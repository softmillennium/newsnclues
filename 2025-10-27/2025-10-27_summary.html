The State Department seemingly contradicted the findings to appease the Israeli government, he said.

The Biden administration dismissed and publicly contradicted an internal finding by a longtime military policeman that Israeli soldiers intentionally shot at and killed prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in 2022, the former official has said in his first public interview.

Col. Steve Gabavics was a top official in the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which conducted the U.S.'s investigation into the killing of the Al Jazeera journalist. Gabavics, a military policeman with three decades of experience, was the chief of staff to the office's head, Lt. Gen. Michael Fenzel, at the time of the probe, The New York Times reports. 

Gabavics was the lead investigator on the case, he says, and had three others working with him. The team conducted an on-the-ground probe into the killing. Gabavics concluded that it would have been “the most absurd thing in the world” for the shooting to have been accidental, and that “we had everything there” to show that it was intentional.

“The individual popped out of the truck, just was randomly shooting, and happened to have really well-aimed shots and never looked down the scope. Which wouldn't have happened,” he told the Times.

This conclusion was based on numerous factors, he said, including Israeli military communications showing that soldiers were aware that journalists were in the region that day; the fact that a sniper in an Israeli military vehicle had a clear line of sight to Abu Akleh that morning; and that the team did a simulation of where Abu Akleh and the soldier were at the time of the shooting, and a blue “Press” vest was clearly visible to where the shooter was positioned.

Despite this, and despite Gabavics's continued insistence that the office's report on the shooting include this conclusion, Fenzel disagreed. He continually deleted language on Israel's culpability, seeking to preserve the office's relationship with the military, sources told the Times. 

Then, the State Department released a statement saying that the government concluded that the Israeli shooting was not intentional. It said the office found “no reason to believe” it was anything other than “the result of tragic circumstances.” This echoed Israel's own findings that Abu Akleh was accidentally hit by Israeli gunfire.

Gabavics said the State Department's statement “flabbergasted” him and his colleagues. 

In the liaison's office, “the favoritism is always toward the Israelis. Very little of that goes to the Palestinians,” he said.

Gabavics had previously spoken out about the probe's conclusions in a documentary, “Who Killed Shireen?”, by Zeteo, but had remained anonymous at the time.

Abu Akleh was a well known journalist who was reporting on an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank when Israeli forces shot and killed her. Her death sent shockwaves throughout the region, and the U.S. never sought accountability for her killing. Facing pressure, the Biden administration opened an FBI probe into her killing in 2022, but it was never released.

Voters appear to have responded to idea that US president's ‘generosity' would evaporate if Milei failed to win

“The dollar always talks in the end,” Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 bestseller The Art of the Deal.

Javier Milei's surprise triumph in Argentina's midterm elections – after Trump bailed him out with 40bn of them – suggests there may be some truth to that assertion.

The US president had vowed to jettison his South American ally if, as widely predicted, the radical libertarian fared badly in Sunday's make-or-break legislative vote. “If he doesn't win, we're gone,” Trump declared when Argentina's shaggy-haired president visited him in Washington earlier this month to plead for economic help.

Milei's political woes have been building in recent months, with growing public frustration over Argentina's sluggish economy translating into market jitters and a pasting in Buenos Aires' provincial election in September. Trump stepped in after that humiliating result, offering a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap deal and a further $20bn in support for an economy he claimed was “dying” – although the US president indicated such “generosity” would evaporate if Milei failed to win big on Sunday.

Milei's opponents accused Trump of flagrantly meddling in Argentina's electoral process with his explicit message to voters. Some predicted an anti-Trump backlash, similar to the one felt in neighbouring Brazil as a result of Washington's ham-fisted attempt to force its authorities to abandon the coup trial of the former president Jair Bolsonaro.

But on Sunday night there was scant sign of voter reprisals over Trump's intervention. If anything, some suspected the gambit might have paid off by swaying voters' minds.

Diego Guelar, an Argentinian politician and former ambassador to China and the US, voiced unease at how Trump had warned voters “they had to vote for his friend [Milei] or he would abandon them”. But Guelar thought the US president's “direct intervention”, while “awful”, had worked, with voters accepting “the need for American assistance” and blaming the economic crisis on the opposition.

Brian Winter, an Argentina expert who edits the Americas Quarterly magazine, said: “It has the appearance of a masterstroke by Donald Trump. He threw a lifeline to somebody who was drowning at just the right moment.”

Milei's libertarian party, La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances), captured nearly 41% of the vote – considerably higher than expected after a miserable spell of corruption scandals and growing economic crisis – compared with his Peronist rivals' 32%. Argentina's bonds, stocks and currency, the peso, surged on Monday as Milei celebrated what he called a vindication of his two-year-old “shock therapy” crusade.

Winter was still trying to gauge the extent to which Trump's $40bn rescue package – and pre-election admonition – had affected the result, which underlined how many voters still blamed the Peronists for years of economic chaos, even if they were increasingly disillusioned with Milei.

“But the way politics works, Trump will get credit for this,” Winter predicted. “It looks like a bold bet – and not just a bold bet. The appearance, at least, is that he [Milei] showed the value of being an ally to Donald Trump. And this is a White House that is making more use of carrots and sticks in Latin America than any White House in probably 50 years.”

Trump's unexpectedly intense focus on Latin America – which also includes the highly controversial naval buildup off Venezuela's coast, accusing Mexico's leaders of narco ties, threatening to forcibly “take back” the Panama canal, and slapping 50% tariffs on Brazil – may not, beyond Milei's movement, be winning him many friends in the region.

But Winter believed it was, for better or worse, influencing people: “He has helped cajole the Mexicans into a more active approach on security and migration. He has convinced the Panamanians to push the Chinese out of the proximity of the canal. He appears to have backtracked on a failing strategy in Brazil – and now both sides are talking about a significant deal on rare earths, critical minerals and potentially other areas.”

Trump's distinctly 19th-century-style doctrine – “rescue packages and loans for his friends and gunboat diplomacy for his enemies” – could easily backfire over time, Winter admitted. “But for now, most of them are producing results.”

Above all for Milei, now Trump's best regional friend, who used X to thank his North American underwriter as the scale of Sunday's victory became clear.

“You are a great friend of the Argentine Republic,” Argentina's president told Trump, before signing off with a rallying cry they now share: “Maga.”

The changes came as senators have called for an investigation into Trump's destruction of the White House's East Wing.

Last week, the Trump administration modified a page of the White House website detailing the history of the building to include alleged Democratic administration scandals — as criticism is mounting against President Donald Trump's destruction of the East Wing to make way for a grandiose, $300 million ballroom.

The web page includes a “Major Events Timeline,” which details the renovations following the War of 1812 and the construction of the Oval Office in 1909, for example. But last week, the administration added a number of entries to the timeline about supposed misdeeds by the Clinton, Obama and Biden administrations — some of which included flagrant misinformation.

After the changes were met with widespread criticism, the site appears to have removed those items.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

One entry detailed the “Bill Clinton Scandal,” explaining the former president's extramarital affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Another entry mentions the discovery of drugs at the White House during the administration of former President Joe Biden.

“During Biden's administration, a U.S. Secret Service agent discovered a small, zippered plastic bag containing cocaine in the West Wing entrance lobby,” the entry read. “Speculation has pointed to Hunter Biden, an admitted drug user.”

Hunter Biden has reportedly been sober since 2019, and there is no evidence to suggest the drugs were his.

The page also made Islamophobic claims regarding former President Barack Obama, alleging he had met members of the Muslim Brotherhood at the White House, a group that some Republicans have pushed to designate a foreign terrorist organization. 

In fact, Obama had met with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, for diplomatic reasons, at the United Nations General Assembly in 2012, not at the White House. Morsi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and several Republican lawmakers, including allies of Trump, met with him and other members of the organization around the same time Obama did. 

That entry also included a photograph of Obama wearing a turban, with the White House falsely labeling the image as a “Muslim Brotherhood Visit.” It was actually an image of Obama visiting Kenya in 2006, and had nothing to do with the Muslim Brotherhood.

The White House has gone through many renovations over the years, but Trump's unilateral approach has sparked concern from the public, with some polls demonstrating that a majority of Americans disagree with his demolition of the East Wing. 

The Trump administration denies that there is anything wrong with the construction project, which has included the complete destruction of the East Wing and historic foliage that was planted in the area, without going through the ordinary process of approval from archivists. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has denounced criticism of the project as “fake outrage.” Meanwhile, the White House has restricted the press from being able to fully document and report on the changes. 

There is also concern that the project, which is being funded by private donors, may create major conflicts of interest, with those donating to the construction of the multimillion dollar ballroom receiving preferential treatment from the administration. Among the donors are digital behemoths like Google and Meta, weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin, tobacco company Altria Group, and media companies like Comcast.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) noted on social media last week that Trump's recently enacted budget bill gave tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to some of these companies. “Now, they're writing checks to Trump for his $300 million ballroom. Gee, I wonder why?” Sanders wrote.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) is calling for more oversight over the construction project, specifically citing those concerns.

“I've launched an investigation into the contracting and approval process for the demolition of the White House — and whether the corporate donors funding Trump's ballroom are seeking favors with the Administration,” Warren wrote on X. “The American public deserves answers.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

US.. President Donald Trump meets with Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office on Oct. 7. The President said the two won't meet again for some time after a falling-out over the Ontario government's anti-tariff ad.JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images

Lawrence Herman is an international lawyer with Herman & Associates.

It looks like the Canadian side was caught flat-footed with U.S. President Donald Trump's blow-ups last week – terminating the trade talks and then suddenly adding new 10-per-cent duties.

Then on Monday Mr. Trump said he did not even want to see Prime Minister Mark Carney. “I'm not going to be meeting with him for a long time,” Mr. Trump said.

So, where should the Carney team go from here?

For starters, it is now pretty clear, if it has not been already, that free trade with the United States is dead. Mr. Trump will not remove Section 232 tariffs on Canadian vehicles, steel and aluminum. He will also show no mercy on energy, potash, lumber products and other sectors currently being investigated under Section 232. The situation looks dire for Canada, even with possible carve-outs for some exports compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

Campbell Clark: Yet another emergency for Trump to use to shake Canada down

Second, even if an agreement can be cobbled together, the White House want this to be a handshake-type deal, like the ones concluded with the Brits and the Europeans, subject to the tariff surcharge threats by the President at any given time.

Canada can never decouple from the U.S. as its largest export market. We know this. The challenge, as the Prime Minister underscored months ago, is to gird ourselves and to lessen exposure to that market. But can Mr. Carney actually follow through?

A key strategic change to reduce overdependence on the U.S. would be a return to the Third Option concept, a policy initiated by the Pierre Trudeau government in the early 1970s. The policy hoped to change that overdependence – while also lessening American political influence – by developing new economic and trade arrangements with other countries.

The policy never got full buy-in from Canadian business and limped along, before finally being put to rest with the signing of the first Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement by the Mulroney government in 1988. The FTA, and later the North American Free Trade Agreement, resulted in tightening commercial and business integration. We now see the enormous risks of that integration with Mr. Trump's bellicosity and as the U.S. turns decisively to protectionism.

One of the reasons the Third Option never developed traction, in addition to the ease of doing business with the U.S., was that Canada lacked market-opening agreements with other regions. Today the trading picture is different, with Canada's preferential trade deals with large economic groups such as the European Union and the Asia-Pacific region. It is opportune to renew Third Option thinking.

At the end of the day, of course, trade agreements are government-to-government frameworks to set stable and predictable rules for cross-border business. Regrettably, Canadian companies have failed to fully utilize the business advantages of these market opening deals.

A case in point is our business with South Korea where, in spite of a free-trade agreement, Canada continually runs large trade deficits, estimated at $13-billion in 2024. Relatively speaking, our trade deal has not resulted in Canada selling heavily into South Korea, but rather the other way around.

Same with the Indo-Pacific region, where Canada ran a trade imbalance of $78-billion in 2023 with its trade agreement partners under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Likewise with the European Union, where Canada had a 2024 trade deficit of some $33-billion in spite of the Canada-EU free trade deal. Why conclude these deals if business doesn't follow through?

Carney tries to reassure Canadians after Trump threatens 10% tariff hike

We have to do better. But expanding into foreign markets can't just fall on the shoulders of the private sector alone. It requires sustained engagement by the federal government. We need to consider how other countries do things.

Take Germany, which has institutional structures for permanent business-government co-ordination on international trade through semi-public institutions such as the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The German model has paid off handsomely. Japan, another trading giant, likewise has a system of tight co-operation through powerful business federations with permanent structures.

Canada, by contrast, only has loose, unstructured arrangements that are entirely ad hoc, reflecting domestic politics and the predilections of the trade or industry ministers at any given time. While Canada's industry associations do a commendable job within this impermanent system, there is a total absence of anything like systematic co-ordination.

This has to change. Even if adopting formalized structures might be a leap too far, Canada still needs a much more sophisticated, strategically focused system. The federal government has to work much more closely with the business community to end Canada's over-dependence on its unreliable – even hostile – neighbour to the south.

Presidents are constitutionally limited to two elected terms but some had suggested unorthodox gambit to stay in office

US politics – live updates

Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.

“I'd be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a trade war truce with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.

But he added: “I wouldn't do that. I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that … It's not – it wouldn't be right.

No one may be elected to the US presidency a third time, according to the 22nd amendment of the US constitution.

Some have suggested that one way around this prohibition would be for Trump to stand as vice-president, while another candidate stood for president but then resigned, letting Trump as the No 2 step up and again assume the presidency.

Opponents have disputed whether this would be legal.

Referring to the possibility of a third term, however, Trump said: “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever.”

When pressed by a reporter whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said: “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you'll have to tell me.”

He added: “All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they [the Democrats] don't.”

Referring to JD Vance and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, Trump also said they were great people who could run for the office.

“I think if they ever formed a group, it'd be unstoppable,” he said. “I really do. I believe that.”

The remarks were Trump's latest on the subject, which he has teased in public remarks and with “Trump 2028” hats he hands out at the White House.

In the interview at the weekend, the former US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump last November, said she was not done with politics and strongly suggested that she was considering another run for president and did not rule out running in 2028.

Meanwhile, Trump is making his longest journey abroad since taking office in January and is scheduled to attend the Apec and Asean trade summits. He announced a flurry of deals on trade and critical minerals with four south-east Asian countries during the first stop in Malaysia and is set to meet Xi in South Korea on Thursday.

“I've got a lot of respect for President Xi and I think we're going to come away with a deal,” Trump said before landing in Tokyo.

He also said he would like to meet up again with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.

Oil firm asks court to block enforcement of laws that would require disclosure of planet-heating carbon emissions

Exxon, an oil firm consistently ranked among the world's top contributors to global carbon emissions, is suing the state of California over two climate-focused state laws, arguing that the rules infringe upon the corporation's right to free speech.

The 2023 laws, known collectively as the California Climate Accountability Package, will require large companies doing business in the state to disclose both their planet-heating carbon emissions and their climate-related financial risks, or face annual penalties.

The laws would thereby force Exxon to “serve as a mouthpiece for ideas with which it disagrees”, says the lawsuit, filed in the US district court for the eastern district of California on Friday.

Asked for comment, Exxon referred the Guardian to the lawsuit. The state of California was not immediately available for comment.

Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Gavin Newsom, California's governor, told the New York Times it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency”, adding that the laws “have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them.”

Exxon is asking the court to block the enforcement of the laws, which is set to begin in 2026. The company already reports emissions and climate risks voluntarily, using different methodologies, it said in the lawsuit.

But the laws would force the company to adopt the state's preferred frameworks for emissions and risk reporting, which it finds “misleading and counterproductive”, the lawsuit says.

To calculate its emissions, Exxon uses a method established by the global non-profit oil and gas industry association Ipieca, which was created in 1974 to allow a UN environmental group to interface with polluting industries. But under one of the two California laws, it would have to use a methodology known as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the research group World Resources Institute and business network World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

That framework sends “the counterproductive message that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services”, the lawsuit says.

The California law also requires companies to report their global emissions footprint. But Exxon argues that the rule should apply only to emissions created by company activity within California's borders, since the a vast majority of Exxon's business operations occur outside the state.

The second 2023 California law that Exxon is challenging requires companies to disclose the threat that climate change poses to their business operations, and how they plan to address them. That would require it to speculate “about unknowable future developments”, Exxon argued.

It also claimed that the law conflicts with existing federal securities laws, which already regulate what publicly traded companies must disclose regarding financial and environmental risks.

Taken together, the two laws constitute overreach by California officials, the lawsuit argues. The laws aimed to “to shape public opinion and shame private parties disfavored by the State,” Exxon said.

Supporters of the California rules say they discourage greenwashing from companies.

“The disclosure requirements would really pull back the curtain on the biggest climate destroyers in the oil industry,” Hollin Kretzmann, a senior attorney at the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, told the Guardian after they were passed.

Last year, business interests including the US Chamber of Commerce, California Chamber of Commerce, and American Farm Bureau Federation sued California over the same two laws. A judge denied a motion from the business groups to block the laws, but the case is still proceeding with a trial date expected in October 2026.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission had also been working to implement new federal climate disclosure rules, and was nearing completion toward the end of Joe Biden's term in the White House. Those rules also faced legal challenges; in March, the agency voted to end its legal defense of the rules.

“We don't want to be fighting for what we already agreed to,” said a Maryland public library worker.

On any given day in Howard County, Maryland, teenagers play Dungeons & Dragons, adults practice English conversation skills, and toddlers and their caregivers play together, all in clean and well-lit public libraries that are kept warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Anyone can walk in and use the space and its collections, and they do in great numbers.

In its latest annual report, the Howard County Library System documents more than 1.5 million visits across its seven locations, special collections unit, and a pop-up library. A quarter of a million students took classes at the library, and more than 7.5 million items were checked out and returned in 2024.

“All of us work here because we believe in the library and our community impact,” says Megan Royden, an Instructor and Research Specialist at the Howard County Library System and president of AFSCME Amalgamated Local 6359.

Royden and their coworkers are waiting on collectively bargained wage increases that included a 3 percent raise and 4 percent cost of living adjustment. When county leadership approved a smaller budget increase than requested, library administration reneged on the negotiated increases, asking for a contract re-opener in light of the smaller budget allocation. “They told us the country rejected our raises,” Royden told Truthout. “It was the library's choice to make up the shortfall via our wages.”

The two parties are headed to arbitration on October 28. When management approved COLA raises for library staff on July 1, members of the bargaining unit were excluded and told that they would have to wait for the outcome of arbitration. Everyone else, including upper administration, got their COLA payments on time. “We have a lot of staff that count on that money,” Royden said. “Members couldn't get their cars fixed, couldn't pay bills.”

“We don't want to be fighting for what we already agreed to,” Royden said.

In Anne Arundel County, library leadership announced a severe cut to the collections budget at the same time they signed a contract with Venable, a notorious management-side law firm.

Public library workers in Maryland are getting used to this kind of management hardball, including the use of public money to suppress the wages of public sector workers. Members of Pratt Workers United struggled for two years to bargain a first contract at the Baltimore institution. It took nearly two years to bargain a first contract at Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library. And in Anne Arundel County, library leadership announced a severe cut to the collections budget at the same time they signed a contract with Venable, a notorious management-side law firm whose lobbying clients have included Lockheed Martin, Citadel, and American Airlines. Venable's website boasts of their union-crushing record, including bargaining contracts with an orientation toward deadlock (bargaining “to impasse”) and working to overturn NLRB rulings favorable to labor.

“Nobody signs a contract with Venable because they want a smooth process,” Nicole Dvorak told Truthout. Dvorak helped organize the union at the Baltimore County Public Library and remains active in public sector union movements in the state. “It's like they're keeping a dirty secret behind the scenes.”

Employers are responding to a library labor movement that has been growing nationwide in response to a range of workplace issues including threats of organized censorship and the mismanagement of COVID closures from the perspective of many frontline workers.

After years of organizing across Maryland, Gov. Wes Moore signed the Library Workers Empowerment Act in 2024, setting out a standard process for library workers seeking to organize. Prior to its passage, library workers in the state did not have established collective bargaining rights, excluded from existing guidelines that covered public employees. (Library workers are employed by library systems, not directly by city or county governments.) LWEA secures the right to unionize, imposing restrictions on intimidation and retaliation, asserting rights to representation, and mandating timelines intended to prevent the kinds of lengthy processes that have marred negotiations at Howard County and elsewhere. 

“After that bill pushed through, things were supposed to be easier,” Anita Bass, president of the Baltimore County Public Library union, told Truthout. “Library administrators still say no, and they're still hiring union busting lawyers. You'd think the law would stop them, but it doesn't.”

“I don't believe the Board of Trustees or our community are fully aware of how hostile the response to unionizing has been.”

In Charles County, library administration contracted with the notorious union busting firm Jackson Lewis. “They work with Tesla, they work with Starbucks, so I don't know what they're doing working with public libraries,” said Christopher Lindstrom, a public service associate and organizer with the library union. “We're like the guinea pigs — what happens if you throw a lot of money at a union fight after this bill has passed?”

For Royden and her colleagues in Howard County, the management crackdown hasn't dampened enthusiasm for the union. “I'm sure it's frustrating not to have total power and to have to consult with the union,” Royden told Truthout. “I wish we could get along rather than dragging it out. But everyone knows we need a union now.”

Part of the challenge is making the public understand that too. “I don't believe the Board of Trustees or our community are fully aware of how hostile the response to unionizing has been,” Lindstrom said, citing the $250,000 that Charles County Library administrators have set aside for collective bargaining. “I don't think they know that every dollar will be spent to delay negotiations as long as possible. I don't think that's what they want for the library and their library workers.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

GOP-led state is latest that Trump administration has put pressure on to undertake redistricting to favor Republicans

The Indiana governor, Mike Braun, announced on Monday that he is calling a special session to consider redrawing congressional districts in the state, the latest state to work on its maps ahead of 2026.

Indiana is one of several Republican-led states the Trump administration has pressured to undertake mid-decade redistricting to favor Republicans, which began with a push in Texas to redraw lines to add Republican seats.

California is considering a ballot measure to redraw its lines to favor Democrats, a move initiated in response to Texas. Virginia's Democratic house speaker, Don Scott, also said last week the state would hold a special session to redistrict to benefit Democrats, potentially adding two or three Democratic seats. Several other states, including Indiana and North Carolina, have now launched redistricting efforts to benefit Republicans.

“I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” Braun said in a statement on Monday morning.

Indiana currently sends seven Republicans and two Democrats to Congress.

Republican state lawmakers in some states, including Indiana and Kansas, have pushed back on the idea of redistricting. But Braun has said, if the state doesn't redraw its maps, “probably, we'll have consequences of not working with the Trump administration as tightly as we should.”

John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, highlighted the opposition in a statement on Monday. 
 “Between the overwhelming opposition from Hoosiers and the relentless pressure from Washington – including but not limited to Vice-President [JD] Vance taking two taxpayer-funded trips to the state, threats to cut federal funding, and phone calls from President Trump – Governor Braun clearly called this special session solely because he got orders from Washington,” he said. “Hoosiers do not want a mid-decade gerrymander.”

Also on Monday, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, is reportedly headed to Illinois to meet with local leaders about redrawing the congressional maps. Jeffries will meet with the Illinois legislative Black caucus and Black members of Congress, a nod to the fact that Black lawmakers will be needed to pass a new map, according to Punchbowl News.

Last week, the Illinois senate Black caucus warned that it wouldn't support a new map if it dilutes the Black voting population, Punchbowl noted. There are three historically Black districts among Illinois's 17 congressional seats. Only three of the state's seats are held by Republicans.

MOSCOW, October 27. /TASS/. There has been no progress on the next round of talks between Moscow and Kiev, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told reporters.

"I can refer to what [Kremlin Spokesman] Dmitry Peskov said on the subject: Ukraine is not responding to our initiatives, avoiding dialogue. Nothing has changed," the senior diplomat pointed out in response to a TASS question.

On July 23, the Turkish city of Istanbul hosted the third round of Russia-Ukraine talks on resolving the conflict. Prior to an expanded meeting, the heads of the two countries' delegations, Vladimir Medinsky and Rustem Umerov, held a bilateral meeting. The expanded talks lasted about 40 minutes, with the parties discussing the positions they had set out in draft memorandums.

At the meeting, the parties agreed to exchange civilians along with service members. Russia invited Ukraine to set up three online working groups to address political, military and humanitarian issues. In addition, Moscow offered to transfer the bodies of another 3,000 Ukrainian troops to Kiev and resume short humanitarian pauses on the frontline in order to collect the wounded and the dead.

A decision on the fourth round of talks will be made after the new agreements are implemented, Medinsky said.

Former US president on Sunday addressed Trump's agenda while being honored at Kennedy Institute in Boston

US politics live – latest updates

Joe Biden has decried “dark days” for the US under Donald Trump's hardline presidency as he urged Americans to stay optimistic and not to “check out” from the way White House politics under his successor is affecting the nation.

The former US president was speaking publicly for the first time since completing a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, in a speech on Sunday night that addressed Trump's agenda.

Biden spoke of attacks on free speech and Trump's tests on the limits of executive power.

“Since its founding, America served as a beacon for the most powerful idea ever in government in the history of the world,” Biden said. “The idea is stronger than any army. We're more powerful than any dictator.”

The former Democratic president, 82, addressed an audience in Boston after receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Edward M Kennedy Institute.

He said the US depended on a presidency with limited power, a functioning US Congress and an autonomous judiciary, as the three co-equal branches of government. With the federal government facing one of the longest shutdowns on record, Trump has used the funding lapse as a way to exercise new command over the government.

“Friends, I can't sugarcoat any of this. These are dark days,” Biden said before predicting the country would “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have – stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith.”

Biden listed examples of people who were standing their ground against threats from the current administration, citing the example of federal employees who resign in protest, and universities and comedians that have been targeted by Trump.

“The late-night hosts continue to shine a light on free speech knowing their careers are on the line,” he said.

Biden also gave shout-outs for any elected Republican officials who vote or openly go against the Trump administration.

“America is not a fairytale,” he said. “For 250 years, it's been a constant push and pull, an existential struggle between peril and possibility.”

He finished the speech by telling people to “get back up”.

The Democrat left office in January after serving one term in the White House. Biden dropped his bid for re-election after facing pressure after a disastrous debate against Trump and concerns about his age, health and mental fitness. Former US vice-president Kamala Harris launched her bid right after, but lost to Trump last November.

In May, Biden's post presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it had spread to his bones.

            Ten people went on trial in Paris Monday accused of the online harassment of French first lady Brigitte Macron, after they spread what prosecutors called “malicious comments” about the gender and sexuality of President Emmanuel Macron's wife.
    


            The trial comes three months after Macron and his wife filed a 22-count defamation lawsuit in the US state of Delaware against right-wing podcaster Candace Owens over the claim that Brigitte Macron could be a man.
    


            The French case relates to a legal complaint filed by the first lady's lawyer in August 2024 alleging cyberbullying, which led to two waves of arrests in February and March of 2025.
    


            Initial investigations identified several claims about Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality, as well as describing the age difference between her and the president as “pedophilia,” the prosecutor said. The trial is expected to last two days, and a verdict is likely to be issued later.
    


            Among the eight men and two women aged 41 to 60 on trial are an elected official, a gallery owner, an IT specialist, a teacher, a property manager and a business owner. CNN affiliate BFMTV provided details on one of the defendants: 41-year-old advertising executive Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, who uses the pseudonym “Zoé Sagan” on social media. His X account, which has since been suspended, has been the subject of several complaints and is often linked to conspiracy theorists.
    


            The Delaware lawsuit alleges Owens broadcast “a relentless year-long campaign of defamation against the Macrons.”
    


            In March, the conservative commentator revived a conspiracy theory in a YouTube video entitled “Is France's First Lady a Man?” according to the complaint. Promoted widely on X, Owens said the conspiracy theory was “likely the biggest scandal in political history.”
    


            Since then, Owens has produced numerous videos about Brigitte Macron for her nearly 4.5 million YouTube subscribers, including a multi-part series called “Becoming Brigitte.”

Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,342 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far: 

An operation by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) has killed the son of a Russian general in Zaporizhia Oblast, the agency said on Oct. 27.

Lieutenant Vasily Marzoev was killed by a glide bomb after drone operators in his unit were spotted in the village of Plavni, HUR said in a post on Telegram, adding he was also at the position at the time of the strike.

"The liquidated Vasily is the son of Lieutenant General Arkady Marzoev, commander of the 18th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, who is involved in the commission of war crimes against Ukrainian civilians in Kherson," HUR said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Russia has killed 661 Ukrainian children and injured 2,203 others during the full-scale invasion, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Ruslan Kravchenko said on Oct. 27.

Moscow's forces have also destroyed or damaged more than 4500 schools, kindergartens and 1294 hospitals, he added, as well as kidnapping and deporting more than 19,000, and committing sexual violence in at least 23 different cases. 

"UN Security Council Resolution No. 1261 defines the six most serious crimes against children during war. And all six,  Russia does them every day, here, in front of the world," Kravchenko said in a post on social media.

The numbers do not include the full totals committed in Ukrainian territories still occupied by Russia and the real numbers are almost certainly far higher.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law formally withdrawing from the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement with the U.S., according to a decree published on Oct. 27.

The 2000 agreement obligated both countries to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium — enough for thousands of nuclear warheads — no longer required for defense purposes.

Following the end of the Cold War, both Russia and the U.S. dismantled thousands of warheads, leaving costly stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium and raising proliferation risks.

Under the deal, the plutonium was to be processed into fuel for civilian nuclear power plants. Russia ratified the agreement in 2011, with implementation initially planned to begin in 2018.

Moscow suspended its participation in 2016, accusing Washington of violating its obligations.

Saab, the manufacturer of the Gripen fighter jet, has said it's ready to open a factory in Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 27.

"It is not so easy during a war, but it would be great to set up a capacity for at least final assembly and tests and maybe part production in Ukraine," Saab Chief Executive Micael Johansson said.

Sweden and Ukraine on Oct. 22 signed a letter of intent for a future contract on the purchase of up to 150 modern Gripen E fighter jets to bolster the Ukrainian Air Force.

The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is a light 4.5-generation fighter jet that can be used for both defensive and offensive tasks. Kyiv and Stockholm have repeatedly discussed the possibility of supplying the aircraft to Ukraine's Air Force, which already operates Western planes, including the Mirage 2000 and F-16.

A state order for domestic Flamingo cruise missiles will be fully fulfilled by the end of 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 26 in an interview with TSN.Zelensky said Ukraine faced technological challenges in missile production and delays in partner financing, adding that these issues are now being resolved.

Ukraine has secured its own funding to pay for production and will soon receive "a certain number of them," according to the president. 

Zelensky also highlighted the effectiveness of the missiles that have already been tested.

A Ukrainian strike on a dam near Belgorod, Russia, has caused water to begin flowing uncontrollably, reportedly cutting off Russian units that had crossed the Siverskyi Donets River near the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine's 16th Army Corps said on Oct. 26.

The strike damaged the dam at the Belgorod Reservoir, located north of the Ukrainian border. The flooding has disrupted Russian logistics and stranded several Russian units on the Ukrainian side of the river without secure supply lines or reinforcements, according to the report.

"The main thing is that the enemy's logistics have become significantly more complicated. The leaves have fallen too. So the units that managed to cross the Siverskyi Donets have effectively been cut off from their main forces," it said.

"So we're expecting the (POW) exchange pool to be replenished," it added, referring to the potential for capturing Russian troops.

A large-scale overnight drone attack on Oct. 27 targeted multiple regions of western Russia, including the Moscow metropolitan area, according to Russian officials.

In Moscow oblast, residents reported explosions in several districts, including the capital itself.

Photos published by eyewitnesses and geolocated by the Russian Telegram channel Astra show smoke rising in the Kommunarka area, part of Moscow's Novomoskovsky Administrative Okrug. The images suggest the smoke originated from a forested area near a local road.

The Russian Defense Ministry later said that a total of 193 drones were intercepted overnight, including 40 over Moscow Oblast. The ministry said that 34 of those drones were bound for the capital.

In Kursk Oblast, a fire broke out near a power substation in the city of Rylsk after what local authorities claimed was a Ukrainian drone strike.

Dozens of drones targeted the city of Moscow, according to Mayor Sergey Sobyanin.

At least six people have been killed and 66 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 27.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 66 out of the 100 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Twenty-six drone strikes were recorded at nine locations.

            Africa's electric vehicle (EV) market is accelerating rapidly — projected to reach $4.2 billion by 2030, more than double its current value, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence. Yet most EVs still depend on grid electricity, which often comes from a mix of renewable and fossil fuel sources.
    


            Bako Motors, a Tunisian startup, is looking to jump on the EV trend, while tapping into one of Africa's greatest natural resources — sunshine. Its compact cars and cargo vans have solar panels on their roofs. While the vehicles still have lithium batteries and can be plugged in and charged at home or on the road, the solar panels give them access to a free energy source, charging the batteries directly. So far, the company has made just 100 vehicles but it plans to scale up and increase exports over the coming year.
    


            “The solar cells provide us with more than 50% of our needs,” says Boubaker Siala, founder and CEO of Bako Motors. “For example, the B-Van, for commercial use, you can have free energy for about 50 kilometers (31 miles) per day… 17,000 kilometers (10,563 miles) per year. It's huge.”
    


            The company, founded in 2021, began making three-wheeled cargo vehicles, but has since moved to four-wheeled models. The B-Van, which can carry 400 kilograms (882 pounds) of cargo and has a 100 to 300-kilometer (62 to 186 mile) range, is designed for logistics and last-mile delivery, with prices starting at 24,990 Tunisian dinar ($8,500).
    


            The other is the Bee, a tiny 2-seat car with a 70 to 120-kilometer (44 to 75 mile) range and a max speed of 45 kilometers per hour (27 mph). It's tailored toward daily, in-city trips and starts at 18,264 Tunisian dinar ($6,200).
    


            Khaled Habaieb, COO of Bako Motors, tells CNN it is also designing a third model, the X-Van, which will fit two passengers and have a larger cargo area.
    


Can Africa's EV revolution support rural women?



            He says that more than 40% of the parts of each vehicle are sourced locally, including the lithium-iron-phosphate batteries and steel. This helps to provide much-needed local jobs, Habaieb adds.
    


            Globally, startups like US-based Aptera Motors are developing cars with solar panels. Their coverage is more extensive and offers bigger ranges, but they are also a lot more expensive, costing from around $30,000. Bako Motors is looking to fill a gap in the African market, while maintaining affordability.
    


            More established players in Africa's conventional e-mobility market include BasiGo, with its fleet of hundreds of e-buses operating in Kenya and Rwanda, and Spiro, one of the leading providers of electric motorbikes, supplying seven African countries, but Bako Motors is distinctive in its use of solar.
    


            “It's a really good concept because it helps to extend the range of your EV,” says Bob Wesonga, operations and research associate for Africa E-Mobility Alliance, a think tank. “Among the biggest inhibitors of EV adoption has been range anxiety. If you can tell a person that while the battery itself will give you 250 kilometers (155 miles) of full charge, solar can extend that by another 50 (31 miles), it gives them the confidence to choose EV.”
    


Solar and batteries could help Egypt beat its blackouts



            He adds that the trends in e-mobility in Africa are localized. “Different African countries have different modes of transport,” he says, citing how in South Africa, four-wheel passenger vehicles lead, whereas in Kenya, motorbikes are king. This means that there is room in the market for many players, especially if local manufacturing allows companies to tackle local infrastructure problems such as road quality with their designs. By building locally, “the vehicles are suiting the mobility needs of the continent,” he says, as well as boosting the economy and creating jobs.
    


            Currently Bako Motors is small, but it recently started building a second, larger factory in Tunisia, expected to open toward the end of 2026, and aims to manufacture up to 8,000 vehicles per year for Africa, the Middle East and Europe.
    


            “The addressable market in Africa is about 1 million vehicles per year,” says Siala. “We are targeting maybe 5 to 10% of this market.”
    


            He adds that the next five to 10 years will be the peak of the electric mobility transition: “We have to prepare ourselves for this transition (and) offer affordable and good products for the African citizen.”

			Critics say Timothy Mellon's donation is illegal and would only cover salaries of 1.3 service members for less than a day

A reclusive billionaire has been revealed as the mystery donor who gave $130m (£97m) to the US government to help pay troops during the federal shutdown.

Timothy Mellon, a banking heir who spent tens of millions on Donald Trump's election campaign last year, was responsible for the sizeable donation, which is designed to help keep the army afloat.

Mr Trump has turned to unorthodox means to keep paying troops, immigration and others amid the government shutdown, which is now on its third week amid gridlock in Congress between Republicans and Democrats.

Although he has pledged to maintain the salaries of troops, on Sunday a senior member of government warned funds would run out within weeks. 

On Friday, the Pentagon said it had accepted $130m under its “general gift acceptance authority” to “offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits”. On Sunday, the New York Times reported that the person behind the funds was Mr Mellon.

Mr Trump has publicly refused to reveal the donor's identity, instead praising him as a patriot and “great American citizen”.

Speaking shortly before leaving the White House for a tour of Asia, Mr Trump lauded the anonymous donor as a “great gentleman”.

“He's obviously a very substantial man, and he contributed $130m for the military… he wanted to see the military get paid,” the president continued.

Mr Trump, who is widely expected to name a ballroom being erected on the site of the White House's East Wing after himself, said the decision to remain anonymous was “pretty unusual in the world I come from”.

“In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned. He doesn't,” he said.

However, critics believe Mr Mellon's reported donation was illegal, violating a 19th-century law, and note the sum would have covered the salaries of America's 1.3 million active service members for less than a day. 

Mr Mellon, the grandson of former treasury secretary Andrew Mellon and heir to the Mellon banking fortune, has deliberately shunned the spotlight despite emerging as one of the biggest political donors in the US.

The 83-year-old last year gave $50m to a campaign group supporting Mr Trump's White House bid, one of the largest single donations ever recorded. “I don't have to say why,” he told The New York Times.

Experts say the $130m donation, the equivalent of about $100 per service member, may be a violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from accepting voluntary services “except in the case of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property”.

Federal employees who break the law can face suspension or removal from office, in addition to fines or imprisonment.

Romina Boccia, the budget director at the Cato Institute think tank, told Fox News that Congress would have to approve the funds in order to pass them on to federal employees like the military.

Republicans and Democrats have been at loggerheads since failing to pass a funding bill in September, prompting the government to shutdown, shut non-essential agencies and furlough most of federal employees.

On Sunday, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, admitted that funding for soldiers' pay would run out in under four weeks if the shutdown continues.

“I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November, but by Nov 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,” he told CBS News.

So far, Mr Trump has been relying on some $8bn in the Pentagon's unspent research and development funds to maintain salaries.

On Friday, Senate Democrats blocked a bill which would have guaranteed pay for those who are still on duty, including soldiers, air traffic controllers, immigration agents and park rangers.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, declared the legislation was a “ruse” that would give the Trump administration carte blanche to decide which agencies to keep open while prolonging the shutdown indefinitely.

“We will not give Donald Trump a license to play politics with people's livelihoods. That's why we oppose this,” he said.

A Ukrainian strike on a dam near Belgorod, Russia, has caused water to begin flowing uncontrollably, reportedly cutting off Russian units that had crossed the Siverskyi Donets River near the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine's 16th Army Corps said on Oct. 26.

The strike damaged the dam at the Belgorod Reservoir, located north of the Ukrainian border. The flooding has disrupted Russian logistics and stranded several Russian units on the Ukrainian side of the river without secure supply lines or reinforcements, according to the report.

"The main thing is that the enemy's logistics have become significantly more complicated. The leaves have fallen too. So the units that managed to cross the Siverskyi Donets have effectively been cut off from their main forces," it said.

"So we're expecting the [POW] exchange pool to be replenished," it added, referring to the potential for capturing Russian troops.

Vovchansk endured a Russian occupation until September 2022, when Ukrainian troops liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes.

The town remains partially occupied by Russian forces. 

Ukraine's Commander of Unmanned Systems Forces, Colonel Robert Brovdi, call sign "Madyar"), confirmed on Oct. 26 that the strike on the dam was carried out by Ukrainian forces.

Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov acknowledged that the risk of further flooding and damage remains due to potential repeat strikes.

"There is a risk that the enemy might attempt another strike to destroy the dam completely. If that happens, there will be a threat of flooding along the floodplain on the Kharkiv side, as well as in several streets of our local settlements, home to around 1,000 people," he said on Oct. 25.

"The Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS News.

"Contraband" balloons launched from Belarus have disrupted air traffic four times in the last week. Lithuania has closed border crossings with Belarus for "an indefinite period" in response. 

Russian forces shot down 34 Ukrainian drones flying toward Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed.  

Ukraine's "Black Forest" brigade detected and struck a Russian Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system at an unspecified location. 

"We bring people together to learn... to educate themselves and to use their voices to speak to their elected officials to support Ukraine," Marianna Tretiak, Chair of the American Coalition for Ukraine (ACU) Board, told the Kyiv Independent.



While Ukraine also lacks Western-supplied weapons, soldiers and commanders say shortages of basics — cars, drones and people — make holding back Russia extremely difficult. Even as Kyiv seeks U.S. approval for Tomahawks, they say critical, rudimentary gear is the more pressing need.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are climbing toward more records on Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events for Wall Street.

The S&P 500 rose 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 258 points, or 0.5%, as of 11:45 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.6% higher. All are adding to their latest all-time highs set on Friday.

Stocks also rallied in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the heads of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world's two largest economies and allow the global economy to keep motoring.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's “a framework” for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, “We feel good” about working things out with China.

That's just one of many things that will need to go right this week in order for the U.S. stock market's tremendous, record-breaking rally to continue. The S&P 500 has shot up a stunning 37.6% since hitting a low in April, when worries about Trump's tariffs on China and other countries were at their peak. Besides hopes for easing trade tensions, the rally has also been built on expectations for several more things to happen.

One is that the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates in order to give the slowing job market a boost. The Fed's next announcement on interest rates is due on Wednesday, and the nearly unanimous expectation among traders is that it will cut the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point at a second straight meeting.

It's not a certainty though, because the Fed has also warned it may have to change course if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level. That's because low interest rates can make inflation worse.

The latest monthly report on inflation came in slightly better than economists expected, raising hopes, but it may be the final update for a while if the U.S. government's shutdown continues. That could cloud the forecast for cuts to rates to continue.

Besides low interest rates, another expectation that's propped up stock prices is the forecast that U.S. companies will continue to deliver solid growth in profits.

Keurig Dr Pepper climbed 7.1% Monday after reporting profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts' expectations. The company behind the Canada Dry and Green Mountain coffee brands said it benefited from higher prices for K-Cup products, among other things

Some of Wall Street's most influential stocks are set to report their own results this week, including Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. They'll need to deliver big growth and justify big spending underway in artificial-intelligence technology.

Worries have been climbing that AI may be in the midst of a bubble, similar to the dot-com bonanza that ended up bursting in 2000. Nvidia's stock is up 42.2% for the year so far, for example, and Qualcomm soared 12.4% Monday after unveiling AI products for data centers.

Announcements of mergers and buyouts also helped move stocks on Monday. Cadence Bank rose 3.6% after Huntington Banchsares said it would buy the bank with locations across Texas and the South for $7.4 billion in stock. Huntington fell 3.5%.

Avidity Biosciences leaped 42.5% after Novartis agreed to buy the biopharmaceutical company based in San Diego for $12 billion, after Avidity spins off its early-stage precision cardiology programs.

In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly in Europe following bigger gains in Asia.

Stocks climbed1.2% in Shanghai and 1% in Hong Kong. They rose even more in Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 jumped 2.5%, and in Seoul, where South Korea's Kospi rallied 2.6%.

The Nikkei 225 topped the 50,000 level for the first time as opinion polls show Japan's newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enjoying high levels of public support for her market-friendly policies. Takaichi favors raising spending on defense, and that has boosted prices of stocks in major defense contractors, such as Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which jumped 9% Monday.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.01% from 4.02% late Friday.

All the optimism flowing through financial marketshelped knock down the price of gold. The metal's price has stalled after it nearly touched $4,400 per ounce last week, when it set its latest record. It's dropped back toward $4,000, but it's still up more than 50% for the year so far.

Arches of water released during a fire drill on Sunday morning create a spectacular view in the World Heritage site of Shirakawa-go, Gifu Prefecture. The village is home to 114 thatched roof houses, and has 60 water cannons. While a siren sounded at 8 a.m., water was discharged from all the cannons. Columns of waters seen here and there shrouded the village with a fantastic atmosphere, in addition to the foggy forests surrounding the place.

Ukrainian forces successfully detected and destroyed a state-of-the-art Russian Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system valued at $45 million, Ukraine's Land Forces reported on Oct. 26.

The Buk-M3 is one of Russia's key air defense assets, used to engage targets in the air, on the ground, and on the water. 

Ukraine's "Black Forest" brigade struck the target at an unspecified location, the military said. The brigade shared video footage of the operation. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. 

The Buk is a self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile system, first developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s. In the decades since, the Soviet Union and then Russia developed several upgraded versions.

The Buk-M3 is manufactured by Russia's Almaz-Antey defense company, and canreportedly track and engage up to 36 targets simultaneously. The system is designed to target planes, helicopters, cruise missiles, and drones.

The Buk gained worldwide infamy in 2014 with the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.

Ukraine has reported destroying Russian Buk systems in previous strikes. In September, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) reported a successful hit on a Buk-M3 in the Russian-occupied part Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In May, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces said they destroyed a Buk-M3 in an undisclosed front-line sector.

Orban is expected to meet Trump in Washington in the second half of the next week to discuss the sanctions, Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's foreign minister, told journalists on Oct. 27.

"It's a unique product that no one else in the world possesses," Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed.

Russian missile attacks on Kyiv over the weekend destroyed the warehouse of one of Ukraine's largest pharmaceutical distributors and a production facility of a popular coffee chain, reportedly causing at least $100 million in damage and losses.



The 2000 agreement obligated both countries to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium no longer required for defense purposes. 

By infiltrating Ukrainian positions in small infantry groups, Russia has accumulated around 200 troops within Pokrovsk, the General Staff reported. These personnel are engaging in "intense" small arms and drone clashes with Ukrainian troops in the city. 

The man identified as Serhii K. was arrested in August near the Italian town of Rimini under an European arrest warrant, Reuters reported. The lawyer said the defense would appeal the ruling.

A Ukrainian strike on a dam near Belgorod, Russia, has caused water to begin flowing uncontrollably, reportedly cutting off Russian units that had crossed the Siverskyi Donets River near the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine's 16th Army Corps said on Oct. 26.

"The Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS News.

"Contraband" balloons launched from Belarus have disrupted air traffic four times in the last week. Lithuania has closed border crossings with Belarus for "an indefinite period" in response. 

Russian forces shot down 34 Ukrainian drones flying toward Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed.  

Ukraine's "Black Forest" brigade detected and struck a Russian Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system at an unspecified location.

 Washington Is Driving the BRICS to Become an Anti-American Bloc

 Richard Fontaine and Gibbs McKinley

In the battle to shape the global order, the BRICS—a ten-country group, which is named for its first five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)—has become increasingly important. The bloc represents roughly a third of global GDP and nearly half the world's population. It exists to give countries that belong to the so-called global South more sway on the world stage.

That might make the BRICS seem like an inherently anti-Western group. It was, after all, founded in part by Beijing and Moscow. But for most of its 16-year history, the BRICS has not positioned itself in opposition to the United States and its allies. Several BRICS members have even been close U.S. partners. Washington has built a strong trade relationship with Brazil, for instance, and cooperates with India and Indonesia on matters of defense.

But much of that picture now appears to be changing. Over the past decade, China and Russia have ramped up their efforts to steer their fellow BRICS members toward a worldview contrary to Washington's interests. China has become Brazil's top trade partner and supports the country's efforts to reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar. Russia has been selling massive amounts of oil to India. And both China and Russia have courted South Africa as a partner in resisting what Russian President Vladimir Putin has described as the “colonialism” of the U.S.-led order. Meanwhile, the United States has strained its relations with friendly BRICS members. The U.S.-Indian relationship has not been this chilly since 1998, when the United States sanctioned it for testing nuclear weapons. In September, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said that the U.S.-Brazilian relationship was at its “darkest point in two centuries.” And ties with South Africa are the most tenuous they've been since the end of apartheid in 1994.

The causes of the deterioration are different in each case, and some of Washington's grievances against Brazil, India, and South Africa—global swing states that will help dictate which country leads the world—are legitimate. But in each instance, the Trump administration has made relations significantly worse than they should be, and for reasons hard to square with U.S. national interests. As a result, there is a new risk on the horizon: the emergence of the BRICS as a more active, anti-Western bloc that is increasingly dominated by China and Russia. Unless the United States changes policy in the short term, it will pay for this realignment in the long term.

Democrats and Republicans had, until this year, agreed that a better U.S.-Indian relationship was worth building. The benefits were obvious to policymakers regardless of their party affiliation. India, they realized, could help balance Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific. With the fastest-growing major economy, India also offered substantial economic dividends to American investors. It was the world's largest democracy and poised to be the world's most populous country—as it now is.

U.S.-Indian ties, frosty during the Cold War, began to thaw by the end of the Clinton administration and continued warming under every American president and Indian prime minister since. Bipartisan efforts to improve relations resulted in a series of major, concrete achievements. In 2008, the two countries finalized a watershed deal that ended India's long-standing nuclear isolation by allowing civil nuclear trade with India even though New Delhi never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In the years since, the two countries have done roughly $20 billion in arms sales. In 2016, the U.S. Congress made India a “major defense partner,” a designation that allows it to buy advanced U.S. military technologies. During his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump became close with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2017, Washington revived the Quad, a coalition focused on Indo-Pacific security made up of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. The Biden administration built on this cooperation by launching a technology partnership that expanded defense industrial ties between the United States and India. After Trump began his second term, Modi was one of the first world leaders to visit the White House.

And then, at the drop of a hat, Trump upended the relationship. He antagonized New Delhi by repeatedly insisting that he had ended the May 2025 clash between India and Pakistan in Kashmir—a claim New Delhi rejects—and by hosting the Pakistani army chief of staff at the White House in June. According to The New York Times, Trump no longer plans to attend a summit for the Quad, which is scheduled to be held in New Delhi in November. Now, the entire conference may be canceled. He also slapped 50 percent tariffs on India, including a 25 percent hike as punishment for buying Russian oil, and threatened to tack on an extra ten percent tariff to any countries that align with the “anti-American policies” of the BRICS. India condemned the tariffs as “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable” and has since deepened engagement with Russia and China. In August, New Delhi and Moscow agreed to expand bilateral trade ties. In September, Modi made his first visit to China in seven years to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where he held hands with both Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.



Bilateral relations with Brazil were never as close, ambitious, or transformative as those with India. But successive U.S. administrations also saw value in cooperation with Brasília. Trade and investment ties have steadily grown in recent decades, and the United States enjoys a trade surplus in goods—around $6.8 billion in 2024. The two countries have worked with each other on security and counternarcotics for decades and have struck multiple agreements that link their defense technology companies. During his first administration, Trump forged close personal ties with then President Jair Bolsonaro, and Washington designated Brazil a major non-NATO ally.

Then, as with India, Trump's return to power set relations on a downward trajectory. The bulk of his anger appears rooted in Brazil's decision to prosecute Bolsonaro for attempting a coup after his 2022 electoral loss, which seemed to remind Trump of his own judicial troubles after his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. In July of this year, the Trump administration raised tariffs on Brazil to 50 percent, citing a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. He also used the Global Magnitsky Act, a law meant to punish foreign functionaries for human rights violations, to sanction Brazilian officials involved in Bolsonaro's trial—including a supreme court justice and his spouse.

The roots of the United States' problems with South Africa long predate Trump. Pretoria purports to be a champion of human rights but tends to condemn the injustices of the United States and its allies while ignoring those committed by China or Russia. For example, South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. But when Russia invaded Ukraine, South Africa repeatedly abstained from United Nations votes on the war—rankling officials in Washington. And in 2023, the U.S. ambassador in Pretoria charged South Africa with letting a Russian ship subject to U.S. sanctions, the Lady R, pick up weapons at a South African naval base. In 2024, a bill was even introduced in the U.S. Congress to review the United States's relationship with South Africa, signaling broad frustration with Pretoria among American policymakers.

Yet the U.S.–South African relationship has deteriorated further since Trump again became president. He accused South Africa of waging genocide against white farmers, a claim rejected by most observers, and created a priority refugee track for Afrikaners, even as he suspended the resettlement of refugees from elsewhere. In March, his administration expelled South Africa's ambassador from the United States for claiming that Trump's political movement is driven by a “white supremacist instinct.” In May, Trump played a video for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that alleged violence against white farmers and handed him a stack of articles that he said described the “death, death, horrible death” of white South Africans. In August, Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on the country.

The United States does have legitimate grievances with Brazil, India, and South Africa. New Delhi has historically maintained a protectionist trade policy, with an average tariff rate of 12 percent, and it started buying Russian oil in large quantities after the invasion of Ukraine to take advantage of the discounted price caused by sanctions. Brazil maintains that both Russia and Ukraine share equal responsibility for the war, has made efforts to reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar, criticizes Washington for sanctioning Venezuela, and openly seeks “a new geopolitics” that is less dominated by the United States. South African policymakers speak of liberation from an unjust, Western-imposed global order while maintaining close ties with Beijing, Moscow, and even Hamas.

But it is profoundly unwise for Washington to push these swing states away. China and Russia are actively competing with the United States for influence among them, so Brazil, India, and South Africa are caught between a relatively liberal bloc, led by the United States, and a revisionist axis made up of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Washington is unlikely to ever fully win the swing states over to its side; instead, they prefer to maintain relationships with China, Russia, and the United States simultaneously. But if Washington continues to antagonize these countries, it could drive them away.

It is in the United States' interests to see the BRICS divided between two factions: one that includes China and Russia, which oppose the United States, and the other composed of Brazil, India, and South Africa, which are not automatically at odds with Washington. When the BRICS is polarized, it is less likely to oppose the United States' interests. But if the former faction takes hold, American power will suffer. The BRICS, for example, might lead a coordinated effort to de-dollarize trade and create alternative payment systems that erode the global dominance of the U.S. economic system, weakening a key pillar of American clout and the effectiveness of Washington's sanctions. If the BRICS collectively invests more in alternative institutions, including its New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement, existing U.S.- and European-led financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, might lose their influence. China and Russia will also gain more opportunities to expand their spheres of influence in the global South, putting U.S. interests in these regions at greater risk.



Instead of alienating such global swing states, the United States should be working with them. It could team up with Brazil, for instance, to diversify its semiconductor supply chains and offset Chinese influence in Latin America. India remains a key player in the Indo-Pacific, and Washington should keep using the Quad to balance Chinese power. And if Washington signed a trade deal with Pretoria, American officials might entice South Africa to work with the United States on its diplomatic efforts across the African continent. All three countries have access to critical minerals that could help the United States diversify away from adversary suppliers.

Ironically, the Trump administration is, in some ways, unusually well positioned to rebuild these relationships. No American president in memory has been less constrained by existing policy or more willing to change tack. For instance, his administration went from warmly embracing India to denouncing it nearly overnight. And in the past few months, Trump cannot seem to decide whether Russia or Ukraine will prevail in their conflict, alternating where he applies pressure. U.S. foreign policy shifts quickly these days.

But even if the United States makes strides with Brazil, India, and South Africa, some damage will remain. The memory of U.S. capriciousness does not easily fade. India is a case in point: it took decades for Washington and New Delhi to overcome their mutual distrust from the Cold War, when India was close with the Soviet Union, and the United States had a partnership with Pakistan. Indian policymakers still remind American diplomats about U.S. support for Pakistan during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war and the United States' deployment of a naval task force to the Bay of Bengal. Even if the administration changes policy on a dime, no multi-aligned country will suddenly go all in with the United States.

But that is no excuse for not trying. If Washington fails to even mildly improve relations with Brazil, India, and South Africa, Beijing and Moscow will toast their good luck.

A Navy helicopter and an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet went down in the South China Sea on the afternoon of Oct. 26 in two separate incidents.

The U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet made the announcement on X, stating that “at approximately 2:45 p.m. local time, a U.S. Navy MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter, assigned to the ‘Battle Cats' of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 73, went down in the waters of the South China Sea while conducting routine operations.”

MOSCOW, October 27. /TASS/. Russia's former Prime Minister and current Chairman of the Association of Lawyers of Russia, Sergey Stepashin, has expressed confidence that adversaries are unlikely to risk deploying American Tomahawk cruise missiles for deep strikes into Russia.

"I am certain that Tomahawks will not penetrate deep into Russian territory," Stepashin stated, citing the strategic posture of Russia's leadership. "Listen to what our president, Vladimir Putin, has emphasized. We also possess the Burevestnik missile."

The day prior, President Putin announced the successful completion of decisive tests for the Burevestnik - a nuclear-powered cruise missile with virtually unlimited range. While he acknowledged that further work remains before the missile is ready for combat deployment, he affirmed that the primary objectives have been achieved.

In March 2018, President Putin revealed during his address to the Federal Assembly that Russia had developed a compact nuclear power unit designed for use in cruise missiles, granting them an unprecedented range. He described the missile as low-flying, stealthy, with an unpredictable flight path, and armed with a nuclear warhead.

The missile was named Burevestnik through a nationwide vote on the Russian Defense Ministry's website - marking the first time in Russian history that a weapon's name was chosen by popular vote, previously determined solely by military authorities. Development of the Burevestnik began after the United States withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in December 2001. The Russian Ministry of Defense emphasizes that the creation of such advanced strategic weapons aims to bolster Russia's defense capabilities and deter any potential aggression against the nation and its allies. The Pentagon has acknowledged that the Burevestnik missile possesses the capacity to deliver strikes from virtually any direction, thanks to its extensive range and autonomous operation.

US President Donald Trump is moving on to the second leg of his Asia tour, boarding Air Force One for Japan after time in Kuala Lumpur for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.

U.S. President Donald Trump arrived Monday in Japan where he'll meet new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for the first time. She's a protege of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who Trump bonded with over their shared love of golf.

Trump spent Sunday in Malaysia, where he participated in a regional summit. His focus in Asia has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of “America first.” A trade deal between the U.S. and China is drawing closer, officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday as they reached an initial consensus for Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to aim to finalize during their high-stakes meeting.

Trump's trip comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands for health care funds, there's no sign of a break in the impasse.

The food charity, known for opening public kitchens and distributing meals in war zones and in the aftermath of natural disasters, was providing food to federal workers furloughed by the government shutdown. It was distributing fresh food, ranging from vegetarian to meat options, and fruit and water to dozens of people on Monday.

Elizabeth Anderson, a furloughed NASA employee, said it's tough being a federal worker during this moment. She said the food provided “a little extra cushion for the furlough.”

Humberto Lopez, a furloughed federal worker with the Department of Defense, said he is starting to feel the financial squeeze of the shutdown.

“It's starting to get real,” he said, waiting in line for food. “You know you can't sustain this for much longer.”

The leader of Canada's most populous province is bragging about the impact of his anti-tariff ad that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the ad had over a “billion impressions around the world” and “generated a conversation that wasn't happening in the U.S.”

The populist Conservative premier says it was the “best ad I ever ran” and says he's achieved his goals.

Ontario's television advertisement criticizes Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

The ad upset Trump who said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%.

“You know why President Trump is so upset right now? It was because it was effective,” Ford says.

Republicans outnumber Democrats in Indiana's congressional delegation 7-2, limiting possibilities of squeezing out another seat. But many in the party see this mid-cycle redistricting effort as a chance for the GOP to represent all nine seats.

Among the targets is the 1st District, a Democratic stronghold near Chicago held by third-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan. He's won reelection twice despite previous GOP efforts to redraw the borders to help Republicans. 

“I believe that representation should be earned through ideas and service, not political manipulation,” Mrvan said in a statement Monday. 

Indiana Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder threatened legal action if the Republicans pass any new maps: “This is not democracy. This is desperation,” she said in a statement.

The countdown is on to figure out how to keep food on the table for the nearly 42 million Americans who receive SNAP grocery assistance.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy food won't be replenished in November due to the government shutdown.

About 1 in 8 people in the U.S. receive the aid.

It's not clear whether the pause in the program will shift anything in the negotiations to reopen the government.

It is leaving beneficiaries, states and food banks scrambling for ways to fill the gaps.

Indiana's Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray was among the state lawmakers who met privately with Trump as the White House pressured them to redraw the state's House districts to give the GOP more of an advantage. But his spokesperson said Monday that the votes are still lacking, casting doubt on whether a special session called by Gov. Braun will be successful.

With only 10 Democrats in the 50-member Senate, that means more than a dozen of the 40 Republicans oppose the idea. Some state Republican lawmakers have warned that midcycle redistricting can be costly and could backfire politically.

Gov. Braun is a staunch ally of Trump in a state the president won handily. He previously said he did not want to try mid-decade redistricting unless he was sure lawmakers would back a new map. 

But on Monday, he said it was the right thing to do: “I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” Braun said.

Julie Emerson, a Republican Louisiana state representative, is running to unseat fellow Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is seeking a third term in 2026.

Emerson, 37, chairs the Louisiana House ways and means committee and is an ally of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. She announced her candidacy in a video posted Monday morning.

Landry had spoken to Trump in May about U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow as a potential primary challenger to Cassidy, who is unpopular with a segment of Louisiana's GOP base. Cassidy voted in January 2021 to convict Trump after his second impeachment. Emerson said in August that she would run if Letlow didn't. She now joins a crowded primary field, which includes state Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez and others.

The president of the union that represents more than 800,000 government workers says that both political parties have made their point and it's time to end the shutdown.

Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said every worker should be back on the job with full pay. His statement comes as more workers miss their first full paycheck.

“It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,” Kelley said. “No half measures, and no gamesmanship.”

The AFGE carries considerable political weight in Washington, particularly on the Democratic side. Kelley said there is no winning a government shutdown.

“It's time for our leaders to start focusing on how to solve problems for the American people, rather than on who is going to get the blame for a shutdown that Americans dislike,” Kelley said in a statement posted on the union's website.

New Yorkers are choosing between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat on the ballot as an independent. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, is also on the ballot despite dropping out and supporting Cuomo. 

The New Jersey governor's race features Republican state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli against Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

Mamdani appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday, telling a raucous crowd that his campaign is a “movement of the masses” against billionaires and “oligarchs.” As the crowd chanted his name, Mamdani reiterated plans to hire thousands of new teachers, renegotiate city contracts, freeze rent increases for the city's 1 million rent-regulated apartments, build more affordable housing and provide universal child care.

Cuomo argued that he's the real Democrat and that Mamdani's democratic socialism would send residents and businesses fleeing: “He wins, book airline tickets for Florida now.”

The Navy's Pacific Fleet said three people went down in the MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter, quickly followed by the ejection of both aviators in the F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet. All five were rescued.

The causes are under investigation, but Trump speculated while en route to Tokyo that “bad fuel” could be to blame for both crashes. The president ruled out foul play and said there was “nothing to hide.”

The Nimitz is returning to Naval Base Kitsap in Washington state after being deployed to Middle East in response to attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. The carrier is on its final deployment before decommissioning.

A statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Wang Yi's conversation with Marco Rubio, which took place on Monday, after the economic and trade talks in Kuala Lumpur.

“The two sides clarified their positions, enhanced understanding, and reached a framework consensus on reciprocal solutions to current pressing economic and trade issues,” Wang said in the statement, adding that both sides should “resolve conflicts through dialogue and abandon the practice of exerting pressure” to “stabilize the relationship and move forward in bilateral relations.”

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a phone call Monday that they both have “world-class leaders.”

Wang said the “long-standing exchange and mutual respect” of presidents Xi and Trump have become the most valuable strategic asset” of the bilateral ties, according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry.

U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators said they made progress toward a possible trade deal during talks in Malaysia, ahead of the expected meeting between Trump and Xi on Thursday in South Korea. 

The streets in Japan are famously narrow and congested, but no matter: Japan's government said it may import Ford F-150 trucks for its transport ministry to use while inspecting roads and infrastructure. That would be a win for the Trump administration, which has long complained of American vehicles being shut out of the market that's home to Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Subaru.

“We appreciate President Trump's advocating for American made products,” Ford spokesperson Dave Tovar said. “We would be excited to introduce America's best-selling truck to work and government customers in Japan.”

Trump bought into the idea while flying to Asia, saying “That's a hot truck.”

Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun called Monday for state lawmakers to return to Indianapolis for a special session on Nov. 3 to redraw the state's congressional boundaries, escalating a national fight over midcycle redistricting.

Trump has ramped up pressure on Republican governors to give the party an easier path to maintain control of the House. Republicans in Texas and Missouri moved quickly, and California Democrats responded with their own redistricting plan. But Indiana lawmakers have been far more hesitant. 

A spokesperson for a GOP state senate leader said last week that the Indiana Senate lacked the votes to pass a new congressional map, but the White House has held multiple meetings with holdout lawmakers, including a return trip to Indianapolis on Oct. 10 by Vice President JD Vance.—CORRECTION: Last week's statement that the Senate lacked the votes was incorrectly attributed to a spokesperson for Braun. The statement was made by a spokesperson for state Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray.

Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters' mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration. Republicans have offered few answers, saying they won't negotiate until Democrats end the shutdown. 

The moment revives a familiar dynamic in a the Republican Party that is united in opposing the Affordable Care Act but since the Obama administration has lacked a clear plan to replace it. The lack of a plan to address to rising costs risks political backlash for Republicans in next year's midterms. 

Democrats have said tax credits that kept the costs lower should be extended and refused to reopen the government until they are.

When the Trump administration froze foreign assistance overnight, urgent efforts began to figure out how private donors could support critical aid programs.

Multiple groups launched fundraisers in February, eventually mobilizing more than $125 million in emergency funding. It wasn't nearly enough, but was more than organizers had imagined possible. And with needs piling up, wealthy donors and private foundations grappled had to determine: Of the thousands of programs the U.S. funded abroad, which ones could have the biggest impact if saved?

Sasha Gallant led a team at the U.S. Agency for International Development that specialized in identifying programs cost-effective and impactful programs. Along with colleagues who had been fired or worked outside of business hours, they identified 80 programs they recommended to private donors, and Project Resource Optimization announced that all had been funded.

Former President Joe Biden called these “dark days” as he urged Americans to stay optimistic and to not check out as Trump attacks free speech and asserts expanded executive powers.

“We're more powerful than any dictator,” Biden said after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston Sunday night.

America depends on a balance of powers between a presidency with limited power, a functioning Congress and an autonomous judiciary, he said: “Since its founding, America served as a beacon for the most powerful idea ever in government in the history of the world.” 

Biden, 82, ended his first public speech since a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer on an optimistic note, predicting Americans will “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have — stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith.”

Chinese markets logged solid gains Monday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.1% to 26,434.69, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.2% to 3,996.94 — reflecting growing hopes that after months of escalating trade disputes, Trump might be right when he said “I think we're going to come away with a deal” with China.

“This isn't just photo-op diplomacy. Behind the showmanship, Washington and Beijing's top trade lieutenants have quietly mapped out a framework that might, just might, keep the world's two largest economies from tearing up the field again,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to hold their high-stakes meeting on Thursday, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea. 

Trump, whose powerful handshake was a bit of concern among Japanese officials, seemed gentle when he met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace soon after arriving in Tokyo on Monday. 

When he got off the Presidential vehicle, he walked to Naruhito and shook hand and gently placed his left hand on top of the Emperor's, instead of his usual, kind of a slap. They exchanged greeting in English though their conversation was inaudible. Trump straightened his jacket as he stood next to Naruhito for a photo spray before they sat across a round table, with flowers placed in the middle, for talks for about 30 minutes. 

Before leaving, Trump shook hands again with Naruhito, and called him “A great man!” twice while pointing to the Emperor. Trump last saw the emperor in 2019 soon after Naruhito ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne, becoming the first foreign dignitary invited to the palace.

Asian shares surged Monday while European markets were little changed after Trump said he expected to reach a trade agreement with China.

Germany's DAX gained 0.2% to 24,279.53 and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.1% to 8,218.42. Britain's FTSE 100 also shed 0.1%, to 9,640.12. The future for the S&P 500 jumped 0.9% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6%.

Work on trade deals that might alleviate friction between the U.S., China and other major trading partners has reassured investors, especially in Asia.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 2.5% to 50,512.32, a new closing high following news that the world's two largest economies had reached an initial consensus for Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to finalize during a high-stakes meeting later in the week.

Brazilian farmers are increasing soybean production as the U.S. and China engage in a trade fight. 

The conflict has shut American soybeans out of the Chinese market, leading China to seek more Brazilian supply. China's customs body reported no U.S. soybean imports in September, a first since November 2018. 

Brazilian soybeans already accounted for over 70% of China's imports last year. Brazil's Agriculture Ministry expects the next soybean harvest to rise by 3.6%. 

Farmers in the U.S. are worried about losing the Chinese market permanently, even if a trade agreement is reached, and are seeking other markets.

Japan has welcomed Trump to Tokyo by lighting Tokyo landmarks in the red, white and blue colors of the U.S. flag.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi also posted a message on X, saying: “Welcome to Japan, @realDonaldTrump!”

Among the landmarks lit up are the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building as well as the Tokyo Tower and Sky Tree, broadcasting and observation towers that are icons of the city skyline.

Japanese television broadcast live footage of Trump waving to roadside onlookers as he rode in his motorcade to the Imperial Palace to meet with Emperor Naruhito.

Many people in the large crowd that had gathered in Tokyo to see Trump took photos with their phones.

Bessent said a potential agreement, which has been the subject of extensive negotiation, could require more time. 

“Just a lot of details to work out,” he said. “Very complicated deal, and I think we're very close.” 

A sticking point has been Washington's push for South Korea to invest $350 billion in the U.S. 

Greer said “Koreans have a great plan to invest in U.S. shipbuilding,” an industry that Trump wants to expand.

Trump has arrived in Japan, where he'll meet new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for the first time. 

The meeting is an early diplomatic test for Takaichi. She took office only last week and has a tenuous coalition backing her.

Bessent says there's “a framework” for Trump and Xi to discuss during a meeting in South Korea later this week.

The details are still unclear, but Bessent said American and Chinese negotiators discussed tariffs, rare earths, fentanyl and “a substantial purchase of U.S. agricultural products.” Specifically, Washington wants Beijing to buy soybeans from U.S. farmers.

Trump chimed in by saying “we feel good” about working things out with China.

As Air Force One approached Tokyo, Trump posted on social media about renovations at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

He said exterior columns had been “beautifully painted in a luxuriant white enamel color, replacing the fake looking gold paint that was there for years.” 

There are also “many major improvements” on the way, including “seating, carpeting, wall coverings, ceilings, chandeliers, stages, heating and A/C, etc.”

Trump also posted a picture of the renovated Oval Office, which features extensive gold trim and more portraits of presidential predecessors.

“Look how beautiful the Oval Office is, now,” he wrote.

President Donald Trump announced he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs. The ad was paid for by the Ontario provincial government, not the Canadian federal government.

Trump is still upset about Ontario's television advertisements criticizing his tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

Trump noted that the advertisement was yanked from the air, “but they did it very late” and “they let it play for another two nights.”

Trump said he wouldn't meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in South Korea, where they're attending the same summit.

“I don't want to meet with him,” he said. “I'm not going to be meeting with him for a while.”

The president said he wants the current chairman, Jay Powell, to leave “as soon as possible,” and he could pick a replacement by the end of the year.

Powell's term as chair ends in May. Trump has stepped back from threats to fire Powell, although he has tried to push out another board member, Lisa Cook.

Bessent said they're preparing a slate of candidates for Trump to choose from. And Trump reiterated that Bessent is a possibility for the job himself.

During the gaggle with reporters, Trump boasted about his administration's transparency, pointing to all the top officials taking questions from the media.

“You can ask anything you want. There's never been anything like this,” he said.

But Trump still wants to keep some things under wraps. Specifically, he's still unwilling to identify the donor who provided $130 million to pay U.S. troops during the government shutdown.

Trump said only that “he's an unbelievable patriot.”

The political party of Argentine President Javier Milei did well in the country's midterm elections, and Trump called it “a big win.”

“He had a lot of help from us,” Trump said. “I gave him an endorsement, a very strong endorsement.”

The administration has also been extending economic assistance to Argentina, including raising the possibility of buying Argentine beef to bring down prices in the U.S.

The idea has upset American cattle ranchers, but Trump brushed off the issue.

“We're going to get the price of beef down, and I'm going to make sure the cattle ranchers don't get hurt,” Trump said.

The president and the tech titan had an explosive falling out when Musk left the administration, where he was spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency. They reconnected at the funeral for conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Trump suggested their dispute was water under the bridge.

“He had a bad period, a bad moment. It was a stupid moment in his life,” Trump said, adding, “I like Elon, and I suspect I'll always like him.”

Stephen Bannon, a Trump ally, has repeatedly said the president could serve a third term despite a constitutional prohibition. Trump himself has flirted with the idea.

Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said, “I haven't really thought about it.” He rejected the possibility of running for vice president as a way to get back to the presidency, saying, “I'd be allowed to do it” but wouldn't because “it's too cute.”

Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates.

“I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,” he said.

The president's overtures to reconnect with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have gone unanswered.

“If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,” Trump said.

Trump even said he'd be willing to extend his trip if there was a chance to talk to Kim. Since South Korea is Trump's last stop before returning to the U.S., “it's pretty easy to do,” he noted.

A source of tension has been a recent immigration raid at a Hyundai plant, which frustrated Korean business leaders who have been encouraged to invest in the United States.

Trump said, “I was opposed to getting them out,” and he said they were working on a new visa system that would make it easier for Korean companies to bring in skilled workers.

“We're doing a whole new plan for that,” he said.

Trump said, “We want them to bring in experts” and “they'll teach our people how to do it” before returning to Korea.

Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. They took questions for about a half hour.

Trump said he would talk about the “great friendship” between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.

“I hear phenomenal things” about the new Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, Trump said. He noted her closeness with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Trump had a good relationship during his first term.

“It's going to be very good,” he said. “That really helps Japan and the United States.”

There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of “America first.”

For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports — from allies and adversaries alike — in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.

However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. Trump is awaiting a Supreme Court case that could solidify his authority or limit it.

Soon after he stepped out of the plane, U.S. President Trump displayed his signature dance moves to Malaysian performers on Sunday. He arrived in Malaysia to attend the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.

The president is flying to Tokyo from Kuala Lumpur, where he attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He participated in a ceremonial signing of an expanded ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, which fought earlier this year. Trump helped pressure both countries to stop by threatening to withhold trade agreements.

The summit is not a guaranteed part of any president's itinerary, but it was an opportunity for Trump to reengage with a critical region for the first time since returning to office.

In addition, American and Chinese negotiators used the summit to advance trade talks, with the potential for an agreement that would reduce tensions between the world's two largest economies later this week.

Japan's capital saw heightened security ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's arrival on Monday. Tokyo's metropolitan police set up a special taskforce and mobilized some 18,000 officers.

At Tokyo's Haneda airport, where Trump will arrive, all lockers and garbage bins were closed or removed.

In downtown Tokyo, vehicles were checked and police dogs were stationed near the U.S. Embassy, where riot police were also deployed. One man was arrested for allegedly carrying knives outside the embassy.

Former chief counsel to House Judiciary Committee Democrats Julian Epstein discusses the Gaza peace deal and more on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

Hamas says it will hand over another body of an Israeli hostage on Monday, as President Donald Trump's 48-hour deadline looms.

If the latest body is handed over, Hamas will still have the bodies of 12 Israeli hostages in its custody. Trump's deadline will expire Monday night. Hamas has made no mention of the identity of the deceased hostage set to be released.

"Within the framework of the Al-Aqsa Flood prisoner exchange deal, the Martyr Izz El-Din Al-Qassam Brigades will hand over the body of one of the occupation prisoners, which was recovered today in the Gaza Strip, at 9 PM Gaza time," Hamas announced in a statement.

Trump acknowledged on social media Saturday that some of the deceased hostages are "hard to reach."

"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. "Perhaps it has to do with their disarming, but when I said, ‘Both sides would be treated fairly,' that only applies if they comply with their obligations. Let's see what they do over the next 48 hours. I am watching this very closely."

Hours before Trump's post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee met with the families of Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, two U.S. citizens who were killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.

Their bodies are among those still being held by Hamas.

"We will not forget the lives of the hostages who died in the captivity of Hamas," Rubio wrote in an X post. "We will not rest until their—and all—remains are returned."

Authorities believed Chen, a 19-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, was kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, but was later declared dead by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Huckabee noted Rubio's visit to Israel was "very productive in moving forward" the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan, adding the plan cannot work until all hostages, living and deceased, are released.

            Jon Stewart says he wants to stay at “The Daily Show” desk after his current contract expires in December.
    


            “We're working on staying,” the Comedy Central host said Sunday when asked about his status on stage at The New Yorker Festival in Manhattan.
    


            “It's not as clear-cut as all that,” Stewart quickly added. He started to say the media business is changing, perhaps alluding to the recent ownership changes at Comedy Central's parent, Paramount.
    


            However, Remnick asked, “If it's up to you, you're staying?” Yes, Stewart said.
    


            A Paramount spokesperson declined to comment on Stewart's remarks.
    


            Stewart first hosted “The Daily Show” from 1999 to 2015, returning last year to host its Monday episodes. The satirical newscast's correspondents have been taking turns filling in the rest of the week.
    


            Remnick had brought up the political context earlier in the conversation: Paramount's ownership shift, Disney's suspension of Kimmel amid Trump administration pressure, and widespread perceptions of media mogul capitulation to President Trump.
    


            Stewart, one of the biggest stars on cable, has been outspoken in his opposition to President Trump and equally loud about his support of late-night comedy.
    


            Remnick asked “what do you do” when facing pressure, and Stewart said, “You don't compromise on what you do, and you do it till they tell you to leave. That's all you can do.”
    


            Stewart acknowledged the fears about Trump's authoritarian approach — and said the US may wind up in “some kind of soft autocracy where news is controlled” — but also urged Trump's critics to recognize the power they have.
    


            “We have a lot of different avenues,” he said. “And suppression creates opportunity, and a populace that is thirsty for inspiration and leadership and morality and integrity and lack of corruption, that's fertile ground for that opportunity.”
    


            Talking about new media stars like podcaster Joe Rogan, Stewart said, “It's not acceptable to just say, well, ‘I don't like what he does.' Then do it better, beat them at their own game. Go on.”
    


            “There's no one in this world right now that isn't platformed,” he added. “And so if you have a problem with information, then fight like hell to get better information out there.”

Urban Meyer and Tom Rinaldi broke down the top options to be the next Head Coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions.

It was just last week when Penn State fired head coach James Franklin after a third straight loss, leading to a $49 million buyout by the Nittany Lions to let him get out of his contract. 

At the time, it seemed wild that a university would be willing to shell out that much money, but the potential buyout for former LSU head coach Brian Kelly could rival Franklin's. 

After the Tigers made the decision Sunday night to fire Kelly, less than 24 hours after LSU fell to Texas A&M 49-25 for its third loss in the last four games, both sides are still negotiating the financial terms of the split.

Kelly was in his fourth year of a 10-year, $100 million deal with LSU, which he signed after leaving Notre Dame. Kelly had $95 million in salary on that deal and 90% of it was guaranteed money. 

LSU FIRES FOOTBALL COACH BRIAN KELLY AFTER THIRD LOSS OF SEASON: REPORTS

Kelly and LSU athletic director Scott Woodward reportedly had a tense meeting on Sunday morning, according to The Athletic. The report added that during that meeting, Kelly's $54 million buyout in his contract was brought up. 

There was also a coaching confrontation, as Woodward reportedly wanted to make changes to Kelly's staff, which included axing offensive coordinator Joe Sloan. However, Kelly allegedly pushed back, saying he would rather make other moves on his staff.

This situation has even reached the highest level of state government, as Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry reportedly met with the LSU Board of Supervisors about Kelly's firing on Sunday night. 

The loss to Texas A&M was the last straw for many LSU fans, who were heard chanting "Fire Kelly" at Tiger Stadium on Saturday during the loss. Kelly was asked about that possibility after the loss, which put them at 5-3 on the year and 2-3 in SEC play. 

"It's impossible for the head coach that's been here for four years and 35 years of doing this, to think anything [but keep coaching]," he said, via the New York Post. "That's not my decision in terms of whether I'm here or not, but that's what I will do."

Kelly went 34-14 during his tenure with the Tigers. 

"When Coach Kelly arrived at LSU four years ago, we had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships during his time in Baton Rouge," Woodward said as part of a statement. "Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize, and I made the decision to make a change after last night's game."

The Republican governor of Indiana said Monday he's scheduling a special session to redraw congressional boundaries after weeks of pressure to back President Donald Trump's bid to add more winnable seats with midcycle redistricting.

Trump has pressed Republicans to draw new maps that give the party an easier path to maintain control of the House in the midterms. While Republicans in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have moved quickly to enact new districts, Indiana lawmakers have been hesitant.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun called for the General Assembly to convene Nov. 3 for the special session. It's unclear whether enough of the GOP majority Senate will back new maps. 

The White House held multiple meetings with Indiana lawmakers who have held out for months. The legislative leaders kept their cards close as speculation swirled over whether the state known for its more measured approach to Republican politics would answer the redistricting call. 


      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.
  




Vice President JD Vance first met with Braun and legislative leaders in Indianapolis in August and Trump met privately with state House Speaker Todd Huston and state Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray in the Oval Office weeks later. Vance also spoke to state lawmakers visiting Washington that day. 

Vance returned to Indianapolis on Oct. 10 to meet with the governor, as well as the Republican state House and Senate members.

Braun is a staunch ally of Trump in a state the president won by 19 percentage points in 2024. But Indiana lawmakers have avoided the national spotlight in recent years — especially after a 2022 special session that yielded a strict abortion ban. Braun previously said he did not want to call a special session until he was sure lawmakers would back a new map. 




“I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” Braun said in a statement Monday.

Typically, states redraw boundaries of congressional districts every 10 years after the census has concluded. Opponents are expected to challenge any new maps in court. 

State lawmakers have the sole power to draw maps in Indiana, where Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers. Democrats could not stop a special session by refusing to attend, as their peers in Texas briefly did. 

A spokesperson for Bray said last week that the Indiana Senate lacked the votes to pass a new congressional map and she said Monday that the votes are still lacking, casting doubt on whether a special session will achieve Braun's goals. 

With only 10 Democrats in the 50-member Senate, that means more than a dozen of the 40 Republicans oppose the idea. Some state Republican lawmakers have warned that midcycle redistricting can be costly and could backfire politically. 

Republicans who vote against redistricting could to be forced out of office if their colleagues back primary opponents as punishment for not towing the party line. Braun's move to call a special session could force lawmakers who haven't commented publicly to take a stance. 

Indiana's Republican legislative leaders praised existing boundaries after adopting them four years ago.

“I believe these maps reflect feedback from the public and will serve Hoosiers well for the next decade,” Bray said at the time. 

Indiana Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder decried the special session and threatened legal action over any maps passed by the Legislature.

“This is not democracy. This is desperation,” she said in a statement. 

Democrats only need to gain three seats to flip control of the U.S. House, and redistricting fights have erupted in multiple states. 




Some Democratic states have moved to counter Republican gains with new legislative maps. The latest, Virginia, is expected to take up the issue in a special session starting this week.

Republicans outnumber Democrats in Indiana's congressional delegation 7-2, limiting possibilities of squeezing out another seat. But many in the party see it as a chance for the GOP to represent all nine seats.

The GOP would likely target Indiana's 1st Congressional District, a longtime Democratic stronghold that encompasses Gary and other cities near Chicago in the state's northwest corner. The seat held by third-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan has been seen by Republicans as a possible pickup in recent elections. 

Lawmakers in Indiana redrew the borders of the district to be slightly more favorable toward Republicans in the 2022 election, but did not entirely split it up. The new maps were not challenged in court after they were approved in 2021, not even by Democrats and allies who had opposed the changes boosting GOP standing in the suburbs north of Indianapolis. 

Mrvan still won reelection in 2022 and easily retained his seat in 2024. 

“I believe that representation should be earned through ideas and service, not political manipulation,” Mrvan said in a statement Monday. 

Republicans could also zero in on Indiana's 7th Congressional District, composed entirely of Marion County and the Democratic stronghold of Indianapolis. But that option would be more controversial, potentially slicing up the state's largest city and diluting Black voters' influence.

Live Updates


            • Rare Category 5: Melissa rapidly intensified over the weekend and is now a Category 5 hurricane with 165 mph winds. Its outer bands are already lashing Jamaica with wind and rain. 



            • Catastrophic impact:  Up to 40 inches of rain, 13 feet of storm surge and 160 mph sustained winds will cause “extensive infrastructure damage” that will cut off communities, the National Hurricane Center warned.
    


            • Jamaica's worst hurricane: Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for vulnerable coastal areas of Jamaica ahead of what will likely be the strongest storm on record to hit the country. Melissa has already killed three people in Haiti and one person in the Dominican Republic.
    


            • Extreme rapid intensification: Melissa more than doubled in strength over the weekend, increasing its winds by 70 mph in just 24 hours. More tropical systems are rapidly intensifying and wringing out more rain as the atmosphere and ocean warm due to fossil fuel pollution.
    


            Jamaica's climate change minister said Monday that the time for preparation is “all but over” as Hurricane Melissa moves toward the island.
    


                    “We've started every press conference where I've had the opportunity to speak by simply saying that it is not time to panic, but time to prepare. The time for preparation is all but over. The time now is to listen to instructions,” Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change.
                





            Samuda encouraged people on the island to use resources sparingly and warned that disruption to the water system could start as soon as tonight.
    


            “You will start to see disruption to water systems, we imagine, later this evening going into early morning tomorrow,” he said. “Now is definitely the time to put aside your water for storage and to use sparingly. Every drop will count.”
    


            “The time for preparation is almost at an end,” Samuda again stressed.
    


            It's been 13 years since a hurricane made landfall in Jamaica. However, last year showed it doesn't take a landfall to cause big problems in the island nation.
    


            While Sandy in October 2012 was the last hurricane to come ashore in Jamaica, Hurricane Beryl tracked just south of the island as a Category 4 in July 2024. Floods and high winds caused damage to homes, crops and other infrastructure, especially in southern areas.
    


            The storm killed four people and caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, according to the hurricane center report.
    


            Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 was the last Category 4 or stronger hurricane to make landfall in Jamaica. Melissa is poised to be the most powerful hurricane on record to come ashore.
    


            Jamaican government officials are now giving updates about the progress of Hurricane Melissa as it churns toward Jamaica.
    


            The press conference is taking place at the country's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management.
    


The speakers include:



            • Dana Morris Dixon, minister of Education, Skills, Youth & Information
    


            • Desmond McKenzie, minister of Local Government
    


            • Matthew Samuda, minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change
    


            • Robert Morgan, minister without portfolio for the Ministry of Economic, Growth and Job Creation
    


            • Evan Thompson, Jamaica's principal director of the Meteorological Service
    


            We will bring you more updates as we get them.
    


            Massive flooding is unavoidable no matter where Hurricane Melissa makes landfall, Jamaica's transport minister said on Monday.
    


                    “Regardless of where it enters and where it exits there is going to be massive flooding,” said Daryl Vaz, minister of Transport, Telecommunications and Energy. “That is going to require persons to relocate from their existing locations.”
                





            Meanwhile, Minister for Local Government Desmond McKenzie shared his concerns about low uptake in the use of emergency shelters across the country that are available for those in vulnerable areas.
    


            “There are over 800 shelters across Jamaica. Of the 800 shelters that are open, only 76 of the 800 shelters are seeing any activities at all,” McKenzie said at a press conference. “There are four parishes that have no one in the shelters.”
    


            McKenzie said the government is anticipating that “close to 50,000 persons will be relocated, either moving to safe grounds or in the shelters.”
    


            Residents in low-lying neighborhoods along Jamaica's coastline will be most exposed to heavy rainfall, storm surges, and strong winds, a senior meteorologist warned Monday, hours before Hurricane Melissa was set to make landfall.
    


            “The areas around that coastline are going to be most impacted,” Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, told journalists.
    


            Melissa will likely emit the strongest hurricane winds in western parishes of the Caribbean nation. Tropical storm force winds will cover nearly the entire island, Thompson said.
    


                    “If you think that you live in Kingston, and you will not experience the eye and so you are free from fear or worry… Think again,” the meteorological chief said. “The heavy winds will also affect you.”
                





            He also warned that landslides are “a very real possibility and likelihood, because as the soil is saturated and the soil is loose.”
    


            Hurricane Melissa pushed a research plane to its limit, forcing hurricane hunters to abort a mission Monday morning.
    


            “NOAA aircraft left the storm early after experiencing severe turbulence in the southwestern eyewall,” the National Hurricane Center wrote in Melissa's latest forecast discussion.
    


            Hurricane hunters are no stranger to powerful winds and intense turbulence, so what happened Monday morning is remarkable. These teams routinely fly specialized aircraft into the most powerful storms on the planet to collect weather data, which is used to improve track and intensity forecasts.
    


            But this flight was “definitely the most turbulent I've ever experienced,” Andy Hazelton, a hurricane expert who confirmed he was on the plane, said on X.
    


            Aircraft positioning data shows that the plane — a WP-3D Orion — was able to take at least two passes through Melissa's center, collecting critical weather data before experiencing the dangerous turbulence that sent researchers heading for safety.
    


CNN's Thomas Bordeaux contributed to this report.



            In Jamaica's capital city, the streets are relatively quiet ahead of Melissa's landfall. The Category 5 is expected to be the strongest storm in the country's history.
    


            Some vehicles are loaded with plywood as residents make final preparations. The government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston.
    


            There's been light rain with some gusts of wind.
    


            At the hotel where a CNN field crew is staying, exterior doors have been boarded up with sand bags piled in front to help combat the water expected to pour on the city overnight.
    


            Kingston's geography is like a bowl and many residents told CNN they fear the island's beautiful mountains will also funnel great amounts of rain into the city.
    


            Jamaican Minister Robert Morgan warned the public not to cross flooded gullies on Monday as Hurricane Melissa looms, threatening to bring torrential rain and flash flooding to the island.
    


                    “We want to appeal to the public … Do not interact with infrastructure that you think is compromised. If the bridge looks shaky, do not attempt to go on the bridge or across the bridge. Do not try to traverse gullies that are flooded,” Morgan, minister without portfolio for the Ministry of Economic, Growth and Job Creation, told a press conference.
                





            Over the weekend, workers in Jamaica's capital Kingston dredged as much trash and silt as they could from the bottom of Sandy Gully, an approximately 20 km long waterway snaking along the city's western flank.
    


            When Melissa brings its months' worth of rain as it passes over Jamaica, the swollen, debris-filled gully could knock out bridges, splitting Kingston in two.
    


            “We've had historical evidence of persons in very powerful vehicles seeking to traverse gullies. And they lost the competition,” Morgan said at a press conference while urging the public to report damage to Jamaica's authorities.
    


            Melissa may well be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica since 1988, when at least 40 people were killed in the wake of Hurricane Gilbert.
    


            Authorities have replenished the electricity grid since then and reinforced housing, according to Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's minister of water, environment and climate change.
    


            “We're certainly better prepared than we would have been in the '80s,” he told CNN on Monday. “But when you speak about 160 mph winds, we've never tested our new infrastructure in that regard.” Gilbert had 135 mph winds when it made landfall on the island.
    


            Hurricane Melissa, which currently has 165 mph winds, is the 45th Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic and the third Category 5 storm this season. Storm surges — a rise in water level caused by a strong storm's wind pushing water onshore — could peak between nine to 13 feet.
    


                    “There isn't infrastructure that's built, I think, anywhere in the world to navigate that sort of risk,” added Samuda. “We do expect that if it does come onshore, we will be facing significant damage.”
                





            Powerful winds whip up along Jamaica's coastline Monday as Hurricane Melissa closes in.
    


            A senior government minister in Jamaica has called on people to follow mass evacuation orders, ahead of what could be the most ferocious storm to hit the country in decades.
    


            Matthew Samuda, the minister of water, environment and climate change, implored residents to travel to shelters and reach high ground on Monday, as the government braced for Hurricane Melissa — the 45th Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic.
    


                    “Heed the warnings. This is serious. It's a devastating storm,” Samuda told CNN on Monday.
                





            Communities on the coasts will be particularly exposed to destructive winds, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storms — and seventy percent of the Jamaican population live within five kilometers of coasts, Samuda said.
    


            The government has erected 800 shelters across the country, according to Samuda. Meanwhile, crews from the national bus service, the country's defense forces and disaster preparedness unit are mobilizing mass evacuations.
    


            “Go to the shelters. Go to higher ground because this can take lives,” he said.

            Melissa's almost perfectly circular, clear eye is an obvious sign of the hurricane's tremendous power.
    


            The eye of a hurricane is an area of relatively calm weather surrounded by the storm's fiercest winds – the eyewall. Melissa's eyewall was sparking with lightning this morning, indicating a lot of energetic thunderstorm activity.
    


            Constant thunderstorm activity often a sign of a strengthening hurricane.
    


            Hurricane Melissa is still strengthening as it crawls toward Jamaica late Monday morning.
    


            Melissa now has sustained winds of 165 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. That's a 5 mph increase from earlier this morning.
    


            The Category 5 hurricane's center is 145 miles southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, as of 11 a.m. ET. It's drifting to the west at just 3 mph.
    


            Melissa has been tracking at what's considered a human's slow walking pace of just 2 to 3 mph since late last week. It's moved just 150 miles since Thursday afternoon, or about the distance between New York City and Baltimore.
    


            The average forward speed of a hurricane where Melissa is located is about 10 to 11 mph, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division.
    


            Melissa's slow movement over warm water that extends deep into the ocean along with improving wind conditions high in the atmosphere allowed it to explode in strength over the weekend and Monday. 



            Warming ocean water from climate change has caused the rapid intensification of hurricanes to become more likely.
    


            The sun rose to reveal a terrifying image of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa Monday morning. The center of the monstrous hurricane was just over 100 miles from the southern coast of Jamaica, but its clouds and storms had completely obscured the island from view.
    


            Melissa's center is easy to spot, just look for the eye – the clear space amid all the cloudiness.
    


            In short, no, not in recorded history.
    


            Since reliable records began in 1851, no Category 5 hurricane has ever made landfall in Jamaica. The strongest known storm to affect the island was Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which approached from the east as a Category 4.
    


            Gilbert remains Jamaica's benchmark hurricane. It destroyed more than 100,000 homes, wiped out power and communications, and killed 45 people.
    


            Tropical storm conditions are already happening in Jamaica as rain bands from Melissa swirl into the island. Wind-whipped periods of heavy rain like this will continue much of the day. That means the threat of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding and numerous landslides has already developed and will continue through Tuesday.
    


            The most extreme wind and storm surge impacts will arrive this evening into early Tuesday as Melissa turns north. “Extensive infrastructural damage” and “long-lasting power and communication outages” are among the devastating wind impacts the hurricane center has warned about.
    


            Storm surge could reach heights of 9 to 13 feet above ground level near and east of where Melissa's center crosses the coast. Large waves will pile onto the surge's destructive potential in low-lying areas.
    


            The Jamaican government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston, as Melissa intensifies on its approach to the Caribbean nation.
    


            “Do not venture out of your safe shelter,” the National Hurricane Center warned Monday morning.
    


             “Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely today through Tuesday. Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities.”
    


Jamaica peak impacts: Wind-whipped bands of rain are spreading across the island so the threat of catastrophic flooding rain and landslides is underway. The most devastating wind and storm surge impacts are expected to develop Monday evening into early Tuesday.  The worst of the winds should ease by late Tuesday.
    


After Jamaica: Melissa is still expected to be a major hurricane when it roars over eastern Cuba with damaging winds, storm surge and potentially catastrophic flooding rain Tuesday night into early Wednesday. The central and southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos will see their worst impacts during the daytime on Wednesday. Bermuda could be hit by a weakening Melissa Thursday night into early Friday.
    


            Melissa has joined Erin and Humberto from earlier this season as the third hurricane to hit Category 5 strength. Only the 2005 season has had more Category 5 hurricanes with four.
    


            Melissa is forecast to become the first Category 5 landfall in the Atlantic Basin since Dorian roared into the Bahamas in 2019.
    


            There have been 32 Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic since the use of satellites began in 1966, with 13 of those having formed in the past nine years.

A man whose son died during a 2017 fraternity hazing ritual at Penn State University warned students and parents of the ills of the practice in an interview with Fox News Digital, saying anyone could become a victim. 

A New Jersey university's fraternity chapter has been permanently closed after authorities reportedly discovered a student had been critically injured in an alleged hazing incident involving electricity earlier this month.

Rutgers University's Alpha Sigma Phi chapter has had its doors permanently shuttered more than a week after a 19-year-old member was hospitalized in critical condition following an alleged hazing incident, according to the school's website. The Oct. 15 incident reportedly involved the student being electrically shocked and coming into contact with water, NJ.com reported. Authorities were initially called to the home in response to a disconnected 911 call, but upon arrival, discovered the injured and unresponsive student.

"Based on our investigation, hazing did occur and as a result, the fraternity made the decision to close the chapter," Gordy Heminger, a spokesperson for Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity, Inc, said in a statement to NJ.com.

The frat house had a history of code violations, NJ Advance Media reported.

Heminger reportedly added that the Oct. 15 incident involved "underground and unreported new members," and occurred in the basement of the off-campus fraternity house.

"At some point, water became involved," Heminger said. "This was not students just listening to music in the dark as was claimed by an anonymous parent. This was hazing. We are still trying to determine who and how many people were involved, but we believe it will be double digits when all the facts come out."

Heminger also reportedly called on Rutgers to expel any students who were involved in the incident, while vowing that Alpha Sigma Phi will do the same.

"We hope Rutgers will do the same," Heminger reportedly said. "New Jersey has very strong anti-hazing laws and I hope the prosecutor seeks the maximum penalties allowed for those involved."

As of Friday, authorities had not filed any charges stemming from the incident and the injured student was no longer in critical condition, NJ.com reported.

The New Brunswick house also possessed a history of building code violations and officials have since declared the building to be an unsafe structure, according to NJ Advance Media.

FRATERNITY SUSPENDED AFTER POSSIBLE HAZING LEAVES UNIVERSITY STUDENT IN CRITICAL CONDITION: REPORT

A July 2025 inspection revealed numerous "life safety" issues – including multiple electrical hazards – at the property, which is owned by the fraternity's national arm and managed by CLVEN, according to NJ.com.

Immediately following the incident, Rutgers imposed a cease and desist order on the fraternity's activities and placed the chapter on organizational disciplinary probation until May 18 – however, the fraternity has since been shut down in light of the new information obtained by investigators.

In 2021, the state implemented several new and stricter penalties for hazing after 19-year-old Timothy Piazza, a New Jersey resident, died after being forced to drink copious amounts of alcohol while attending Penn State University. Two former college students ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from Piazza's death last year, according to NJ.com.

Alpha Sigma Phi's national organization, Rutgers University and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Hurricane season can be stressful as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives. Here's a few tips on how to prepare and stay safe. (AP video: Mary Conlon; Video production: Laura Bargfeld)

A strengthening Melissa has grown into a Category 4 hurricane and U.S. forecasters say it could reach Category 5 status, unleashing torrential rain and threatening to cause catastrophic flooding in the northern Caribbean, including Haiti and Jamaica.

HOW TO PREPAREHurricane season can be stressful for anyone near the potential path of a storm. Powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks, and otherwise upend lives. But stress can be reduced when people have a plan, emergency management officials say.

KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) — Hurricane Melissa strengthened into a Category 5 storm Monday as it drew closer to Jamaica, where forecasters said it would unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage. It would be the strongest hurricane to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851.

Melissa, blamed for six deaths in the northern Caribbean as it headed toward the island, was on track to make landfall Tuesday in Jamaica before coming ashore in Cuba later in the day and then heading toward the Bahamas. It was not expected to affect the United States.

Hanna Mcleod, a 23-year-old hotel receptionist in the Jamaican capital of Kingston, said she boarded up the windows at her home, where her husband and brother are staying. She stocked up on canned corned beef and mackerel and left candles and flashlights throughout the house.

“I just told them to keep the door closed,” she said. “I am definitely worried. This is actually the first time I'll be experiencing this type of hurricane.”

In an AP interview, National Hurricane Center specialist Larry Kelly says everyone in Jamaica needs to be hunkered down now.

Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, with sustained winds exceeding 157 mph (250 kph). Melissa would be the strongest hurricane in recorded history to directly hit the small Caribbean nation, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.

A storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters) was expected along the coast in Kingston, which Porter said is home to critical infrastructure such as Jamaica's main international airport and power plants.




“This can become a true humanitarian crisis very quickly, and there is likely going to be the need for a lot of international support,” Porter said in a phone interview.




On Monday morning, Melissa was centered about 145 miles (230 kilometers) southwest of Kingston and about 330 miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

The hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph) and was moving west at 3 mph (5 kph), the center said.

Some areas in eastern Jamaica could see up to 40 inches (1 meter) of rain while western Haiti could get 16 inches (40 centimeters), according to the hurricane center. “Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,” it warned.

Mandatory evacuations were ordered in seven flood-prone communities in Jamaica, with buses ferrying people to safe shelter.

But some insisted on staying.

“I hear what they say, but I am not leaving,” said Noel Francis, a 64-year-old fisherman who lives on the beach in the southern town of Old Harbor Bay, where he was born and grew up. “I can manage myself.”

His neighbor, Bruce Dawkins, said he also had no plans to leave his home.

“I am not going anywhere,” Dawkins said, wearing a raincoat and holding a beer in his hand. The fisherman said he had already secured his vessel and planned to ride out the storm with his friend.

Several towns along Jamaica's southern coast already reported power outages as winds intensified throughout the night.

“I don't think the storm will damage my house. My only concern is flooding, because we live near the sea,” said Hyacinth White, 49, who said she had no plans to evacuate to a shelter before the call was disconnected.

The slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. Two people died in Jamaica over the weekend as they cut trees ahead of the storm, according to the country's emergency management office.

“I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. “Do not gamble with Melissa. It's not a safe bet.”

In eastern Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for Haiti.

Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service, warned that cleanup and damage assessment would be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.

A storm of Category 4 or higher has not made landfall in Jamaica in recent history, Thompson said. Hurricane Gilbert was a Category 3 storm when it hit the island in 1988. Hurricanes Ivan and Beryl were both Category 4, but they did not make landfall.

The life-threatening storm surge was expected along Jamaica's southern coast, near and to the east of where Melissa is likely to make landfall, the U.S. center said.

“Don't make foolish decisions,” warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister. “We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.”

The storm already has dropped heavy rain on the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert.

Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across the country and displaced more than 3,760 people. Floodwaters also have cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.

In neighboring Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 15 hectares (37 acres) of maize at a time when at least 5.7 million people, more than half of the country's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger.

“Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season,” the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said.

Melissa was expected to keep dumping heavy rain over parts of Haiti as it moves northeast in the coming days.

A hurricane watch was in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas and for the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms.

Andrew Cuomo slammed Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for claiming he is a "victim" as a Muslim, saying his rival has "been dividing and attacking and offending" different New York groups during his campaign.

With just over a week until Election Day, Zohran Mamdani holds a double-digit lead in the raucous race for the nation's most populous city, but former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is narrowing the gap, according to a new public opinion poll.

Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from the New York City borough of Queens who shocked the political world in June with his convincing win over Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination, stands at 44% support among likely voters in the most recent survey in the race, from Quinnipiac University.

Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple scandals and who is running as an Independent candidate in the general election after losing the primary, had 34% support in the survey.

The survey was conducted Thursday through Sunday, entirely after incumbent Mayor Eric Adams endorsed Cuomo in a bid to defeat Mamdani. The embattled Democratic mayor had been running for re-election as an independent but dropped out of the race late last month, although his name remains on the ballot.

Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee in the Democratic-dominated city, stood at 11% in the poll. The remaining four candidates listed on the ballot grabbed 2% support, with 7% undecided and 2% questioned in the survey refusing to respond.

Mamdani's 10-point advantage over Cuomo is down from his 20-point lead in Suffolk's September poll.

Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted that "Cuomo's biggest gains" were among Hispanic voters and independents.

Cuomo has turned up the volume on his criticisms of Mamdani during the closing stretch of the campaign, with dire warnings that "mayhem" would follow a Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. 

He's also repeatedly spotlighted Mamdani's Muslim faith and criticized his rival for painting himself as a victim because of his faith. Cuomo has argued that Mamdani has offended Jewish New Yorkers and charged that his rival is antisemitic because of his comments opposing the Israeli government and calling its attacks on Palestinians in Gaza a "genocide."

Mamdani, firing back, told reporters recently that "we're speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it's also disgusting."

Meanwhile, Sliwa, a longtime fixture in New York City politics, has been the target of a pressure campaign to drop out of the race to set up a one-on-one matchup between Cuomo and Mamdani, in a frantic effort to avert a Mamdani victory.

Among those urging Sliwa to end his bid is billionaire businessman and conservative radio host John Catsimatidis, a top New York City Republican and ally of President Donald Trump.

Sliwa voters, when given a second choice, preferred Cuomo over Mamdani by 36%–2%, according to the poll.

"There is only one person in New York City whose voters will determine the outcome," Paleologos said. "And that person isn't Mayor Adams, Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, or any New York billionaire. It's Republican Curtis Sliwa and his voters who hold the 11% blocking Cuomo from winning the race. Politics has its ironies."

The Ugandan-born Mamdani, if elected, would become the first Muslim and first Millennial mayor in New York City's history.

Mamdani surged to the Democratic primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. It was fueled by a grassroots army of supporters and backing from top national progressive champions, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering free childcare for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.

Mamdani has been heavily criticized by his rivals not only for his far-left proposals, but also for his criticism of Israel, his past negative comments regarding the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and his proposal to shift certain responsibilities away from the NYPD and focus on social services and community-based programs.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in key districts in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.

In the election widely seen as a referendum on Milei's past two years in office, his upstart La Libertad Avanza party scored over 40% of votes compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.

Milei, a key ideological ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, bolstering the government's support in the legislature enough to uphold presidential vetoes and block impeachment efforts. 

At La Libertad Avanza headquarters late Sunday in downtown Buenos Aires, a beaming Milei hailed the election sweep as a mandate to press forward with his spending cuts and introduce ambitious tax and labor reforms. The results also automatically position him as a candidate for reelection in 2027.

“The Argentine people have decided to leave behind 100 years of decadence,” Milei exulted as his supporters cheered, referring to a succession of Peronist governments that brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei has won decisive victories in key districts across the country in midterm elections.

“Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.”

Perhaps never has an Argentine legislative election generated so much interest in Washington and Wall Street. 

Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks on a good showing for Milei in national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.

“If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,” Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month. 

Those contentious comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms and that the midterm race would be tight. 

To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves to shore up the peso. In an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury then came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the credit line. 

In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.

“For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,” said Marcelo J. García, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. 

“It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023,” Garcia added.

The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the chain saw-wielding outsider inherited in late 2023.

Trump, while on his way to Japan on Monday, posted on Truth Social that Milei was “doing a wonderful job” after his party beat expectations in midterm elections.

“Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,” Trump wrote.

Milei responded to Trump's post, calling him “a great friend” of Argentina and thanking him for “trusting the Argentine people.”

The results showed Milei's young libertarian party gaining support across the country — including in some surprising corners that have long been under the sway of Peronism. 

In the closely watched Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold home to nearly 40% of the electorate, La Libertad Avanza eked out a razor-thin victory Sunday. Just last month, the Peronists beat Milei's party there by a whopping 14 percentage points.

Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Trump for putting his thumb on the scale. 

He warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.

“I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,” he said. “If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.”

With Milei's efforts to deregulate the economy and scrap tariffs winning over Argentina's powerful agriculture sector, La Libertad Avanza also swept Santa Fe, which dominates soybean production and processing, and Córdoba, another powerhouse farming province.

Despite Milei's new momentum, experts caution that the irascible president still needs to court political allies to see through his agenda. Given the limited number of seats up for grabs in this election, it was mathematically impossible for Milei to secure a majority in either house.

“This victory is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain control of Congress,” said political consultant Sergio Berensztein. “The government must build a broad and effective coalition with like-minded forces.”

Seeking to capitalize quickly on Sunday's results, Milei said he called the country's powerful provincial governors to accelerate agreements on long-term economic reform.

Sunday's outcome will also test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although Milei's budget cuts have significantly driven down inflation — from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month — the price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.

The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.

In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.

But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifanía Contreras, 64, said she feels like she's bearing the brunt of the cutbacks.

“You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,” she said, describing how her $200 monthly pension has shriveled in value since Milei cut cost-of-living increases. “The situation is getting worse and worse.” 

Reflecting widespread public resignation, electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's 1983 return to democracy. Voting is compulsory in Argentina.

“I vote out of obligation, nothing more,” said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate. “None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.”

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) has fallen victim to the latest political plague: White House Ballroom Construction Derangement Syndrome.

As I introduced last week, WHBCDS is “the condition predicated on an irrational and overly emotional response to the president renovating an 80-year-old section of the White House to create a luxurious new ballroom, using private contributions to fund the changes.” It's affected prominent politicos on the Left, from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the entire workforce of MSNBC. And now Swalwell is the latest victim.

Swalwell, who, in August, was caught lying about crime rates in Washington, D.C., after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard in the city, revealed his symptoms of WHBCDS on Saturday in a post on social media. He is apparently suffering from a particularly aggressive strain of the mental abnormality, as the far-Left California congressman mandated that any Democrat considering running for president in 2028 must make destroying the ballroom Trump an integral part of their candidacy's platform. 

“Don't even think of seeking the Democratic nomination for president unless you pledge to take a wrecking ball to the Trump Ballroom on DAY ONE,” Swalwell warned on X.

Don't even think of seeking the Democratic nomination for president unless you pledge to take a wrecking ball to the Trump Ballroom on DAY ONE.

A particularly troubling sign about Swalwell's condition was the time of his post. It did not happen during the work day or after a session in Congress. He posted it on a Saturday night, shortly before 11 p.m., indicating an almost obsessive nature about his thoughts, which are currently dominated by Trump's ballroom. After all, most people are either sleeping or enjoying a leisurely social activity at that time, whereas the California Democrat was obsessively dwelling on a possible presidential candidacy three years into the future over a construction project ordered by the president of the United States in the present day.

Furthermore, Swalwell followed up with his post, adding an addendum to his 2028 Democratic candidacy requirements, and did so about 15 hours later, further indicating his obsession with the topic. He offered an alternative to destroying a perfectly fine, recently constructed White House ballroom, suggesting a renaming of it — even though it currently does not have a name — to the Barack Obama Ballroom.

“***Or, as @RubenGallego proposes, rename it the Barack Obama Ballroom,” Swalwell said in his post. “But a Trump monument to corruption will not stand.”

Trump's monument to corruption? It's a ballroom, a venue the government will use to host events at the White House for generations to come. As with Democrats' responses from last week, Swalwell's fanatical tantrums are utterly absurd.

It doesn't take a medical professional to know this is not normal behavior and should raise red flags. Swalwell, along with scores of liberals, Democrats, and others on the Left, is unwell. 

Yet Swalwell's WHBCDS offers insights into the political Left's unhinged obsessions. Their ire goes beyond the games and schenanigans associated with politics. They have demonstrated a complete intolerance for anything that challenges their ideologies or beliefs. And they have a sheer disdain for millions of Americans, approximately half of the country's voting population, solely predicated on their support for the president.

INTRODUCING WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM CONSTRUCTION DERANGEMENT SYNDROME

One would never know it over the chorus of hysterics perpetuated by Democrats, but numerous additions and reconstructions have happened to the White House over the years. Presidents from both parties have authorized changes, additions, subtractions, and other construction projects. Never was there the kind of petulant sulking that Democrats exhibited last week. 

They have shown time and again that they are unhinged. WHBCDS is just the latest example of their mental instability.

            Former President Joe Biden called these “dark days” as he urged Americans to stay optimistic and not to check out in response to what he says are attacks on free speech and tests on the limits of executive power by President Donald Trump.
    


            “Since its founding, America served as a beacon for the most powerful idea ever in government in the history of the world,” Biden said Sunday. “The idea is stronger than any army. We're more powerful than any dictator.”
    


            Biden, 82, was speaking publicly for the first time since completing a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. He addressed an audience in Boston after receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute.
    


            He said America depends on a presidency with limited power, a functioning Congress and an autonomous judiciary. With the federal government facing its second-longest shutdown on record, Trump has used the lapse in funding to exercise new command over the government.
    


            “Friends, I can't sugarcoat any of this. These are dark days,” Biden said. He predicted the country would “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have — stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith.”
    


            Biden listed examples of people who are standing their ground against threats from the current administration, citing federal employees who resign in protest, and universities and comedians that have been targeted by Trump.
    


            “The late-night hosts continue to shine a light on free speech knowing their careers are on the line,” he said.
    


            Biden also shouted out Republican officials who vote against the Trump administration.
    


            “America is not a fairy tale,” he said. “For 250 years, it's been a constant push and pull, an existential struggle between peril and possibility.”
    


            He finished the speech by telling people to “get back up.”
    


            The Democrat left office in January after serving one term in the White House. Biden dropped his bid for reelection after facing pressure following a disastrous debate against Trump and concerns about his age, health and mental fitness. Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump last November.
    


            In May, Biden's post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.
    


Prostate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score. The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Biden's office said his score was 9.
    


            Biden, who will turn 83 in November, completed a course of radiation therapy earlier this month. It is unclear what the former president's next treatment steps might be.
    


            Biden will also headline an event for the Nebraska Democratic Party in Omaha next month.

The warming of the world's oceans caused by climate change helped double Hurricane Melissa's wind speed in less than 24 hours over the weekend, climate scientists said Monday. 

Melissa is currently a Category 5 storm, the highest category, with sustained wind speeds of over 157 mph (252 kph). Melissa is forecast to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. 

Scientists said this is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification of its wind speed and power. 

“That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, in the United Kingdom. “And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.”

Deoras, who has tracked the impact of climate change on weather phenomena for decades, said scientists are seeing storms intensify quickly. 

“Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, an independent group of scientists and communicators.

A 2023 study had found that Atlantic hurricanes are now more than twice as likely as before to intensify rapidly from minor storms to powerful and catastrophic events. The study looked at 830 Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1971. It found that in the last 20 years, 8.1% of storms powered from a Category 1 minor storm to a major hurricane in just 24 hours. That happened only 3.2% of the time from 1971 to 1990, according to a study in the journal Scientific Reports. 

The U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned of “ catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides ” from Melissa in Jamaica, where some areas could receive up to 40 inches (1 meter) of rain. The storm has already killed at least four people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

Climate scientists have long warned that warming oceans — driven by greenhouse gas emissions — are making such explosive storm development more common. “We're living in a warmer world, and that means hurricanes are more likely to intensify quickly, especially near coastlines,” Deoras said. 

Storms intensifying faster near land poses greater risks to lives and infrastructure, said Deoras. “If a hurricane forms deep in the ocean and just dissipates over the ocean, it's fine. It's not going to affect anyone. But if it forms close to the coast, and if it just crosses the coast, as we are going to see in the case of Jamaica and other regions, it's a big problem,” he said.

Deoras added that while hurricanes are natural phenomena, climate change is amplifying their impact. “We can't stop hurricanes, but we can reduce the risk by cutting emissions and improving coastal defenses,” he said. Investment is needed in early warning systems, sea walls and other infrastructure to make communities, especially in island countries, more resilient to climate impacts, he said. 

The world has warmed too much to prevent phenomena like rapid intensification, he said. Various global weather agencies found that last year was the hottest year on record.

The impact of climate change is putting lives at risk on islands and in coastal areas, Placky said. “With 90% of our extra heat going into our oceans, we're seeing these oceans warm and they're rising. And that plays out with sea level rise. So even outside of any storm, the water levels are getting higher. They're creeping away at our coastlines and they're going farther inland,” she said. 

A storm like Melissa only compounds these impacts, according to Placky. “These storms are really ripping away at the coastal infrastructure of these islands,” she said. 

The NOAA predicted a busier-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season this year, with 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine hurricanes and two to five major hurricanes. After a slow start, that's been largely accurate, with 13 storms and four major hurricanes and roughly another month left in the season.

The impact of such storms increases the urgency for global action to reduce the amount of planet-heating gases released into the atmosphere according to policymakers in small island countries. 

At least six people have already died as a result of Melissa in the northern Caribbean and the storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic. When the hurricane makes landfall in Jamaica, it'll likely be the strongest storm to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851.

“All of our small island developing states know all too well the fear and dread those in the hurricane's path are feeling. This trauma should not be anyone's norm,” said Anne Rasmussen, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States at the United Nations climate talks, the next session of which is scheduled to be held in Brazil next month. 

Rasmussen said extreme weather events like Hurricane Melissa only make it more urgent for countries to begin acting more decisively on climate change. “We need urgent action that gets us back on track with a 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit increase, so we can avoid even worse impacts to come,” she said.

            From a distance, Pamukkale looks every bit like a ski resort, with a cascade of brilliant white slopes and a scattering of tourists at the top, seemingly preparing to slalom down into the valley below.
    


            So why isn't it melting away as midsummer temperatures nudge toward 100 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius, and the heat hangs in the shimmering air?
    


            Because this unusual and beautiful wonder, located deep in the sunkissed hills of southwestern Turkey, isn't snow at all. In fact the water it's formed from sometimes spurts out of the ground at boiling point.
    


            And those visitors milling around its upper reaches aren't going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle — and either paddle or soak in some of the planet's most photogenic pools.
    


            Today, Pamukkale's travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink.
    


            But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell.
    


            Today, Pamukkale and the ancient city of Hierapolis, which sprawls across the plateau above the white terraces, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that pulls in busloads of visitors. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but it's worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground.
    


            Enter from the South Gate — tickets cost 30 euros (about $33) — and it's easy to be initially underwhelmed. There's not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey.
    


            In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf carts can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). But it also means that the big reveal, when it comes, is even better.
    


            After 10 minutes of strolling along paved pathways from the gate, the line of trees that marks the edge of the plateau comes into sight. Even if you know what's coming, there's still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed.
    


            Over millennia, the calcite deposited by the thermal water sputtering out of the ground has reshaped this hillside, creating white terraces that give the area its name — Pamukkale means “cotton castle” in Turkish.
    


            These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off-limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by.
    


            “It is pretty, but there's not as much water as I'd expected,” says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. “The view is gorgeous though.”
    


The ancient monastery hanging from the side of a cliff



            There's still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. It's a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties.
    


            To explore the terraces, visitors need to remove their footwear. The rock is uncomfortable and slippery in places, but it doesn't take long to reach the first in the series of pools where toes sink into soft sediment.
    


            The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way farther down, there's every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves.
    


            DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Having already sampled plenty of the country's stunning landscapes, he declares: “I love Pamukkale the best.”
    


            For a more complete spa experience, there's the Antique Pool, about five minutes' walk from the top of the terraces. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo.
    


            Better still, as you near the source of the water, in one corner of the pool, it becomes filled with tiny, fizzing bubbles — it's like swimming in warm Champagne or soda. The water is said to offer relief to skin, cardiovascular and rheumatic complaints. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions.
    


Paradise Bay: The new destination for an A-list getaway



            You can spend hours wandering around the remains of Hierapolis – high spots include the wide 2nd century agora marketplace, the magnificent Roman theater and the tombs of the necropolis.
    


            The size of the site reveals the city's one-time power and popularity (it even rates a namecheck in the Bible alongside another nearby ruined city, Laodicea, which is also worth a visit). Much of Hierapolis' status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface.
    


            While many of the Romans and Greeks who came to the city were undoubtedly here for the warm waters, the place had great religious significance as the site of a Plutonium cave, or entrance to Hell.
    


            Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath.
    


            Today, the Plutonium — located between the Ancient Pool and the Roman theater — is another high point on the tour of Hierapolis, and one of many places in the city worth visiting in the cooler evenings when, after nightfall, some attractions are dramatically illuminated.
    


            While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area.
    


Hagia Sophia: Secrets of the 1,600-year-old megastructure that has survived the collapse of empires



            Ali Durmuş, who runs Pamukkale-based tour company Turkey Magic Travel, says the roping off of much of the travertines and diversion of water since it became a UNESCO World Heritage site has robbed visitors of an experience enjoyed for millennia. He says it puts them off staying longer.
    


            Pammukale's UNESCO listing led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray.
    


            “If they cannot enjoy the water, then they are not staying long. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon,” Durmuş says.
    


            He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground.
    


            About 20 minutes' drive northwest up the surrounding Denizli Basin, the town of Karahayit has spas and heating systems based around the iron-rich red waters that emerge at around 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice.
    


            Farther away, in Buharkent — its name meaning “steam city” — water at boiling point powers what was Turkey's first geothermal power station.
    


            In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, it's always a hot destination.

President Donald Trump slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, saying the leader should be pursuing peace in Ukraine rather than testing missiles.

President Donald Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to recent missile tests, reminding him that the U.S. has a nuclear submarine stationed "right off their shores."

Trump made the comments during a press gaggle aboard Air Force One Monday morning, telling reporters that the U.S. is "not playing games" with Putin.

"Russia said this week that they've tested a new missile that can go more than 8,000 miles. Is that saber-rattling for you? What is that?" a reporter asked.

"I know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores. So, I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles, and they're not playing games with us. We're not playing games with them either," Trump responded.

"We test missiles all the time. But, you know, we do have a submarine, a nuclear submarine. We don't need to go 8,000 miles. And I don't think it's an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way. You ought to get the war ended. A war that should have taken one week is now in its soon fourth year. That's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles," he added.

Trump later teased that he may be considering further sanctions against Russia, telling reporters simply, "You'll find out."

Russia announced the successful test of its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile on Sunday, claiming it has a range of over 8,000 miles and can pierce defense shielding. Putin said Russia is moving to deploy the weapon.

Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin that the missile traveled 8,700 miles and was in the air for about 15 hours when it was tested on October 21.

Trump has been heavily critical of Putin in recent months for his unwillingness to negotiate a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump met face-to-face with the leader in Alaska earlier this year, but no deal has materialized.

The warming of the world's oceans caused by climate change helped double Hurricane Melissa's wind speed in less than 24 hours over the weekend, climate scientists said Monday. 

Melissa is currently a Category 5 storm, the highest category, with sustained wind speeds of over 157 mph (252 kph). Melissa is forecast to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. 

Scientists said this is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification of its wind speed and power. 

“That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, in the United Kingdom. “And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.”

Deoras, who has tracked the impact of climate change on weather phenomena for decades, said scientists are seeing storms intensify quickly. 

“Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, an independent group of scientists and communicators.

A 2023 study had found that Atlantic hurricanes are now more than twice as likely as before to intensify rapidly from minor storms to powerful and catastrophic events. The study looked at 830 Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1971. It found that in the last 20 years, 8.1% of storms powered from a Category 1 minor storm to a major hurricane in just 24 hours. That happened only 3.2% of the time from 1971 to 1990, according to a study in the journal Scientific Reports. 

The U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned of “ catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides ” from Melissa in Jamaica, where some areas could receive up to 40 inches (1 meter) of rain. The storm has already killed at least four people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

Climate scientists have long warned that warming oceans — driven by greenhouse gas emissions — are making such explosive storm development more common. “We're living in a warmer world, and that means hurricanes are more likely to intensify quickly, especially near coastlines,” Deoras said. 

Storms intensifying faster near land poses greater risks to lives and infrastructure, said Deoras. “If a hurricane forms deep in the ocean and just dissipates over the ocean, it's fine. It's not going to affect anyone. But if it forms close to the coast, and if it just crosses the coast, as we are going to see in the case of Jamaica and other regions, it's a big problem,” he said.

Deoras added that while hurricanes are natural phenomena, climate change is amplifying their impact. “We can't stop hurricanes, but we can reduce the risk by cutting emissions and improving coastal defenses,” he said. Investment is needed in early warning systems, sea walls and other infrastructure to make communities, especially in island countries, more resilient to climate impacts, he said. 

The world has warmed too much to prevent phenomena like rapid intensification, he said. Various global weather agencies found that last year was the hottest year on record.

The impact of climate change is putting lives at risk on islands and in coastal areas, Placky said. “With 90% of our extra heat going into our oceans, we're seeing these oceans warm and they're rising. And that plays out with sea level rise. So even outside of any storm, the water levels are getting higher. They're creeping away at our coastlines and they're going farther inland,” she said. 

A storm like Melissa only compounds these impacts, according to Placky. “These storms are really ripping away at the coastal infrastructure of these islands,” she said. 

The NOAA predicted a busier-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season this year, with 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine hurricanes and two to five major hurricanes. After a slow start, that's been largely accurate, with 13 storms and four major hurricanes and roughly another month left in the season.

The impact of such storms increases the urgency for global action to reduce the amount of planet-heating gases released into the atmosphere according to policymakers in small island countries. 

At least six people have already died as a result of Melissa in the northern Caribbean and the storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic. When the hurricane makes landfall in Jamaica, it'll likely be the strongest storm to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851.

“All of our small island developing states know all too well the fear and dread those in the hurricane's path are feeling. This trauma should not be anyone's norm,” said Anne Rasmussen, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States at the United Nations climate talks, the next session of which is scheduled to be held in Brazil next month. 

Rasmussen said extreme weather events like Hurricane Melissa only make it more urgent for countries to begin acting more decisively on climate change. “We need urgent action that gets us back on track with a 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit increase, so we can avoid even worse impacts to come,” she said.

President Donald Trump on Monday again declined to definitively slap down speculation that he would seek a third term in the Oval Office, while pointing to several leading figures in his administration as prime candidates for the 2028 ticket. 

Trump suggested an “unstoppable” ticket could be comprised of Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, echoing thoughts he has floated in the past.

“We have JD, obviously, the vice president, who's great. Marco's great. I'm not sure if anyone would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,” he told reporters on Air Force One en route to Japan. 

Yet, Trump offered a more evasive reply when pressed on former White House adviser Steve Bannon's plan to have the president assume office for the third time, which would present legal challenges given the ramifications of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. 

 “I would love to do it,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of a 2028 presidential bid. 

“I have my best numbers ever. It's very terrible. I have my best numbers,” he continued, amid aggregate polling data compiled by the New York Times showing the president's approval rating at 43%. “I haven't really thought about it. We have some very good people, as you know…But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.”

Bannon, who played a key role in galvanizing Trump's first presidential victory in 2016, told the Economist last week that “at the appropriate time we'll lay out what the plan is, but there's a plan and President Trump will be the president in ‘28.” 

“This is the age of Trump, and we have to get all the squeeze out of the lemon,” Bannon added. “He's a vehicle of divine providence. … He's gonna get a third term. Trump is gonna be president in ‘28 and people ought to just get accommodated with that.”

When questioned on the matter on Monday, Trump demurred, making vague comments similar to multiple other statements he's given in recent months. 

“Am I not ruling it out? You'll have to tell me,” he said. “All I can tell you is that we have a great, a great group of people, which they don't,” he added in reference to the Democratic Party as he went on to slam Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). 

Speaking with reporters on board Air Force One en route to Japan on Monday, President Trump again refused to rule out a bid for a third presidential term, despite the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to being elected twice.Read more: https://t.co/Ya2ePJ8PGo pic.twitter.com/5yReOrVuWg

“They have Jasmine Crockett, a low-IQ person. They have AOC, who is low IQ. You give her an IQ test, have her pass the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed, I took, those are very hard,” Trump added. “Let AOC go against Trump. Let Jasmine go against Trump.”

MAJORITY SAY TRUMP WOULD WIN THIRD TERM IF RULES CHANGED

Trump ruled out another theory that has been floated in which he would run for vice president in 2028, have the president resign to circumvent the 22nd Amendment, and then assume the role of president. 

“I'd be allowed to do that,” Trump said. [But] “I guess I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It's not — it wouldn't be right.”

            Some Trump administration officials, including at the White House, have expressed frustration with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in recent weeks as internal wrangling over who will lead NASA spilled into public view, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Duffy, who also currently serves as NASA's acting administrator, has said privately that he would like to not only hold the space chief title permanently, but also fold NASA into the Department of Transportation, one source told CNN.
    


            Duffy now has competition as Jared Isaacman – the Elon Musk-associate whose nomination for the position was pulled by Trump earlier this year – has re-emerged as a candidate for the top job at NASA.
    


            The abrupt withdrawal of Isaacman left a bad taste in the mouths of many within the White House, who pointed fingers at a top Trump aide for convincing the president that Isaacman's past democratic donations disqualified him as the nominee.
    


            That frustration only grew when the decision appeared to ignite a bitter and messy monthslong feud between Trump and billionaire Musk that dominated the news cycle for weeks.
    


            Isaacman and Trump, however, reopened lines of communication over the summer, and it soon became clear to officials, including Duffy, that Isaacman was back in the mix to lead NASA.
    


            Duffy, who has ruffled feathers within the White House for going directly to Trump, rather than through proper White House channels, suggested to the president that he be part of the hiring process for the NASA administrator role.
    


            Duffy and several of his DOT advisers, interviewed Isaacman on October 13 for the job. Duffy has conducted other interviews as well, however, in the eyes of White House officials, Isaacman has remained the frontrunner.
    


            “(Trump) likes (Duffy). He's not going anywhere,” the official said, while noting the public spectacle over the NASA job has been a headache for some administration officials. Another source said that the president was praising Duffy privately to advisers while traveling in Asia.
    


‘We're not going to wait for one company': NASA chief suggests SpaceX may be booted from moon mission



            Isaacman has courted the president as well, making high-dollar donations and attending fundraisers at the White House as recently as this month, one source said. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the jockeying for the top NASA post.
    


            The internal battle came into the spotlight last week, as Musk got involved, publicly sparring with Duffy about the future of NASA.
    


            “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?” Musk wrote in one social media post on X. “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” he said in another post.
    


            It came after Duffy told CNBC last week that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon's surface, is lagging behind schedule.
    


            Trump was made aware of the attacks on Duffy during his trip to Asia — only commenting that he didn't like Musk going after the transportation secretary.
    


            White House officials said that while the president would eventually name a head of NASA, it wasn't something that he was fixated on, making it unclear when it would ultimately happen.
    


            “Secretary Duffy is a valuable member of President Trump's team and he is doing a tremendous job leading the department of transportation, especially during this difficult time when Democrats have shut down the government and forced air traffic controllers to work without pay,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Transportation for comment.

            For months, the sightings have been murky and long-distance in nature, more worthy of Arctic nature photography than gossip pages. In July, they were seen walking a dog and then dining at a restaurant in Montreal. And then, a confusing silence, as the — were they, even? — new couple retreated into a summer hibernation.
    


            It was not until September that a California whale-watching trip got the biggest nautical sighting of all, when a passenger snapped an entwined romantic duo atop a yacht from a distance.
    


            When enhanced, the photographer recognized former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau by his thorny Indigenous tattoo, though apparently did not recognize the incredibly famous pop star Katy Perry by the fact that they were canoodling on her quite tasteful motor yacht, the 78-foot Caravelle.
    


            They were, it seemed, a something.
    


            It has been a very strange year for both. Trudeau announced he would resign in January, leaving Canada to conduct its ongoing conflict with America without him; he was replaced in April.
    


            That was the same month that Perry resigned the planet, taking a strangely disastrous celebrity trip into the earth's thermosphere. She, Gayle King and the then Bezos-bride-to-be Lauren Sánchez took Bezos' Blue Origin rocket into the very nearest edge of space.
    


            For some difficult-to-define reason, this trip made Perry a laughingstock. Was it the cringe moment of her kissing the ground upon return? Was it the dated all-woman-crew girl-boss vibes of the trip? Was it that they essentially lit a bunch of money on fire for no good purpose, while it felt like the world was already burning? Or were these ill vibes personal to Perry — some nefarious Orlando Bloom-led negative PR campaign? For, we would soon learn, Perry was separating from her fiancé, old Legolas himself.
    


            Whatever the reason, she went overnight from “pop royalty to America's favorite punch line.”



            It has only been her slow defection northward romantically that has kept her brand out of deep crisis. Trudeau has made her the butt of a kinder sort of joke: “Katy Perry Releases New Single About Superiority Of Canadian Manufacturing,” ribbed The Onion. This trade war of the heart is paying dividends.
    


Some say that Americans who pretend to be Canadian abroad aren't fooling anyone. Here's what's giving them away



            They are, now, officially out of the closet, and we know because Pop Crave says so: “Katy Perry & Justin Trudeau are officially dating,” the gossip account of record posted over the weekend.
    


And here she is, triumphantly on the front page of all the best English tabloids. It was her birthday on Saturday. She threw a big party at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris. She and Trudeau not only held hands but also apparently left the party together. They honestly looked great.

TOKYO (AP) — President Donald Trump opened his visit to Japan on Monday with greetings from the emperor a day before he meets new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is banking on building a friendly personal relationship with the U.S. leader to ease trade tensions.

One key to this strategy might lie in an idea floated by Japan's government to buy a fleet of Ford F-150 trucks, a meaningful gesture that may also be impractical given the narrow streets in Tokyo and other Japanese cities.

It's an early diplomatic test for Takaichi, the first woman to lead Japan. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her. 

Trump instantly bought into the idea of Ford trucks as he flew to Asia aboard Air Force One.

“She has good taste,” Trump told reporters. “That's a hot truck.”

Japanese Emperor Naruhito welcome Trump at the Imperial Palace after the president's arrival and the two spoke for about 30 minutes. Trump straightened his jacket as he stood next to Naruhito for photos before sat across a round table, with flowers in the middle, for their talks.

“A great man!” he said twice while pointing to the emperor. Trump last saw the emperor in 2019, soon after Naruhito ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne, becoming the first foreign dignitary invited to the palace.

Trump and Takaichi spoke over the phone while the president was mid-flight on Saturday. Takaichi stressed her status as a protege of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a favorite of Trump's from his first term, and said she praised him for brokering the Gaza ceasefire that led to the return of hostages held by Hamas.

“I thought (Trump) is a very cheerful and fun person,” she said. “He well recognizes me and said he remembers me as a politician whom (former) Prime Minister Abe really cared about,” she said. “And I told the president that I extremely look forward to welcoming him in Tokyo.”

Trump spent Sunday in Malaysia, where he participated in a regional summit, and departed Monday morning for Japan. While on Air Force One on Monday, he said he planned to talk in Tokyo about the “great friendship” between the U.S. and Japan.

Beneath the hospitality is the search for a strategy to navigate the increasingly complex trade relationship that Trump shook up earlier this year with tariffs.

Trump wants allies to buy more American goods and also make financial commitments to build factories and energy infrastructure in the U.S.

The meetings in Japan come before Trump's sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea.

Both the U.S. and Japan have sought to limit China's manufacturing ambitions, as the emergence of Chinese electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and advanced computer chips could undermine the American and Japanese economies.

“In light of the planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping shortly afterward, Trump may also be considering how he might strengthen his hand by demonstrating the robustness of the U.S.-Japan relationship,” said Kristi Govella, Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

Japan's previous administration agreed in September to invest $550 billion in the U.S., which led Trump to trim a threatened 25% tariff on Japanese goods to 15%. But Japan wants the investments to favor Japanese vendors and contractors.

Japan's economy and trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, has said his ministry is compiling a list of projects in computer chips and energy to try to meet the investment target. 

“As far as I know, I'm hearing that there are a number of Japanese companies that are showing interest,” he told reporters Friday, though he did not give further details.

Japanese officials are looking at the possibility of buying more American soybeans, liquefied natural gas and autos. The U.S.-China trade conflict has shut American soybeans out of the Chinese market, leading China to seek more Brazilian supply. China reported no U.S. soybean imports in September, a first since November 2018.

For Trump, the prospect of Ford trucks in the skyscrapered streets of Tokyo would be a win. The administration has long complained that American vehicles were being shut out of a market that is the home of Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Subaru. In a September interview on CNBC, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Japan wouldn't buy U.S.-branded vehicles because “Chevys” were popular with Japanese gangsters.

Takaichi may arrange for Ford F-150 trucks to be showcased in a place Trump gets to see them, Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported. The government is considering importing the trucks for its transport ministry to use for inspecting roads and infrastructure, though there are concerns that the F-150 could cause congestion on narrow Japanese streets.

“We appreciate President Trump's advocating for American made products,” Ford spokesperson Dave Tovar said. “We would be excited to introduce America's best-selling truck to work and government customers in Japan.”

Japanese media have reported that Toyota Motor Corp. Chairman Akio Toyoda could announce plans to import his company's American-made cars back to Japan during a dinner with Trump and other business leaders on Wednesday. 

The gestures — combined with Takaichi's connection to Abe — should help her deal with Trump, who seems predisposed to like her.

“I think she's going to be great,” Trump said aboard Air Force One. “She's a great friend of Mr. Abe, who was a great man.”

In 2016, Abe gave Trump a high-end golf club to celebrate his first election, and the leaders bonded over their love of golf. Trump often expresses sadness about Abe's 2022 assassination. 

But there are risks for Takaichi in emphasizing her ties to Abe, said Rintaro Nishimura, who specializes in Japan at the advisory firm The Asia Group.

“Because it's Takaichi's first diplomatic engagement I think she wants to start with sort of a bang,” Nishimura said. “Succeeding the Abe-line rhetoric is definitely going to be part of this engagement, although some also suggest that leaning too heavily on the Abe line might not exactly be good for her for creating her own kind of portfolio, her status as Japan's leader.”

Following his meeting with Takaichi on Tuesday, Trump will give a speech aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier anchored in Japan, then hold a dinner with business leaders. Trump plans to leave for South Korea on Wednesday.

But aboard Air Force One on Monday, he told reporters that he was also ready to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, should that be an option.

“If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,” Trump said.

President Donald Trump said he does not suspect any foul play in the two separate crashes of U.S. Navy aircraft in the South China sea on Monday.

President Donald Trump says the U.S. does not suspect foul play in the two separate crashes of U.S. Navy aircraft in the South China Sea this weekend.

Trump made the statement during a gaggle with reporters aboard Air Force One, saying he expected to get answers regarding the crashes soon. One possibility he'd been given was that the planes had faulty fuel, the president said.

"You've been briefed on the incident, on the Nimitz, both a fighter jet and a helicopter?" a reporter asked.

"I've heard about it, yeah," Trump responded.

"Do you know what happened there? What was that?" the reporter asked.

"They're going to let me know pretty soon. I think they should be able to find out. It could be bad fuel. I mean, it's possible it's bad fuel. Very unusual that that would happen," Trump said.

"You don't think it was foul play or anything?" the reporter pressed.

"No, I don't," Trump replied. "They think it might be bad fuel."

Two U.S. Navy aircraft from USS Nimitz — a Sea Hawk helicopter and an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet — crashed during separate "routine operations" over the South China Sea on Sunday. All five crew members aboard the two craft were rescued and remain in stable condition, according to the Navy.

The U.S. Pacific Fleet — the Navy's largest operational command — said in a post on X that around 2:54 p.m. local time, an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter assigned to the "Battle Cats" of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 73 crashed in the South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68).

Search-and-rescue teams from Carrier Strike Group 11, operating alongside the Nimitz, quickly launched recovery efforts and safely pulled all three helicopter crew members from the water.

Roughly 30 minutes after the helicopter incident, an F/A-18F Super Hornet from the Nimitz, assigned to the "Fighting Redcocks" of Strike Fighter Squadron 22, also went down in the South China Sea during flight operations.

Search-and-rescue teams again responded swiftly, recovering the jet's two crew members, who had successfully ejected before the aircraft hit the water. Both aviators were transported back to the Nimitz and are reported to be in stable condition.

Attorney Nathan Evershed, who has previously worked with Judge Tony Graf, says the newly appointed judge faces a career-defining challenge as he leads one of Utah's most scrutinized trials.

Two Utah attorneys say newly appointed Judge Tony Graf will bring fairness, experience and steady leadership to the state's most closely watched murder trial, a case one calls "the biggest legal case in Utah history."

Defense attorney Skye Lazaro told Fox News Digital she expects Graf to approach the high-profile proceedings involving Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, with diligence and balance.

"He's very conscientious… very fair," Lazaro said. "I would expect that he's going to take his oath of office very seriously in working through this case."

Graf, a longtime Utah prosecutor before his appointment to the bench, will oversee the capital case against Robinson, accused in the high-profile killing of the Turning Point USA founder. Lazaro, who has known Graf professionally for years, said his background provides valuable experience but doesn't compromise impartiality.

CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION: LEGAL EXPERT UNPACKS DEFENSE CHALLENGES AND WHY EVIDENCE SECRECY COULD BE CRUCIAL

"He does have familiarity with the criminal justice system. I don't think that's going to impact his rulings one way or another," she said. "He'll decide fairly, the best he can, based on what's in front of him."

Attorney Nathan Evershed, who is not connected to the Robinson case but previously worked alongside Graf, told Fox News Digital: "This case is not only big, it literally could be the biggest legal case in Utah history. There's not really been a case like this of such not only national but international significance."

He noted that Graf had "less than two months on the bench" when he was assigned the case, calling the appointment "apparently… randomly allocated."

Evershed, who served with Graf at the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office, described him as "very diligent, very hardworking," someone who "got there early, understood his cases and really cared about doing the right thing."

While Graf lacks judicial experience, Evershed said he brings "years and thousands of hours of courtroom experience" from his time as a prosecutor. "He's gone to trial many times… He was a prosecutor for many, many years," he said.

Evershed called the case a "career-defining moment" not just for Graf but for "literally everyone that's involved in this case."

"It's gonna be something that's gonna be in the news for a long time, especially here in Utah," he said. "I have no doubt that this will go to trial… several weeks long and… highly scrutinized."

WATCH: Attorney says newly appointed judge faces intense spotlight in Charlie Kirk assassination case

Lazaro emphasized that Graf's commitment to judicial balance, between victims' rights and a defendant's constitutional protections, will be critical in a case already saturated with public attention.

"All judges… take their oath very seriously," she said. "Part of that is being unbiased and making rulings based on the facts and the law… I would expect that he's going to do the very best job he can to be impartial and uphold his duty to the office."

Lazaro described Utah County's growing number of death penalty filings as "somewhat unique or unlucky" for a newly appointed judge to face so early in his tenure.

"There's a really steep learning curve going from practicing law to being on the bench," she said. "But that doesn't mean he won't do a good job… this case is going to be under scrutiny for years."

Lazaro noted that capital cases impose intense professional and personal strain, not only on attorneys and court staff but also on the judges who preside over them.

"Death penalty cases are hard… and when you add in media and political pressure — and calls for the death penalty early on — it makes it that much harder," she said. "It takes a toll on everybody involved."

Despite the case's national attention, Lazaro said a change of venue is improbable.

"I wouldn't expect that this case would change venue unless the defense moves for it or there's a conflict," Lazaro said. "You're not gonna get a more favorable jury with a change of venue because it's nationally known… everybody's talking about this case."

While acknowledging the challenges, Lazaro expressed confidence in Graf's capability and fairness.

"Anyone appointed to the bench is deemed competent and experienced enough to handle any type of case," they said. "I wouldn't want to be in his shoes, but I expect he'll do the very best job he can."

Describing Graf's demeanor, Evershed said, "He has a very calming demeanor. I think he has a very strong presence as well. He's someone that doesn't easily back down from his convictions."

He said that will serve Graf well as the case unfolds under intense national attention and likely "years of appellate review."

"This is a death penalty case," Evershed said. "Should the death penalty be enacted, this will be a case that will be highly scrutinized in terms of judicial rulings, orders, reviews, rulings on evidence."

"Your heart just really goes out to him," Evershed added. "You would hope to have at least 10 years of experience on the bench to handle this kind of quagmire. In this case, he had less than two months."

"I believe Judge Graf reflects well on the Utah Judiciary," he said. "He's an experienced lawyer. He is someone that is careful. He is someone that likes to show respect to everybody in the courtroom."

"He's not someone that's gonna prematurely put his thumb on the scale for certain outcomes," Evershed added. "He understands his role… of judicial restraint and making sure that things are handled appropriately."

Evershed said the case will be long and complex, but believes Graf is prepared for the challenge.

"The amount of hearings… the amount of motions that are going to be filed… we can't even calculate that," he said. "It's going to take a long, long road, but eventually we'll get there."

Paul Gigot interviews Bjorn Lomborg

Climate protesters have grown more confrontational in recent years, experts say, including publicly cataloging energy sector leaders and conservatives as "climate criminals," staging disruptive protests outside conservative organizations in the U.S., while climate activists in the U.K. have gone as far as attempting citizen's arrests of water company CEOs. 

"It's been getting worse during the 21st Century, ever since Bush vs. Gore in the year 2000," Heritage Foundation's director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, told Fox News Digital. "Before that, I think that the relations were better and that they've been gradually getting worse. It seems to be worse, worse every year. I would say, and I think partly the year 2000, it's also where there was more access to the internet in general."

Climate activists have increasingly become more confrontational in splashy and often costly acts of protests, including throwing soup at glass protecting the "Mona Lisa" at the Louvre in Paris while protesting food insecurity in 2024, vandalizing Berlin's Brandenburg Gate in 2023 with orange paint while calling on the German government to stop using all fossil fuels by 2030, and a yearslong international campaign that has vandalized and deflated thousands of tires on SUVs since 2021. 

Fox News Digital took a look back at how climate protests have intensified in recent years, most notably in Europe, and how the activism is also playing out on U.S. soil and in the court system. 

SCALISE LEADS GOP FIGHT AT SCOTUS TO STOP 'RADICAL' LEFT'S ‘WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY'

In the U.K. earlier in October, a group of female climate activists were seen surrounding water company CEO Mark Thurston near a train station in London while trying to place him under a citizen's arrest for "charges" of public nuisance related to environmental damage and sewage spills. The women surrounded the CEO of Anglian Water and linked their arms together before he was seen jumping into a cab. 

The attempted citizen's arrest followed another similar incident in the U.K. in March, when climate protesters attempted to place Thames Water's CEO and chief financial officer under citizen's arrest on suspicion of causing a public nuisance over illegal discharge of sewage and other alleged issues, The Guardian reported at the time. 

Confrontational and destructive protests have not played out at the same pace in the U.S. as Europe, but stateside protests also have swelled in recent years. 

"For the past few months, we've had protesters in front of Heritage," Furchtgott-Roth told Fox News Digital about the conservative think tank's office in Washington, D.C.

"We had to hire extra security, and it's not just the front entrance, but it's also the back entrance," she added. "They know all the entrances to our building."

The climate expert and economist explained that the proliferation of internet accessibility since 2000 has sparked climate protesters to become more confrontational, as activists push the limits of what they say online and are better able to coordinate with like-minded individuals. 

The Heritage Foundation's president is also among a lengthy list of individuals identified as "climate criminals" in a public directory of dozens of individuals stretching from Trump administration officials to oil company CEOs. The directory claims those listed "have played historical and present roles in perpetuating climate destruction."

"Certain criminals have been awarded specific titles based on the nature of their crimes. Climate criminals designated as ‘Oilgarchs' are members of Trump's Cabinet or Mega-donors with explicit ties to the fossil fuel industry. Climate criminals designated with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award are actors who have earned a spot in our ‘Hall of Shame' for their role in driving climate destruction over the last couple decades," the climate directory states.

The website states it does not call for violence against those identified, instead championing "nonviolent witness and protest with the goal of promoting legal and voluntary changes in behavior." Fox News Digital reached out to the group for additional comment but did not immediately receive a reply. 

SUPREME COURT MUST FREEZE THE CLIMATE EXTORTION OF OUR ENERGY INDUSTRY

Furchtgott-Roth said Europe's heightened climate protests are more severe than in the U.S., pointing to European censorship overall as an issue. 

"Look at what's happened in Birmingham in the UK, where they're telling supporters of the Israeli football team that they cannot attend the game because they cannot protect. That's a lot worse than what we have here," she said, referring to a ban on Israeli soccer club fans from attending a Europa League game in Birmingham, England, in November over security concerns. 

The economist and climate expert continued that the political climate overall is tenuous, pointing to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO in 2024. 

"I think everyone has to be careful with the CEO of UnitedHealthcare getting killed on the streets of New York, not to mention Charlie Kirk. But I mean the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he's not a known Republican or Democrat, he's just CEO going around his business," she said. "The world has gotten more confrontational, and I think this has real costs in security."

The mounting climate protests come as U.S. energy industry leaders face an onslaught of cases that GOP lawmakers are warning could bankrupt the industry and put the U.S.' national security at risk.

"Every day, hardworking Americans depend on access to affordable and reliable energy," House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a comment provided to Fox News Digital earlier in October. "Despite this, radical environmentalists and local leftist politicians continue to wage war on American energy by going after domestic energy companies in our courtrooms, demanding they meet impossible standards or pay billions in damages. Any regulation of global greenhouse emissions falls squarely within the federal government's jurisdiction." 

Dozens of House lawmakers signed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in October calling for the Supreme Court to end lawsuits originating in Colorado that seek compensation from Exxon and Suncor Energy, arguing it's a federal issue, not a state matter. The lawmakers wrote that the case is one steeped in national security and stability concerns, arguing it could throttle the American energy industry, "if not bankrupt it altogether."

Similar suits have also originated in Massachusetts, New York, Delaware and elsewhere.

President Donald Trump also has railed against climate change as the "greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world" during a UN speech in September. 

"All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong," Trump added. 

The Biden administration frequently championed climate change initiatives, with former President Joe Biden warning that global warming was the "ultimate threat to humanity." For liberal politicians and lawmakers, climate change remains a top priority during the off-season election year and as Washington, D.C., eyes the midterms in 2026.

"I've seen firsthand what the reports made clear: the devastating toll of climate change and its existential threat to all of us.  And it is the ultimate threat to humanity: climate change," Biden said in a 2023 speech addressing the "climate crisis." 

"Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. The impacts we're seeing are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious, and more costly," he added. 

Furchtgott-Roth said American companies are also facing legal challenges from across the Atlantic as European Union directives. 

"The European Union is taking a very strong stance against American companies. So there is now what's called CSDDD, corporate sustainability due diligence directive. Which says that as of 2029, any company that does business in the EU with more than $500 million of revenue, is going to have to abide by net-zero solutions," she explained. "And declare its climate emissions, the climate emissions of its contractors, the climate emissions of its subcontractors, which is practically impossible to do accurately. And if it doesn't do it accurately, there's a fine.

"So it seems like, globally, these groups are trying to take away American sovereignty in the climate issue for goals that are totally unrealistic and ineffective in terms of changing the climate," she continued.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The imposing Shrine of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic church a short drive from the White House, was intended to be a sanctuary for worshippers. Now, its mostly immigrant congregation is steeped in fear.

Church leaders say more than 40 members of their parish have been detained, deported or both since federal law enforcement stepped up their deployment in August.

Many parishioners are too scared to leave home to attend Mass, buy food or seek medical care, as the Trump administration's immigration crackdown targets their communities.

Cardinal Robert McElroy, who leads the Archdiocese of Washington, said the government was using fear to rob immigrants “of any sense of real peace or security.” 

“It really is an instrument of terror,” he told The Associated Press.

Trump's federal law enforcement surge technically ended on Sept. 10. But National Guard troops and federal agents remain in the nation's capital. That includes immigration authorities, who continue to prowl near Sacred Heart, which sits in a vibrant Latino community flanked by two neighborhoods — Columbia Heights and Mt. Pleasant — that have been home to successive waves of immigrants.

The parish was established more than 100 years ago by Irish, Italian and German immigrants. Today, most of its 5,600 members came from El Salvador, but also from Haiti, Brazil and Vietnam.

The immigration raids have upended lives and worship at Sacred Heart. Families grieve for missing loved ones. Attendance at Masses, which are held in several languages, has dropped dramatically, visible in the many empty pews under the domed church's colorful mosaics.




“About half the people are afraid to come,” said the Rev. Emilio Biosca, the church's pastor.

But the church community rejects being reduced to powerless victims. During the crisis, pastors and church volunteers have attended immigration court hearings, covered rent and legal fees, and donated and delivered food to those fearful of leaving home.

“Our role here at the church has changed, also dramatically,” Biosca said. “Because we have so many people who are adversely affected by that situation, we cannot possibly go on as business as usual.”

On a recent day, parishioners dedicated a rosary to the detained and deported church members. They pray daily on Zoom because so many are fearful of stepping outside their homes.

Among them was a woman who hasn't returned to the church since last month, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained her husband while the couple sold fruits and vegetables from a stand that was their main source of income.

They entered the U.S. illegally nearly two decades ago to escape gang violence in El Salvador. They met at Sacred Heart, where they both have been active volunteers, often leading retreats and programs. For years, her husband helped coordinate popular Holy Week processions.

When her husband was detained, the first person the woman called was her pastor. Since then, the church has helped to pay her rent. She is now preparing to move to Boston with family members as her husband faces deportation from a Louisiana detention center.  Barring some unforeseen change that would allow him to stay in the U.S., she plans to move back to El Salvador to be with him.

“It's been a very difficult, bitter month of crying and suffering,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear she could be deported. “Our lives changed from one day to the next. We had so many dreams.”

In her apartment, she clutched rosary beads, surrounded by the cardboard boxes she had been packing with their belongings. On her desk near a makeshift altar of the Virgin Mary, she keeps a prayer card of Pope Leo XIV, who has vowed to “stand with” migrants.

When someone on the Zoom worship read a name from a long list of the detained, she flinched and whispered sadly: “That's my husband.” Above her hung a framed photo of the couple, smiling joyfully on their wedding day at Sacred Heart.

His journey to the church hierarchy — after working odd jobs and obtaining asylum and then U.S. citizenship — has made him an important symbol for the area's Catholic immigrants.

Of the recent ICE detainments, Menjivar said, “That could have been me, you know.”

He recently helped lead a procession in support of migrants and refugees that began at Sacred Heart.

He said the parish feels like home to him. “It holds a very special place not just for me, but for many, many immigrants.”

The Catholic Church staunchly defends the rights of migrants, even as it acknowledges the rights of nations to control their borders. U.S. Catholics depend on foreign-born priests to serve parishes. In the Washington Archdiocese, which includes D.C. and parts of Maryland, more than 40% of parishioners are Latino. 

Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said via email that “DHS law enforcement in Washington, D.C. is targeting the worst of the worst violent criminal aliens.”

Biosca, Sacred Heart's pastor, had thought the Trump administration's immigration enforcement would target violent criminals. But then, he said, they began to go after his congregation.

“It became very unbearable,” he said, adding that the targets seemed like anyone who “just looked Hispanic.”

At the Sacred Heart School, principal Elias Blanco said at least two families withdrew their children because they didn't want to risk being detained while dropping them off.

“There's certainly a lot of fear with our parents,” he said.

Many of the children at the school are U.S. citizens who have parents in the country illegally. In case they are detained, some parents have signed caregiver affidavits, which designate a legal guardian, in hopes their children stay out of foster care.

“It's like a ripple effect,” Blanco said of the immigration detentions. “It might be one person, but that individual is the father of someone, the husband of someone, the brother, and then it impacts the whole family.”

Church leaders have accompanied congregants to immigration court, where, in cities nationwide, masked ICE officers have arrested immigrants as they leave hearings.

The Rev. Carlos Reyes, a Sacred Heart priest originally from El Salvador, attended a hearing with a 20-year-old congregant who recently arrived in the U.S. illegally from Bolivia.

Thanks to support from Reyes and Sacred Heart, she said her hope and her Catholic faith have deepened. 

“It's a refuge for me because it's all I have here, because I don't have anyone,” she said, sobbing after a Sunday Mass. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she has another court hearing soon and fears deportation.

On a recent Saturday, volunteers gathered in the church basement. They formed a circle to pray before they packed bags of donated food.

Then they made deliveries to immigrant congregants who hadn't left their homes in weeks, not even to buy groceries. Some recipients stepped out to thank the volunteers, cautiously looking around for ICE personnel.

“These people are losing their dignity,” said a congregant who helped deliver the food and is a legal U.S. resident. She spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing her U.S. citizenship process could still be disrupted.

“As people of God, we can't just sit and watch,” she said. “We have to do what we can.”

The Justice Department has drawn a red line for Democrats in state and local governments who are threatening to arrest federal immigration officials for enforcing federal law in Democrat-run areas.

Prominent Democratic officials, from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), have threatened to pursue legal action over what they say are abuses by federal immigration officers in their states. But the Justice Department has issued sharp warnings to those who say they plan to interfere with federal operations, telling the officials they could face charges if they attempt to arrest officers.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco in Congress since 1987, and Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-CA) said in a joint statement Wednesday that federal immigration officers could be arrested for violating state laws.

“It is important to note that California law protects communities and prevents federal agents from taking certain actions here that we have witnessed in other states. While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,” their statement said. “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.”

San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins added to discourse from Bay Area officials, as reports swirled that President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard to San Francisco, claiming she would prosecute federal agents who violate state law. Trump ultimately opted not to send the National Guard to the city — for now.

“If the agents cross the bounds of the law, if they do things that we believe are criminal themselves, then I have an obligation as the district attorney to ensure that they're held accountable, too,” Jenkins told the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday.

“If there is excessive use of force, shootings that aren't legally justified, things of that nature, then I have to step in and do my job with respect to them, like I do with anyone else,” she added.

California, a hotbed for illegal immigrants, has attempted to push back on Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement operations by passing state laws taking aim at federal officers, including a ban on law enforcement wearing face coverings to conceal their identities. The Trump administration has not cooperated with the state law, arguing federal law allowing face coverings holds supremacy.

In Illinois, Pritzker signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a state commission to compile information and reports about the Trump administration's federal immigration efforts in Chicago, which could be used for future prosecutions against agents.

“We are going to show the public — here in Chicago, the State of Illinois, across the nation, and around the world — exactly what is going on. We will create a detailed record, and that record will reflect reality,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Once this all ends, I believe there will be people of good faith who will review what the Commission has recorded and will demand answers and accountability.”

So far, no Democrat-run states or cities have attempted to arrest federal immigration officers for state law violations at this time, despite the tough talk by some Democratic officials.

The threats from Democrats have prompted a sharp response from the Justice Department, which has sent a warning that criminal charges could accompany any Democratic attempt to arrest federal immigration officers.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a warning to California officials that if they attempt to arrest federal officers, the DOJ will pursue charges against state officials and urged them to preserve their records related to talks of arresting federal officers.

“The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” Blanche said in the letter. “Numerous federal laws prohibit interfering with and impeding immigration or other law-enforcement operations.” 

The letter was sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and California Attorney General Rob Bonta, along with Pelosi and Jenkins.

“We urge you and other California officials to publicly abandon this apparent criminal conspiracy, to stop threatening law enforcement, and to prioritize the safety of your citizens,” Blanche said. “In the meantime, federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities who have abdicated their duty to protect their constituents.”

Blanche later followed up his letter by warning Pritzker of consequences should he or Illinois officials interfere in federal immigration operations.

“This applies to you too. Federal law. Federal authority. Federal consequences,” Blanche said, tagging Pritzker in the post.

While state officials have attempted to assert their power to arrest federal officers for alleged state crimes, the supremacy clause of the Constitution says firmly that they don't have the power to do so.

“Just because Nancy Pelosi and Brooke Jenkins don't like the fact that this administration is choosing to enforce federal law, that doesn't mean that they can suddenly violate the Constitution and try to arrest or otherwise impede federal officers doing their duty,” John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both Bush administrations, told the Washington Examiner. 

“If they do, the Justice Department is well within its right to arrest and prosecute them for assault and battery upon a federal officer, impeding federal officers or federal functions, obstruction of federal proceedings, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy,” he added.

Shu also pointed out that alleged abuses by federal immigration law enforcement may be raised in court by the alleged victim, not by a state or local prosecutor, under federal statute.

“It's not up to the State of California or any of its municipalities to assert the rights of illegal aliens,” Shu said. “An individual alleged victim of federal officer misbehavior can file a Section 1983 civil rights claim against that officer, and then the court will have to analyze whether the federal officer exceeded his authority and was within his qualified immunity.”

While Illinois's collection of information regarding federal immigration operations is not unlawful, any prosecution using that data in the future would have to come from the Justice Department. Any charges brought, presumably under a future Democratic presidential administration, would have to fall within the statute of limitations, which is five years for most federal crimes.

“There is nothing that prevents the State of Illinois from compiling their own data and then sending it to a future Justice Department to use for prosecuting federal law enforcement officers, but it is the Justice Department, not Illinois, that decides whether to prosecute and handles the prosecution,” Shu said.

TRUMP PREPARES FOR PORTLAND TROOP DEPLOYMENT AS HE AWAITS THREE SEPARATE NATIONAL GUARD COURT DECISIONS

The fiery claims by Democrats and equally sharp response by the Justice Department come as the Trump administration has continued to pursue aggressive immigration enforcement operations nationwide.

In some places, like Los Angeles and Portland, the administration has called in the National Guard to protect federal property and personnel due to unrest around federal immigration operations. The deployments have been slammed by Democratic officials in those states and have been met with lawsuits that are playing in various federal courts.

Dozens of members of a major drug trafficking organization were apprehended and charged in Philadelphia on Friday in what the FBI is calling a “historic” indictment.

The charges come after a multiyear investigation into the Weymouth Street Drug Trafficking Organization, accused of running a dangerous and illicit drug trafficking operation for nearly a decade in the notorious Kensington section of Philadelphia.

The Weymouth Street Drug Trafficking Organization ran “one of the most prolific drug blocks in the city” from January 2016 to October 2025, distributing dangerous narcotics such as cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl, according to the indictment charges. The organization's trafficking activities effectively created an “open-air drug market in which illegal narcotics are sold every day and at all hours,” read a release by the Department of Justice.

Following a raid on Friday, 24 suspected members of the group were arrested, according to reports. Eight people were already in custody, and another remained at large. As a result, 33 people were indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and dozens of related offenses, announced the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

FBI Director Kash Patel touted the successful operation during a press conference announcing the historic indictments on Friday. The indictments came a day after the FBI announced a sports betting crackdown involving NBA players and coaches.

“We have permanently removed a drug trafficking organization out of the streets of Philadelphia, and they're going to stop pouring guns, chemicals, and drugs into our communities,” Patel said. “And our children are safer today.”

The Kensington section of Philadelphia has long been considered one of the worst hubs for illicit drug trafficking in the United States, especially regarding the country's opioid epidemic. The area earned the infamous moniker, “the Walmart of Heroin.” 

Patel explained the damage the organization caused in communities and the products they were accused of trafficking that “poisoned” Philadelphia's neighborhoods.

“Today, even more criminals are off the streets because of the diligent work of the FBI and our partners,” Patel said in a released statement. “Over 30 people have been charged for their alleged role in drug trafficking and dozens of other offenses. These individuals were charged with distributing fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine on one of the most prolific drug blocks in Philadelphia.” 

“They were members of a violent drug trafficking organization and used violence to enforce their territory and sell drugs that poison our city streets and community,” Patel said. The FBI will continue our work to put an end to drug trafficking and violence in our cities.”

Wayne Jacobs, the FBI special agent in charge of the Philadelphia office, commented on the brutality with which the Weymouth Street Drug Trafficking Organization ran its operations, relying on violence and intimidation, reported WPVI, a Philadelphia ABC affiliate.  

“The vast majority of our actions were concentrated right here in Kensington, where this organization devastated the community, fueled violence, and spread fear among residents for nearly a decade,” Jacobs said.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche warned of the consequences to organizations poisoning communities through drug trafficking. He spoke of holding criminals accountable while collaborating with state and local organizations to make the nation's neighborhoods safer.

“Drug traffickers who poison our communities and enforce their territory through violence will face the full force of federal law,” Blanche said. “Working alongside our state and local partners, the Department of Justice will continue to dismantle these criminal networks, hold violent offenders accountable, and restore safety to neighborhoods that have suffered for far too long.”

David Metcalf, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, lauded the efforts of law enforcement and hailed the “precision” of their actions on Friday. 

“And like a precision missile, it has been targeted for maximum impact where it needed to go … the heart of the opioid scourge here in Kensington,” Metcalf said.

“This indictment is, by defendant, the largest federal case of this century prosecuted by our office, and it attacks the very heart of the opioid crisis in the neighborhoods of Kensington,” Metcalf added. “We are committed to returning these neighborhoods to their residents and reclaiming them from drug dealers who profit from the misery of others.”

Dimitri Semenikhin became the face of the Beyond Meat stock rally in the last week, but he's already eyeing other opportunities. 

The retail investor says he's got a new target in ETHZilla Corporation, a digital asset treasury that was previously doing business as biotech firm 180 Life Sciences. 

The stock has surged in the last week, with the gains piling up in recent days following Semenikhin's announcement of his investment in a post on YouTube. The stock was up 24% on Monday, adding to gains after a big rally in Friday's session. 

He told Business Insider that his case for the stock is similar to his thesis for why Beyond Meat shares are undervalued. 

Many companies have pivoted to digital asset treasuries in 2025, seeing it as a quick way to boost share price growth in a booming crypto market.

For some investors, the trend has been concerning, and recent research estimates that retail investors have lost $17 billion chasing the bitcoin treasury trend this year. 

However, Semenikhin is bullish on the entire sector, even as crypto experiences volatility in the final stretch of 2025. He argues that it's the volatility of digital assets that makes crypto treasuries attractive. 

Semenikhin sees ETHZilla as the best play among crypto treasury stocks right now. Like Beyond Meat, it caught his eye because of what he saw as a misunderstood event that negatively impacted share prices.

In the case of ETHZ, the company announced a 1-for-10 reverse stock split on October 15, pushing the already struggling stock down even further. Semenikhin had based his bullish thesis on Beyond Meat stock around the fact that he thought investors had misunderstood the company's attempt to reduce its debt through a convertible note exchange.

Like the note offering, a reverse stock split is typically a sign of a distressed company, as it boosts stock prices by reducing the share count. But Semenikhin argues that it was a more bullish development than investors believed it to be.

He said in his post that he purchased 2% of the company's shares at a 50% discount from their net asset value, unpacking his case for the stock on X.

"ETHZ has 102.3k ETH ($420m) and 560m in cash. This adds up to roughly $62 per share in liquid assets on its balance sheet. [The] business earns 10-12m in net profit per quarter from these."

He said that when investors look at ETHZilla's balance sheet, they are seeing its profits from its time as a biotech company, not a crypto treasury. However, he expects the next earnings report, scheduled for November 13, to be a significant catalyst, as it could reveal that the pivot to ethereum has been profitable.

The big stories in media right now are all about technology and capital — algorithms and balance sheets: What will AI do to the industry? Who is going to own the industry, and where will they get the money to buy it?

But on Monday, we have a reminder that human beings who make things are still at the core of media. And that some of them still have enough power to reshape the industry on their own.

That's the story with Taylor Sheridan, who may be the single most powerful creator in TV and streaming right now. The man who makes "Yellowstone" and "Landman" and a slew of other hit shows for Paramount is reportedly leaving the company, and headed to Comcast's NBCUniversal.

It's pretty hard to overstate how big a deal Sheridan is: He's a one-man hit factory for both Red and Blue America, whose shows mix melodrama, violence, and sex alongside lectures about society losing its way. "Yellowstone" alone has generated a reported $2.9 billion in revenue.

Sheridan's importance wasn't lost on new Paramount owner David Ellison, who signaled internally and publicly that keeping Sheridan was a priority. And given that Ellison has been making a point of spending freely to keep and recruit other franchises — $1.5 billion to stay in business with the "South Park" creators; $7.7 billion to land the UFC; a fortune for The Duffer Brothers, the guys who make "Stranger Things" for Netflix — you'd assume Ellison would do whatever it took to keep Sheridan working for him.

What happened? Puck's Matt Belloni, who broke the news, says Sheridan will get a big pay bump from Comcast. But he would have gotten one from Paramount, too. And while Belloni reports that "money wasn't the big factor here," there isn't a lot of detail about what Comcast was offering — and what Paramount refused to do — in order to make the deal. (I've asked both companies for comment.)

So this one is a real head-scratcher, especially for someone like Ellison, who very much understands the value of a single megastar. Prior to acquiring Paramount, Ellison's biggest success in Hollywood was attaching himself to Tom Cruise, which allowed Ellison to produce multiple "Mission Impossible" hits, as well as Cruise's hugely successful "Top Gun" reboot in 2022. Ellison knows better than most that Hollywood fortunes rise and fall based on who you're in business with.

Still, there is life after a megastar. Ask Warner Bros., which lost director Christopher Nolan after Jason Kilar's 2020 HBO Max experiment — the "everything streams" pivot that enraged some talent and drove Nolan to Comcast, where he made "Oppenheimer." That one generated a ton of Oscars, nearly $1 billion in ticket sales, and cemented Nolan as one of the very few directors who can bring audiences to theaters.

But Warner has thrived without him. The studio's on a surprising hot streak, powered by filmmakers who aren't Nolan. You can survive the loss of a star creator. But it's better when you have one.

The U.S. has formed a $1 billion partnership with Advanced Micro Devices to construct two supercomputers that will tackle large scientific problems ranging from nuclear power to cancer treatments to national security, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and AMD CEO Lisa Su told Reuters.

The U.S. is building the two machines to ensure the country has enough supercomputers to run increasingly complex experiments that require harnessing enormous amounts of data-crunching capability. The machines can accelerate the process of making scientific discoveries in areas the U.S. is focused on. 

Energy Secretary Wright said the systems would "supercharge" advances in nuclear power and fusion energy, technologies for defense and national security, and the development of drugs.    Scientists and companies are trying to replicate fusion, the reaction that fuels the sun, by jamming light atoms in a plasma gas under intense heat and pressure to release massive amounts of energy.

"We've made great progress, but plasmas are unstable, and we need to recreate the center of the sun on Earth," Wright told Reuters. 

"We're going to get just massively faster progress using the computation from these AI systems that I believe will have practical pathways to harness fusion energy in the next two or three years."     

Wright said the supercomputers would also help manage the U.S. arsenal of nuclear weapons and accelerate drug discovery by simulating ways to treat cancer down to the molecular level.

"My hope is in the next five or eight years, we will turn most cancers, many of which today are ultimate death sentences, into manageable conditions," Wright said. 

The plans call for the first computer called Lux to be constructed and come online within the next six months. It will be based around AMD's MI355X artificial intelligence chips, and the design will also include central processors (CPUs) and networking chips made by AMD. The system is co-developed by AMD, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

AMD's Su said the Lux deployment was the fastest deployment of this size of computer that she has seen. 

"This is the speed and agility that we wanted to [do] this for the U.S. AI efforts," Su said.

ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer said the Lux supercomputer will deliver about three times the AI capacity of current supercomputers. 

The second, more advanced computer called Discovery will be based around AMD's MI430 series of AI chips that are tuned for high-performance computing. This system will be designed by ORNL, HPE and AMD. Discovery is expected to be delivered in 2028 and be ready for operations in 2029. 

Streiffer said he expected enormous gains but couldn't predict how much greater computational capability it would have.

The MI430 is a special variant of its MI400 series that combines important features of traditional supercomputing chips along with the features to run AI applications, Su said.

The Department of Energy will host the computers, the companies will provide the machines and capital spending, and both sides will share the computing power, a DOE official said.

The two supercomputers based on AMD chips are intended to be the first of many of these types of partnerships with private industry and DOE labs across the country, the official said.

The U.S. has formed a $1 billion partnership with Advanced Micro Devices to construct two supercomputers that will tackle large scientific problems ranging from nuclear power to cancer treatments to national security, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and AMD CEO Lisa Su told Reuters.

The U.S. is building the two machines to ensure the country has enough supercomputers to run increasingly complex experiments that require harnessing enormous amounts of data-crunching capability. The machines can accelerate the process of making scientific discoveries in areas the U.S. is focused on. 

Energy Secretary Wright said the systems would "supercharge" advances in nuclear power and fusion energy, technologies for defense and national security, and the development of drugs.    Scientists and companies are trying to replicate fusion, the reaction that fuels the sun, by jamming light atoms in a plasma gas under intense heat and pressure to release massive amounts of energy.

"We've made great progress, but plasmas are unstable, and we need to recreate the center of the sun on Earth," Wright told Reuters. 

"We're going to get just massively faster progress using the computation from these AI systems that I believe will have practical pathways to harness fusion energy in the next two or three years."     

Wright said the supercomputers would also help manage the U.S. arsenal of nuclear weapons and accelerate drug discovery by simulating ways to treat cancer down to the molecular level.

"My hope is in the next five or eight years, we will turn most cancers, many of which today are ultimate death sentences, into manageable conditions," Wright said. 

The plans call for the first computer called Lux to be constructed and come online within the next six months. It will be based around AMD's MI355X artificial intelligence chips, and the design will also include central processors (CPUs) and networking chips made by AMD. The system is co-developed by AMD, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

AMD's Su said the Lux deployment was the fastest deployment of this size of computer that she has seen. 

"This is the speed and agility that we wanted to [do] this for the U.S. AI efforts," Su said.

ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer said the Lux supercomputer will deliver about three times the AI capacity of current supercomputers. 

The second, more advanced computer called Discovery will be based around AMD's MI430 series of AI chips that are tuned for high-performance computing. This system will be designed by ORNL, HPE and AMD. Discovery is expected to be delivered in 2028 and be ready for operations in 2029. 

Streiffer said he expected enormous gains but couldn't predict how much greater computational capability it would have.

The MI430 is a special variant of its MI400 series that combines important features of traditional supercomputing chips along with the features to run AI applications, Su said.

The Department of Energy will host the computers, the companies will provide the machines and capital spending, and both sides will share the computing power, a DOE official said.

The two supercomputers based on AMD chips are intended to be the first of many of these types of partnerships with private industry and DOE labs across the country, the official said.

Millions of borrowers once again have access to student loan forgiveness, but they may need to take action to ensure they qualify.

The U.S. Department of Education will resume cancelling the debt of eligible borrowers enrolled in the Income Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay as You Earn plan, or PAYE, according to an agreement reached by the American Federation of Teachers and the Trump administration.

Earlier this year, the department had stopped cancelling the debt of borrowers in those two plans, citing a court order. 

Loan cancellation opportunities have become rarer under the Trump administration. While President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. Department of Education made regular announcements that it was wiping away hundreds of thousands of borrowers' debts.

More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. 

Some 2.5 million borrowers are enrolled in either ICR or PAYE, according to an estimate by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The agreement may allow more of those borrowers to qualify for forgiveness. But it's a limited window.

President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" will phase out ICR and PAYE as of July 1, 2028. The Education Department has agreed to resume the relief only while ICR and PAYE remain in effect.

Here's what borrowers need to know about the resumed loan forgiveness under ICR and PAYE.

Both ICR and PAYE are income-driven repayment plans, meaning they cap a borrower's bills at a share of their discretionary income and lead to loan forgiveness after a certain period; ICR after 25 years and PAYE after 20 years.

Borrowers have had access to debt cancellation under ICR since 1994 and under PAYE since 2012.

Student loan borrowers also have access to forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR.

When the Education Department curtailed forgiveness under ICR and PAYE earlier this year, officials said they were responding to a February court order that blocked a Biden administration-era repayment plan, known as the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, or SAVE. The officials said that the ruling had implications for other repayment plans, although ICR and PAYE have both been available for over a decade.

Consumer advocates and the American Federation of Teachers, a union representing some 1.8 million members, disagreed with the administration's interpretation of the ruling and said the agency was required to offer debt forgiveness under the well-established programs. In its March lawsuit, the AFT accused Trump officials of blocking borrowers from the relief programs mandated in their loan terms.

Before the AFT and Education Department reached their agreement, student loan borrowers who had accumulated enough credit to get forgiveness under ICR or PAYE would have needed to transfer to IBR to get their loans discharged, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

"Now, they don't have to do that," Nierman said. "They can remain in these plans and realize forgiveness."

Borrowers who want to cancel a submitted request to switch into IBR can try calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID, Kantrowitz said. You might also try contacting your student loan servicer to cancel your request.

Once PAYE and ICR are phased out, borrowers in those plans who haven't yet become eligible for debt erasure will need to switch to a repayment plan that still offers loan cancellation. The payments made under PAYE and ICR will count on the borrower's timeline to the relief, Nierman said.

Borrowers should keep records of the payments they have made, to make sure they don't lose any qualifying months.

One important point to note: Continued access to IBR will be available only to those who borrow before July 1, 2026. Loans taken out after that date will void eligibility for IBR.

Due to recent legislation, borrowers after that date will be able to enroll in only a new income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan," or RAP, or a revised Standard Plan.

In this article

Qualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors.

The stock soared 15% following the news.

The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers.

Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.

Qualcomm is matching Nvidia and AMD, which offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.

Qualcomm's data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm's smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs.

"We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level," Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week.

The entry of Qualcomm into the data center world marks new competition in the fastest-growing market in technology: equipment for new AI-focused server farms.

Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate.

The industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. Nvidia's chips were used to train OpenAI's GPTs, the large language models used in ChatGPT.

But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services.

Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data.

The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks.

Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm's data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU.

"What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, 'I'm going to mix and match,'" Malladi said.

The company declined to comment, the price of the chips, cards or rack, and how many NPUs could be installed in a single rack. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm's customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power.

Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD.

Tesla's board is warning shareholders they risk losing Elon Musk as CEO if they don't pass his $1 trillion pay package.

In a letter to shareholders sent on Monday, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said that Tesla was at a "critical inflection point," adding that failing to pass the compensation package could lead to Musk stepping away and Tesla losing "significant value."

"The fundamental question for shareholders at this year's Annual Meeting is simple: Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?" wrote Denholm.

The proposed pay package, which is set to be put to a shareholder vote at Tesla's annual meeting next week, was unveiled last month after Musk's previous compensation plan was struck down by a Delaware judge.

To unlock the full payout, which could be worth as much as $1 trillion over the next decade, Musk needs to hit a series of ambitious milestones, including shipping 1 million Optimus robots and increasing Tesla's market capitalization to $8.5 trillion by 2035.

The compensation plan has faced pushback. Proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis both recently issued guidance advising shareholders to vote against the package, prompting Musk to criticize them as "corporate terrorists" during Tesla's earnings call last week.

"I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis," Musk said.

In the letter to shareholders, Denholm said that Musk may "give up his executive position" if Tesla fails to adequately compensate him, adding that this could cause Tesla to lose value as a "transformative force" in the fields of AI and robotics.

"While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential," Denholm wrote.

The compensation plan would also see Musk's stake in Tesla rise from 13% to nearly 29%.

Musk has frequently said he wants more control over Tesla as the company expands its Optimus humanoid robotics program, and Denholm told CNBC in a Monday interview that growing his stake was the Tesla CEO's primary concern.

"He's been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote at Tesla in the future so that bad things can't happen with the AI. So it's less about compensation and more about the voting influence," she said.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

President Donald Trump's administration zeroed in on his tariff policies over the weekend. After pausing trade talks with Canada last week, Trump headed to Asia for a summit with world leaders and announced trade agreements with Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam.

Here's the latest:

The artificial intelligence boom is keeping spirits high on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. But on Main Street, it's a different story.

As CNBC's Ashley Capoot reports, small businesses are grappling with tariff-related cost hikes and concerns around the health of the consumer. Capital expenditures related to AI are outperforming the U.S. consumer as a driver of economic expansion, according to JPMorgan data. 

OpenAI in particular has been a major player in AI-related spending, which will make it a hot topic during Big Tech earnings reports this week.

Novartis announced yesterday it will buy Avidity Biosciences. The Swiss pharmaceutical firm said it would shell out around $12 billion in cash for the biotechnology company.

The deal is slated to close in the first half of next year after Avidity spins out some of its business. Novartis' purchase comes as it bulks up its research and development division.

Avidity investors will be paid $72 per share — a 46% upside compared to where the stock finished last week.

By many metrics, American Airlines is trailing its rivals. The Texas-based carrier's profit is a fraction of the total market and its stock is underperforming this year.

Now, the question is whether American's investments in cabin upgrades and technology can right its course. Shareholders seemed to like what they heard when the company reported earnings last week. American's shares rallied more than 16% after the airline beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations, but the stock is still down more than 20% on the year.

Yum! Brands' Taco Bell wants to be known for more than just the Baja Blast when it comes to drinks.

Taco Bell has been opening Live Más Cafés inside its restaurants, serving beverages such as frozen coffee and energy drinks. The Mexican chain expects to have 30 Live Más Cafés up and running in California and Texas by the end of the year.

As CNBC's Amelia Lucas notes, the new format is part of Taco Bell's goal of creating a $5 billion drink business by 2030.

Shareholders must vote to pay Tesla CEO Elon Musk almost $1 trillion, or he might not stay, Board Chair Robyn Denholm warned in a letter Monday.

"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become," Denholm wrote ahead of Tesla's annual meeting on Nov. 6.

The shareholder vote for Musk's pay and other proposals closes at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.

Musk is key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being "just another car company," with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus, Denholm argued.

Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with Institutional Shareholder Services, the biggest proxy advisory firm in the world, recommending against its "astronomical" value.

Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk's embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.

Musk lashed out at proxy firms as "corporate terrorists" on a post-earnings call with analysts last week.

Denholm told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday that the company is at an "important inflection point" with artificial intelligence at the forefront.

"The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant," she said.

Tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.

The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.

The first tranche milestone is a market capitalization of $2 trillion. The company is currently worth about $1.5 trillion.

The next nine tranches are awarded as the market cap increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. The last two tranches bump the increment to $1 trillion, putting a $8.5 trillion market capitalization as the last tranche.

Product goals tied to the pay package:

There are also a series of adjusted EBITDA milestones, beginning at $50 billion and moving up to $400 billion.

The package would give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla's earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.

"If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?" Musk said to analysts. "I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence."

The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

"He's been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can't happen with the AI," Denholm told CNBC. "So it's less about compensation and more about the voting influence."

Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla's shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote.

She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.

On Musk's pay package and shareholder value:

"What we have done in the plan is we've bifurcated the voting rights versus the economic value. He doesn't get those economic value till at least year seven and a half, even if he delivers them in the first five years. And so that's one of the features of this plan. ... Firstly, shareholders get their return much earlier than Elon would if he delivers against the plan. And secondly, it really does make sure that the economic value is an incentive for him to stay at the company and continue to deliver for quite some time in the future."

On the upcoming Roadster:

"It's on the roadmap."

On autonomous driving and AI in vehicles:

"Leaning into FSD and actually AI in the vehicles has actually been the focus over this last period of time. The integration of that with a really purpose built vehicle for autonomy is actually really important, which is why you see the cyber cabs and, again, the vehicles that we have on the road today. Great vehicles using full self driving as well."

On vote for Tesla to take a minority stake in xAI:

"It is a shareholder proposal, and what that means is that the company didn't put the proposal on the proxy. It was actually submitted by shareholders. We received a number of them, and actually this was the most common proposal around xAI to take a minority stake, or at least vote on that."

On Optimus robots:

"So I've been in the lab with Optimus. He can fold laundry. He can wipe the table down really well, where he can hand things to you, you can actually shake hands with him. The tactile nature of his hand is actually really very good. ... He's very mobile and very dexterous. He's walking around the offices in Palo Alto all the time."

Russia's testing of an "invincible" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially "unlimited range" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.

Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.

It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.

President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.

"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.

He also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.

"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles," Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.

"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either," Trump added. "We test missiles all the time."

The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that "Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place," Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.

"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security," Peskov added.

The timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.

Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.

During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was "not the limit," Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.

Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.

Putin told military officials that such missiles were "unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world," in comments translated by AP.

Russia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's "nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states." He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons "on combat alert."

On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an "overwhelming" response.

Relations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to "have a wasted meeting."

Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because "every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere."

The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and "fake news" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.

Huntington Bancshares agreed to buy smaller rival Cadence Bank in an all-stock deal valued at $7.4 billion on Monday, underscoring a broader push by regional lenders to grow their footprint and compete with larger banks.

Dealmaking has gathered pace under the Trump administration, which has pledged to simplify and speed up merger approvals, while analysts say the highly fragmented U.S. banking system leaves ample room for consolidation.

Regional lenders are also pursuing mergers to diversify revenue, strengthen balance sheets and expand in faster-growing markets as they strive to compete with larger rivals.

The Cadence deal, valued at $39.77 per share, will create a top-ten bank with assets of $276 billion and deposits of $220 billion, Huntington said. The combined bank will have $184 billion in loans and leases.

Huntington said it will issue 2.475 shares for each outstanding share of Cadence common stock.

Cadence shares were last up about 2% before the bell on the news, paring some gains. Huntington shares fell 4%.

"This partnership will extend the reach of our full franchise to 21 states - stretching from the Midwest to the South to Texas - and into new, high-growth markets for which we have a powerful playbook," Huntington CEO Steve Steinour said.

The bank raised its medium-term performance targets, citing expense synergies and enhanced earnings potential from the deal, and now expects return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 18% to 19%, up from its previous target of 16% to 17%.

ROTCE is a key measure of how effectively a bank is using its core capital to grow profits for its shareholders.

The deal will see Huntington expand to 21 states in the U.S. with a foothold in high-growth markets, including Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin.

"Huntington has been on the path to expanding in Texas and the Southeast and we believe this acquisition fits nicely into that expansion strategy," analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note.

Earlier this month, rival Fifth Third agreed to buy regional lender Comerica in the year's largest bank deal so far, valued at $10.9 billion.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Evercore and BofA Securities served as financial advisors to Huntington, while Keefe, Bruyette & Woods advised Cadence on the deal.

Zohran Mamdani has said billionaires shouldn't exist. Some of them are spending big in an effort to stop him from becoming mayor of New York City.

After failing to defeat the Democratic socialist state assemblyman's campaign during the June primary, several big-name billionaires have continued to pour money into outside groups aimed at stopping Mamdani and boosting his main rival, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Those groups include Fix the City, a pro-Cuomo group that's raised $7.3 million since the primary, along with Defend NYC, an anti-Mamdani group that's raised almost $2.5 million.

Polling has shown Mamdani leading Cuomo, along with the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, dropped his third-party bid in September and endorsed Cuomo on Thursday.

Despite Mamdani's outreach to the business community, many of the city's business titans have remained supportive of Cuomo and spoken out against many of Mamdani's progressive policies.

Here are the billionaires who've spent more than $100,000 in the mayoral race since the June primary.

Joe Gebbia, a cofounder of Airbnb, has spent a total of $2 million on the race, including $1 million apiece to Fix the City and Defend NYC.

Gebbia is currently serving as the Chief Design Officer of the United States under President Donald Trump.

He has repeatedly signaled his opposition to Mamdani on X, writing in one recent post that Sliwa could be a "hero" by dropping out of the race and giving Cuomo an easier shot at beating Mamdani.

Gebbia is worth $7.9 billion, according to Forbes.

Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, has poured $1.25 million into the race since June, including $1 million to Defend NYC and $250,000 to Fix the City. That's on top of the $500,000 he gave to Fix the City before the primary.

Ackman has been a vocal opponent of Mamdani, and like Gebbia, has publicly encouraged Sliwa to drop out of the race.

Mamdani has singled out Ackman on the stump, naming him as among the billionaires who are opposed to his candidacy. He has also mocked the hedge fund manager for his "1000-word tweets."

Ackman is worth $9.2 billion, according to Forbes.

Ronald Lauder, whose parents founded the Estée Lauder Companies, gave $750,000 to Fix the City in September.

Lauder, a Republican, has long been a financial supporter of Cuomo. He is the president of the World Jewish Congress.

Mamdani has publicly named Lauder, along with Ackman, when decrying the influence of billionaires.

"Billionaires like Bill Ackman and Ronald Lauder have poured millions of dollars into this race because they say that we pose an existential threat," Mamdani said at a rally last week. "And I am here to admit something. They are right. We are an existential threat to billionaires who think their money can buy our democracy."

Lauder is worth $4.9 billion, according to Forbes.

William Lauder, the chairman of the board of the Estée Lauder Companies and the nephew of Ronald Lauder, has given $500,000 to Fix the City since June.

That's in addition to the $500,000 he gave to the group before the primary.

Lauder is worth $1.7 billion, according to Forbes.

Steve Wynn, a casino mogul and real estate developer, gave $500,000 to Fix the City in October.

Wynn is a longtime GOP mega-donor and the one-time financial chair of the Republican National Committee. He is worth $3.9 billion, according to Forbes.

Daniel Loeb, the founder and CEO of New York-based firm Third Point, has given a total of $350,000 since the primary — $100,000 to Defend NYC and $250,000 to Fix the City.

Loeb also gave $250,000 to Fix the City before the primary. He is worth $3.8 billion, according to Forbes.

Alice Walton, a billionaire philanthropist and a member of the family that founded Walmart, gave $100,000 to Fix the City in August. She previously gave $100,000 to that same group in April, before the primary.

Walton is worth $115.5 billion, according to Forbes.

Laurie Tisch, a billionaire philanthropist, gave $100,000 to Fix the City in October.

She is a member of the Tisch family, whose wealth comes from the Loews Corporation.

Tisch also gave $50,000 to Fix the City before the primary. Other members of the Tisch family have given to the group, totaling over $1.3 million for the year.

Laurie Tisch is worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. The family as a whole is worth an estimated $10.1 billion.

Global markets rallied at the start of the week as investors were buoyed by growing optimism that the U.S. and China are nearing an agreement on trade.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 preliminarily closed Monday's trading session 0.2% higher, which followed earlier solid gains across Asian markets, with Japan's Nikkei 225 breaching the 50,000 mark for the first time to close up 2.46% and South Korea's Kospi rising 2.57% on the day.

Most major European bourses were positive, with the FTSE 100 up nearly 0.1%, as Spain's Ibex 35 Index gained 0.87%, hitting a new 52-week high and beating its historic record as it reached 16,000.20.

U.S. stocks also received a shot in the arm, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 0.5% as of 4:45 p.m. in London (12:45 p.m. in New York), the S&P 500 rising close to 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite advancing 1.6%. The three indexes reached new record highs through the session.

While more than half of Europe's sectors were negative Monday morning, industrials, technology and mining stocks — three industries often seen as particularly sensitive to global trade tensions — were among the biggest gainers. The Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index led the way before paring some gains, closing the day up 1.1%, as the Stoxx 600 Industrial Goods & Services index added almost 0.3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 Basic Resources made gains through the session but fell below the flatline by the closing bell.

Rupert Thompson, chief economist at IBOSS, said the latest trade news was the main driver for Monday's global rally, adding that it further strengthens the prospects for a longer-lasting truce that will defuse tariff hostilities.

"It certainly kicks out into the long grass a sort of big flare-up of trade tensions again," Thompson told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."  "Almost certainly, if this does go ahead, it means the trade truce will continue, possibly for longer than a sort of three-month period, which had been the norm so far."

He added: "Certainly, it means that…. the favorable tailwinds behind the markets at the moment have got another leg to them."

But Thompson also sounded a note of caution. He warned that underlying geostrategic tensions between the two nations remain in place, and noted that the president's plans for 10% tariffs on Canada — which Thompson said came "out of the blue" — demonstrates that Trump remains "fairly fickle" on trade matters.

Christian Mueller-Glissmann, head of asset allocation research at Goldman Sachs, pinpointed broader factors at play when it comes to a potential pick-up in growth.

"I'm not sure that this agreement in particular will get things going, but the baseline assumption for next year is things will look a bit more reflationary," Mueller-Glissmann told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" Monday.

He said the bank is "modestly pro-risk," looking for upside convexity and avoiding speculative trades, adding that the current market environment is built around structural optimism partly fueled by greater liquidity. He said that "trapped" liquidity could boost the potential for a late-cycle acceleration, but warned that risks also remain.

Shares of several U.S.-listed rare earth miners fell sharply on Monday as U.S. officials said they expect China to delay introducing export controls on critical minerals as part of a broader trade deal.

Critical Metals fell more than 17% in early deals, USA Rare Earth declined 12%, MP Materials was down 7.3% and Trilogy Metals lost 15%. Energy Fuels and NioCorp Developments, meanwhile, traded 14.7% and 9.5% lower, respectively.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News' "Meet The Press" on Sunday that Washington and Beijing were expected to reach a deal to avoid a new 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods, with Beijing set to defer on imposing strict rare earth export controls.

His comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday.

Trump on Monday said that the U.S. and China were set to "come away with" a trade deal. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan amid a weeklong Asia trip, Trump said that he had "a lot of respect for President Xi."

The U.S. president had previously threatened to impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China starting from Nov. 1, adding at the time that the White House would also slap export controls on "any and all critical software."

China, for its part, announced a new framework earlier this month for restricting rare earth exports. The move was seen as a stark warning to the West — and a reflection of the deepening mistrust between Beijing and Washington.

To be sure, China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.

"Details are still limited, and nothing will be finalized until the Trump-Xi meeting," Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 26 note.

"But a renewed truce now seems near-certain, with China likely fully delaying their rare earth export controls for a year—better than the alternative of an agreement to grant licenses," Marcus said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that Washington and Beijing were poised to "come away with" a trade deal ahead of his expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan from Malaysia, Trump added that he could sign a final deal on TikTok as early as Thursday.

"I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal," Trump said.

He began his whirlwind weeklong Asia trip on Sunday with a flurry of trade deals and a peace agreement aimed at strengthening his position before meeting Xi.

During his first stop in Malaysia, Trump signed separate trade and mineral agreements with his Malaysian and Cambodian counterparts, as well as frameworks for trade pacts with Thailand and Vietnam.

The four countries, part of an 11-member regional bloc called the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pledged to remove trade barriers, provide preferential market access to U.S. goods, and increase purchases of American agricultural, energy products, and aircraft.

They also agreed to cooperate with Washington on export controls, sanctions and access to critical minerals — commitments that appear to strengthen Trump's standing in a region where Beijing has a growing clout.

Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute, said that the agreements focused on "cooperation rather than hard commitments," with many important points "considerably shorter" than prior U.S. trade agreements.

"The U.S. can impose tariffs or terminate the agreement if it considers Malaysia in violation of commitments," Cutler added.

In Japan, Trump is expected to meet Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and the emperor before flying to South Korea, capping the trip with a  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who also flew in to Malaysia for the 28th China-ASEAN Summit, stopped by Singapore, where he witnessed the signing of eight agreements covering trade and the digital economy.

While the diplomatic momentum appeared strong, few details were released about the scope of the new trade frameworks.

Under the agreements, Washington will keep a 19% tariff rate on most exports from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, while some products will face no duties, according to joint statements from the White House.

Tariffs on Vietnam will remain at 20% with some goods eligible for duty-free access, according to the joint statement. Vietnam, which recorded a trade surplus of $123 billion with the U.S. last year, also pledged to step up purchases of American products to address the trade imbalance.

Malaysia agreed not to impose bans or quotas on U.S.-bound exports of critical minerals and to speed up development of its rare-earth projects needed by American companies.

The country, which sits on an estimated 16.1 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has enforced a nationwide moratorium on the export of unprocessed rare earth materials since last year to develop its downstream industries and prevent resource exploitation.

Thailand will ease tariff barriers on U.S. goods by accepting some American-made vehicles, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and by importing ethanol for fuel. It also pledged to relax foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. investors in the telecommunications sector.

The agreements left open the possibility of additional product exemptions to be decided later, said Michael Wan, economist at MUFG Bank. He noted that sectoral tariffs on pharmaceuticals and electronics would remain key, as would questions over the legality of Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose them.

Aside from trade agreements, Trump announced the formalization of an extended truce between Thailand and Cambodia, building on a ceasefire that he brokered in July following their violent border clashes this summer.

Trump, who has cast himself as a global peace broker, said the deal showed his administration has done "something that a lot of people said couldn't be done, and we saved maybe millions of lives."

"My administration immediately began working to prevent the conflict from escalating," Trump said. "Everybody was sort of amazed that we got it done so quickly."

As Trump mingled with other leaders in Malaysia, U.S. and Chinese negotiators met on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, where the bilateral talks yielded a framework ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea on Thursday.

"Markets are increasingly getting used to a 'punch-first, negotiate-second' tariffs overture," said John Woods, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier.

Chinese top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said Sunday that a preliminary consensus had been reached after "very intense discussions" on a range of issues, including export controls, fentanyl and shipping fees.

The next step, he said, was for both sides to complete their domestic approval procedures.

In an interview with CBS on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's threat of 100% tariffs is "effectively off the table" after a "very good two-day meeting" with Chinese officials.

Speaking separately to ABC News' "This Week," Bessent said the negotiations produced a "substantial framework" that could ease concerns among American soybean farmers over China's boycott.

China bought more than half of U.S. soybeans in 2023 and 2024, accounting for nearly $12.8 billion in 2024. But Beijing halted purchases earlier this year after Trump ignited a trade war.

Bessent also told ABC News that he expected China to delay its rare earth export controls, set to take effect in the coming weeks, by one year. Trump and Xi could "consummate" a deal to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S., Bessent added.

"We believe both sides, after testing the other's boundaries, will likely make concessions again," said Ting Lu, China economist at Nomura, who expects the additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods will "surely not be implemented" with both sides likely to extend the existing tariff truce.

In return, Lu added, Beijing may resume purchases of U.S. soybeans and ease the enforcement of its rare earth export controls.

A tamer-than-expected U.S. inflation report for September injected optimism into markets. Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut rates at its October meeting — scheduled for later this week — as well as at its December gathering.

Major U.S. indexes climbed Friday and had their second consecutive week in the green, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all up about 2% for the week.

The inflation report offers additional support to markets already buoyed by a strong earnings season. Of the companies that have reported so far, 87% managed to exceed Wall Street's expectations, much higher than the typical 67% beat rate, according to LSEG. If Big Tech earnings this week top estimates — and provide upbeat guidance — markets could see fresh highs.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, however, are still a chilly overhang amid the warm sentiment. Trump on Saturday hit Canada with an additional 10% tariff, as punishment over an ad.

Economists have been warning that tariffs will lead to higher prices. Indeed, while the consumer price index report came in below estimates, September's headline annual rate rose to 3% from the previous month's 2.9%.

"Inflation might not be slowing but it's not surprising to the upside anymore," said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation.

With the lack of other data, such as the jobs report, because of the U.S. government shutdown, we don't have the full picture of how the economy is performing — so the rise in markets could be balanced on a precarious ledge.

Trade developments at the ASEAN Summit. Top U.S. and China officials met Sunday, resulting in "a very successful framework" for talks between Trump and Xi, according to U.S. Treasury Scott Bessent. Trump announced agreements with four Southeast Asian countries.

China's industrial profits surge in September. They rose 21.6% from a year ago, helped by Beijing's efforts to rein in a price war among manufacturers. The growth in profits was the largest since November 2023, and extends August's increase of 20.4% year on year.

HSBC will recognize a $1.1 billion provision. The bank lost part of a court appeal linked to Bernard Madoff's fraud scheme, but said it would pursue a second appeal. The $1.1 billion provision will be included in its third-quarter results, out Tuesday.

Stocks rise on CPI report. Major U.S. indexes climbed Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 47,000 for the first time. U.S. stock futures rose Sunday evening stateside. Asia-Pacific markets advanced Monday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 breaking the 50,000 level for the first time.

[PRO] Don't overlook Asian equities, UBS says. While the U.S. stock market has been charging forward, investors should consider adding Asian stocks, bonds and gold to their portfolio for diversification, the Swiss bank said in a Friday note.

Trump to meet China's Xi for the first time in second term as trade deal remains elusive

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last week that Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Oct. 30 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, Summit.

It will be the first in-person meeting between the two heads of states since Trump returned to the office in January. The high-stakes meeting comes as a delicate trade detente between the economic superpowers nears its expiration on Nov. 10, if they fail to agree on another extension.

Business Insider Edition 

Russia's automakers UAZ and AvtoVAZ are stepping up plans to enter Africa's fast-growing car market, pursuing local assembly initiatives aimed at competing with dominant Asian manufacturers and tapping into the continent's push to build domestic vehicle production capacity.


        Following the successful shipment of tractors to Ethiopia, Russian automakers UAZ and AvtoVAZ are now exploring local assembly opportunities as part of a broader effort to deepen Russia-Ethiopia economic ties and tap into Africa's emerging shift toward homegrown vehicle production.



        According to a report by The Reporter Ethiopia, Russia's embassy in Ethiopia confirmed that UAZ and AvtoVAZ are conducting market-entry studies and negotiating a possible presence in Addis Ababa, signalling a significant move into African vehicle manufacturing.
    


        Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said relations between Russia and Ethiopia are undergoing “successful and steady development” after talks with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedion Timotheos.
    


        He noted that both sides aim to deepen cooperation across multiple sectors through a more active Intergovernmental Commission.
    


        Meanwhile, Ambassador Evgeny Terekhin told TASS that Russian automakers UAZ and AvtoVAZ are advancing discussions to enter Ethiopia's automotive market. He described the sector as a key area for future bilateral economic collaboration.
    


        In a statement posted on social media, Ambassador Evgeny Terekhin said:
    


        “The process involves conducting in-depth marketing and technical research to ensure the economic feasibility of the projects.”
    


        He added that official negotiations are underway and stressed:
    


“We expect the results of the decisions to allow Russian cars to take a worthy place on the roads of Ethiopia,” Terekhin said.
    


        The move by Russian automakers comes as multiple African countries push to expand domestic vehicle manufacturing instead of depending heavily on imported cars, particularly used vehicles, which still dominate the market due to affordability challenges.
    


        Governments in South Africa, Morocco, Kenya and Nigeria are increasingly offering tax breaks, special economic zones and investment incentives to global automakers in hopes of building industrial capacity and creating jobs.
    


        So far, Asian manufacturers have taken the early lead. Chinese brands such as BYD, Chery and Great Wall Motor are growing aggressively across the continent with affordable models and expanding assembly partnerships.



        Indian giants like Tata Motors and Mahindra have also strengthened operations, moving toward more advanced local production.
    


        This shift aligns with Africa's broader ambition to retain more value in supply chains while preparing for the future of mobility.
    


        Russia's interest through UAZ and AvtoVAZ adds a new competitive layer. Their potential entry into local assembly could diversify the market further and pressure policymakers to sustain reforms that favor new-vehicle production over continued reliance on used-car imports.

LONDON — European stocks were slightly higher on Monday as traders look ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, more earnings and signs of a rapprochement between Washington and Beijing.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.1% at 3:15 p.m. in London (11:15 a.m. ET).

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index was little changed for the session, while France's CAC 40 was over 0.1% higher, as Germany's DAX gained 0.1% and Italy's FTSE MIB added 1%.

Regional markets had ended last week higher as investors reacted to the latest U.S. inflation print, the only federal data to be released during the ongoing government shutdown, and a flurry of corporate earnings reports.

Looking at individual stocks, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis on Monday fell 1% after the firm announced it was buying Avidity Biosciences in a deal worth $12 billion.

Copenhagen-listed bank Sydbank was among the biggest gainers, advancing 5.6% after unveiling plans to merge with Danish lenders Arbejdernes Landsbank and Vestjysk Bank, with the new entity – named AL Sydbank – becoming one of Denmark's five largest banks.

Barclays meanwhile gained 1.9% after Saudi Arabia said it would imminently recognize the U.K. lender's regional headquarters in the country, with the bank having reportedly received a provisional capital market authority licence to conduct investment banking activities there.

Meanwhile, HSBC's shares fell over 0.3% as the bank revealed it will book at $1.1 billion provision in its third-quarter earnings due to a court ruling relating to the Bernie Madoff investment fraud case in 2009. HSBC's earning will be released on Tuesday.

Porsche AG shares gained 1.4% after releasing its third-quarter earnings report late on Friday which showed sales revenues of 26.9 billion euros ($31.3 billion) in the first nine months of the year, down from 28.6 billion in the same period last year.

Galp Energia gained 3.3% as the Portuguese energy company's third-quarter earnings report showed adjust net profits reaching 407 million euros during the three-month period, outweighing analysts' estimated 321 million euros.

The U.S. annual inflation rate hit a lower-than-expected 3% in September, prompting a bounce in U.S. stocks amid anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates when it meets this week.

The market is now pricing in a 96% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut this week, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.

Geopolitics and trade are also at the forefront of investors' minds this week amid hopes that the U.S. and China can resolve an escalating trade dispute.

President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in South Korea on Thursday in an attempt to ease trade tensions, an event that could offer significant clarity and reassurance to investors. The leaders will meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, Summit as Trump continues his Asia tour.

Global tech stocks rallied on the news, with industrials, technology and mining-related stocks in Europe benefitting from a positive sentiment surrounding the meeting.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index led the way, rising to 1.2%, paring some earlier gains. The Stoxx Europe 600 Basic Resources index was last seen around the flatline but had risen 0.5% earlier in the day, and the Stoxx 600 Industrial Goods & Services index added over 0.2%.

However, shares of several U.S. companies related to the rare earth minerals supply chain fell on Monday as investors anticipated the meeting, which may result in China delaying new export controls.

CNBC is at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) forum in Riyadh this week which will feature 20 heads of state and more than 600 speakers.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs Group's David Solomon, Blackrock's Larry Fink and Brookfield's Bruce Flatt will be among the hundreds of bankers, consultants, and tech executives heading to the Kingdom for the three-day event.

Russia's policymakers are so fixated on inflation that they are missing the bigger picture, one of the country's most powerful bankers said last week.

"We've been so focused on fighting inflation lately that we've somewhat forgotten about economic growth. Without economic growth, there will be nothing. We won't be able to solve social problems or anything else," German Gref, the CEO of Sberbank, told Russia's State Council on Demographic and Family Policy on Thursday.

"All economic growth depends on two factors: labor productivity and the number of people employed," said Gref, who was Russia's economy minister from 2000 to 2007.

But both of those pillars are under pressure.

"In principle, it is achievable if we begin actively using artificial intelligence, robotics, and all other new technologies, but this requires significant investment and a major commitment to education, science, and so on," Gref said.

However, "this will be difficult to achieve given the capital shortage and the high interest rates we have today," he added.

Gref's comments came before Russia's central bank cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 16.5% on Friday.

Business leaders have been pushing back against the central bank's tight monetary policy, arguing that sky-high borrowing costs are choking lending and investment. The bank has defended its stance, saying high rates are necessary to curb inflation, which stood around 6.4% in the third quarter.

Gref projected that Russia's GDP growth rate over the next two years would hover between 1% and 1.5%, and that this year's growth could slump to just 0.8% — sharply lower than Russia's 4.3% GDP expansion recorded last year.

Earlier this month, a top Russian business leader warned that the country's economy has slowed to a pace that could jeopardize its ability to cover surging defense, security, and social costs.

Russia is facing a deepening demographic crisis, with a looming labor shortage that could reach nearly 11 million workers by 2030, Anton Kotyakov, Russia's labor minister, said in July.

The war in Ukraine has only worsened the problem, as battlefield casualties and a mass exodus of young professionals deplete the country's working-age population.

Russia has leaned on foreign workers, mainly from Central Asia, to fill labor gaps, but Gref said the country is "engaging in negative selection."

"We mostly attract very low-skilled labor, while we ourselves are losing highly qualified specialists," he said, urging Moscow to actively attract skilled professionals from abroad and offer incentives for foreign graduates to stay in Russia.

"It is a matter of national security and the survival of the country," he said.

Russia's demographic squeeze is already distorting its economy, keeping unemployment low at around 2.1% and fueling inflationary pressure through rapid wage growth.

Businesses are already struggling to cope. Employers are increasingly hiring retirees and teenagers to plug staffing gaps in an economy distorted by wartime spending.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made population growth a national priority, calling it a matter of "ethnic survival" and urging women to have as many as eight children.

In 2024, births in Russia fell to 1.22 million — the lowest since 1999 — while deaths rose to 1.82 million, according to government data.

China's EV market is saturated with way too many car company founders who are deadlocked in a brutal battle for market share, says China analyst Dan Wang.

Wang lived in China from 2017 to 2023, where he covered the country as a technology analyst for Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial services company.

He is now a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Wang published his first book, "Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future," in August.

Wang said the EV price war in the country won't stop anytime soon, and that's by design.

"There are too many entrepreneurs, too many engineers, and too much desire for local governments to support local champions," he said.

"Brutal competition has produced many of China's successes, for example, in solar and electric vehicles. It is also a reason for many of these industries to have low profits," he added.

Wang wrote in "Breakneck" that government support was a key reason Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi ventured into the automotive business.

"This sort of expansion is driven both by the fiercely competitive market environments and by government subsidies that make it easier for companies to try their hand at making new products," he wrote.

"They allow companies to unleash a flood of undifferentiated products, ruthlessly underbid each other, and pray their competitors run out of money before they do," he added.

That race to the bottom is starting to show up in EV companies' bottom lines.

In August, BYD said its net profit in the second quarter fell by 30% from a year earlier.

BYD said in its earnings report that "short-term profitability" had been pulled down by "excessive marketing" and discounting. In May, BYD said it was slashing prices on 22 electric and hybrid models until the end of June.

"Competition in China is cutthroat, and it's hard for that situation to change," Wang told Business Insider.

"That's partly a function of the giant scale of China's market, in which entrepreneurs are always daring to pursue opportunities, which is a feature of China's highly dynamic ecosystem," he added.

Last year, the US's Center for Strategic & International Studies said in a report that China's government had spent at least $230 billion since 2009 supporting local EV champions such as BYD. The think tank said the figure was probably an underestimate, since it did not include incentives and subsidies from regional governments.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told the "Everything Electric" podcast in an episode that aired in September that China's EVs are cheaper because of the country's generous subsidies and lower labor costs.

"There's not something magical when you take it apart that's allowing these really impressive cost structures," Scaringe said. "There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.' But rather it's the compounding benefits of a lower cost of capital."

But not everybody has said that China's EV market will remain as hotly contested in the years to come.

In December, Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng told his staff that the auto industry would experience an "elimination round" from 2025 to 2027, per an internal letter obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

The Xpeng founder said in a November interview with Singaporean newspaper The Straits Times that most Chinese automakers won't survive past the next decade.

"I personally think that there will only be seven major car companies that will exist in the coming 10 years," he said, without naming specific companies.

Hailey Bieber, 28, says there's no shame in getting help as a working mom.

During an appearance on Friday's episode of the "In Your Dreams With Owen Thiele" podcast, Bieber said she relies on a strong support system to balance motherhood and her career.

"I do have help. I have full-time help. And I'm super not ashamed to say that," Bieber told podcast host Owen Thiele. "And I would never shy away from talking about that because I wouldn't be able to have my career and do the things that I do without the help."

The Rhode founder and her husband, Justin Bieber, welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, in August 2024.

Even though she always wanted to be a mom and is "super super super hands-on" with her son, she said she is "grateful" to have other people in her circle to rely on.

"If he's not with me, he's with his dad," Bieber said, adding that her son is "always with his family" or someone close to their family, like his godparents.

Bieber added that becoming a mother at a young age comes with its own learning curve.

"I think it did feel daunting, and then once he was here, it didn't feel as daunting," Bieber said, referring to her son.

"I think when your life is about to change in a way which you've never experienced before, and you don't know what to expect, and you don't know what's coming," Bieber said.

She recalled how she was often told that no amount of planning could truly prepare her for becoming a mom.

"And I think that's very true because you just don't know what it's like until you're in it," she said.

Now, she's figuring things out "day by day," Bieber said.

"It's like every single day, I'm learning something new about how to be a mom, and what's best for my son, and what's best for me as a mom," she added.

Speaking to Vogue in May, Bieber said she experienced postpartum body dysmorphia after giving birth.

"Being postpartum is the most sensitive time I've ever gone through in my life, and learning a new version of myself is very difficult," Bieber said.

A representative for Bieber did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Bieber isn't the only Hollywood star who has spoken about juggling work with the demands of parenthood, or about the help that makes it possible.

In 2023, Emma Roberts told People that she realized motherhood is "a full-time job" and said she's thankful for the support of her family.

"I'm so lucky my mom helps me a lot," Roberts said. "I would die without my mom."

During a podcast appearance in May, Michelle Williams said that balancing her career and her duty as a mom is like figuring out "which master you're going to serve."

"Because the truth is, if work is going well, somebody else is taking care of the kids. And if you're in a high point with your kids, the work is shoved to the side," Williams said.

In September, "Grey's Anatomy" actor Camilla Luddington said that she accepts there is "no balance" when it comes to juggling work and kids.

"Letting go of that need to be perfectly balanced all the time has been very freeing for me."

A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet and an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter crashed in separate incidents on Sunday in the South China Sea, the US Pacific Fleet said. 

Both military aircraft had been deployed from the USS Nimitz and went down 30 minutes apart from each other during routine operations, the Navy said in a statement on Sunday.

"All personnel involved are safe and in stable condition. The cause of both incidents is currently under investigation," it said.

According to the statement, the Sea Hawk was the first to go down at about 2.45 p.m. local time. It was assigned to the "Battle Cats" of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 73.

The three crew members on board were later rescued, the Navy said.

The Super Hornet, from the "Fighting Redcocks" of Strike Fighter Squadron 22, crashed at 3:15 p.m., per the Navy. The statement added that both crew members had ejected just before the fighter jet went down.

The separate incidents come as President Donald Trump engages in a diplomatic tour in Asia this week, which he kick-started with a meeting in Malaysia on Sunday.

The tour is expected to include a leg in China, where Trump is scheduled to meet China's leader, Xi Jinping. Trade is high on the agenda as the Trump administration threatens severe tariffs on China and tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to grow.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested on Sunday that the US may hold back on plans to impose 100% tariffs on China after Trump's preliminary talks with Beijing officials in Kuala Lumpur.

This Sunday's fighter crash marks the US Navy's fourth Super Hornet loss in the last 12 months. The first of the $60 million fighters was shot down last December by friendly fire over the Red Sea, while another two fell off their flight deck this spring.

All three previously lost aircraft had been deployed on the USS Harry S. Truman, an aircraft carrier in the same class as the Nimitz.

The MH-60R Sea Hawk is the Navy's most advanced variant of the Sea Hawk, which is essentially a sea-based version of the Black Hawk helicopter. Estimated to cost about $40 million, it's built for a wide variety of missions, including finding and attacking submarines, serving as a flying command post, or conducting rescue operations.

The Nimitz, commissioned in 1975, is the Navy's oldest aircraft carrier in service and is the lead ship of its class. The 50-year-old warship is scheduled to start its decommissioning process next year.

A group of Democratic lawmakers wants to test a new kind of social safety net: a monthly paycheck provided by the federal government to spend however you want.

New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said she is reintroducing a bill to establish a three-year guaranteed basic income pilot program that would offer a cohort of Americans across the country a no-strings-attached monthly payment — enough to cover rent for a two-bedroom home.

"Events like the Coronavirus Pandemic, economic fluctuations, and increasing automation and job losses threaten to wipe out what little savings they have, to finally push them to homelessness, to reinforce the fact that in the wealthiest nation in the world, too many families are just a single mishap away from financial devastation," Watson Coleman said in a press release.

The legislation is called the Guaranteed Income Pilot Program Act of 2025. A guaranteed basic income is when the government distributes recurring and unrestricted payments to a certain demographic. It differs from a universal basic income, which would provide payments to an entire population. Many US cities have already experimented with guaranteed basic income programs to varying degrees of success.

According to the bill, which is co-sponsored by nine other lawmakers, the pilot program would involve 20,000 people between 18 and 65 years old. Of that group, 10,000 would receive monthly payments equal to the "fair market" rent on a two-bedroom home where they live, or a similar amount to be determined by Health and Human Services. The other half would be the control group.

The lawmakers said the proposed basic income would not only insulate Americans from economic instability but also from the potential impact of the AI revolution.

"Increasing automation and advancing AI have the potential to expand human flourishing. However, the concentration of control of those technologies into the hands of a few billionaires may mean the eventual loss of the livelihoods of millions of Americans," the lawmakers said in the press release.

AI leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have long supported the idea of a universal basic income in response to AI. Altman helped fund a large basic income study that ended last year.

Passing such legislation would be a major lift in today's political climate. While Democrats generally support a basic income, some Republicans have criticized the cost of running the programs and raised concerns that it could discourage Americans from working. Some state legislators controlled by Republicans have sought to prevent basic income experiments in their states.

Representatives for Rep. Watson Coleman did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The following article is adapted from The Block's newsletter, The Daily, which comes out on weekday afternoons.

Happy Monday! Crypto rebounded over the weekend, boosted by trader optimism about macroeconomic conditions amid U.S.-China trade talks and Sunday's short liquidation surge.

In today's newsletter, Mt. Gox pushes back its repayment deadline by yet another year, Standard Chartered says bitcoin may never fall below $100,000 again, Strategy buys another $43 million worth of bitcoin, and more.

Meanwhile, bitcoin illiquid supply declines as 62,000 BTC moves out of long-term holder wallets, according to Glassnode.

Let's get started!

P.S. CryptoIQ is now available to everyone. Take the test for a chance to win $20,000!

Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox has postponed its creditor repayment date by another year to Oct. 31, 2026, marking its third extension since the rehabilitation trustee's original 2023 target and coming just four days ahead of this year's previous deadline.

Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick said easing U.S.-China trade tensions have boosted market sentiment, with the bitcoin-gold ratio rebounding after the Oct. 10 tariff-driven selloff.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) bought another 390 BTC for $43.4 million at an average price of $111,117 between Oct. 20 and Oct. 26, raising its total holdings to 640,808 BTC worth around $74 billion.

Strategy was outshone on Monday, however, as American Bitcoin Corp., co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., confirmed it added 1,414 BTC worth over $160 million to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 3,865 BTC to rank among the top 25 public treasuries.

MegaETH's MEGA token sale, which was scheduled to last up to 72 hours, sold out within minutes on Monday morning, raising the maximum $50 million cap as demand exceeded three times the available supply.

Oops, something went wrong

Earlier in October, Bitplanet, a South Korean public company with direct involvement from Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich and Sora Ventures, announced it had purchased 93 BTC and launched an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation program aiming for 10,000 BTC under the country's new regulatory framework.

This marks the first time a public Korean company has executed a major Bitcoin treasury strategy through regulated infrastructure, with Metaplanet's leadership playing a pivotal role in the initiative.

We'll explore how Metaplanet's executive leadership in Bitplanet's digital asset push could reshape the company's investment narrative.

Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.

Anyone looking at Metaplanet today has to buy into a big-picture thesis: the company is betting heavily on Bitcoin, both as a core treasury asset and as a driver of growth, navigating new businesses in Japan and internationally. The recent news of Bitplanet's regulated Bitcoin accumulation program, with Metaplanet's CEO directly involved, is significant because it signals a maturing, possibly more sustainable approach to digital assets within corporate treasuries. This could sharpen Metaplanet's profile as an innovator, but it also adds a fresh layer of volatility and regulatory uncertainty, especially given the company's still-new management and board. The short-term catalysts, impressive revenue and earnings growth, index inclusions, expansion in Bitcoin infrastructure, could benefit from the validation provided by Bitplanet's move. However, the biggest risk remains: rapid business model pivots and large-scale Bitcoin exposure can amplify swings in valuation and financial health, a risk heightened by recent price moves and ongoing shareholder dilution. Overall, while Bitplanet's announcement could provide momentum, it also magnifies existing uncertainties.

But significant board turnover and inexperienced leadership raise new questions investors should not ignore. Metaplanet's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? Uncover how much higher they are than fair value.

Six members of the Simply Wall St Community set their fair values for Metaplanet anywhere from ¥2 up to a high of ¥1,927, with most clustered below ¥600. Given how much of Metaplanet's future could now hinge on its growing Bitcoin focus, it's clear market participants continue to debate the company's risk profile and upside potential. Look further to see what drives these contrasting views.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum layer-2 network MegaETH started its initial coin offering auction on Monday—and it became oversubscribed in just five minutes. Now, approximately five hours later, it has attracted $350 million in pre-deposits at a “hypothetical” fully diluted valuation of $7 billion.

MegaETH has gained significant hype over the past year, following the launch of its testnet in March. Its primary selling point, especially as an Ethereum scaling network, is its fast transaction execution speed—with some users reporting that it makes Ethereum feel “instant.”

As a result, over 100,000 users completed know-your-customer procedures ahead of the MegaETH initial coin offering, also referred to as an ICO. Those users now have 72 hours to place a bid, and allocations will be revealed next week. Now several times oversubscribed, allocations will be determined by assessing past engagement with MegaETH and Ethereum communities, both via “social and on-chain” methods. 

The “hypothetical” $7 billion fully diluted valuation is only the result of the ICO's oversubscription. Once allocations have been determined, MEGA will have an FDV of $999 million.

In the first two hours of the ICO, according to Arkham Intelligence, 819 addresses committed a maximum of $186,282 in USDT apiece to the MegaETH sale address.

Predictors on Polymarket believe there is a 27% chance that there will be up to $1.8 billion worth of commitments to the public sale. Meanwhile, others on the platform predict an 84% likelihood that it raises less than $1 billion.  

The ICO is selling 5% of the total 10 billion token supply. Those based in the United States will be required to lock up their funds for a year; this was also seen during the ICO for stablecoin blockchain Plasma due to U.S. regulations. The lock-up is optional for non-U.S. participants, but it may help gain allocation.

According to the MegaETH MiCA whitepaper, the token generation event will take place at least 40 days after the public sale concludes, which would be mid-December at the earliest. That said, the whitepaper also estimates the token will launch in January 2026.

About us

Copy link

A stablecoin linked to US President Donald Trump is deepening its ties to decentralised finance. 

On Monday, Enso, a provider of so-called chain shortcuts that allow crypto projects to deploy across different blockchains easily, announced that USD1 is the latest project to utilise its tech stack.

This will make “DeFi attractive to major players, including institutions, enabling them to tap into deep liquidity and optimal pricing,” Connor Howe, founder of Enso, said in comments shared with DL News. 

World Liberty Financial, part of the sprawling crypto empire backed by the Trump family, is the issuer behind USD1. The stablecoin launched in March.

USD1's growth is part of a broader theme of market expansion for stablecoins in 2025.

The sector has grown to over $308 billion, a more than 50% growth this year, amid favourable regulations in the US. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, which legally recognises stablecoins in the US.

And the market is expected to continue growing.

Analysts at Keyrock, a crypto investment firm, and Bitso, a cryptocurrency exchange, have predicted that stablecoins will account for 12% of global payments by 2030.

Enso's goal is to make USD1 ubiquitous onchain and distribute its liquidity to protocols across different blockchains, according to the announcement. 

Enso lists over 250 supported protocols on its website that have settled more than $17 billion in onchain transactions.

USD1's almost $3 billion market value makes USD1 the sixth-largest stablecoin in the world, almost 70% of its liquidity is siloed on BNB Chain, a blockchain linked to crypto exchange giant Binance, whose founder, Changpeng Zhao, was pardoned by the president last week.

Ethereum accounts for another quarter of Trump's digital dollar liquidity, with the remainder spread across Solana, Tron, and Aptos.

Following the Enso partnership, USD1 will be available on protocols like Dolomite, a margin trading protocol, and users will be able to trade, lend, and transfer the stablecoin across different blockchains, the announcement stated.

Something went wrong

The Trump family-backed American Bitcoin has announced the acquisition of around 1,414 Bitcoin .

As of October 24, the company's total Bitcoin balance stands at 3,865 BTC, obtained through mining operations and strategic acquisitions.

The latest purchase strengthens its position as one of the world's largest corporate holders of the asset.

The company, ranked as the 26th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, said part of these assets are held in custody or pledged under an agreement with mining hardware provider Bitmain.

Following the acquisition announcement, ABTC shares surged 11.5% to $5.62, suggesting investor confidence in the company's long-term Bitcoin strategy.

American Bitcoin has also introduced a new reporting metric, Satoshis Per Share (SPS), which measures the amount of Bitcoin indirectly owned by each shareholder through their stock holdings.

This comes after the firm previously announced plans to raise up to $2.1 billion in Class A shares, with funds allocated toward Bitcoin purchases, ASIC equipment, and general corporate growth.

While American Bitcoin's aggressive accumulation caught headlines, BlackRock also made a notable BTC move. The world's largest asset manager transferred $118 million worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime.

Market analysts suggest these transfers are part of routine liquidity adjustments or ETF-related rebalancing. However, some believe that it could also be a sign of a major sell-off as the cryptocurrency started the week with a green candle.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $115,000, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency's daily trading volume doubled on October 27.

Bitcoin's price has maintained upward momentum since October 23, climbing beyond $112,000-$113,000 resistance zone. This breakout pushed the cryptocurrency above three key on-chain cost bases, indicating renewed market confidence.

Data from CryptoQuant shows nearly 7 million BTC have returned to profit, including 5.1 million BTC held by investors within six months.

Analysts say that as short-term holders regain profitability, they tend to hold longer and increase positions. This is a classic sign of rising bullish conviction.

However, popular analyst Ali Martinez noted on X that the TD sequential indicator is flashing a “sell” signal for BTC. He believes that BTC could soon face profit-taking pressure from short-term holders.

BitMine Immersion Technologies added another $321 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) to its stockpile over the last week, the NYSE American-traded firm said Monday, with its holdings rising in value due to Ethereum's recent rebound. Its stock was climbing Monday, as well.

The Tom Lee-fronted firm now holds 3.313 million ETH valued at over $13.8 billion, plus it has 192 Bitcoin (about $22 million worth) and $305 million in on-hand cash. The company added 77,055 ETH over the last week.

BitMine is the largest Ethereum treasury firm by far, outpacing runner-up SharpLink Gaming (SBET) with its $3.58 billion in ETH holdings. It's the second largest overall crypto treasury behind Strategy, which holds over $73 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Ethereum has been rising in recent days alongside the rest of the crypto market, climbing 3% over the last week to a recent price of $4,166. Overnight, ETH rose as high as $4,246, the highest mark registered by crypto markets data provider CoinGecko in the last two weeks.

Lee, the chairman of BitMine and co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, cited improving trade relations between the United States and Canada for why Ethereum is on the rise again after a dramatic crypto market plunge earlier this month.

"The progress in trade talks between U.S. and China is a positive for Ethereum and crypto broadly,” said Lee in a statement. “These are global assets and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging in crypto a few weeks ago. While the fundamentals of Ethereum and crypto are 'uncorrelated' to equities, Fundstrat work has shown that in the past 15 years, Ethereum and crypto perform better when equities rise, meaning crypto is correlated to 'risk-on' assets via the associated leverage channel.”

BitMine's stock jumped Monday following both ETH's weekend rise and the purchase announcement, with shares of BMNR recently changing hands for $53.15—up more than 5% so far on the day.

Myriad users remain bullish on Ethereum's prospects, currently giving ETH a nearly 80% chance of rising to a price of $4,500 sooner than it can plunge to $3,100. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, Dastan.)

The People's Bank of China reported that digital yuan payment volumes nearly doubled over the past 14 months, reaching RMB 14.2 trillion ($2 trillion) through September 2025, up from RMB 7.3 trillion in July 2024. The CBDC figures represent a significant acceleration in adoption of the central bank digital currency.

The surge in volume comes alongside explosive wallet growth. The number of digital RMB wallets has climbed to 2.25 billion, more than twelve times the 180 million reported in July 2024. With China's population at 1.4 billion, the figures suggest users are opening multiple wallets.

However, the average transaction value of RMB 428 ($60) has remained moderately stable since the CBDC pilot first launched. This marks a significant decline from the 2023 peak of RMB 1,895 ($135), which may have indicated a larger proportion of business adoption at that time. The central bank has only periodically released enough data to calculate this metric.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion said its holdings have now surpassed 3.3 million ETH — worth around $13.7 billion — following its latest weekly acquisitions.

BitMine bought 77,055 ETH since its last update on Oct. 20, reporting its total crypto and cash holdings had reached $14.2 billion on Monday. BitMine did not disclose the average purchase cost, but at current prices, its latest acquisition is worth around $319 million.

As of Oct. 26, BitMine also holds 192 BTC ($22.2 million), an $88 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $305 million in unencumbered cash. The company's ETH holdings are equivalent to nearly 2.8% of Ethereum's current circulating supply, which sits at approximately 120.7 million ETH, according to The Block's price page.

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 859,400 ETH and 496,710 ETH, respectively, according to SER data. BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,808 BTC ($74 billion) — equivalent to more than 3% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply — following Strategy's latest acquisition announcement on Monday.



Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Bill Miller III, DCG, Founders Fund, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Pantera, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH.

The acquisition announcement comes after ETH rebounded 3.1% over the past week, boosted by trader optimism about macroeconomic conditions amid U.S.-China trade talks and Sunday's short liquidation surge.



"The progress in trade talks between U.S. and China is a positive for Ethereum and crypto broadly," Fundstrat Managing Partner and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee said on Monday. "These are global assets and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging in crypto a few weeks ago."

"While the fundamentals of Ethereum and crypto are 'uncorrelated' to equities, Fundstrat work has shown that in the past 15 years, Ethereum and crypto perform better when equities rise, meaning crypto is correlated to 'risk-on' assets via the associated leverage channel," he continued. "Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30 of this year (ETH was $2,500). Given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward."

BitMine is now among the top-traded U.S. equities, with a five-day average daily volume of $1.5 billion as of Oct. 24. That ranks it 46th nationwide, just behind Goldman Sachs among 5,704 U.S.-listed stocks, per Fundstrat and Statista data.

"The combined trading volume share of BitMine and MSTR is now 88% of all global DAT trading volume. We continue to lead our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock," Lee added.

MegaETH, a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain designed for real-time performance with high throughput and low latency, saw its token sale oversubscribed within minutes, raising approximately $50 million at a $1 billion fully diluted valuation.

The project required participants to register on a specific platform with identity checks to ensure fair access. MegaETH prioritized community involvement by capping commitments and focusing on broad participation rather than exclusive investor deals.

Recent blockchain ICOs have highlighted a trend toward English auction structures to manage high demand transparently.

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance.

I recently had the pleasure of visiting the lovely mountain town of Lugano, Switzerland, whose appeal lies in that it is basically Italy but administered by the Swiss. That's according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, one of the prime backers of Plan B, a Bitcoin conference where I hosted a discussion on the growing trend of nation states embracing the original cryptocurrency.

The event had an upbeat vibe—not surprising since everyone there worshipped Bitcoin—but it was also clear there was trouble in paradise. It turns out there is a growing schism over Bitcoin's codebase, and whether it should be modified to permit the blockchain to include more non-financial data.





The notion of including data unrelated to Bitcoin transactions is hardly new and, indeed, the very first block on the blockchain includes a reference to a newspaper headline about bank bailouts. Now, though, Bitcoin's biggest and most influential group of coders, known as Core, are planning to tweak their software in order to significantly lift the restrictions on how much non-payment information can be included in a block.





For the Core crowd, this is a simple and pragmatic way to promote new uses for Bitcoin and, in the process, drum up extra fees for miners at a time when the blockchain's lottery payment is 3.125 Bitcoins, and set to halve again in 2028. A fast-growing rival faction, though, wants nothing to do with the scheme and is promoting a Bitcoin client software of its own called Knots.





That faction's software is led by an influential Bitcoin developer, who is a devout Catholic and reportedly named it Knots after the “whip of knots” Jesus used to drive money changers from a temple. According to a lawyer I spoke with on the Knots side, the software is necessary to protect the blockchain from what he decried as spammers and “scam adjacency” projects that promote things like Bitcoin NFTs. 




If you've encountered Bitcoiners in person or online, you're aware they're not known for their tact. That is true of prominent figures from Bitcoin's early days who have been denouncing each other on stage in Lugano and on X. These high profile partisans include Peter Todd and Jameson Lopp for the Core faction, and Nick Szabo and Luke Dashjr for the rival Knots sect.





This latest schism (you can read a helpful breakdown here) hearkens back to the Bitcoin block size wars that raged from 2015 to 2017, and ultimately saw the “small blockers”—who favored keeping Bitcoin blocks at 1MB—prevail over rivals who claimed boosting the blocks to 2MB or more would be more commercially viable. That fight produced bad blood that has lasted to this day.





In the current fight, Knots is still the smaller faction, but has already become the client of choice for over 20% of Bitcoin node operators. Its growing popularity lies not only in Knots' position on expanding the blockchain, but from a perception that the Core crowd has grown arrogant and out-of-touch with Bitcoin's core values. The Core folks, meanwhile, dismiss the Knots faction as lying trouble-makers.





I lack the authority to weigh in on much of this, other than to observe that this latest battle for the soul of Bitcoin reinforces what I've said for years: Bitcoin is a marvelous technology, but also a religion. And with any religion, there will be divisions between old-line believers and more modern adherents. Happily for the crowd in Lugano, there was a moment of unity that came with the unveiling of a restored Satoshi Nakamoto statue on the city's beautiful lakefront. Bitcoin's factions may be at war but there's no doubt they still worship a common god.

If you can't beat ‘em, join ‘em: JPMorgan Chase's CEO continues to soften his longtime anti-crypto stance as his bank announced that it will let borrowers use Bitcoin and Ethereum for loan collateral by the end of year. (Bloomberg)

COIN upgrade: Coinbase's forthcoming crypto token could be worth $12 billion to $34 billion, said a JPM analyst, who cited the token and the slowing growth of DEXes as reasons to upgrade the stock ahead of third-quarter earnings this week. (DL News)

Here we ICO again? In assessing Coinbase's $375 million acquisition of Echo, which was founded by crypto influencer Cobie and helps token projects raise funds, one journalist speculated it could inaugurate the return of 2016-style initial coin offerings. (Bloomberg) 

DAT doesn't add up: Following a Fortune exposé pointing to potential insider trading ahead of public company pivots to digital asset treasuries, a new report provides evidence that insiders tied to some popular DATs are using share sales to circumvent token lockups. (Unchained)

Trump picks a CFTC chair: The White House selected longtime lawyer and crypto guy Mike Selig to lead the agency. The choice of Selig, which came after the Winklevii helped torpedo the original frontrunner, was hailed by industry vets who are eager to finalize a key bill that will divide responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC. (Politico)





CZ was the easy choice for main character of the week after finally securing a Presidential pardon. Critics, pointing to a $2 billion deal involving the Trump family's stablecoin and Binance, blasted the pardon as massively corrupt while many on Crypto Twitter claimed it was fair since CZ—who pleaded guilty—had allegedly been the target of a political prosecution.



Bitcoin devotees seeking to make a pilgrimage have a growing number of options. In addition to the refurbished Satoshi statue unveiled in Lugano, there is one in Budapest as well. Can a formal shrine—or perhaps a Bitcoin theme park—be far behind?

      Last Monday, the internet's digital bloodstream developed a clot that sent jitters around the world. Amazon Web Services (AWS) began reporting increased error rates and latency in its flagship cloud region, US-East-1, in Northern Virginia. The cause was eventually traced to a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution failure affecting a critical application programming interface (API) endpoint for DynamoDB, AWS's popular server-less database service.


     
      This DNS issue meant that software trying to connect to DynamoDB couldn't find it; not because the database was offline, but the system responsible for translating human-readable names into machine-usable Internet Protocol (IP) addresses had stopped functioning properly. Application requests failed, retries spiked and global services got disrupted, hitting everything from apps such as Snapchat and Signal to government services. 


     
      To understand the implications, it helps to look at how DNS works. At its core, DNS is the internet's phone book. When you enter a web address like ‘amazon.com,' DNS translates that into a numeric IP address so your browser can locate the correct server. This involves a chain of lookups: from the root servers to top-level domain servers, such as those for a ‘.com' address, to the authoritative server for the specific domain.





     
      This structure is overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the non-profit that manages the DNS root zone, delegates top-level domains and accredits registrars. ICANN  is on top of the domain name hierarchy. While it had no direct role in AWS's outage, its position underscores a broader point: the DNS is built on a centralized architecture, and centralization means the risk of a failure cascade, which is what occurred. 


     
      The DNS resolution for the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-East-1 failed, leaving dependent services unable to locate the database. Because the DNS is assumed to ‘just work,' most systems are not built to handle its failure. But if it breaks, it breaks everything above it.


     
      The DNS has several flaws. Its hierarchical nature creates single points of failure. The entire process can collapse if any step in the resolution chain fails due to a mis-configuration, overload or software bug. The AWS outage made these weaknesses painfully visible. 


     
      It showed how even internal DNS services, which cloud providers like AWS use for communication between their resources, can act as bottlenecks. In this case, the failure was in AWS's own name resolution infrastructure within US-East-1. Even services inside AWS couldn't reach DynamoDB because internal pointers had disappeared.





     
      Some technologists see safety in blockchain-based alternatives, often grouped under Web 3.0. These systems aim to decentralize name resolution, side-stepping the control of ICANN. Projects like the Ethereum Name Service, Handshake and Unstoppable Domains use distributed ledgers for domain records. Users can register names on-chain and those records are secured by consensus mechanisms rather than a single registry.


     
      In theory, this has significant advantages. A decentralized system would be harder to censor or take down. If no organization is in charge, there's no central point of failure. Names and records live across thousands of nodes rather than a handful of root servers. This could prevent outages like AWS's from spreading if a single node fails.


     
      But reality complicates the picture. Blockchain-based naming systems are still niche, experimental and largely disconnected from DNS infrastructure. Most devices, browsers, and operating systems don't support these systems natively. You need plug-ins, gateways or specific blockchain clients to resolve these names. The user experience is fragmented and performance trade-offs—especially for high-speed web traffic—remain significant.





     
      Even if these technologies had matured, they wouldn't have prevented the AWS outage. The failure didn't occur at the public DNS layer, but within its internal network. For a blockchain-based name resolution system to help, AWS must redesign its internal service discovery architecture for decentralized use, a massive undertaking.


     
      Still, chief among the lessons to be drawn is the danger of geographic and logical centralization. US-East-1 has long been a lynchpin of AWS's infrastructure, hosting customer applications and many internal control services. Reversing this over-concentration offers a path toward resilience.


     
      A more robust future might combine both approaches. Traditional DNS could incorporate ideas from decentralized systems, such as cryptographic verification, distributed resolution and independent registries, without abandoning compatibility. Cloud providers like AWS could adopt multi-region service discovery, independent failover paths and redundant name resolution layers that don't depend so heavily on a single region or naming service.


     
      The AWS outage reminds us of network vulnerability. When DNS fails, it's like address labels vanishing from every building in a city. The centralized infrastructure we rely on today is efficient, but brittle. Blockchain-based naming may not be the solution yet, but could help make outages like this less catastrophic, as services would no longer hinge on a single address book in a single place. 


     
      For now, the web will continue to run on DNS, governed by ICANN. But for a more fault-tolerant internet, we may need to rethink how we store data, how we name it and who keeps the list.

China today announced intensified measures to curb digital currency speculation, as authorities reinforce the nation's strict stance against private crypto assets while promoting state-controlled alternatives.

Beijing recently directed major tech firms to halt private stablecoin initiatives in Hong Kong, reinforcing state dominance in currency issuance. The People's Bank of China has emphasized concerns over financial stability risks posed by privately issued digital assets.

China's central bank continues advancing its digital yuan as a controlled alternative to private cryptocurrencies. Regulators view private stablecoins as threats to financial stability and national monetary policy oversight.

The crackdown aligns with China's broader strategy to maintain monetary sovereignty while preventing speculative activity in decentralized digital assets. The nation has maintained some of the world's strictest controls on crypto trading and mining operations.

 MIAMI, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- American Bitcoin Corp. (Nasdaq: ABTC) ("American Bitcoin" or the "Company"), a Bitcoin accumulation platform focused on building America's Bitcoin infrastructure backbone, has acquired approximately 1,414 Bitcoin. As of October 24, 2025, the Company held approximately 3,865 Bitcoin acquired through Bitcoin mining and strategic purchases, which includes Bitcoin held in custody or pledged for miner purchases under an agreement with BITMAIN.


As part of its ongoing commitment to providing investors with visibility into shareholder value, American Bitcoin will now provide periodic updates to Satoshis Per Share ("SPS"), a metric that represents the amount of Bitcoin attributable to each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. SPS is calculated by multiplying the Company's total Bitcoin holdings by the Satoshi conversion ratio (1 Bitcoin equals 100,000,000 Satoshis), then dividing that total by the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding as of the measurement date. This measure provides shareholders with insight into their indirect ownership of Bitcoin through their equity in the Company.

SPS is calculated by multiplying the Company's total Bitcoin holdings by the Satoshi conversion ratio (1 Bitcoin equals 100,000,000 Satoshis), then dividing that total by the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding as of the measurement date. This measure provides shareholders with insight into their indirect ownership of Bitcoin through their equity in the Company.

"We believe one of the most important measures of success for a Bitcoin accumulation platform is how much Bitcoin backs each share," said Eric Trump, Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of American Bitcoin. "As part of that conviction, we are focused on providing transparent updates as we aim to increase our holdings."  

"What sets American Bitcoin apart from most traditional Bitcoin treasury vehicles is our integrated mining operations," said Asher Genoot, Executive Chairman of American Bitcoin. "By producing Bitcoin directly, we can reduce our average cost per Bitcoin to drive a cost advantage over vehicles that buy exclusively on the open market. That structural advantage allows us to compound Bitcoin value per share more efficiently for our investors."

Oops, something went wrong

Ant Group, China's largest internet finance company, is reportedly laying the groundwork for a return to digital assets.

The tech giant has applied in Hong Kong to register a series of trademarks related to virtual assets, stablecoins, and blockchain technologies, including one for “ANTCOIN,” according to a Monday report from Hong Kong Economic Times, citing public filings.

In one application filed with Hong Kong's Intellectual Property Department in June, found and seen by Decrypt, a broad scope of financial and digital-asset services under the proposed ANTCOIN mark is listed.

The filing includes registrations for providing online payments, electronic wallets, foreign exchange, and the issuance and transfer of stablecoins and digital tokens. It remains pending before the registry.

Decrypt reached out to Ant Group to confirm the status and scope of its Hong Kong trademark applications but did not immediately receive a response.

The group's decision to file for trademarks such as ANTCOIN appears as a “strategic move to protect their interests” in Hong Kong's burgeoning virtual asset sector, Joshua Chu, lawyer, lecturer, and co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association, told Decrypt.

“Although recent regulatory developments from Beijing have put their stablecoin ambitions on ice, retaining IP rights ensures Ant can defend its brand,” Chu said.

Earlier this month, Beijing reportedly ordered major tech firms, including Ant Group, to suspend their stablecoin-related initiatives in Hong Kong.

Ant Group's next move would depend on how it goes about with “sorting out issues” which have “caused their ambitions to be iced in the first place,” Chu said.

Chu warned that there have been cases “where unauthorized or fraudulent tokens masquerade as USDT” without actually being issued by Tether. Other scammers, for instance, “have created tokens on various blockchains that use similar names, symbols, or contract addresses” to appear legitimate.

There are also “high-fidelity copycat contracts” that can deceive users into believing they hold genuine stablecoins, he added. Such operations are among the risks that stablecoin players like Ant Group who may be looking to open business in Hong Kong would face.

“Trademark protection is a prudent and essential part of risk management,” he added.

Co-founded by Chinese serial entrepreneur Jack Ma, Ant Group has been steadily adopting blockchain and digital asset infrastructure as part of its broader shift to financial tech.

In July, Ant Group worked with Circle, a public U.S. company, to pilot USDC-based cross-border payments between Ant International's Alipay+ network and select global merchants, in one of the first integrations of a regulated stablecoin into its payment rails.

A month later, the group dismissed rumors that it was working with China's central bank on a rare earth-backed RMB stablecoin.

In September, its Ant Digital Technologies unit unveiled a blockchain platform to tokenize energy assets in China, linking roughly $8 billion worth of infrastructure to on-chain systems.

      Prime Minister Narendra Modi's consecutive addresses at the Global Fintech Festival (GFF)—this year alongside the UK's PM—reflect how central fintech has become to India's global economic engagement. His continued participation underscores that fintech is no longer peripheral but integral to India's digital diplomacy and its ambition to shape the global financial architecture. 


     
      Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and commerce minister Piyush Goyal have reiterated that India will not support cryptocurrencies without sovereign or asset backing. Both leaders have highlighted that the next phase of fintech growth will be driven by AI and blockchain, where innovation advances within clear monetary and regulatory guard-rails. 


     
      Together, their remarks frame India's strategic choice: shape a blockchain-based fintech future through its own digital public infrastructure and regulatory foresight—or risk capital flight and diminished digital sovereignty in an evolving global order.





Stablecoins and a new monetary architecture: Many analysts once viewed stablecoins and blockchain technology as a challenge to banking systems. Yet, the debate has shifted. Stablecoins are now seen as a complement to traditional banking infrastructure—an upgrade that carries liquidity, trust and compliance across borders. 


     
      In our article ‘Reduce friction: Let regulated stablecoins transform India's remittance economy,' we argued that stablecoins can serve as the “missing layer" in India's financial stack—bridging the domestic interoperability of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with the global flow of remittances.


     
      The Citi Stablecoins 2030 report calls 2025 blockchain's “ChatGPT moment," with stablecoins driving this transformation and projecting their issuance to reach $1.9 trillion in its base case and $4 trillion in a bullish scenario by 2030. Amid such a landscape, banks will remain cornerstones of trust, liquidity and credit intermediation, while stablecoins modernize the infrastructure that underpins them. 


     
      Banks could act as custodians of the reserves that back stablecoins—holding cash or government securities to ensure full convertibility—and issue tokenized deposits, digital representations of existing balances that enable smart contracts, programmable payments and instant settlement. 


     
      Far from replacing banks, stablecoins enhance their efficiency, embedding compliance into blockchain code and enabling real-time liquidity. In this architecture, speed and programmability strengthen rather than weaken the banking system.





Global regulatory momentum: Globally, regulators are converging on the same approach: integrating stablecoins within existing banking frameworks, rather than leaving them to unregulated markets. The US's GENIUS Act of 2025 brings stablecoin issuers under the supervision of the US Treasury and Federal Reserve, requiring full-reserve backing and daily disclosures. 


     
      The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) of 2024 treats ‘e-money tokens' as supervised payment instruments with reserves held at authorized credit institutions. 


     
      Singapore's Monetary Authority framework of 2023 and Hong Kong's Monetary Authority regime of 2025 both require one-to-one fiat backing, redemption rights and custody with licensed banks. Japan's Payment Services Act of 2023 restricts issuance to banks and trusts, while the UAE's VARA and FSRA rules of 2024 enforce full collateralization and domestic reserve custody. 


     
      The policy is clear: Stablecoins succeed when regulated through appropriate authorities, anchoring innovation in trust, transparency and monetary discipline. India's financial ecosystem already meets many of these conditions—it has the institutions, digital rails and compliance architecture to lead this evolution.





India's trust layer: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Interoperable Regulatory Sandbox (IoRS) offers a foundation for the convergence we need. The IoRS enables the testing of innovations in domains under multiple regulators—including those overseeing securities, insurance and international financial centres—under unified oversight. 


     
      Within this structure, India can pilot rupee-backed stablecoins issued by licensed financial institutions, backed one-to-one by bank reserves and interoperable with the UPI and digital rupee. The sandbox can embed Know-your-customer, Anti-money-laundering and audit standards directly into digital code, ensuring that innovation unfolds within India's regulatory bounds.





     
      Beyond RBI, India's institutional ecosystem is ready for scaled deployment. The National Payments Corp of India (NPCI) can extend its infrastructure to global corridors through stablecoin-linked remittance channels. This would enable instant conversion between fiat money, the digital rupee and rupee-backed stablecoins, thereby embedding compliance at the transaction layer rather than through post-facto audits. 


     
      The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) could act as the trust layer of this system; it could deploy AI-driven monitoring and blockchain analytics to track flows in real-time. Together, RBI, NPCI and FIU can ensure that India's stablecoin architecture remains both innovative and secure.





From remittances to a tokenized economy: The potential of stablecoins extends well beyond remittances. They can accelerate India's shift towards tokenized credit and financial assets. Imagine home loans, MSME financing or trade invoices issued as programmable tokens, where repayments, interest adjustments and lien releases are automated through smart contracts. 


     
      Mudra or SIDBI loans could be tokenized to ensure end-use traceability, while carbon credits under the Green Credit Programme could attract verified ESG investment. Such tokenization would digitize compliance, lower transaction costs and create transparent and audit-ready data trails for policymakers and investors. 


     
      India's challenge is not whether to engage with stablecoins, but how to lead their responsible adoption. A restrictive approach could push talent and capital to more agile jurisdictions. A calibrated framework—one that combines RBI's prudence, NPCI's interoperability and FIU's data intelligence—could instead make India the trust capital of digital finance. 


     
      Stablecoins are not a threat to the rupee; they are its most scalable expression.

 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has flipped to neutral, leaving “fear” behind for the first time since the mid-October market crash sparked by Trump's China tariffs. 

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index finally clawed its way out of the “fear” zone on Sunday, resolving to neutral for the first time in more than two weeks as the price of Bitcoin surged back to around $115,000 over the weekend.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall market sentiment, is currently sitting in the “neutral” zone with a score of 51 out of 100.  

It's up 11 points from the fearful score of 40 on Saturday, and also up over 20 points since last week, marking a sharp change in tune over the past few days.       

Trump's China tariff announcement on Oct. 10 had plunged the index from a “greed” score of 71 to a yearly low of 24 as $19 billion of crypto leveraged positions were liquidated. 

The shift in sentiment comes amid a recent decline in Bitcoin (BTC) selling pressure, according to Bitcoin analytics platform Glassnode.

In an X post on Sunday, Glassnode suggested a trend reversal is in the works, as selling pressure and negative sentiment appear to have already peaked to their extremes.

“For the first time since the October 10th flush, spot and futures CVD [Cumulative Volume Delta] have flattened, indicating that aggressive selling pressure has subsided over the last several days,” the post reads, adding: 

Looking ahead at other potentially bullish indicators, the market is seemingly anticipating another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve at its Oct. 29 meeting.

At the time of writing, data from CME Group's FedWatch tips a 96.7% chance that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point this week.

 A new Bitcoin improvement proposal calls for a one-year soft fork for Bitcoin while developers resolve the transaction filtering debate, but the language within it has sparked controversy. 

A new Bitcoin improvement proposal for a soft fork has sparked outrage on X over a section that some claim is threatening legal consequences for those who reject the fork. 

The proposal, created by core developer Luke Dashjr and published on Friday, is the latest salvo in the recent Bitcoin Core vs Knots debate, which revolves around what Bitcoin should be used for and whether non-financial transactions should be filtered out. 

The proposal aims to restrict data in Bitcoin (BTC) transactions through a one-year soft fork while a more permanent solution is devised, addressing concerns that bad actors can embed illegal and immoral content into the blockchain following the Bitcoin Core v30 update.

However, under the improvement proposal, the developers have written on line 261 that “there is a moral and legal impediment to any attempt to reject this soft fork.”

Then starting on line 270 and continuing to line 272, the developers go into further detail, “rejecting this soft fork may subject you to legal or moral consequences, or could result in you splitting off to a new altcoin like Bcash. However, strictly speaking, you are free to choose.”

Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was designed to disrupt traditional financial institutions and empower individuals. Critics of the proposal believe any form of censorship or restricting data sizes contradicts Bitcoin's core principle of permissionless use. 

In a post on Sunday, a user with the handle Bam, the founder of a Bitcoin education resource and systems engineer, called the wording “Orwellian,” a reference to the writings of George Orwell, an author who depicted a future totalitarian state in his book 1984. 

Ben Kaufman, a coder and software engineer, said a “fork under the threat of legal consequences is the most clear case of an attack on Bitcoin.”

Canadian cryptographer and computer scientist Peter Todd also weighed in with a screenshot of Dashjr, saying it's “clear he expects his soft-fork to get adopted due to legal threats.”

Galaxy Digital's Alex Thorn commented on Todd's post and agreed it's “explicitly an attack on Bitcoin, however, it's also incredibly stupid.”

Some also warned that if miners and users split over activation, the network could face a chain split.

Users have long been able to embed messages onchain; the recent Bitcoin Core v30 update allows much larger data payloads, which the proposal claims has opened the door for anyone participating in the network to be criminally liable if the content posted in the transactions is illegal.

Some X users argue that this liability is what the proposal is referencing, specifically that failure to adopt the fork could result in illicit content on the blockchain, which could lead to legal or moral consequences.

Dashjr also appeared to support this argument in the comments of a user who claimed it's illegal to reject the soft fork, posting that it “doesn't say that. Maybe you can propose a clarification if you think it's unclear.”

“May isn't certainly. Also, for some context, I believe this part originated in an earlier draft, which didn't have the proactive activation (ie, the opposing chain would definitely include CSAM) — so it would probably make sense to add clarification,” he added. 

The proposal for the soft fork is already on track with no technical objections, according to Dashjr.

However, Todd may have already found a way to exploit the fix in the proposal. He claims to have recorded a transaction containing the entire text of the proposed fork that is “100% standard and fully compatible” with the improvement proposal. 

Meanwhile, BitMEX Research stated that a malicious actor seeking to conduct a double-spend attack could place illegal content onchain to “trigger a re-org and succeed with their attack,” thereby creating an “economic incentive” to place unlawful content onchain.

The monopoly of dollar is now facing an unprecedented challenge. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed the BRICS, accusing the organisation of attempting de-dollarisation. India's trade with Russia in Indian rupees has also hurt the dollar. And China is now coming up with something big.

For decades, the United States dollar has been more than just a currency — it has been the bedrock of global trade, finance, and power. Washington's ability to weaponize the dollar — from freezing assets to enforcing sanctions and controlling international payment networks — has long cemented its geopolitical leverage. 
But that monopoly is now facing an unprecedented challenge. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed the BRICS, accusing the organisation of attempting de-dollarisation. India's trade with Russia in Indian rupees has also hurt the dollar. And China is now coming up with something big.
China's Landmark Digital Leap

In October 2025, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) made a historic announcement: its central bank digital currency — the Digital Renminbi (e-CNY) — would now support cross-border settlements with all 10 ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries.

This expansion connects nearly 38% of global trade volume directly to China's blockchain-based financial infrastructure, bypassing the traditional SWIFT system, which has served as the backbone of U.S. dollar–denominated payments for decades.

The implications are profound.

In pilot tests between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi, the PBoC's “Digital Currency Bridge” (mBridge) enabled cross-border settlements in just 7 seconds, compared to SWIFT's 3–5 day window, and slashed transaction fees by up to 98%. The mBridge system — developed jointly with the UAE, Thailand, and Hong Kong — allows central banks to settle directly via distributed ledger technology, eliminating intermediary banks in New York or London.

For countries wary of US sanctions or payment blocks, this offers something SWIFT cannot: monetary sovereignty.

Beijing's De-Dollarisation Strategy
China's digital currency expansion isn't just a financial experiment — it's part of a long-term geopolitical strategy. The Digital RMB merges economic sovereignty, technological innovation, and statecraft.

As of early 2025, BRICS nations use the yuan for about 24% of intra-bloc trade, while roughly 90% of their total trade is now settled in local currencies.

Several ASEAN economies — including Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand — have begun holding RMB in their reserves and using the digital yuan for energy or commodities transactions.

Middle Eastern exporters are increasingly open to settling oil and gas trades in RMB, drawn by faster and cheaper settlement options.

By creating an alternative financial infrastructure that is faster, cheaper, and sanction-resistant, Beijing directly challenges the three pillars of US dollar dominance: Oil trade, SWIFT intermediaries, and Dollar-denominated reserves.

This is more than economic competition — it's the creation of a parallel financial world.

Why Emerging Economies Are Pivoting to CBDCs
Developing economies today face three choices for international transactions:

* Stay tied to SWIFT and the dollar — slow, expensive, and politically controlled.

* Depend on volatile cryptocurrencies — fast but legally uncertain.

* Adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — fast, sovereign, and regulatory-compliant.

CBDCs, unlike crypto, offer finality, compliance, and legal clarity, making them attractive for governments seeking both financial inclusion and geopolitical autonomy.

China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system.

India's Counter-Strategy: A Democratic Digital Currency
While Beijing races ahead, India is charting its own digital path. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model.

India's approach emphasizes interoperability over dominance. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration.

Key features of India's eRs ecosystem include:
* Retail and wholesale versions: for citizens and institutions alike.

* Offline transaction capability, enabling digital payments in rural and underconnected areas — a unique inclusion measure absent in China's model.

* Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT.

* UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access.

India envisions its digital rupee not just as a national instrument, but as a neutral reserve option within BRICS+, offering smaller economies a trust-based, transparent alternative to both the US dollar and the tightly controlled RMB.


BRICS and Battle For Financial Multipolarity
Within BRICS, the debate over de-dollarisation has shifted from rhetoric to infrastructure.

Russia is using the yuan for more than 30% of its trade after being cut off from SWIFT.

Brazil and South Africa are experimenting with blockchain-based payment systems.

Saudi Arabia, a potential BRICS+ member, has expressed openness to trading oil in non-dollar currencies, including the RMB and INR.

Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems.

The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks.

The Dollar's Future: Still Dominant, but Not Untouchable

The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago.

De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance.

For Washington, this represents not an immediate collapse, but the slow unbundling of financial hegemony — a world where power no longer flows through one currency, one network, or one capital. 

The Bottom Line
The rise of the Digital RMB and India's eRs signals the dawn of a new financial era. China's model offers speed and state control; India's promises inclusivity and cooperation. Both converge on one truth: the dollar's unchallenged reign is ending — not with confrontation, but with code, connectivity, and currency innovation. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. It might try to coerce or manipulate nations in trade in only dollars and not in other currencies. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well.

But that monopoly is now facing an unprecedented challenge. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed the BRICS, accusing the organisation of attempting de-dollarisation. India's trade with Russia in Indian rupees has also hurt the dollar. And China is now coming up with something big.

Russia is using the yuan for more than 30% of its trade after being cut off from SWIFT.

Brazil and South Africa are experimenting with blockchain-based payment systems.

Saudi Arabia, a potential BRICS+ member, has expressed openness to trading oil in non-dollar currencies, including the RMB and INR.

Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems.

The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks.

The Dollar's Future: Still Dominant, but Not Untouchable

The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago.

De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance.

For Washington, this represents not an immediate collapse, but the slow unbundling of financial hegemony — a world where power no longer flows through one currency, one network, or one capital. 

The Bottom Line
The rise of the Digital RMB and India's eRs signals the dawn of a new financial era. China's model offers speed and state control; India's promises inclusivity and cooperation. Both converge on one truth: the dollar's unchallenged reign is ending — not with confrontation, but with code, connectivity, and currency innovation. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. It might try to coerce or manipulate nations in trade in only dollars and not in other currencies. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well.

In October 2025, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) made a historic announcement: its central bank digital currency — the Digital Renminbi (e-CNY) — would now support cross-border settlements with all 10 ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries.

This expansion connects nearly 38% of global trade volume directly to China's blockchain-based financial infrastructure, bypassing the traditional SWIFT system, which has served as the backbone of U.S. dollar–denominated payments for decades.

The implications are profound.

In pilot tests between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi, the PBoC's “Digital Currency Bridge” (mBridge) enabled cross-border settlements in just 7 seconds, compared to SWIFT's 3–5 day window, and slashed transaction fees by up to 98%. The mBridge system — developed jointly with the UAE, Thailand, and Hong Kong — allows central banks to settle directly via distributed ledger technology, eliminating intermediary banks in New York or London.

For countries wary of US sanctions or payment blocks, this offers something SWIFT cannot: monetary sovereignty.

Beijing's De-Dollarisation Strategy
China's digital currency expansion isn't just a financial experiment — it's part of a long-term geopolitical strategy. The Digital RMB merges economic sovereignty, technological innovation, and statecraft.

As of early 2025, BRICS nations use the yuan for about 24% of intra-bloc trade, while roughly 90% of their total trade is now settled in local currencies.

Several ASEAN economies — including Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand — have begun holding RMB in their reserves and using the digital yuan for energy or commodities transactions.

Middle Eastern exporters are increasingly open to settling oil and gas trades in RMB, drawn by faster and cheaper settlement options.

By creating an alternative financial infrastructure that is faster, cheaper, and sanction-resistant, Beijing directly challenges the three pillars of US dollar dominance: Oil trade, SWIFT intermediaries, and Dollar-denominated reserves.

This is more than economic competition — it's the creation of a parallel financial world.

Why Emerging Economies Are Pivoting to CBDCs
Developing economies today face three choices for international transactions:

* Stay tied to SWIFT and the dollar — slow, expensive, and politically controlled.

* Depend on volatile cryptocurrencies — fast but legally uncertain.

* Adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — fast, sovereign, and regulatory-compliant.

CBDCs, unlike crypto, offer finality, compliance, and legal clarity, making them attractive for governments seeking both financial inclusion and geopolitical autonomy.

China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system.

India's Counter-Strategy: A Democratic Digital Currency
While Beijing races ahead, India is charting its own digital path. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model.

India's approach emphasizes interoperability over dominance. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration.

Key features of India's eRs ecosystem include:
* Retail and wholesale versions: for citizens and institutions alike.

* Offline transaction capability, enabling digital payments in rural and underconnected areas — a unique inclusion measure absent in China's model.

* Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT.

* UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access.

India envisions its digital rupee not just as a national instrument, but as a neutral reserve option within BRICS+, offering smaller economies a trust-based, transparent alternative to both the US dollar and the tightly controlled RMB.

The rise of the Digital RMB and India's eRs signals the dawn of a new financial era. China's model offers speed and state control; India's promises inclusivity and cooperation. Both converge on one truth: the dollar's unchallenged reign is ending — not with confrontation, but with code, connectivity, and currency innovation. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. It might try to coerce or manipulate nations in trade in only dollars and not in other currencies. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well.

As of early 2025, BRICS nations use the yuan for about 24% of intra-bloc trade, while roughly 90% of their total trade is now settled in local currencies.

Several ASEAN economies — including Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand — have begun holding RMB in their reserves and using the digital yuan for energy or commodities transactions.

Middle Eastern exporters are increasingly open to settling oil and gas trades in RMB, drawn by faster and cheaper settlement options.

By creating an alternative financial infrastructure that is faster, cheaper, and sanction-resistant, Beijing directly challenges the three pillars of US dollar dominance: Oil trade, SWIFT intermediaries, and Dollar-denominated reserves.

This is more than economic competition — it's the creation of a parallel financial world.

Why Emerging Economies Are Pivoting to CBDCs
Developing economies today face three choices for international transactions:

* Stay tied to SWIFT and the dollar — slow, expensive, and politically controlled.

* Depend on volatile cryptocurrencies — fast but legally uncertain.

* Adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — fast, sovereign, and regulatory-compliant.

CBDCs, unlike crypto, offer finality, compliance, and legal clarity, making them attractive for governments seeking both financial inclusion and geopolitical autonomy.

China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system.

India's Counter-Strategy: A Democratic Digital Currency
While Beijing races ahead, India is charting its own digital path. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model.

India's approach emphasizes interoperability over dominance. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration.

Key features of India's eRs ecosystem include:
* Retail and wholesale versions: for citizens and institutions alike.

* Offline transaction capability, enabling digital payments in rural and underconnected areas — a unique inclusion measure absent in China's model.

* Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT.

* UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access.

India envisions its digital rupee not just as a national instrument, but as a neutral reserve option within BRICS+, offering smaller economies a trust-based, transparent alternative to both the US dollar and the tightly controlled RMB.


BRICS and Battle For Financial Multipolarity
Within BRICS, the debate over de-dollarisation has shifted from rhetoric to infrastructure.

Russia is using the yuan for more than 30% of its trade after being cut off from SWIFT.

Brazil and South Africa are experimenting with blockchain-based payment systems.

Saudi Arabia, a potential BRICS+ member, has expressed openness to trading oil in non-dollar currencies, including the RMB and INR.

Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems.

The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks.

The Dollar's Future: Still Dominant, but Not Untouchable

The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago.

De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance.

For Washington, this represents not an immediate collapse, but the slow unbundling of financial hegemony — a world where power no longer flows through one currency, one network, or one capital.

* Adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — fast, sovereign, and regulatory-compliant.

CBDCs, unlike crypto, offer finality, compliance, and legal clarity, making them attractive for governments seeking both financial inclusion and geopolitical autonomy.

China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system.

India's Counter-Strategy: A Democratic Digital Currency
While Beijing races ahead, India is charting its own digital path. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model.

India's approach emphasizes interoperability over dominance. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration.

Key features of India's eRs ecosystem include:
* Retail and wholesale versions: for citizens and institutions alike.

* Offline transaction capability, enabling digital payments in rural and underconnected areas — a unique inclusion measure absent in China's model.

* Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT.

* UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access.

India envisions its digital rupee not just as a national instrument, but as a neutral reserve option within BRICS+, offering smaller economies a trust-based, transparent alternative to both the US dollar and the tightly controlled RMB.


BRICS and Battle For Financial Multipolarity
Within BRICS, the debate over de-dollarisation has shifted from rhetoric to infrastructure.

Russia is using the yuan for more than 30% of its trade after being cut off from SWIFT.

Brazil and South Africa are experimenting with blockchain-based payment systems.

Saudi Arabia, a potential BRICS+ member, has expressed openness to trading oil in non-dollar currencies, including the RMB and INR.

Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems.

The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks.

The Dollar's Future: Still Dominant, but Not Untouchable

The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago.

De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance.

For Washington, this represents not an immediate collapse, but the slow unbundling of financial hegemony — a world where power no longer flows through one currency, one network, or one capital. 

The Bottom Line
The rise of the Digital RMB and India's eRs signals the dawn of a new financial era. China's model offers speed and state control; India's promises inclusivity and cooperation. Both converge on one truth: the dollar's unchallenged reign is ending — not with confrontation, but with code, connectivity, and currency innovation. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. It might try to coerce or manipulate nations in trade in only dollars and not in other currencies.

De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance.

For Washington, this represents not an immediate collapse, but the slow unbundling of financial hegemony — a world where power no longer flows through one currency, one network, or one capital. 

The Bottom Line
The rise of the Digital RMB and India's eRs signals the dawn of a new financial era. China's model offers speed and state control; India's promises inclusivity and cooperation. Both converge on one truth: the dollar's unchallenged reign is ending — not with confrontation, but with code, connectivity, and currency innovation. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. It might try to coerce or manipulate nations in trade in only dollars and not in other currencies. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well.

 Zcash rallied over 490% in the last 30 days and also crossed the $5 billion market capitalization threshold for the first time on Sunday. 

Privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash has surged 30% in the last 24 hours after crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes predicted the token would eventually reach $10,000. 

Zcash rallied from $272 to a peak of $355 in the hours after Hayes's bullish prediction in a  “vibe check” post on X on Sunday, with the token outperforming all others in the top 50 coins by market capitalization over the same time frame. 

This isn't the first time Hayes' predictions have been linked to a token's rise. At the August WebX 2025 conference in Tokyo, he stated that Hyperliquid's HYPE token could increase 126 times over the next three years, which resulted in a 4% spike for HYPE. 

Crypto trader and contributor to Binance Square, AB Kuai Dong, speculated in an X post on Sunday that the Zcash rally was likely due to Hayes.

He said the endorsement by a “legendary Silicon Valley investor” drove “everyone to follow the trend and join in, subsequently triggering a full month's FOMO market frenzy.”

At the same time, a user under the handle Clemente, a crypto trader and board member of the treasury company K9Strategy, admitted to jumping in on Zcash because they were filled with “so much fomo I couldn't keep myself sidelined to this run.”

Meanwhile, a trader and investor under the handle JonnyJpegs speculated that the rally was more about users wanting to invest in privacy-related tokens, as more governments attempt to clamp down on encryption and other privacy-related technologies.

Zcash has staged a 490% rally in the last 30 days and also crossed the $5 billion market capitalization threshold for the first time on Sunday, according to CoinGecko.

The token launched in October 2016 and uses an encrypted ledger with zero-knowledge proofs. Transactions can be transparent and publicly viewable, or fully shielded, meaning both the sender and receiver are private, along with the transaction amount.

Fellow privacy-focused coin Monero (XMR), the leading privacy coin by market cap, also gained 3.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at $346. It remains delisted or restricted on most major exchanges, including Binance and OKX, as well as several European trading platforms.

A new clinical study has successfully returned a level of sight to those living with geographic atrophy.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The human eye is an indisputable marvel of evolution. Filled with 120 million rods and 6 million cones, our eyes can distinguish one million colors—multiply that by 100 if you happen to be a rare tetrachromat. But when things go wrong in the eye, all of that sensitive biological engineering, all backed with a 24mm-diameter sphere, can be hard to repair. 

One of the most pernicious conditions that afflicts around five million people worldwide is “geographic atrophy,” or GA, an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration that is one of the leading causes of blindness in people over 50. Dry AMD, as its name suggests, gradually destroys light-sensitive cells in the macula, the part of the eye that processes central vision. This eventually impacts a person's ability to read, drive, or even recognize faces. In some cases it can even lead to total blindness. 

Today there is no known cure for this vision affliction, but a new study led by an international team of scientists has made some serious progress on that front. With the help of a 2mm-by-2mm light-powered microchip, inserted between the lens and the retina, paired with augmented reality (AR) glasses, researchers successfully restored reading-level vision to 84 percent of the participants of the 38-patient study. The results of the study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. 

“In the history of artificial vision, this represents a new era. Blind patients are actually able to have meaningful central vision restoration, which has never been done before,” UCL's Mahi Muqit, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence.”

Called the photovoltaic retina implant microarray, or PRIMA, the chip is inserted beneath the central retina after surgeons perform a vitrectomy, which removes the vitreous gel between the lens and the retina.

Once the eye heals, AR glasses beam infrared signals to the chip, and an artificial intelligence-powered computer worn on the waist processes the data and transforms it into electrical signals that travels through optic nerve cells to the brain. This system also comes with a zoom feature so that patients can learn to read effectively after training for several months. 

According to the researchers, several of the participants in the study couldn't even distinguish a standard vision chart before the operation. Now they can read up to five lines on it. 

“The rehabilitation process is key to these devices. It's not like you're popping a chip in the eye and then you can see again. You need to learn to use this type of vision,” Muqit said in a press statement. “My feeling is that the door is open for medical devices in this area, because there is no treatment currently licensed for dry AMD…I think it's something that, in future, could be used to treat multiple eye conditions.”

Eyes may be an evolutionary wonder, but so too is our scientific ability to understand them and hopefully one day fix them when things go wrong.

The fortress stood undisturbed for two millennia.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ancient Roman army didn't seem to be afraid of anything, but they definitely weren't afraid of heights, as evidenced by the discovery of a 2,000-year-old Roman military camp located 7,000 feet above sea level in the Swiss Alps. 

As archaeologists continue to explore the history of the Roman army in what is now Switzerland, a volunteer unearthed a previously unknown military camp in the mountains, strategically positioned to have tactical views of the surrounding valleys and mountain passes, according to a translated statement from the Canton of Graubünden. 

Not only did archaeologists discover the ditches and a wall of the camp, but they also found lead sling bullets bearing the stamp of the Roman 3rd Legion. That's a helpful giveaway. 

Since 2021, a team from the University of Basel has researched the landscape in the Crap Ses area between Cunter and Tiefencastel in collaboration with the Graubünden Archaeological Service. The focus has been on a Roman battlefield in the Oberhalbstein Alps, located in eastern Switzerland. The research took quite the turn, though, in fall 2023 when a volunteer working on the project discovered what the statement calls “a striking terrain structure in the Colm la Runga corridor,” about 3,000 feet above the battlefield.

Using a high-resolution digital terrain model and LiDAR data, the team investigated the hilltop site. LiDAR features laser scanning of the ground to show even slight height differences in the terrain as a grayscale image, and in the Colm la Runga corridor, it revealed the profile of the artificial fortification of the hilltop.

Resting undisturbed for two millenia 7,000 feet high in the Swiss Alps, the previously unknown Roman military camp was fortified by three ditches and a wall with ramparts. The site of the camp offers a view of four key valleys—Landwassertal, Albulatal, Domleschg, and Surses—and Lenzerheide, a heavily traveled mountain passageway. The perch gave Roman soldiers stationed at the camp a perfect vantage point to spot any incoming enemies.

A team of students from the University of Basel joined volunteers in August to research the structures inside the wall-ditch system. So far, the find has yielded weapons and equipment belonging to Roman soldiers, including lead sling bullets and boot nails. The slingshot lead bears the stamp of the 3rd Legion, which was involved in the battle at Crap Ses, giving experts an obvious tie between the ancient battlefield and the newly discovered military camp. The dating of the artifacts also links the camp to the same period as the battlefield, roughly 2,000 years ago. 

The discovery helps experts track the advancement of Roman forces 2,000 years ago with precision, showing their movement from Bergell over the Septimer Pass to the Tiefencastel area and from there toward Chur and the Alpine Rhine Valley. 

The statement said that the “sensational discovery of a Roman military camp in Graubünden shows once again that archaeological research into ‘Roman Switzerland' continues to hold great surprises.”

Mitochondria transfer is a spontaneous process that releases functional mitochondria to damaged cells via different mechanisms including extracellular vesicle containing mitochondria (EV-Mito) to restore mitochondrial functions. However, the limited EV-Mito yield makes it challenging to supply a sufficient quantity of functional mitochondria to damaged cells, hindering their application in mitochondrial diseases. Here, we show that the release of EV-Mito from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is regulated by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving CD38 and IP3R signaling (CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway). Activating this pathway through our non-viral gene engineering approach generates super donor MSCs which produce Super-EV-Mito with a threefold increase in yield compared to Ctrl-EV-Mito from normal MSCs. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a classic mitochondrial disease caused by mtDNA mutations, is used as a proof-of-concept model. Super-EV-Mito rescues mtDNA defects and alleviates LHON-associated symptoms in LHON male mice. This strategy offers a promising avenue for enhancing mitochondria transfer efficiency and advancing its clinical application in mitochondrial disorders.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is the source and key hallmark of mitochondrial disorders, with a minimum prevalence of 1 in 5000 adults1. However, effective therapeutic strategies are currently lacking for many mitochondrial diseases in clinical practice2,3. Notably, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) refers to a classical mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which encodes key proteins related to mitochondrial function4,5. Although some antioxidant drugs and nutritional support can assist in the treatment of LHON, there is currently no effective therapeutic approach targeting the mitochondrial dysfunction underlying LHON6.

Mitochondria transplantation is an effective approach for restoring mitochondrial functions in patients with mitochondrial diseases because the dysfunctional mitochondria are replenished by exogenous functional mitochondria7,8,9. This approach involves directly transplanting isolated free mitochondria into the lesion site. However, studies on mitochondria transplantation are still in their relatively early stages. Since the first reported application of mitochondria transplantation in treating mitochondrial disorders in 2009, only two clinical studies have been published (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02586298 and NCT04976140). Advancement of this technology is hindered by the lack of selective identification of dysfunctional cells and the rapid inactivation of isolated mitochondria outside the cell10,11. Therefore, developing an effective method to deliver functional mitochondria specifically into damaged cells is a critical yet challenging objective.

Inspired by the natural intercellular transfer of mitochondria, healthy cells can deliver mitochondria to injured cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs)12, intercellular nanotube connections13, and other mechanisms in an attempt to repair mitochondrial dysfunction14. Accumulating evidence indicated that the paracrine effect of stem cells is a key mechanism underlying their ability to repair damaged cells15,16. This is primarily because stem cells transfer healthy mitochondria to injured recipient cells via extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EV-Mito), thereby compensating for the functional impairment of damaged mitochondria17. In this phenomenon, EV-Mito not only protects mitochondrial activity through the membrane structure of EVs but also selectively recognizes damaged recipient cells for functional mitochondrial delivery18,19,20,21. This approach appears to address the main challenges of mitochondria transplantation technology: the lack of selectivity and the rapid deactivation of isolated mitochondria. Consequently, some studies are now focusing on collecting EV-Mito for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases. However, these studies have uncovered a challenge: the limited mitochondrial mass of stem cells as donor cells restricts the mitochondrial content of EV-Mito22,23. Addressing how to create super donor cells capable of generating more high-quality EV-Mito would expand this platform's scalability and enhance its feasibility for treating mitochondrial diseases.

In this study, we demonstrate that the release of EV-Mito from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is regulated by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving CD38 and inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) signaling (CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway). Furthermore, we develop our non-viral gene delivery vectors called CAP (C: N,N-cystamine-bis-acrylamide, A: agmatine dihydrochloride, P: p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonic acid) to load a CD38 plasmid, forming CAP/pCD38 complexes24,25. These CAP/pCD38 complexes are used to genetically engineer adipose-derived MSCs, thereby activating the CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway in MSCs. Genetically engineered MSCs using CAP/pCD38 complexes release extracellular mitochondrial particles at 3 times the level of untreated MSCs, indicating that this approach produces super donor MSCs for more EV-Mito. To validate the therapeutic efficacy of super donor MSC-derived EV-Mito (Super-EV-Mito) in mitochondrial diseases, we introduce LHON cell and LHON-like male mouse models. We find that Super-EV-Mito significantly enhances the cellular uptake of exogenous mitochondria, alleviating LHON disease symptoms. Meanwhile, Super-EV-Mito demonstrates mitochondrial function restoration in both rotenone (Rot)-induced widespread mitochondrial damage models at the cellular and mouse levels, further expanding their potential applications in other mitochondrial diseases. As mitochondria serve as the primary therapeutic agent in mitochondria transplantation, their activity and quantity inevitably influence the efficiency of mitochondria transplantation. Our study suggests that genetically engineered stem cells can generate super-donor cells, thereby providing a greater quantity and higher quality mitochondrial material for mitochondria transplantation.

Mitochondria transplantation is an effective treatment for mitochondrial disorders; however, it is restricted by the limited selectivity in recipient cells and loss of mitochondrial activity in isolated mitochondria. Fortunately, mitochondria transfer as a spontaneous process selectively delivers functional mitochondria to damaged cells, thereby overcoming the aforementioned limitations26. Meanwhile, accumulating evidences suggest that the paracrine effects of stem cells, including the extracellular release of mitochondrial particles, constitute a key mechanism underlying their ability to repair damaged cells15. Therefore, stem cells are widely used as donor cells in studies of mitochondria transfer27,28. We attempted to investigate the pathways regulating the secretion of EV-Mito by MSCs and explored whether enhancing these pathways could increase the yield of EV-Mito.

Previous studies have identified that the release of extracellular mitochondrial particles by donor cells, such as astrocytes and osteoblasts, is mediated by CD38 signaling29,30. Therefore, we aim to elucidate how CD38-mediated pathways influence the release of EV-Mito. We employed the exogenous supplementation of CD38 plasmid DNA (pCD38) to upregulate CD38 expression in MSCs and observe changes in the genetically engineered MSCs. To construct genetically engineered MSCs, we introduced our previously developed polymeric material, named CAP [C: N,N'-cystamine-bis-acrylamide (CBA), A: agmatine dihydrochloride (Agm), P: 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonamide (PAEBS)]24. Before conducting formal experiments, we confirmed the structure of the synthesized CAP and characterized the CAP/pDNA complexes. CAP was synthesized following the procedure described in a previous study (Supplementary Fig. 1) and verified using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 2)24. Subsequently, the pDNA binding capacity of CAP was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results demonstrated that CAP could completely bind pDNA at the weight ratio of 5:1 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Additionally, nanoparticle sizes and zeta potentials of the CAP/pDNA complex were approximately 102.3 ± 1.8 nm and 20.9 ± 0.9 mV, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4). CAP contains disulfide bonds within its linkers, allowing degradation in the intracellular reductive environment of MSCs and the rapid gene release. To simulate the intracellular reductive conditions and investigate the degradation of CAP, we used dithiothreitol (DTT) to mimic the intracellular reductive environment of MSCs. The pDNA was released after 10 mM DTT treatment (2 h), indicating that the vector material had degraded for gene release (Supplementary Fig. 5)31,32. The transfection efficiency of CAP/pGFP complexes was significantly superior to that of PEI 25 K/pGFP complexes and Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (Lipo3000)/pGFP complexes, where PEI 25 K and Lipo3000 are widely considered the gold standards for plasmid gene transfection (Supplementary Fig. 6). One of the purposes of gene delivery of stem cells is to engineer stem cells to have certain functions or secrete certain proteins to act on target sites33. Low toxicity gene vectors are essential for gene transfection and future applications in vivo. We performed MTT assay to investigate the cellular viability of the CAP vector. It can be found that CAP/pDNA complexes had no obvious toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 7). These results indicated that CAP offered both higher transfection efficiency and better safety compared to Lipo3000, making it more suitable for engineering MSCs in the subsequent research applications.

We obtained genetically engineered MSCs and analyzed them using gene ontology (GO) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, these results between normal MSCs and CD38-enhanced MSCs indicated that CD38 upregulation affected calcium-dependent pathways, accompanied by alterations in the extracellular region, extracellular space, positive regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and positive regulation of mitochondrial fission. Therefore, we hypothesized that the mitochondrial functions and the release of EV-Mito from MSCs may be regulated by a mechanism involving CD38 and Ca2+ up-regulation.

Data are presented as mean ± SD. n = 3 biologically independent samples for each in (B, D–K), n = 5 biologically independent samples for each in (L).

We confirmed the expression of CD38 based on CAP. Lipo3000 was set as the positive control group. CAP-mediated plasmid gene delivery obviously promoted the expression of CD38 in MSCs compared with the untreated and Lipo3000 groups, suggesting that CAP enabled the upregulation of CD38 expression in MSCs (Fig. 1B). In addition, CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of the calcium-mobilizing second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)29, resulting in a significant elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels (Supplementary Fig. 8A). Mitochondria are major intracellular calcium stores34,35. However, it is currently unclear whether CD38 regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ to control the release of EV-Mito in MSCs. Based on the fact that IP3R is the receptor responsible for calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria and that most actively secreted cellular events involve calcium regulation, we examined IP3R/mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling as a possible mechanism driving extracellular mitochondria release from MSCs36. Immunofluorescence and Western blot assays demonstrated that CAP-mediated upregulation of CD38 enhanced IP3R expression in MSCs (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 8B). Subsequently, CAP/pDNA enhanced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ level compared to the other groups (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, Mitotracker Green (MTG) was carried out to stain mitochondria of MSCs. After untreated, Lipo3000/pCD38, or CAP/pCD38 complex treatment, the normalized fluorescence intensity (FI) of MTG-labeled EV-Mito in condition medium was detected using the multifunctional microplate reader. As shown in Fig. 1E, CAP exhibited a higher normalized FI of MTG compared with the untreated and Lipo3000, revealing that the upregulation of CD38 led to an increased release of mitochondria in extracellular spaces by MSCs. These findings suggested that the upregulation of CD38 may promote IP3R expression and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ level in MSCs, enhancing an increased release of EV-Mito in the extracellular space.

Furthermore, we identified the IP3R siRNA to suppress IP3R expression. Our results showed that the CAP/pCD38 complex promoted CD38 expression, consistent with the result in Fig. 1B. However, IP3R knockdown (KD) did not affect CD38 expression (Fig. 1F). Notably, IP3R KD significantly inhibited CD38-mediated IP3R activation (Fig. 1G). These findings suggested that CD38 upregulation enhanced IP3R expression and the inhibition of IP3R did not exert a negative feedback effect on CD38 expression. In addition, the upregulation of CD38 increased mitochondrial Ca²⁺ concentration, while blocking IP3R expression significantly inhibited the CD38-induced rise in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ levels (Fig. 1H). Additionally, IP3R knockdown also reduced the release of mitochondria into the extracellular space by MSCs (Fig. 1I).

Previous studies have shown that elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ promotes vesicle-plasma membrane fusion, facilitating the release of EVs and their cargo37,38. Pharmacological inhibition studies further demonstrated that the release of EV-Mito was markedly suppressed by actin polymerization inhibitors, whereas tubulin inhibitors had no obvious effect (Supplementary Fig. 8C, D), suggesting that EV-Mito release is actin-dependent but independent of tubulin dynamics39. This mechanistic insight highlighted a calcium-sensitive, actin-dependent vesicle trafficking pathway as a key contributor to EV-Mito secretion.

To investigate whether the upregulation of CD38 gene expression mediated by the CAP/pCD38 complex negatively impacts mitochondrial function in MSCs, we assessed mitochondrial respiratory function in MSCs using the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) analysis. The OCR curve in CAP/pCD38-treated MSCs was higher than untreated normal MSCs (Fig. 1J, K), demonstrating that the upregulation of CD38 expression not only did not impair the mitochondrial respiratory chain function in MSCs but may actually enhance it. This could be due to the upregulation of CD38 activating processes such as cellular metabolic process (Fig. 1A), which in turn enhanced mitochondrial functions. MMP measurement was used to assess the effects of CAP/pCD38 treatment on mitochondrial integrity. As shown in Fig. 1L, the ratio of mitochondria with normal MMP to those with depolarized MMP in CAP/pCD38-treated MSCs was significantly higher than that in untreated MSCs, indicating that CD38-mediated Ca²⁺ elevation did not compromise MMP.

Therefore, upregulating CD38 expression in MSCs enhanced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ content through IP3R activation, leading to improved mitochondrial activity and augmented mitochondrial release as EV-Mito (Fig. 1M). At the same time, the upregulation of CD38 did not negatively affect mitochondrial respiratory function and MMP level in donor cells (MSCs).

A series of experimental validations demonstrated that the release of EV-Mito from MSCs was regulated by the CD38/IP3R/Ca²⁺ pathway. Based on these findings, we genetically engineered MSCs using CAP/pCD38 complexes to create super donor MSCs. In brief, we utilized the gold-standard plasmid gene transfection reagent (Lipo3000) and our previously developed non-viral gene delivery vector (CAP) to load the pCD38, forming Lipo3000/pCD38 and CAP/pCD38 complexes. These complexes were used to genetically engineer adipose-derived MSCs, thereby activating the CD38/IP3R/Ca²⁺ pathway in MSCs. After treating MSCs with Lipo3000/pCD38 or CAP/pCD38 for 4 h, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium. MSCs were incubated for an additional 20 h or 44 h. The condition medium was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris, followed by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min to eliminate residual impurities. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min to obtain EV-Mito as a pellet. In subsequent experiments, EV-Mito collected from untreated MSCs was designated as Ctrl-EV-Mito, this from Lipo3000/pCD38-treated MSCs as Lipo-EV-Mito, and this from CAP/pCD38-treated MSCs as Super-EV-Mito (Fig. 2A).

Characterization of the CAP/pCD38-treated EV-Mito (Super-EV-Mito) revealed the particle sizes ranging from 350 to 950 nm (Fig. 2B). The zeta potential of Super-EV-Mito was −1.76 ± 0.27 (Supplementary Table 1). Multimodality Structured Illumination Microscopy (multi-SIM) imaging system was used to observe Super-EV-Mito. Before multi-SIM imaging, MSC membranes and mitochondria were labeled with DiO and Mitotracker Red dyes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2C, DiO-labeled membrane structures enveloped Mitotracker Red-labeled mitochondria. Mitotracker Red fluorescence signals were observed within individual Super-EV-Mito, confirming that Super-EV-Mito contained mitochondria. It has been reported that not all released mitochondria are encapsulated within EVs; a portion may indeed exist in the form of free mitochondria. We conducted nano-flow cytometry analysis to quantify the proportion of released mitochondria encapsulated in EVs. The result showed that approximately 24.87 ± 2.76% of mitochondrial particles were double-positive, indicating their encapsulation within EVs, while the remaining mitochondria were FITC-positive, suggesting that they existed as free mitochondria (Fig. 2D). However, the double-positive population in nano-flow cytometry only reflects the proportion of mitochondria associated with EVs and does not directly visualize how many mitochondria are present within individual EVs. To address this, we further quantified the mitochondrial content within EVs using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Statistical evaluation of Super-EV-Mito TEM images revealed that 6 out of every 10 released mitochondria were encapsulated in EVs, while the remaining 4 existed in a free form (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. 9). There is heterogeneity in EV-Mito structures.

To further investigate whether the quantity and quality of mitochondria contained within Super-EV-Mito are improved after activation of the CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway, we used Western blot assay and flow cytometry for assessing the quantity of EVs collected from each group. Subsequently, we evaluated the mitochondrial quality within the EVs using mitochondrial ROS level and basal respiration detection.

Western blot assay was carried out to explore the expressions of key EV membrane markers (CD81) and mitochondrial proteins (MT-ND4 and COX IV) under equal protein loading conditions. The bands for the key EV membrane proteins and mitochondrial proteins in the Super-EV-Mito were stronger compared to those in the Ctrl-EV-Mito and Lipo-EV-Mito, indicating an increased release of EV-Mito in the Super-EV-Mito group (Fig. 2F). Flow cytometry was further employed to quantify mitochondrial content, based on MTG mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and positivity ratios. As shown in Fig. 2G, the MTG positivity ratio was 17.7% in the Ctrl-EV-Mito group, while the MTG positivity ratios in the Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito groups were significantly higher, reaching 51.7% and 55.2%, respectively. The data confirmed that the activation of the CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway led to the generation of super-donor MSCs, from which a greater quantity of mitochondria-containing EVs (Super-EV-Mito) could be collected.

Furthermore, we assessed the mitochondrial activity in the Super-EV-Mito by measuring mitochondrial ROS and basal respiration. MitoSOX probe was employed to assess mitochondrial ROS levels within EV-Mito, reflecting the functional activity of mitochondria in these EVs. The MitoSOX/MTG intensity in Super-EV-Mito was lower than the EV-Mito group, suggesting that CD38 activation enhanced the quality of mitochondria encapsulated within these EVs (Fig. 2H). In addition, we investigated whether Super-EV-Mito contains more functional mitochondria by assessing the basal respiration. We established a standard curve correlating Mitotracker Green fluorescence intensity with mitochondrial protein concentration (Fig. 2I (i)). Based on this calibration, we quantified the basal respiration per unit of mitochondrial protein using OCR assays. As shown in Fig. 2I (ii), the basal respiration per unit mitochondrial protein in Super-EV-Mito was significantly higher than that in Ctrl-EV-Mito and Lipo-EV-Mito.

We evaluated the mitochondrial function in EV-Mito at different time points to reflect the stability of mitochondria within EV-Mito. We isolated free mitochondria from CAP/pCD38 complex-treated MSCs as a control group (called isolated mitochondria from Super MSCs). As shown in Fig. 2J, the basal respiration of Super-EV-Mito, as measured by OCR, remained relatively stable for up to two days. In contrast, the mitochondrial function of isolated mitochondria from Super MSCs dropped significantly starting on the first day, showing lower activity compared to the Super-EV-Mito group. The finding indicated that mitochondria encapsulated within EVs exhibited superior functional stability, maintaining their activity for at least two days. We speculated that this stability was mainly attributed to the membrane structure of Super-EV-Mito, which protected mitochondrial activity. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the mitochondrial activity in Super-EV-Mito and isolated mitochondria under conditions of high extracellular Ca²⁺. The rapid deactivation of isolated mitochondria in the extracellular environment is primarily attributed to the interference of high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations40. The Ca²⁺ concentration gradient (0, 0.0001, 1.25, and 2.5 mM) was used to simulate the mitochondrial functionality of Super-EV-Mito under cytosolic, extracellular, and blood calcium conditions, respectively. Accordingly, we assessed changes in MMP using the MMP-dependent Mitotracker Red probe (MTR) to characterize mitochondrial functional alterations under high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. We measured the FI of MTR in Super-EV-Mito and isolated mitochondria from Super MSCs without any treatment at 0 h using a multifunctional microplate reader, designated as FIS and FII, respectively. After 24 h of treatment with varying concentrations of Ca²⁺, the FI of Super-EV-Mito and isolated mitochondria was measured. The normalized FI of MTR for Super-EV-Mito = FI after treatment/FIS × 100%. Similarly, the normalized FI of MTR for isolated mitochondria from Super MSCs = FI after treatment/FII × 100%. As the concentrations of Ca²⁺ increased, the normalized FI of MTR in the Super-EV-Mito group remained above 70%, whereas the normalized FI of MTR in isolated mitochondria showed an obvious decrease compared with Super-EV-Mito. Our results demonstrated that the membrane structure of Super-EV-Mito protected mitochondria from Ca²⁺-induced MMP loss, suggesting that Super-EV-Mito was likely to preserve mitochondrial function under high Ca²⁺ conditions and resist external stress (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Therefore, the Super-EV-Mito collected by activating the CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway in MSCs exhibited a higher quantity and mitochondrial activity compared to the Ctrl-EV-Mito collected from normal MSCs. This also indicated that the activation of the CD38/IP3R/Ca2+ pathway led to the generation of super-donor cells, thereby holding the potential to provide a greater quantity and higher quality mitochondrial material for mitochondria transfer therapy.

LHON is a classical ocular mitochondrial disease resulting from mutations in mtDNA that encode key proteins related to mitochondrial function. Abnormalities in mtDNA encoding three subunits of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain are primary pathogenic factors in more than 95% of LHON cases. Notably, 90% of Asian LHON patients are closely associated with a homoplasmic nucleotide substitution of guanine to adenine at position 11778 in mtDNA41. The mutations at this site lead to a functional abnormality in the key protein ND4 of mitochondrial complex I, causing mitochondrial dysfunctions, including mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction, decreased ATP generation, and MMP depolarization42. To investigate the therapeutic effects of Super-EV-Mito in mitochondrial diseases, we utilized LHON model cells (GM10742 cells) and evaluated the mitochondrial functional restoration capacity of different formulations after administration43.

The cellular uptake of Super-EV-Mito in GM10742 cells was explored by flow cytometry analysis. We transduced MSCs with a viral vector encoding mEmerald-TOMM20 to specifically label mitochondria within the MSCs. We then utilized mEmerald-TOMM20-labeled Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito, and Super-EV-Mito to track uptake in recipient cells. Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito, and Super-EV-Mito exhibited varying levels of mitochondrial uptake in recipient GM10742 cells. Among these, Super-EV-Mito increased the MFI of mEmerald-TOMM20 compared to the other EV-Mito, likely due to the higher content of mitochondria in Super-EV-Mito (Fig. 3A).

Data are presented as mean ± SD. n = 3 biologically independent samples for each in (A, E–K). n = 8 biologically independent samples for each in (C). Statistical significances were performed via one-way ANOVA with two-sided Tukey's HSD post hoc test (A, F, H, J, K) or two-sided Games-Howell test (C, G, I). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed via two-sided hypergeometric test (L).

Subsequently, we systematically investigated whether the introduction of EV-Mito could effectively improve mitochondrial function in GM10742 cells with mtDNA mutations. The expression of mitochondrial ND4 protein (MT-ND4) in GM10742 cells was limited due to the mutations at position 11778 in mtDNA. Super-EV-Mito promoted the MT-ND4 expression in GM10742 cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 11A). Super-EV-Mito treatment increased COX IV expression compared with Ctrl-EV-Mito treatment (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 11B). This demonstrated that EV-Mito could increase the levels of mitochondrial proteins. The JC-1 is a fluorescent dye commonly used to assess MMP44,45. In functional mitochondria with high MMP, JC-1 aggregates form and emit red fluorescence. JC-1 remains in its monomeric form when MMP is low. The green fluorescence of monomers in the untreated and Ctrl-EV-Mito-treated GM10742 cells was higher than that in the Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito-treated GM10742 cells. In contrast, the red fluorescence of aggregates in the untreated GM10742 cells was weaker than that in the Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito-treated GM10742 cells. The ratio of red to green fluorescence provides a quantitative measure of MMP, making it a reliable indicator of mitochondrial health and function. The value of red/green fluorescence intensity after Super-EV-Mito treatment was obviously higher than the untreated group (Fig. 3C, D). It suggested that untreated GM10742 cells exhibited abnormalities in MMP, which could be improved through the supplementation of exogenous mitochondria provided by Super-EV-Mito. Furthermore, the mitochondrial respiratory chain function of GM10742 cells after treatment with different formulations was evaluated using OCR assays. Super-EV-Mito significantly enhanced the spare respiratory capacity and maximum respiration of GM10742 cells, indicating that Super-EV-Mito treatment improved the mitochondrial respiratory chain function in mtDNA-mutant GM10742 cells (Fig. 3E–G). Additionally, intracellular ATP levels and mitochondrial ROS levels were measured, revealing that Super-EV-Mito effectively increased ATP production while reducing mitochondrial ROS levels in GM10742 cells (Fig. 3H, I). The opening of the mPTP is another critical indicator of mitochondrial functionality. Excessive opening of mPTP is often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The degree of mPTP opening was assessed using Calcein fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3J, untreated GM10742 cells exhibited relatively low Calcein fluorescence. After treatment with Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito, and Super-EV-Mito, Calcein fluorescence values progressively increased, with the highest levels observed in the Super-EV-Mito group, suggesting that Super-EV-Mito produced the best therapeutic effect on mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the EdU assay was applied to investigate cellular proliferation. Due to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mtDNA mutations, untreated GM10742 cells displayed limited proliferative capacity. Super-EV-Mito provided “energy” to GM10742 cells by supplementing exogenous mitochondria, thereby enhancing their proliferative capacity (Fig. 3K). After being treated with Super-EV-Mito, GM10742 cells were collected for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The significantly differentially expressed genes between untreated GM10742 cells and Super-EV-Mito-treated GM10742 cells were enriched in mitochondrial metabolism, AMPK signaling pathway, and mitophagy (Fig. 3L).

We further investigated the long-term therapeutic potential of Super-EV-Mito by examining both their persistence in GM10742 cells and their sustained ability to restore mitochondrial function. Our results showed that mtDNA originating from donor rat mitochondria could persist in GM10742 cells for up to 5 days post-administration (Supplementary Fig. 12A). Furthermore, a single administration of Super-EV-Mito led to significantly improved mitochondrial function in GM10742 cells, which was maintained for up to 5 days (Supplementary Fig. 12B).

In summary, Super-EV-Mito effectively delivered exogenous mitochondria to LHON model cells, restoring mitochondrial functions, including MMP, ATP production, mitochondrial ROS levels, and mPTP opening. This restoration enhanced the proliferative capacity of LHON model cells. Furthermore, as Super-EV-Mito contain a greater quantity of mitochondria with superior functionality, the therapeutic efficacy of the Super-EV-Mito treatment group in vitro was superior to the Ctrl-EV-Mito treatment group.

Given the exceptional mitochondrial function restoration achieved by Super-EV-Mito in GM10742 cells, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Super-EV-Mito for mitochondrial disease in the LHON male mouse model. The safety of Super-EV-Mito was assessed in vivo. Various doses of Super-EV-Mito were set and administrated in the normal C57BL/6J male mice, including 1-fold (Super-EV-Mito-1), 2-fold (Super-EV-Mito-2) and 4-fold (Super-EV-Mito-4) Super-EV-Mito. Different doses of Super-EV-Mito were administered again 7 days after the first administration. 14 days after the second administration, whole blood and serum samples were collected from mice in each group for routine hematological analysis and liver and kidney function tests (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 13A, B, even at high doses, Super-EV-Mito-4 did not induce systemic toxicity in mice, nor did it cause significant damage to the retina or major organs. However, direct transplantation of MSCs into the eye appeared to negatively impact the structural integrity of the retinal layers and led to elevated expression of inflammation-related proteins (Supplementary Fig. 13C)46,47. Therefore, Super-EV-Mito exhibited a high level of in vivo safety. Prior to conducting formal efficacy studies in vivo, we assessed the in vivo persistence of donor-derived mtDNA in ocular tissues to evaluate the long-term therapeutic potential of Super-EV-Mito. Following a single intravitreal administration, donor rat mtDNA remained detectable in the eye for up to 14 days (Supplementary Fig. 12C).

LHON model male mice were purchased from Aurora Bioscience Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, China). A mitochondria-targeted adeno-associated virus (MTS-AAV) containing the mutant human ND4 gene (mutND4), followed by mitochondrial-encoded mCherry, was microinjected into zygotes. Female founders (F0) exhibiting mCherry fluorescence on ophthalmoscopy were backcrossed with normal males for producing the first generation of offspring (F1): mutant ND4 C57BL/6 J male mice48. The therapeutic effect of Super-EV-Mito was evaluated in LHON model male mice (Fig. 4A). Specifically, three-month-old LHON model male mice received an initial treatment, followed by a second treatment seven days later. After two weeks, the optomotor test and electroretinography (ERG) assessments were conducted on all groups of mice. Furthermore, the eyeballs were collected for intraocular ATP level measurement and retinal H&E sections. Additionally, we introduced Idebenone (Ide), the only drug currently approved for adjunctive treatment of LHON, as a positive control group49. Visual recovery in each group was evaluated using the optomotor test and ERG assessments. For the optomotor test, a rotating drum with alternating black-and-white striped circular panels was constructed. The drum was rotated clockwise for 2 min, followed by 1 min of rest, and then rotated counterclockwise for another 2 min. Video recordings were used to count the number of head turns made by each mouse within the 2-minute rotation periods. The results showed that wild-type male mice (WT group) exhibited an average of 15.00 ± 1.41 head movements/2 min, while PBS-treated LHON model male mice showed only 6.71 ± 0.76 head movements/2 min, indicating severe visual impairment in the LHON male mice. Ide treatment via daily oral administration resulted in partial visual recovery, whereas mice treated with Super-EV-Mito demonstrated significantly better visual recovery compared to the Ide group (Fig. 4B). ERG, as an important diagnostic tool for detecting retinal and choroidal hereditary diseases, was utilized to evaluate retinal function in mice after different treatments. ERG assessments were conducted on mice following 24 h of dark adaptation. The ERG waveforms of WT male mice, PBS-treated, Ide-treated, and Super-EV-Mito-treated LHON model male mice were shown in Fig. 4C. Statistical analysis of the amplitude variations in a-wave and b-wave revealed that PBS-treated LHON model male mice showed a significant decrease in the absolute amplitudes of both the a-wave and b-wave relative to wild-type males. However, treatment with Super-EV-Mito markedly restored the absolute values of both waves, with the b-wave amplitude recovering to levels comparable to those of wild-type male mice (Fig. 4D, E). H&E staining sections were carried out to analyze the retinal structure (Fig. 4F). Retinal layer thickness and RGC counts were quantified from H&E-stained sections. Super-EV-Mito significantly increased retinal layer thickness and restored RGC numbers (Fig. 4G, H). Both parameters in the Super-EV-Mito-treated group showed no significant differences compared to WT mice, indicating that Super-EV-Mito effectively repaired retinal structures. Further investigation into the total expression of MT-ND4 protein in LHON model male mice after different treatments revealed that Super-EV-Mito treatment restored ND4 protein expression in the eyes by supplying exogenous functional mitochondria. Western blot analysis of mitochondrial COX IV protein showed that mitochondria transplantation mediated by Super-EV-Mito increased the number of exogenous mitochondria, thereby elevating COX IV protein expression in the eyes of the mice (Fig. 4I, J). ATP generation in the eyes of the mice was further assessed. The mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mtDNA mutations resulted in significantly lower ATP content in the eyes of PBS-treated LHON model male mice compared to wild-type mice. Super-EV-Mito treatment significantly increased ATP content in the eyes (Fig. 4K).

Inspired by the therapeutic efficacy of Super-EV-Mito in the mtDNA mutant LHON male mice, we investigated their potential to supplement exogenous functional mitochondria for the treatment of a broader range of mitochondrial disorders, beyond primary mitochondrial disorder stemmed from mtDNA mutations. To this end, we utilized Rot, a chemical inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, to establish a Rot-induced mitochondrial disease model. As noted in previous studies, Rot-induced cell and male mouse models have been widely used as models for various mitochondrial diseases, including LHON and Parkinson's disease. The binding sites of Rot are located within complex I, specifically targeting regions such as decylubiquinone and the ND4 subunit, resulting in complex I dysfunction50,51.

The Rot-damaged cell model was established by pre-treating HeLa cells with 0.1 µM Rot, and the cellular uptake of exogenous mitochondria and mitochondrial functional restoration effects of Super-EV-Mito were assessed in this model. Mitochondria from donor cells (MSCs) were labeled by mEmerald-TOMM20, and mitochondria-enriched vesicles were obtained following untreated, Lipo3000/pCD38, or CAP/pCD38 transfection. Rot-induced cells were treated with EV-Mito from different groups, and the MFI of mEmerald-TOMM20 in Rot-induced cells was analyzed using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The data exhibited that Rot-damaged cells treated with Super-EV-Mito exhibited the highest fluorescence intensity, indicating that Super-EV-Mito-mediated mitochondria transfer was feasible even in Rot-damaged cells (Fig. 5A, B). In addition, we conducted uptake inhibition experiments to investigate the mechanism by which mEmerald-TOMM20-labeled Super EV-Mito was internalized into the cytoplasm of recipient cells. As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 14, we found that Super-EV-Mito entered recipient cells via multiple endocytic pathways, with macropinocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis being the predominant mechanisms.

Data are presented as mean ± SD. n = 3 biologically independent samples for each in (A, F–I, N, O). n = 7 biologically independent samples for each in (D), n = 7 independent process of optomotor tests for each in (K). Statistical significances were performed via one-way ANOVA with two-sided Tukey's HSD post hoc test (A, D, G–I, N, O) or two-sided Games-Howell test (F, K).

In Rot-induced cells, mitochondrial damage led to reduced MMP, whereas Super-EV-Mito treatment restored MMP to levels comparable to the PBS group without Rot exposure (Fig. 5C, D). Given that Rot also damages the ND4 protein site within mitochondrial complex I, the Rot + untreated group exhibited lower MT-ND4 expression than the untreated group. Super-EV-Mito restored MT-ND4 expression by introducing exogenous mitochondria (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. 15). Moreover, Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito, and Super-EV-Mito all increased ATP content in Rot-damaged cells (Fig. 5F) and reduced mitochondrial ROS accumulation induced by Rot (Fig. 5G). Super-EV-Mito markedly reduced mPTP opening, as indicated by higher Calcein Green fluorescence (Fig. 5H). Most importantly, all vesicle formulations enhanced the proliferation capacity of Rot-induced cells to varying degrees, with Super-EV-Mito showing the most pronounced effect (Fig. 5I). These findings suggested that Super-EV-Mito not only restored mitochondrial functions in mtDNA-mutated LHON cells but also regulated mitochondrial function in Rot-induced cells with widespread mitochondrial damage, ultimately rescuing cell proliferation activity.

Based on our research and studies from other investigators, a Rot-induced male mouse model was established to simulate ocular mitochondrial diseases associated with widespread mitochondrial dysfunction by intravitreal injection of 2.5 mM Rot42,52. The first treatment was administered on day 7 post-modeling, followed by a second treatment on day 14. On day 28, visual function in mice was evaluated (Fig. 5J). Optomotor response testing showed that Super-EV-Mito significantly restored visual impairment caused by Rot (Fig. 5K). Rot exposure led to a decline in complex I expression in the retinal layers, particularly in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL). Treatment with Super-EV-Mito promoted the upregulation of complex I expression (Fig. 5L). H&E staining revealed that Rot induced severe retinal structural damage, including a marked reduction in retinal layer thickness and RGC numbers. After Super-EV-Mito treatment, both retinal layer thickness and RGC counts were significantly improved (Fig. 5M–O).

A series of studies conducted on gene-mutated LHON cells and the LHON male mouse model demonstrated that Super-EV-Mito could effectively supplement exogenous mitochondria via efficient mitochondria transfer, thereby restoring mitochondrial function and achieving effective treatment of LHON (Fig. 6). Furthermore, Super-EV-Mito effectively mitigated disease progression by enhancing mitochondria transfer efficiency and promoting the mitochondrial functions in the Rot-induced pan-mitochondrial disease model.

Mitochondrial diseases, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, affect a minimum prevalence of 1 in 5000 adults. However, the majority of mitochondrial diseases currently lack effective treatments. Mitochondria transfer is a natural process where functional mitochondria are released into damaged cells via EV-Mito to restore mitochondrial function under pathological conditions. To overcome the challenges of limited yield and quality of mitochondria-enriched EVs, which hinder their therapeutic potential for mitochondrial diseases, we employed our previously engineered non-viral transfection vector (CAP) to deliver the pCD38 into MSCs. This approach activates the CD38/IP3R/Ca²⁺ pathway, thereby generating super donor cells. These super donor cells produced EV-Mito (termed Super-EV-Mito) containing 3 times the mitochondrial content of normal MSC-derived EVs, with significantly enhanced mitochondrial quality. This strategy not only enabled the collection of a greater number of high-quality EV-Mito, reducing the production cost of Super-EV-Mito-mediated mitochondria transfer therapy but also utilized the membrane structure of EVs to preserve mitochondrial activity.

We explored the mechanism by which CD38 signaling promotes the release of EV-Mito: (1) CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of the calcium-mobilizing second messenger cADPR, resulting in a significant elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels; (2) Mitochondria are important intracellular calcium stores. We observed that upregulation of CD38 expression led to increased expression of IP3Rs on the ER. These IP3Rs rapidly mediate Ca²⁺ transfer to mitochondria. (3) Previous studies have shown that elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ levels can trigger the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, driving vesicle-plasma membrane fusion and facilitating EV release. As shown in Fig. 2G, the MTG positivity ratio was 17.7% in the Ctrl-EV-Mito group, while the MTG positivity ratios in the Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito groups were significantly higher, reaching 51.7% and 55.2%, respectively.

To further determine whether activation of the CD38/IP3R/Ca²⁺ signaling pathway enhances both the quantity and quality of mitochondria encapsulated within Super-EV-Mito, we conducted a series of assays including Western blot, flow cytometry, and TEM to quantify EVs derived from different groups. In addition, we assessed mitochondrial quality by mitochondrial ROS level and basal respiration detection. These results collectively demonstrated that activation of the CD38/IP3R/Ca²⁺ axis induces the generation of super donor MSCs, which produce EVs with both increased mitochondrial payload and improved mitochondrial functionality. This strategy may thus serve as a promising approach for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of mitochondria transfer.

In both a typical ocular mitochondrial disease model of LHON and a Rot-induced mitochondrial disease model, Super-EV-Mito alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction-associated vision loss in mice. In mitochondrial diseases, pathogenic mutations in mtDNA often coexist with wild-type mtDNA in a state known as heteroplasmy. The severity of such diseases is closely linked to the proportion of mutant mtDNA, with a well-recognized threshold effect-clinical symptoms typically emerge when the proportion of mutant mtDNA exceeds ~60%. Consequently, strategies aimed at reducing the mutant load below this pathological threshold are considered promising therapeutic avenues. Mitochondria transfer represents one such strategy by introducing exogenous, healthy mitochondria into affected cells. This approach can restore mitochondrial function through two complementary mechanisms: (1) providing wild-type mtDNA to dilute the mutant load and shift the heteroplasmic ratio, and (2) stimulating mitophagy to selectively eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria enriched in mutant mtDNA. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of mitochondria transfer does not rely on directly editing or repairing mutant mtDNA, but rather on reestablishing mitochondrial homeostasis through the combined effects of mitochondrial supplementation and mitophagy activation.

Although our results demonstrated that CD38 overexpression significantly enhanced mitochondrial activity and functionality in both MSCs and their derived Super-EV-Mito, it is important to note that such alterations in mitochondrial function may also influence MSC metabolism and differentiation potential. To minimize these potential risks, we limited the transfection procedure to a single round per MSC batch and collected EVs only once from each batch. This precautionary measure was taken to avoid repeated use of the same MSC population for EV production. In future studies, we aim to further optimize MSC engineering and EV harvesting strategies to maximize the proportion of mitochondria encapsulated within EVs while minimizing production costs, thereby enhancing the translational feasibility of this approach.

Therefore, this study suggests that engineering super donor cells is an advanced source for the scalable production of EV-Mito to treat mitochondrial disorders. This approach offers a promising strategy for treating primary mitochondrial diseases such as LHON caused by mtDNA mutations, while also opening a avenue for addressing secondary mitochondrial dysfunction associated with broader disease contexts.

CBA is one of the monomers of CAP and obtained on the basis of the previous synthetic procedure24. Firstly, cystamine dihydrochloride was dissolved in water at a concentration of 50 mM. Then the solution was transferred at a volume of 50 mL into a three-necked flask. Acryloyl chloride (0.1 M) was dissolved in dichloromethane at a volume of 10 mL. After that, NaOH solution (100 mM, 10 mL) was prepared. 10 mL of acryloyl chloride (0.05 M), as well as NaOH solution, were transferred in two separate dripping funnels. Then the two components were added drop by drop in a three-necked flask at the same time. The mixing process lasted for 60 min at 0 °C while stirring. Another 6 h was spent to perform the reaction at room temperature (r.t.). Finally, dichloromethane was used to dissolve the mixture. The purification of CBA was performed by crystallization using ethyl acetate.

CAP was synthesized by Michael's addition reaction in which the N, N-cystamine-bis-acrylamide (C), agmatine dihydrochloride (A), and p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonic acid (P) were used as monomers. The three monomers were dissolved in methanol by the molar ratios as follows: n (A):n (P):n (C) = 1.2:0.8:2. The reaction should avoid the light and be protected by argon for 24 h at 90 °C after adding triethylamine. Then, the pH of the product was adjusted by 100 mM HCl until four. Impurities were removed from CAP to ultrapure water by a 24-hour-long dialysis procedure with a Dialysis membrane (MWCO = 500), and then CAP was obtained by lyophilization. 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was performed to confirm the structures.

The CD38 plasmid DNA (pCD38, Supplementary Sequence 2) and plasmid GFP (pGFP) was constructed. The pDNA used in this study was amplified in E. coli strain DH5α, and then an Endo-free Plasmid Maxi Kits were performed to extract pDNA.

The pDNA (pCD38 or pGFP) was dissolved in H2O. Anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to dissolve and store CAP (200 mg/mL). The CAP mother solution was diluted with H2O into various concentrations. Then pDNA solution was added drop by drop to CAP solution in vortex condition. Then the incubation of the mixture (the weight ratio of pDNA and CAP = 1:30) was performed for 0.5 h at 4 °C to acquire CAP/pDNA complexes. Besides, the reagent protocol of Lipo3000 was referred to prepare the Lipo3000/pDNA complexes. Dynamic light scattering analyzer (DLS) performed by Nano ZS90 zetasizer was used to detect the particle sizes and zeta potentials of NPs.

The enzymatic digestion method was used to isolate MSCs from the epididymal adipose tissue25. Adipose tissues from Sprague-Dawley rats were collected and digested by type I collagenase. Then, DMEM with 10% FBS was used to culture MSCs. After the 3-day culture, unadhered impure cells were removed by fresh medium. Cells were cultured when 90% confluence was achieved.

HeLa cells (human breast cancer cell line) were obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). GM10742 cells were purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. MSCs and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, while GM10742 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO₂. For all cell experiments in this study, the untreated group served as the blank control.

HeLa cells were constantly exposed to either an FBS-free medium or a Rot-contained FBS-free medium at the concentration of 0.1 μM for 12 h. Finally, the medium was replaced for the subsequent studies.

MSCs were seeded on 24-well culture plates. Medium was replaced by different formulations at a concentration of 1 μg pDNA/well diluted by DMEM without FBS. The Lipo3000 group served as the positive control.

For transfection assay, pGFP was used for detection. The different formulations were incubated with the cells for 4 h. Medium was replaced with 1 mL fresh DMEM. Another 20 h cultivation was performed before detection. Finally, the positive rate (%) and mean fluorescence intensity were assessed by flow cytometry.

MSCs were cultured in tissue culture flasks with a 75 cm2 growth area (T75). After 48 h, MSCs were transfected by the different formulations (10 μg pCD38/flask).

The culture medium was replaced with EV-depleted medium and collected after 48 h. The medium was sequentially centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min, 2500 × g for 10 min, and finally at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to isolate EV-Mito from the supernatant. EVs marker expression of CD81 and the mitochondrial marker expression of COX IV and MT-ND4 were measured by Western blot.

Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito were extracted from MSCs treated with PBS, Lipo3000/pCD38 and CAP/pCD38. EV-Mito was resuspended at 0.1 mg/mL (protein concentration) in PBS for DLS and zeta potential detections.

For nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) detection, EV-Mito was resuspended in 40 μL PBS and measured using a ZetaView Particle Metrix (Particle Metrix, PMX-120, Germany). Polystyrene beads at 100 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA) were used to calibrate the instrument. NTA software was carried out to identify the concentrations of nanoparticles.

For multi-SIM imaging system (NanoInsights-Tech Co., Ltd.), EV-Mito was resuspended at 0.1 mg/mL (protein concentration). DiO and Mitotracker Red were used to label the EV-membrane and mitochondria. The multi-SIM images were taken using single slice mode with 50 mW laser power and 30 ms exposure time. Images were then reconstructed using the SIM Imaging Analyser software53.

For nano-flow detection, MSCs were transfected with mEmerald-TOMM20 using recombinant adenovirus (Ad-mEmerald-TOMM20) at a virus titer of 2.0 × 108 PFU/mL for 24 h. Then, MSCs were transfected with CAP/pCD38 complexes. The EV-Mito was extracted and purified. CD81 rabbit mAb was used as the label of EV-membrane. ABflo® 647-conjugated Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) was set as the secondary antibody. The proportion of released mitochondria encapsulated in EVs were analyzed using the Flow NanoAnalyzer U30E (NanoFCM, Xiamen, China).

For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, EV-Mito was pipetted onto a 150-mesh copper and incubated for 3 min. Mesh copper was stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 8 min, and washed with distilled water. Then it was stained with 2.6% lead citrate. The images were recorded by TEM (HT7800, HITACHI, Japan). The TEM image analysis was performed using the software ImageJ.

For flow cytometry analysis, MSCs were cultured in T75 flasks. After 48 h, MSCs were treated with the different formulations (10 μg pCD38/flask). Then the medium was replaced with 100 nM of Mitotracker Green (MTG) for 45 min in serum-free medium. The EV-Mito was extracted and washed with PBS for flow cytometry analysis.

For Ca2+ protection, Super-EV-Mito was obtained and mixed with a series of varying concentrations of Ca2+ for 24 h at 4 °C. The fluorescence intensity of Mitotracker Red was detected by a multifunctional microplate reader.

For pharmacological inhibition studies, MSCs were seeded on 24-well culture plates, transfected with CAP/pCD38 complex, and stained with MTG. Then the medium was replaced by an EV-depleted medium with different inhibitors (cytochalasin B (20 μM), Paclitaxel (20 nM)) and collected after 24 h. Then, EV-Mito was extracted and purified for the flow cytometry analysis.

MSCs were seeded on 24-well culture plates and transfected with pCD38 at a concentration of 1 μg pCD38/well. The untreated group was the negative group and the Lipo3000 group served as the positive control. The PE-labeled Anti-CD38 antibody was used for immunofluorescence detection. In addition, the Anti-IP3R antibody and Alexa Fluor 647-Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG antibody were used for immunofluorescence detection. The fluorescence intensity was assessed by flow cytometry.

MSCs were seeded on 24-well culture plates and transfected with CAP/pCD38. The untreated group was the negative group and the Lipo3000 group served as the positive control. The rhod-2-AM (2 μM) was stained for 30 min at 37 °C. The MFI of rhod-2 was assessed by flow cytometry.

MSCs were seeded on 24-well culture plates and transfected with CAP/pCD38 complexes. The fluo-4-AM (2 μM) was used to stain the cytoplasmic calcium for 30 min at 37 °C. The MFI of fluo-4 was assessed by flow cytometry.

MSCs were seeded on 10 cm culture dishes and transfected with pCD38. MTG was carried out to stain mitochondria in MSCs. After 48 h of Lipo3000/pCD38 or CAP/pCD38 complex treatment, condition medium was collected and the normalized FI of MTG-labeled EV-Mito in condition medium was detected using a multifunctional microplate reader.

MSCs were transfected with mEmerald-TOMM20 using recombinant adenovirus (Ad-mEmerald-TOMM20) at a virus titer of 2.0 × 108 PFU/mL for 24 h. Then, MSCs were transfected with different treatment groups. The EVs were extracted and purified. The Rot-induced HeLa cells were plated in the 35 mm glass bottom dishes (8 × 104 cells/well). The GM10742 cells were plated in the 24-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well. Then cells were treated at 6 μg EV protein/well in complete growth medium for 24 h. After washing by PBS, cell uptake was detected by CLSM (Zeiss LSM800, Germany) and flow cytometry.

The GM10742 cells were plated in the 24-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well and cultured with different EV-Mito at 6 μg EV-Mito protein/well. After different time points (1, 2, 3, 5 days), cells were collected for qPCR detection. The primers of rat MT-ND4 DNA were as follows: Forward 5'-CGATCCATTATCCACCCCAC-3', Reverse 5'- TGTTGGGATTAGAGTGGCTTCG-3', and the primers of human GAPDH DNA were: Forward 5'- GGTCTGAGGTTAAATATAGCTGCTG-3', Reverse 5'-TTGATTTGCCAAGTTGCCTG-3'. The relative copy numbers of rat MT-ND4 were quantified through 2−(∆∆Ct) by real-time PCR analysis (CFX connect, Bio-Rad, USA).

The HeLa cells or Rot-induced HeLa cells were plated in the 35 mm glass bottom dishes (8 × 104 cells/well). Cells were cultured without Mito-EVs (untreated group) or with Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito (6 μg EV-Mito protein/well). After 48 h of incubation, the cells were covered by 1 mL 1 × JC-1 dye for 15 min. Then, the cells were observed with CLSM at 488 nm (JC-1 monomers) and 543 nm (JC-1 aggregates) excitation.

GM10742 cells, HeLa cells, or Rot-induced HeLa cells were plated at 24-well plates overnight and then treated with different groups at 6 μg EV-Mito protein/well for 48 h. Then the ATP Bioluminescent Assay Kits were used to assess the ATP content in different cells. The luminescence was recorded by chemiluminometer (Luminoskan Ascent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of MSCs and GM10742 cells was determined with a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent, USA). MSCs were plated onto a cell culture plate at 3 × 104 cells per well for 24 h, then transfected with Lipo3000/pCD38 or CAP/pCD38 complexes for 12 h before Seahorse analysis. In this test, the medium was replaced with the assay medium, the medium (pH 7.4) containing glucose (10 mM) (Agilent, USA), L-glutamine (2 mM) and sodium pyruvate (1 mM) (Gibco, USA). After equilibration, the OCR was measured steadily with the treatment of oligomycin (2 μM), FCCP (5 μM), rotenone and antimycin A (1 μM). GM10742 cells were plated onto a 24-well plate and treated with Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito (6 μg EV-Mito protein/well) for 48 h. On the test day, the GM10742 cells were collected and resuspended with the assay medium, then seeded onto the cell culture plate at 1 × 104 cells per well. After equilibration, the OCR was measured.

The OCR of different EV-Mito and isolated mitochondria was performed by the similar method as previous study54. In brief, EV-Mito and isolated mitochondria were suspended in mitochondrial assay solution (MAS: 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 10 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA and BSA 0.2% (w/v)) and seeded to XFe96 microplate at a volume of 20 μL/well. The microplate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 180 μL of 37 °C-preheated MAS containing substrate (10 mM pyruvate, 2 mM malate, 4 μM FCCP) was added to each well. The OCR was measured by XFe96 analyzer.

The mPTP opening was measured with Calcein-AM and CoCl2. In brief, the cells in each group were treated, collected and cultured with Calcein-AM (2 μM) and CoCl2 (1 mM) at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, cells were washed with 1 mM CoCl2 on a shaker incubator for 25 min. The MFI of Calcein was assessed by flow cytometry.

GM10742 cells, HeLa cells, or Rot-induced HeLa cells were plated at 24-well plates overnight and then treated with Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito (6 μg EV-Mito protein/well) for 48 h. Then the cells were incubated with 500 nM of MitoSOX (M36007, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. The MFI of MitoSOX was assessed by flow cytometry.

GM10742 cells, HeLa cells or Rot-induced HeLa cells were treated with Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito and Super-EV-Mito (6 μg EV-Mito protein/well) for 48 h. Cell proliferation was detected with a BeyoClick™ EdU Cell Proliferation Kit with TMB (C0088S, Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The absorbance was investigated by the multifunctional microplate reader at 370 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific Multiskan GO, USA).

Total RNA was extracted using Total RNA Kit (R6834, Omega, USA). Conduct quality control using NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE), Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), and electrophoresis. RNA purity was checked using the kaiao K5500® Spectrophotometer (Kaiao, Beijing, China). RNA integrity and concentration was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The library preparation using VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit for MGI (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). RNA sequencing was performed using DNBSEQ T7 Sequencer (Complete Genomics, USA).

Raw sequencing data were processed with FastQC for quality control, and clean reads were aligned to the rat or human reference genome using HISAT. Transcript abundance was quantified with RSEM and expressed as FPKM. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing treatment and control groups (fold change ≥ 2.0, posterior probability ≥ 0.8, FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed with clusterProfiler (v3.14.3), with terms considered significant at adjusted P < 0.05.

The cells were collected for extracting proteins which were quantized by the BCA Protein Kit. The samples were detected by SDS-PAGE and the protein bands were transferred into the NC membranes. After incubation for 2 h with 5% skim milk, the membranes were put with primary antibody (MT-ND4, GAPDH and COX IV antibody) at 4 °C all night. Next, the membrane was cultured with the secondary antibodies (2 h) and the results were evaluated using electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL, Tanon, China).

Eyes were collected for the extraction of protein. Then the proteins were detected by using the same method as cells. MT-ND4 and COX IV antibodies were used for analysis, and GAPDH was used as a loading control.

C57BL/6J male mice (4-6 weeks) were purchased from East China Normal University Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and mutant mtND4R340H mitochondria transgenesis (mtTg) male mice (3 months of age) were purchased from Aurora Bioscience Co. Ltd. (Suzhou, China). All mice were housed under a 12 h light-dark cycle at 25 °C with 50% relative humidity. Mice were randomly assigned to pharmacodynamic studies.

Three-month-old mutant mtND4R340H mtTg LHON male mice were randomly divided into 3 groups. Mice receiving an intravitreal injection of 2 μL PBS or Super-EV-Mito (1 μg EV-Mito protein/eye) were designated as the PBS group and the Super-EV-Mito group, respectively. Mice administered Ide orally at a daily dose of 60 mg/kg were designated as the Ide group. Age-matched wild-type male mice were included as the WT group. After 2 weeks of the second time of administration, the optomotor test and ERG were performed. The eyes were harvested for further analysis. Each group contained 5 mice.

To establish the Rot-induced LHON male mouse model, the mice were injected with 3 μL of 2.5 mM Rot (dissolved in trilaurin) into the vitreous chamber5. After model establishment, male Rot-induced LHON mice were randomly divided into five groups. Mice receiving an intravitreal injection of 2 μL PBS were designated as the Rot + PBS group. Mice treated intravitreally with Ctrl-EV-Mito, Lipo-EV-Mito, or Super-EV-Mito (1 μg EV-Mito protein/eye) were defined as the Rot + Ctrl-EV-Mito group, Rot + Lipo-EV-Mito group, and Rot + Super-EV-Mito group, respectively. Mice administered Ide orally at a daily dose of 60 mg/kg were designated as the Rot + Ide group. Age-matched male mice without Rot were included as the PBS group. Each group contained 5 mice.

For the optomotor test, a circular platform (6 cm radius) in black alternating with a white electric roller was settled to put the mouse. Mice were put to habituate the experiment for 5 min. There was an interval of 30 s between the clockwise (2 min) and counterclockwise (2 min). The movement times of the head were counted. A movement was defined as qualified if the mouse's head moved with the roller while the body stayed still.

For ERG measurement, mice were dark-adapted overnight, anesthetized, and placed on the recording platform. Corneal ring electrodes and subcutaneous needle electrodes in the skin and tail were positioned, and dark-adapted 0.01 ERG responses (flash intensity = 10 cd·s/m²) were recorded using the Espion Visual Electrophysiology System (Diagnosys LLC, USA).

The mitochondrial complex I expression was analyzed using immunofluorescence.

The eyes of mice were collected for H&E staining. The thickness of the general retina layer and the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) were analyzed.

Each group contained 5 mice. After 2 weeks of the second time of administration, the eyes, heart, kidney, liver, lung and spleen of mice were collected for H&E staining. During the dosing period, the mice were weighed every two days until the 28th day. Then the mice were sacrificed, and the blood was taken for further experiments. After blood was obtained, the blood was placed in an EP tube at r.t. for 1 h and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to collect the serum. The serum samples were taken for ALT, AST, and BUN using the relevant assay kits.

The two eyes of all groups' mice were injected with Super-EV-Mito (1 μg EV-Mito protein/eye). After different days (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 days) of treatment, eyes were collected. The qPCR was performed to measure the content of rat MT-ND4 DNA. The primers of rat MT-ND4 DNA were as follows: Forward 5'-CGATCCATTATCCACCCCAC-3', Reverse 5'-TGTTGGGATTAGAGTGGCTTCG-3', and the primers of mouse Actin DNA were: Forward 5'-GATCACTCAGAACGGACACCAT-3', Reverse 5'-GGCTCATCAAATGCCCACA-3'. The relative copy numbers of rat MT-ND4 were quantified through 2−(∆∆Ct) by real-time PCR analysis (CFX connect, Bio-Rad, USA).

In Fig. 1E, normalized FI of MTG = FI of MTG/protein content. In Fig. 2H, MitoSOX/MTG intensity = FI of MitoSOX/FI of MTG. In Figs. 3H and 4K, ATP content = ATP concentration of cells/protein concentration. In Fig. 5F, data was normalized by cell numbers. Quantitative data in these experiments were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from sample numbers (n). And the comparison of the mean values between multiple groups adopted the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, the pairwise comparisons adopted Tukey's HSD post hoc test when the data satisfied the homogeneity of variance, and the Games-Howell test was used for the comparison between multiple groups if the above conditions were not met the homogeneity of variance. And the pairwise comparisons adopted t-test. All tests were two-sided, the P > 0.05 presented not significant (NS), P < 0.05 presented significant, and P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and even P < 0.0001 presented highly significant. Comparisons of all groups were analyzed using the SPSS 23.0. Statistical tests utilized for each experiment and the reproducibility of experiments were specified in the legends of figures. No data were excluded from the analysis. The ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA) was used for quantitative analysis in fluorescence intensity for confocal images and Western blot.

All the animal protocols and procedures were performed under the guidelines for human and responsible use of animals in research approved by the regional ethics committee of China Pharmaceutical University (2024-07-036) and JOINN Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, China) (S-ACU24-0975).

For years, many scientists have warned that Earth is undergoing another mass extinction, with species disappearing faster than ever before. These warnings often rely on projecting extinction data from the past 500 years into the future, assuming that current rates are accelerating dramatically.

However, new research from Kristen Saban and John Wiens of the University of Arizona's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology suggests a different picture. Their analysis shows that over the past five centuries, extinctions among plants, arthropods, and land vertebrates actually reached their highest point about a century ago and have been declining since. The study also found that earlier extinction waves were driven mostly by invasive species on islands, whereas today's greatest danger to wildlife is the loss of natural habitats.

Reassessing the Mass Extinction Narrative

The researchers argue that predictions of an ongoing mass extinction may rely on oversimplified or outdated assumptions. Many of these projections treat past extinction patterns as if they apply equally to modern times, ignoring how the main causes of species loss have shifted over history.

Published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, the paper is the first comprehensive analysis to examine both the rates and causes of recent extinctions across plants and animals. The team reviewed data from nearly 2 million species and closely studied 912 species known to have gone extinct in the last 500 years.

"We discovered that the causes of those recent extinctions were very different from the threats species are currently facing," said Wiens, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "This makes it problematic to extrapolate these past extinction patterns into the future, because the drivers are rapidly changing, particularly with respect to habitat loss and climate change."

Saban and Wiens noted that most of what we know about species loss comes from recent centuries, yet many studies have assumed those patterns predict future risks. In reality, the factors leading to extinction are far from uniform across time, habitats, or taxonomic groups.

"To our surprise, past extinctions are weak and unreliable predictors of the current risk that any given group of animals or plants is facing," said lead author Saban, who recently graduated from the U of A and is currently a doctoral student at Harvard University.

From Islands to Continents: Where Extinctions Hit Hardest

Extinction rates varied widely among species groups. Mollusks such as snails and mussels, along with vertebrates, were the most affected, while plants and arthropods faced relatively few losses. Many of the recorded extinctions occurred on isolated islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, where invasive species introduced by humans -- such as rats, pigs, and goats -- wiped out native wildlife.

On continental regions, however, most extinctions took place in freshwater environments. While invasive species caused the majority of island losses, habitat destruction has emerged as the dominant threat on land.

Unexpectedly, the study found no evidence that climate change has increased extinctions during the past two centuries.

"That does not mean that climate change is not a threat," Wiens said. "It just means that past extinctions do not reflect current and future threats."

The authors also considered threat levels -- for example "threatened," "endangered" or "least concern," -- for 163,000 species as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

"The current threat level provides probably our best hint of what is currently happening and might happen in the near future," Wiens said. "We found the patterns of today's threats to be different from those of past extinctions. For example, most extinct species are mollusks and vertebrates on islands that were driven extinct by invasive species, but most threatened species today are mainland species facing habitat destruction."

A Call for Accuracy and Perspective

Saban said she doesn't want the study "to be taken as giving people a carte blanche" to suggest that human activity does not present a significant and urgent threat to many species.

"Biodiversity loss is a huge problem right now, and I think we have not yet seen the kinds of effects that it might have," she said. "But it's important that we talk about it with accuracy, that our science is rigorous in how we're able to detail these losses and prevent future ones."

Contrary to many studies, the rates at which species are going extinct are not rapidly accelerating, the study found.

"We show that extinction rates are not getting faster towards the present, as many people claim, but instead peaked many decades ago," Wiens said.

Signs of Hope for Species Conservation

For some groups, such as arthropods and plants and land vertebrates, extinction rates have actually declined over the last 100 years, notably since the early 1900s, he added. One of the reasons for declining extinction rates "is many people are working hard to keep species from going extinct. And we have evidence from other studies that investing money in conservation actually works."

According to Saban, the study was born out of a motivation to take a step back from doomsday scenarios.

"If we're saying that what is happening right now is like an asteroid hitting Earth, then the problem becomes insurmountable," she said. "By looking at the data in this way, we hope that our study helps inform our overall understanding of biodiversity loss and how we can come up with better ways to address it."

Attention has been focused on avian influenza virus H5N1 in the past few years, but scientists are concerned about the spread of other bird viruses.Credit: Ralf Hirschberger/AFP via Getty

A bird flu virus that has often been ignored because it mostly causes minor disease in birds has the potential to cause a human pandemic, says a team that has tracked how the H9N2 virus has become better adapted to infect people. The researchers say more surveillance of the virus is needed.

In the past few years, surveillance has been focused on the avian influenza virus H5N1, which has spread across most continents and can cause severe disease and death in people. Since 2020, H5N1 has killed about 21 people. In North America, the virus is also spreading among dairy cows.

Less attention is being paid to H9N2, says Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, despite the virus being the second most common strain of bird flu that infects people. H9N2 has caused 173 infections in people since 2015, mostly in China, says To, who presented his team's research at the Pandemic Research Alliance International Symposium in Melbourne, Australia, on 27 October.

H9N2 might be more prevalent than we realize, says Michelle Wille, who studies bird flu at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. Infections are probably being missed because they do not result in severe infection or hospitalization in people, or because people are more commonly tested for the H5N1 instead, she adds.

Scientists are yet to find evidence of person-to-person transmission of H9N2, which would be needed for it to lead to a pandemic. But To and his team have found that H9N2 underwent genetic changes that began around 2015 that have made the virus more infectious. In cell-based experiments, a version of the H9N2 virus collected in 2024 infected more human cells than did a historical sample collected in 1999. The modern version also showed improved binding to various receptors on human cells. This means the virus has adapted to spread among people1, reported To and his colleagues in Emerging Microbes & Infections earlier this month.

The virus would have to undergo several more changes before it could cause sustained transmission between people, says Wille. The virus has to change to preferentially bind to human receptors instead of receptors found in bird cells and has to adapt how well it grows at temperatures and pH levels of humans, which are different from birds.

Many vital electrocatalytic transformations hinge on reactive surface metal–hydrogen intermediates (M–H*), yet the low concentration and transient nature of such intermediates present formidable challenges to in-depth investigation. Here we use single-molecule super-resolution reaction imaging to directly probe surface palladium–hydrogen (Pd–H*) intermediates on individual palladium nanocubes during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Our approach visualizes hydrogen spillover from palladium to the surrounding substrate surface over hundreds of nanometres away and dissects substantial inter- and intraparticle heterogeneity. Through Gaussian-broadening kinetic analysis, we reveal that ensemble-averaged measurements systematically overestimate the stability of Pd–H*. Moreover, we resolve three subpopulations of palladium nanocubes with distinct reactivity features, uncovering critical correlations between intermediate stability, hydrogenation reactivity and transition-state properties. Our findings highlight the necessity of single-particle resolution for capturing the intrinsic complexity of electrocatalysts; our approach is also broadly applicable to interrogate surface-reactive intermediates across a wide array of electrocatalytic pathways.

While single-cell RNA sequencing has advanced our understanding of cell fate, identifying molecular hallmarks of potency—a cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types—remains a challenge. Here we introduce CytoTRACE 2, an interpretable deep learning framework for predicting absolute developmental potential from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Across diverse platforms and tissues, CytoTRACE 2 outperformed previous methods in predicting developmental hierarchies, enabling detailed mapping of single-cell differentiation landscapes and expanding insights into cell potency.

All cells, from the fertilized egg to its mature progeny, are hierarchically organized in multicellular life. Each cell has distinct potency, or ability to differentiate into specialized cell types, ranging from totipotent (capable of generating an entire organism) and pluripotent (capable of generating all adult cells) to multipotent, oligopotent, unipotent and differentiated cells, each with increasingly restricted developmental potential1 (Fig. 1a). While lineage tracing, functional transplantation assays and single-cell genomics have expanded our understanding of cell potency2, there remains a need for interpretable methods that can learn developmental programs, predict potency states and generate insights applicable to regenerative and cancer biology.

We previously introduced CytoTRACE 1 (ref. 3), a computational method for predicting cellular maturity from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, based on the number of genes expressed per cell. However, like other trajectory inference methods4,5,6,7,8, CytoTRACE 1 provides predictions that are dataset-specific, making it difficult to unify results across datasets and contextualize them within the broader framework of cellular potency.

To overcome these challenges, we developed CytoTRACE 2, an interpretable deep learning framework for determining single-cell potency categories and absolute developmental potential from scRNA-seq data. Unlike most deep learning methods9, CytoTRACE 2 learns multivariate gene expression programs that are readily interpretable and enable accurate predictions of developmental potential. Moreover, it suppresses batch and platform-specific variation through multiple mechanisms, including competing representations of gene expression and training set diversity (Methods). Our approach uncovers cross-tissue correlates of cell potency and highlights the value of interpretable deep learning for characterizing single-cell developmental states in health and disease (https://cytotrace2.stanford.edu).

To develop CytoTRACE 2, we curated an extensive atlas of human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets with experimentally validated potency levels, spanning 33 datasets, nine platforms, 406,058 cells and 125 standardized cell phenotypes (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Phenotypes were grouped into six broad potency categories—totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, unipotent and differentiated—and further subdivided into 24 granular levels based on expected developmental order from lineage tracing and functional assays (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). A training set of 93 cell phenotypes from 16 tissues and 13 studies was used to develop the model, with the remaining data reserved for performance evaluation (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).

CytoTRACE 2 decodes developmental potential using a novel, explainable deep learning architecture called a gene set binary network (GSBN). Inspired by binarized neural networks10, GSBNs assign binary weights (0 or 1) to genes, identifying highly discriminative gene sets that define each potency category (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Multiple gene sets can be learned for each potency group, and the informative genes driving model predictions can be easily extracted—an advantage over conventional deep learning architectures. As such, CytoTRACE 2 provides two key outputs for each single-cell transcriptome: (1) the potency category with maximum likelihood and (2) a continuous ‘potency score' generated by integrating GSBN predictions across potency categories and calibrating the range from 1 (totipotent) to 0 (differentiated) (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 2–4). Based on the assumption that transcriptionally similar cells occupy related differentiation states, CytoTRACE 2 also leverages Markov diffusion combined with a nearest neighbor approach to smooth individual potency scores (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).

Having compiled a compendium of ground truth datasets, we evaluated the performance of CytoTRACE 2 by assessing both the accuracy of potency predictions and the ordering of known developmental trajectories. We used two definitions of development ordering: ‘absolute order', which compares predictions to known potency levels across datasets, and ‘relative order', which ranks cells within each dataset from least to most differentiated (Extended Data Fig. 1d and Supplementary Tables 2–4). The agreement between known and predicted developmental orderings was quantified using weighted Kendall correlation to ensure balanced evaluation and minimize bias (Supplementary Table 5).

We started by evaluating model hyperparameters through cross-validation and observed minimal performance variation across a wide range of values (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f and Supplementary Table 6). Based on this, we selected stable hyperparameters and retrained the model. On the training data, we demonstrated that CytoTRACE 2 achieves high accuracy in distinguishing absolute potency for broad potency labels (Fig. 1d).

To validate our approach, we next extended our analysis to unseen data, comprising 14 held-out datasets spanning nine tissue systems, seven platforms and 93,535 evaluable cells. Performance on broad and granular potency labels was consistently high in testing (Fig. 1d,e) and robust to differences in species, tissues, platforms or phenotypes that were absent during training (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Table 7). To rigorously assess generalizability, we retrained CytoTRACE 2 on different subsets of the potency atlas, including random train–test splits and scenarios where distinct developmental systems, termed ‘clades', were held out from training. In all cases, results were well correlated with ground truth (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9), implying that potency-related biology is conserved across datasets. We also found that CytoTRACE 2 is resistant to moderate annotation errors and performs reliably under practical data limitations (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note).

A key advantage of CytoTRACE 2 is its ability to predict absolute developmental potential on a continuous scale from 1 (totipotent) to 0 (differentiated), which enables cross-dataset comparisons and avoids imposing a developmental order where none exists. For example, unlike its predecessor, CytoTRACE 2 corroborated a pluripotency program in cranial neural crest cell precursors11 and correctly distinguished datasets with and without immature cells12,13 (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 4). It also outperformed other methods3,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 in ordering mouse single-cell transcriptomes from six datasets2,21,22,23,24,25 across 62 developmental time points (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c) and accurately captured the progressive decline in potency across 258 evaluable phenotypes during mouse development (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e)—without requiring data integration or batch correction. CytoTRACE 2 potency predictions also aligned with known leukemic stem cell signatures in acute myeloid leukemia (Extended Data Fig. 6a)26 and identified known multilineage potential in oligodendroglioma27, highlighting its applicability to cancer (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 10).

Next, we benchmarked CytoTRACE 2 against multiple strategies for cell potency classification and developmental hierarchy inference (Supplementary Table 11). CytoTRACE 2 outperformed eight state-of-the-art machine learning methods28,29,30,31,32 for cell potency classification in 33 datasets, achieving a higher median multiclass F1 score and lower mean absolute error (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, it surpassed eight developmental hierarchy inference methods for cross-dataset (absolute) and intra-dataset (relative) performance3,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, demonstrating over 60% higher correlation, on average, for reconstructing relative orderings in 57 developmental systems, including data from Tabula Sapiens33 (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Tables 12 and 13). Similar results were observed when comparing CytoTRACE 2 against nearly 19k annotated gene sets34,35,36 (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Table 13) and scVelo5, a generalized RNA velocity model for predicting future cell states (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 14).

Previous genomic studies of stemness largely focused on pluripotency, with limited insight into other potency states. Given the inherent interpretability of our GSBN design, we next explored the molecular programs driving potency predictions (Fig. 2a). Across our potency atlas, GSBN modules produced a cohesive gradient of differentiation states (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). The top-ranking genes showed conserved signatures across species, platforms and developmental clades, identifying both positive and negative correlates of cell potency (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Tables 15 and 16).

Given these results, we hypothesized that CytoTRACE 2 might enrich for key potency-specific factors. Indeed, the core transcription factors Pou5f1 and Nanog37 ranked within the top 0.2% of pluripotency genes (Supplementary Table 15). To further explore this hypothesis, we analyzed data from a large-scale CRISPR screen, in which ~7,000 genes in multipotent mouse hematopoietic stem cells were individually knocked out and assessed for developmental consequences in vivo38 (Fig. 2d). Among the 5,757 genes overlapping CytoTRACE 2 features, the top 100 positive multipotency markers were enriched for genes whose knockout promotes differentiation, whereas the top 100 negative markers were enriched for genes whose knockout inhibits differentiation (Q = 0.04; Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 9c). This trend was consistent across different numbers of top markers and highly specific for multipotency, underscoring the fidelity of learned potency representations (Extended Data Fig. 9d).

To more deeply analyze multipotency in mouse and human tissues and explore the potential of CytoTRACE 2 for biomarker discovery, we next applied pathway enrichment analysis to genes ranked by feature importance. Remarkably, cholesterol metabolism emerged as a leading multipotency-associated pathway (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 9e and Supplementary Table 17). Within this pathway, three genes related to unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis (Fads1, Fads2 and Scd2) were among the top-ranking markers (Fig. 2g). These genes were consistently enriched in multipotent cells across 125 phenotypes in our potency atlas (Fig. 2h; train–test area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.87 and 0.92, respectively).

To experimentally confirm these findings, we performed quantitative PCR on mouse hematopoietic cells sorted into multipotent, oligopotent, and differentiated subsets (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) and multiplexed in situ mRNA imaging on mouse intestinal epithelium co-stained with multipotency markers, Lgr539 and Fgfbp140 (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 10c–e). In both approaches, Fads1, Fads2 and Scd2 showed reproducible and preferential expression in multipotent cells (Fig. 2i,j and Extended Data Fig. 10). While fatty acid metabolism has been linked to stem cell biology41, no study has specifically attributed lipid metabolism genes to distinct potency levels. Therefore, CytoTRACE 2 provides a framework to uncover molecular relationships and facilitate new hypotheses and discoveries.

In summary, CytoTRACE 2 is an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts cell potency and continuous differentiation states from scRNA-seq data. Unlike previous methods, it links stemness and pseudotime to absolute developmental potential, offering cross-dataset compatibility and transparency into the molecular profiles driving its predictions. Nonetheless, this study has several limitations. Like all supervised machine learning approaches, CytoTRACE 2 depends on the quality and breadth of its training data, although robust results were observed across diverse training–test splits, and moderate labeling variation was well tolerated. Performance may decline when analyzing cells with very low RNA content or number of expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 3). While some phenotypes were misclassified in held-out data, absolute errors remained low and outcompeted existing methods. Finally, although the current model is trained on human and mouse data, ortholog mapping may expand its applicability to other species. Given its demonstrated advantages, we anticipate that CytoTRACE 2 will have immediate utility for improving our understanding of cell potency, with implications for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in diseases where altered developmental hierarchies play a role.

All animal procedures were performed in compliance with ethical regulations and conducted according to a protocol approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel for Laboratory Animal Care committee (protocol no. 10868).

Developmental potency reflects a cell's capacity to differentiate into various cell types, with six widely recognized categories in stem cell biology: totipotency, pluripotency, multipotency, oligopotency, unipotency, and differentiated (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Note). These broad classifications are based on decades of research, including lineage tracing, transplantation and colony-formation experiments across multiple tissues and species. Each category represents a progressively restricted ability to generate downstream cell types, from totipotent cells capable of forming all embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages to unipotent cells restricted to producing a single mature cell type; however, as developmental potential exists on a continuum, we also devised a more granular classification system, as described in Supplementary Note and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

Of note, classically defined potency levels are not directly annotated in publicly available scRNA-seq datasets. Therefore, to train, validate and benchmark CytoTRACE 2, we downloaded and curated 33 human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets from peer-reviewed studies with experimentally confirmed developmental states and assignable potency levels (Supplementary Table 1). As part of this selection process, we applied the following inclusion and exclusion criteria to enhance experimental rigor:

Only functionally validated developmental states supported by lineage tracing or transplantation assays were considered for analysis. Datasets with transient cell changes, such as from metabolic activation or suppression, cell cycle transitions or environmental perturbations were excluded, as these do not represent durable developmental processes.

Datasets with irreconcilable technical batches resulting in major imbalances in the number of cells per phenotype were excluded.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets were excluded, as they do not capture cytoplasmic RNA and include immature transcripts.

Among datasets satisfying these conditions, author-supplied cell type annotations were mapped to one of six broad potency categories (totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, unipotent and differentiated) or not evaluable using established definitions (‘Potency annotation scheme', Supplementary Note). These potency categories were further subdivided into 24 granular categories, ranging from 1 (least differentiated) to 24 (most differentiated) (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Cellular phenotypes were hierarchically grouped into these categories based on potency, developmental timing and sequence, and self-renewal capacity.

Where possible, we also examined single-cell developmental states in a dataset-specific manner and without regard to potency categories, as previously described3. Such ‘relative' orderings, most of which were obtained from Gulati et al.3, ranged from 1 (least differentiated) to N (most differentiated) in a given dataset, and exceeded the number of resolvable potency categories in some datasets (Supplementary Table 4), permitting a more granular assessment

Our comprehensive potency atlas catalogs experimentally confirmed cell states and their corresponding potency levels, providing a structured reference for model training and validation. Supplementary Table 3 includes key details such as the broad and granular potency levels, standardized and original cell phenotypes, species, dataset source, cohort type (for example, training, validation and test), developmental maturity, lineage contributions and supporting evidence. This format allows for consistent annotation and comparison across datasets. For full details of potency annotations and associated rationale, see ‘Potency annotation scheme' (Supplementary Note) and Supplementary Tables 2–4.

Using the abovementioned criteria, we assembled a 33-dataset potency atlas (Fig. 1b), from which we selected a training cohort consisting of seven human and 12 mouse scRNA-seq datasets from 13 studies (Supplementary Table 1). We ensured that all six broad potency categories were represented in both species along with a diverse array of biological (for example, tissue types) and technical characteristics (for example, sequencing platforms). As part of this effort, and to align with precedent in the field, we incorporated all human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets (n = 13) with annotatable potency categories analyzed by Gulati et al.3. To broadly cover tissue types, we also included cell phenotypes from the Tabula Muris scRNA-seq atlas43 for which potency categories could be determined (15 tissue types and 43 phenotypes). The resulting training cohort encompasses 312,523 cells, 16 tissue types, 93 phenotypes and six scRNA-seq platforms (Fig. 1b).

The remaining datasets served as a held-out test cohort, which mirrors the training cohort with respect to species representation in each broad potency category (Supplementary Table 1). Consisting of three human and 11 mouse scRNA-seq datasets from 14 studies, the test cohort spans 93,535 cells, 73 phenotypes, nine tissue types and seven scRNA-seq platforms, including two tissue types and 21 phenotypes that were absent from training (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 7).

To augment these data, we annotated potency categories in 459,320 evaluable cells from Tabula Sapiens, a multi-tissue scRNA-seq atlas from postmortem human donor biopsies33 (Supplementary Table 1); however, given the confounding influence of postmortem intervals on human tissue messenger RNA levels44, we hypothesized that Tabula Sapiens might exhibit reduced data quality. To test this, we calculated the ratio of mitochondrial reads to total reads (MTR) within each single-cell transcriptome as a proxy for overall data quality. Indeed, we calculated a mean MTR across all Tabula Sapiens tissue types, stratified by platform, of 7.4% (median of medians), which is nearly 90% higher than expected for human cell types profiled by scRNA-seq data (median of medians of 3.9%; Table S1 of Osorio and Cai45) and 78% higher than other human datasets in the training and test cohorts, both of which include embryonic tissues with high metabolic activity (median of medians of 4.2%). Accordingly, we omitted Tabula Sapiens from the primary test cohort and evaluated it as a secondary benchmark in Fig. 1h,i. Author-supplied phenotypes in Tabula Sapiens with fewer than five cells in a tissue–platform pair were excluded from further analysis.

Collectively, these ground truth datasets with newly annotated potency levels represent a unique community resource for systematic characterization of absolute developmental states and their molecular programs in humans and mice. Depending on platform, all scRNA-seq expression matrices were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) or counts per million (CPM) as appropriate. Full details of each dataset, including dataset name, accession number, PMID, species, platform, tissue type, number of cells, number of phenotype, and number of potency levels, are available in Supplementary Table 1. These data can also be interactively explored at https://cytotrace2.stanford.edu.

For cells with identical phenotypes but different author-supplied labels, we unified the annotations (Supplementary Table 3). For example, ‘HSC-MPPs' from ‘HSC development (Smart-seq2)' and ‘Hematopoietic stem cell progenitor (HSCP)' from ‘HSPCs (C1)' were annotated as ‘Hematopoietic stem and early progenitor'. To balance the representation of cells from distinct lineages within a given broad potency category, we also re-annotated related cell subsets sharing a common parental phenotype. For example, ‘CD4+ helper T cells' from ‘peripheral blood (10x)' and ‘CD8+ memory T cells' from ‘BM-MNC (CITE-seq)' were labeled as ‘T cell'. This was crucial when training CytoTRACE 2 as the probability of sampling individual cells was weighted based on phenotype. In this way, each major phenotype contributed equally during model training regardless of the number of evaluable cells, mitigating the chance of overweighting and overfitting (see ‘Training and hyperparameter tuning' below). The standardized phenotype assignments along with the original annotations are summarized in Supplementary Table 3.

Existing RNA-based surrogates of cellular differentiation status have notable limitations for imputing absolute differentiation states and potency categories from scRNA-seq data. For example, the original CytoTRACE, termed CytoTRACE 1 in this work, employs gene counts as an unbiased strategy for identifying immature cells3. Despite the utility of this approach, gene counts are subject to dataset-specific biases, making them suboptimal for potency assessment. Measures based on transcriptional entropy and RNA velocity also suffer from dataset-specific biases, a nonspecific relationship to absolute differentiation status, or the requirement for continuous developmental processes within a narrowly defined time window4,5,14,15,16.

Supervised machine learning models offer a potentially robust alternative to the abovementioned strategies when adequate training data are available; however, machine learning methods also face key challenges when applied to scRNA-seq data, including sparsity, high dimensionality and data heterogeneity encompassing both biological and technical variation. While deep learning is a promising subtype of machine learning, often achieving remarkable performance gains over other machine learning methods (especially in the presence of high complexity, noise and uncertainty) most existing architectures lack inherent interpretability, limiting their broad applicability.

To address these challenges, we designed a novel deep learning framework that can handle the complexities of single-cell potency assessment while achieving direct biological interpretability. Unlike recent methods46,47 that decompose single-cell expression data into a combination of previously known and simultaneously learned new gene programs, our approach, termed a GSBN, is anchored to known phenotypic states but not known gene sets. As such, GSBNs have the flexibility to discover new gene programs for known phenotypic states, such as potency categories, from scRNA-seq data. As part of their design, GSBNs are highly robust and fully interpretable, meaning they can be directly interrogated to extract meaningful markers for each phenotypic class of interest across datasets, platforms and tissues.

CytoTRACE 2 consists of five high-level components, schematically depicted in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a and described in detail below.

Preprocessing: ortholog mapping and expression normalization.

GSBNs: identification of interpretable potency-associated gene sets for each potency category.

Enrichment assessment: evaluation of gene set activation levels in single cells.

Integration of scores: integration of gene set activation levels, both within and across gene set binary networks.

Postprocessing: leveraging transcriptional covariance and uncertainty in model predictions to smooth single-cell potency scores and produce the final output.

Among these five components, GSBNs, enrichment assessment and integration of scores constitute the CytoTRACE 2 core model, a neural network architecture consisting of a shared input layer; a set of G GSBN modules, where G denotes the number of potency categories; and a shared output layer (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Within the core model, each GSBN module is trained to discriminate a single potency category and contains (1) a binary neural network (BNN) component, which encodes potency-associated gene sets and (2) downstream functions to calculate and integrate gene set enrichment scores (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, because weights in BNNs are constrained to binary rather than continuous values, BNNs also allow for more efficient computation and provide an implicit form of model regularization48.

Let input scRNA-seq dataset X be an \(I\times C\) gene expression matrix over I genes and C cells. The following preprocessing steps prepare the input dataset for training or prediction.

First, gene symbols in X are mapped and filtered using dictionary \({\mathbb{D}}\), a collection of gene symbols that harmonizes all HGNC (human) and MGI (mouse) identifiers supported by CytoTRACE 2 (‘Dictionary of input genes' below). Following this step, the resulting expression matrix, denoted \({{\bf{X}}}^{{\boldsymbol{{\prime} }}}\), consists of \(n=\mathrm{14,271}\) genes and C cells. As part of this process, any genes in \({{\bf{X}}}^{{\boldsymbol{{\prime} }}}\) not present in \({\bf{X}}\) through mapping are set to zero. In the second step, \({{\bf{X}}}^{{\boldsymbol{{\prime} }}}\) is converted into dual representations: for the first, it is normalized to CPM/TPM and log2-adjusted, yielding an \(N\times C\) matrix \({\bf{L}}\); for the second, it is mapped to rank space, yielding an \(N\times C\) matrix \({\bf{R}}\), with the genes of each single-cell transcriptome \({{\bf{X}}}_{c}^{{\boldsymbol{{\prime} }}}\) assigned relative integer rank such that rank 1 corresponds to the gene with highest expression. While the log2 CPM/TPM representation maintains detailed transcriptomic information, the alternative encoding provided by rank space helps circumvent batch effects, mitigate the influence of extreme values and outliers, and reduce the risk of model overfitting. In tandem, these two representations provide an inherent regularization to model inputs. \({\bf{R}}\) and \({\bf{L}}\) are subsequently passed to the CytoTRACE 2 core model where they jointly constitute the model input layer.

Inputs \({\bf{R}}\) and \({\bf{L}}\) are passed to each of \(G\) GSBN modules within the CytoTRACE 2 core model. These modules begin by thresholding \({\bf{R}}\) (Extended Data Fig. 1a) to learnable maximum rank \(\tau {\mathbb{\in }}{\mathbb{N}}\), yielding \(N\times C\) matrix \({\bf{T}}\):

This rank trimming (see also ‘Model initialization and updates') enables calculation of the rank-based enrichment score, described in ‘Enrichment assessment' below. Input \({\bf{L}}\) remains the same.

Next, within each GSBN module, \(M\) gene sets are learned in binary \(N\times M\) matrix \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\), where \(M{\mathbb{\in }}{\mathbb{N}}\) is prespecified and all entries \({{\bf{W}}}_{i,j}^{{\rm{B}}}\in \left\{\mathrm{0,1}\right\}\). \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\) constitutes the gene set selection layer of the CytoTRACE 2 core model; it has a continuous equivalent \({\bf{W}}\) used for model initialization and backpropagation (see also ‘Training and hyperparameter tuning'). At each forward iteration for model training, \({\bf{W}}\) undergoes binarization:

where binarize denotes the following utility function:

To quantify the enrichment of each gene set in the module (each column of \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\)), CytoTRACE 2 leverages two complementary measures: rank-based enrichment score (\({{\rm{Score}}}_{U}\)) and expression-based enrichment score (\({{\rm{Score}}}_{A}\)). \({{\rm{Score}}}_{U}\) aggregates overall expression activity of a given gene set j in rank space whereas \({{\rm{Score}}}_{A}\) compares the average expression of genes in j versus background levels. By integrating both scores, each providing a different axis of information, CytoTRACE 2 can learn more complex expression patterns while also achieving additional regularization through enrichment score competition. The two scores are defined as follows.

\({{\rm{Score}}}_{U}\) calculates the commonly used nonparametric UCell score49 for each gene set, or column of \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\). For each cell \(1\le k\le C\) and module gene set \(1\le j\le M\),

where \(\mathop{{\rm{S}}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) denotes the vector of length \(M\) containing the number of genes per gene set assigned nonzero weight in the binary weighting matrix:

\({{\rm{Score}}}_{A}\) implements a scoring system based on Seurat's AddModuleScore (AMS), computing the average expression of genes within a gene set subtracted by the aggregated expression of control, or background, feature sets50. To select background features, AMS groups genes into \({n}_{\mathrm{bins}}\) bins according to their average expression within a dataset. Then, for each gene, a ‘background' set of \({n}_{\mathrm{sample}}\) genes from the same average expression bin is sampled, ensuring that each gene is compared to other genes with similar average expression. Here, for computational efficiency and to avoid introducing a dependency on dataset composition, we use our entire curated training cohort (see ‘Single-cell potency atlas') as the ‘dataset' in which to rank genes by average expression. We then compute a constant set of background genes to use for each gene. We encode the mapping of genes to their background genes in the binary \(N\times N\) matrix \({\bf{G}}\), where each row represents a gene as used in a gene set, and the jth entry of row i is 1 if gene j is used as background for gene i, and 0 otherwise.

In detail, we construct \({\bf{G}}\) as follows. First, we compute the average log2 CPM/TPM expression per gene across all cells from the training cohort. We then rank the results and uniformly partition genes into \({n}_{\mathrm{bins}}=24\) bins of size \({s}_{\mathrm{bin}}\) according to rank, following the Seurat default50. Next, for each gene (each row of \({\bf{G}}\)), we randomly select without replacement a set of background genes, where the number of background genes follows a Gaussian distribution with mean \({\mu} = {n}_{\mathrm{sample}}\) and variance

where \({n}_{\mathrm{sample}}=100\). This approach provides an additional regularizing effect compared to constant selection of a uniform number of background genes per gene. Note that left-multiplying a gene set matrix \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\) by \({\bf{G}}\) maps the genes in the gene sets (columns) of \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\) to their corresponding background genes.

Then, given \({\bf{G}}\), for each cell \(1\le k\le C\) and module gene set \(1\le j\le M\),

where the first term simply computes the average expression of selected gene set genes in each cell of input gene expression matrix \({\bf{L}}\), and the second term calculates the aggregated average expression of background genes within the same cells.

The two resulting enrichment score matrices are subsequently concatenated into a single \(C\times 2M\) matrix \({\bf{K}}\):

To transfer these enrichment scores into comparable spaces, CytoTRACE 2 standardizes each score across cells, yielding \(C\times 2M\) matrix \({{\bf{K}}}^{{\rm{norm}}}\). This standardization, implemented via torch.nn.BatchNorm1d from PyTorch v.2.0.0 with affine = False, tracks the mean and variance of each score during training. Once trained, the model applies these learned values, rather than dataset-specific values, for standardization at inference.

To convert the gene set enrichment scores to a single score per cell per GSBN module, the normalized scores \({{\bf{K}}}^{{\rm{norm}}}\) are passed through a feedforward layer, termed the ‘enrichment layer' in the CytoTRACE 2 core model, containing the associated length \(2M\) gene set enrichment score weight vector \(\mathop{{\rm{V}}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) and yielding length \(C\) potency category score vector \(\mathop{q}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\). As part of this process, dropout is applied to reduce overfitting during model training, with a predetermined fraction of the normalized scores set at random to zero. From the weights in each \(\mathop{{\rm{V}}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\), concatenated across potency categories into matrix \({\bf{V}}\), the directionality and importance of each gene set can be interpreted (see ‘Interpretability' below).

The model then integrates across the potency category scores produced by each GSBN module, concatenating the potency category score vectors into \(C\times G\) potency score matrix \({\bf{Q}}\). This procedure represents the shared output layer of the CytoTRACE 2 core model.

To convert the logit entries of \({\bf{Q}}\) to likelihoods, the model applies a softmax activation function, yielding \(C\times G\) matrix \({\bf{P}}\) representing the likelihood of each cell belonging to each of the six potency categories. The model then predicts cellular potency by assigning the potency category with highest likelihood for each cell, yielding length \(C\) vector \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\):

The \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\) vector represents one of the key outputs of the CytoTRACE 2 core model; however, the model also computes an absolute developmental potential from this set of likelihoods, termed the raw potency score \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\). For this aspect, we introduce length \(G\) ordered vector \(\mathop{t}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) to be multiplied by the potency category likelihood matrix:

where \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) is the length \(C\) raw potency score vector. As the potency categories are ordered based on their absolute developmental potential, the resulting raw potency score will be closer to one for higher potency categories, such as totipotent, and closer to zero for lower potency categories, such as differentiated. As \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) directly incorporates model uncertainty, it is passed to ‘Postprocessing' below to define a more granular developmental ordering.

As the fully trained CytoTRACE 2 model predicts potency for each cell individually, CytoTRACE 2 further processes the output (raw potency score \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) and predicted potency categories \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\)) to incorporate the neighborhood structure of transcriptionally similar cells. We reasoned that doing so could further improve performance given our previous experience combining gene counts with transcriptional covariance in CytoTRACE 1 (ref. 3). To this end, we devised and validated a three-step procedure using the training cohort, as described below. Notably, this procedure improves correlations with relative developmental orderings (see ‘Metrics' below) over \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) or \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\) alone without sacrificing the potency classification performance achieved by \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\) (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

In the first step, CytoTRACE 2 applies Markov diffusion to smooth \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) using the same implementation as CytoTRACE 1 (ref. 3). In brief, the log2-adjusted CPM/TPM gene expression input \({\bf{L}}\) is used to create a Markov matrix from the transcriptional similarity between cells over the top 1,000 genes with highest dispersion3. This similarity matrix is then used to smooth \(\mathop{\mathrm{RPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) with diffusion parameter α = 0.9 as previously described3, yielding smoothed potency score \(\mathop{\mathrm{SPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\). Using the same sampling procedure described in our previous work3, the running time of this step can be significantly reduced without loss of performance (Extended Data Fig. 1c). In this study, sampling was restricted to datasets with >10,000 cells (Supplementary Table 1).

To reconcile \(\mathop{\mathrm{SPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }\) with predicted potency categories \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\), in the second step CytoTRACE 2 performs a binning procedure to maintain \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\) while preserving relative potency ordering within each category. To do so, CytoTRACE 2 first separates cells by their predicted potency category and assigns each cell \(1\le w\le C\) a rank \({\mathcal{R}}\left(k,{\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}}_{w}\right)\) relative to all cells sharing predicted potency category \({\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}}_{w}\). For this transformation, within each potency category \(1\le p\le G\), the cell with lowest potency score receives rank 1 while the cell with highest potency score receives maximum rank \({r}_{\max }\left(p\right)\). Cells are then arranged uniformly by rank per potency category within equal length partitions of the unit interval, yielding binned smooth potency score \({\mathop{\mathrm{SPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup}}{}^{B}\). Thus, the binned smooth potency score for differentiated cells extends from 0 to 1/6, unipotent from 1/6 to 2/6, and so on, with relative ordering within each bin matching that of the original smoothed potency score.

In the third step, to further smooth \({\mathop{\mathrm{SPS}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup }}{}^{B}\) while minimizing the impact on \(\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}\) and allowing for the preservation of rare cell states (Extended Data Fig. 3f), CytoTRACE 2 applies a variation of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) smoothing to datasets with >100 cells. Here, we introduce an efficient heuristic approach for adaptive neighborhood smoothing guided by two key assumptions: (1) cells with more similar gene expression profiles are more likely to share a potency phenotype; and (2) prediction errors for cells with the same ground truth potency exhibit a random distribution around a central mean. To balance these two considerations and identify an appropriate neighborhood size, we select k adaptively for each cell according to the following process. First, given log2-adjusted CPM/TPM gene expression profiles for the selected cell, we standardize expression per cell to zero mean and unit variance, then perform dimension reduction of standardized gene expression profiles over all cells to the top 30 principal components (PCs). Using the top 30 PCs, we then compute pairwise Euclidean distances for all cells, rescaling the resulting distances to unit maximum per cell of interest. Next, we define the neighborhood around each center cell w through an iterative procedure, allowing a maximum neighborhood size of 30 cells. We start with the nearest cell to \(w\), denoted \({c}_{1}\), and calculate the average potency score prediction for \(w\) and \({c}_{1}\), mapping the result to one of six broad potency categories, yielding \({P}_{1}\). We repeat this calculation for the next two nearest cells to \(w\) (\({c}_{2}\) and \({c}_{3}\)), yielding \({P}_{2}\), and compare \({P}_{1}\) and \({P}_{2}\). If identical, we assume that we have sufficiently captured the neighborhood, setting k = 3 (for the three non-self-neighbors) and exiting the process. If not identical, we repeat the procedure increasing the group size by one, in other words, comparing the nearest two cells to \(w\) (yielding three total cells) with the next nearest three cells (\({c}_{3}\), \({c}_{4}\) and \({c}_{5}\)). We repeat this process until the resulting potency categories are the same between two groups, in which case we select \(k\) to encompass all cells considered between the two groups, or until we exhaust our candidate nearest neighbor cells (reach a group size of 15). If concordance between nearest and next nearest groups is not found, we keep our initial selection of \(k\) = 3.

Once \(k\) is determined, we update our prediction for \(w\) according to the distance-weighted mean of neighborhood potencies to obtain the final potency score prediction:

where \(N(w)\) denotes the set of all cells within the selected neighborhood of center cell \(w\), including \(w\) itself, and \({d}_{c}\) denotes the Euclidean distance of cell \(c\) to cell \(w\). Categorical potency predictions are updated based on the defined intervals above, yielding \({\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}}^{* }\).

We found empirically that combining these three approaches yielded superior performance on the training cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

For model training, we defined a loss function combining cross-entropy loss with an additional term penalizing gene set size based on the binary weighting matrix \({{\bf{W}}}_{p}^{{\rm{B}}}\) originating from each GSBN module, \(1\le p\le G\). More precisely, we define the loss function as the sum of gene set size penalty loss \({J}_{S}\) and a prediction loss per cell \({J}_{P}\):

In detail, given potency category predictions \({\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}}_{w}\) and ground truth potency categories \({{\boldsymbol{y}}}_{w}\) for cell \({w}\) (see ‘Single-cell potency atlas' above), we defined prediction loss \({J}_{P}\) as:

where \({\mathop{\boldsymbol{v}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup}}_{w}\) denotes the loss weight assigned to cell \({w}\), and \({CE}\left({\hat{{\boldsymbol{y}}}}_{w},{{\boldsymbol{y}}}_{w}\right)\) denotes the cross-entropy loss for cell \({w}\). Loss weights for all cells are contained in the length \(C\) weighting vector \(\mathop{\boldsymbol{v}}\limits^{\rightharpoonup}\), which has unit sum and is constructed hierarchically to assign equal weight (1) to all broad potency categories, (2) to all phenotypes within each broad potency category, and (3) to all datasets contributing to each phenotype.

We defined gene set size penalty loss \({J}_{S}\) as:

where \({\left|\bullet \right|}_{F}\) denotes the Frobenius norm, \({\boldsymbol{\odot }}\) denotes the Hadamard (or element-wise) product, \({\bf{I}}\) denotes the \(M\times M\) identity matrix, λ denotes the gene set size penalty weight, and a serves as a scaling factor to make \({J}_{S}\) invariant to the number of gene sets included in \({{\bf{W}}}_{p}^{{\rm{B}}}\), with factor \(\sqrt{12}\) selected to anchor the gene set size penalty weight to the center of the range of hidden sizes tested (see ‘Hyperparameter optimization'). This loss component serves to minimize the number of genes in each gene set while regularizing the training of the model.

To promote model generalizability, we introduced two explicit regularization aspects. We included a dropout layer to avoid model overfitting to specific enrichment scores (“Integration of scores”). A dropout layer51 randomly drops (sets to zero) units in a hidden layer of a neural network. This layer was applied to the normalized scores \({{\bf{K}}}^{{\rm{norm}}}\) during training only. Additionally, a penalty term was added to the loss function to constrain the number of genes in each gene set of \({{\bf{W}}}^{{\rm{B}}}\) (“Loss function”).

Model weights were initialized according to PyTorch v.2.0.0 default except for the binary weighting matrices, which were initialized at random with values sampled from the Gaussian distribution with mean of –0.1 and s.d. of 0.055 to produce a sparse initial binarization with approximately 500 genes selected per gene set.

Model training was performed with mini-batch learning using a batch size of 1,024. To balance batches and ensure equal representation for the model learning process, each batch was constructed via uniform sampling across datasets and phenotypes (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3) as implemented by torch.utils.data.WeightedRandomSampler in PyTorch.

Following initialization, forward propagation proceeded for each iteration as described in ‘Core model architecture', with parameters updated according to their definition. For numeric stability, the cutoff rank τ (‘Gene set binary networks') for trimming input rank space expression matrix \({\bf{R}}\) was not learned directly but rather computed as a function of learnable parameter \({\tau }_{m}{\mathbb{\in }}{\mathbb{R}}\), which was initialized uniformly at random from \({0\le \tau }_{m}\le 1\) per module and suitably scaled. As gene set enrichment score calculation (‘Enrichment assessment') requires a gene set pool larger than the gene set itself for comparison, τ was computed from \({\tau }_{m}\) in such a way as to ensure that the ranks of at least ten more genes beyond the maximum gene set size of the module were preserved following trimming to \({\bf{T}}\). Thus, at each iteration, the updated \({\tau }_{m}\) was scaled and constrained as follows:

Model predictions were assessed at each iteration against ground truth, with the loss function and its gradient computed and used to backpropagate updates to network weights using PyTorch's NAdam optimizer with custom learning rate \({\rm{lr}}=0.001\) (see ‘Hyperparameter optimization' below) and otherwise default parameters. Given the role of inertia in successfully training binary neural networks52,53, we employed cross-epoch gradient accumulation to dampen binary weight flipping and achieve a stabilizing effect. This approach additionally facilitates broader hyperparameter space exploration while validation-based early stopping (see ‘Model evaluation and stopping') ensures that the most performant model encountered during training is retained. Backpropagation for the binary neural network component of each GSBN module was implemented with Straight-Through Estimator and hardtanh activation function as previously described48.

We evaluated model validation performance via weighted accuracy, defined as the mean F1 score across evaluable potency categories. To do this, we first calculated the F1 score for each phenotype (standardized as in Supplementary Table 3) and dataset pair using metrics.precision_recall_fscore_support from sklearn v.1.0.2. We then averaged the resulting scores across datasets per phenotype, across phenotypes within each broad potency category, and across broad potency categories, yielding the final weighted accuracy. For the standard CytoTRACE 2 model, each validation set consisted of a single dataset; however, for the leave-clade-out model (see ‘Generalizability to unseen cell-type clades'), validation sets included all cells covering a clade, regardless of dataset. All models were trained for 100 epochs with the best model weights by the highest score on the validation set after a minimum of 15 initial training epochs preserved and returned for the final model.

To evaluate the hyperparameter space of CytoTRACE 2, we performed a hyperparameter sweep over the training cohort using wandb (v.0.16.4) (https://wandb.ai). We explored the learning rate lr over \(\left\{\mathrm{0.01,0.005,0.001,0.0005,0.0001}\right\}\), number \(M\) of gene sets per broad potency category over \(\left\{\mathrm{1,2,4,8,12,16,24,32,48}\right\}\), gene set size penalty weight λ over \(\left\{\mathrm{0.5,0.1,0.05,0.01,0.005,0.001}\right\}\), dropout rate \(\rho\) over \(\left\{\mathrm{0,0.25,0.5}\right\}\), and enrichment considering whether to use AMS enrichment, UCell enrichment, or the combination of both as described in ‘Enrichment assessment' above. For every iteration of leave-one-dataset-out nested cross-validation, we trained models across 500 different combinations of these hyperparameters sampled based on the random hyperparameter search. To minimize overfitting to training data, we used a nested cross-validation framework. While one dataset was held out from training and evaluated as a validation set, another dataset was also held out from training but used to determine the early stopping point as described in ‘Model evaluation and stopping'. We scored each hyperparameter combination by weighted accuracy over model validation sets (Supplementary Table 3; see ‘Model evaluation and stopping').

We observed that variation in hyperparameter values had minimal impact on performance, underscoring overall model robustness (Extended Data Fig. 1e, left and Supplementary Table 6). Final hyperparameter selection was carried out by a manual curation process identifying values yielding consistently (albeit modestly) higher weighted accuracy. In selecting the number of gene sets \(M\) per potency category, we found that model performance increased with \(M\) before plateauing (Extended Data Fig. 1e, right); as such, we selected \(M\) slightly larger than the number corresponding to the elbow of this curve. The final hyperparameters used were \(M=24\) gene sets per potency; \(\rho =0.5\) dropout probability; \(\lambda =0.01\) gene set size penalty weight; and \({\rm{lr}}=0.001\) learning rate.

Next, we evaluated the enrichment metrics. Among all models, we limited to 84 models with hyperparameter values in ranges of plateau (\(M\ge 2\) gene sets per potency; \(\rho =0.5\) dropout probability, \(\lambda \le 0.01\), \({\rm{lr}}\le 0.001\)). AMS enrichment and both AMS and UCell enrichment achieved superior performance compared to UCell enrichment alone (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 6). Given the potential to enhance generalizability, we therefore selected the combination of AMS and UCell enrichment metrics for the final model.

Models were trained via leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation for each of the training datasets, with final CytoTRACE 2 predictions in non-training data obtained as the result of integrating predictions across the 19 resulting models followed by an additional postprocessing step. As described in ‘Integration of scores' above, each model m yields a \(C\times G\) potency category likelihood matrix \({{\bf{P}}}^{m}\). Models were integrated by entry-wise averaging of potency category likelihood matrices to yield a single potency category likelihood matrix \({{\bf{P}}}^{{ensemble}}\) from which potency category predictions and raw potency scores were computed as described above, before passing them to ‘Postprocessing'.

To create dictionary \({\mathbb{D}}\) (‘Preprocessing' above), all human gene symbols were mapped to their closest mouse orthologs, as determined by gene sequence similarity, using the GRCh38.p13 and GRCm39 annotation files available from Ensembl v.109, respectively. In cases where a single mouse gene \(g\) was identified as the best hit for multiple human genes, the human gene with maximum sequence similarity to \(g\) was selected and the remaining human gene(s) excluded from further consideration. Unique human gene symbols without orthologs by the above process were also included for completeness. To define a common subset, only genes present in at least 80% of datasets from an initial development cohort, a subset of the final training cohort, were retained. Combining these steps, \({\mathbb{D}}\) was assembled with 14,271 unique gene symbols, including 13,750 orthologous pairs and 521 genes without orthologs in Ensembl via the mapping step above. When mapping human datasets to \({\mathbb{D}}\), gene symbol aliases are resolved using linked aliases available from https://biomart.genenames.org. When mapping to mouse datasets, alias gene symbols are resolved using data available from https://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/.

The GSBN architecture of CytoTRACE 2 enables direct interrogation of the binary weight matrices, consisting of gene sets associated with each potency category (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). By examining the orientation of the output layer weights for each gene set, we found that gene sets with positive weights (polarity) were highly enriched in a given potency category, whereas those with negative weights (polarity) were preferentially depleted (Fig. 2c). Additionally, we reasoned that genes repeatedly selected for a given potency category were more likely to be important for effective classification. As such, we designed a metric to quantify feature importance, assigning importance scores to genes according to the frequency at which they were selected in positively versus negatively weighted gene sets. Here, we incorporate gene selection frequency across all 19 training models computed by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) over the training cohort datasets.

More formally, we define \(N\times G\) feature importance score matrix \({\bf{F}}\) (Supplementary Table 15) containing the feature importance score of each gene \(1\le i\le N\) for each potency category \(1\le p\le G\) based on the gene set compositions and enrichment weights across models. Two enrichment weights correspond with each gene set, one per enrichment score type (see ‘Enrichment assessment'). Given gene set enrichment weight matrix \({{\bf{V}}}^{l}\) of model \(l\), we calculate the polarity \({\rm{Polarity}}\left({{\bf{V}}}^{l},j,p\right)\) of gene set \(j\) defined within model \(l\) for potency category module \(p\) as the sign of the average of these two weights. Then, relying on model binary weighting matrices to encode gene set composition, we construct feature importance score matrix \({\bf{F}}\) entry-wise as

where \({{\bf{W}}}_{p,l}^{{\rm{B}}}\left[i,j\right]\) denotes the \(\left[i,j\right]\)th entry of the binary weighting matrix from module \(p\) of model \(l\).

Two key metrics, illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1d, were used to quantify reconstruction of known developmental orderings: absolute order and relative order. Absolute order quantifies cross-dataset performance, whereby predicted orderings from all cells with annotated potency levels are analyzed together, regardless of dataset, tissue type or platform (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Relative order quantifies performance within a given dataset and tissue type, akin to conventional pseudotime and ranges from 1 (least differentiated) to \(N\) (most differentiated) in each dataset (Supplementary Table 4). For both metrics, we applied weighted Kendall correlation (\(\tau\)) (wdm package v.0.2.4 in R) to assess concordance between known and predicted developmental orderings, with weighting schemes provided in Supplementary Table 5. Similar to our previous work3, ground truth phenotypes corresponding to less mature cells were coded with lower ranks (starting at 1); therefore, higher predictions of developmental order were ranked such that higher values received lower ranks and vice versa.

For categorical predictions (CytoTRACE 2 and potency classification benchmarking outputs only), we evaluated potency classification performance as well. Binary correctness of predicted versus ground truth broad potency categories was assessed via mean multiclass F1 score, implemented with function f1_score from sklearn.metrics with average = none (Extended Data Figs. 1c top, 2d second from right, 3b–e left bottom, 7a left and 7bx axis). To account for the magnitude of deviations from ground truth potency, we also considered mean absolute error (MAE), assigning each broad potency class an integer label corresponding to the class ordering, with labels ranging from 1 (differentiated) to 6 (totipotent), and computing the absolute value of the difference between predicted and ground truth categories (Extended Data Figs. 2d far right, 3b–e right bottom, 7a right and 7by axis). For both metrics, scores were computed per ground truth potency category then aggregated by mean across potencies.

To test the generalizability of CytoTRACE 2 to unseen developmental systems, we trained a version with a leave-clade-out framework (Fig. 1f), grouping phenotypes into 18 mutually exclusive developmental clades as detailed in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 9. Of note, to ensure representation of some totipotent and pluripotent phenotypes for all training sets, we partitioned embryonic phenotypes into two clades by alternating granular potency level annotation, corresponding to distinct time points during development and resulting in 19 total clades for this analysis (Supplementary Table 2). The final clades cleanly separate, for example, immune cells, neural cells, endothelial cells, connective tissue cells and bone cells, among others. Stem and progenitor cells that produce a given clade were included in the same partition as that clade (for example, pancreatic multipotent progenitors were included with pancreatic epithelial cells). Epithelial cells were separated by tissue to avoid conflating tissue-specific developmental hierarchies. For each clade, we trained an ensemble of two models over the remaining 18 clades, selecting at random 17 clades for training and one clade as a held-out validation set to be used for early stopping (see ‘Model evaluation and stopping') for each model. We then applied the resulting ensemble to the unseen test clade, assessing performance across all held-out clades in Fig. 1f.

To assess the robustness of the model to variation in the composition of the training cohort, we repeated the CytoTRACE 2 training process as described in ‘The CytoTRACE 2 framework' across a series of three randomized splits covering all 33 datasets in the single-cell potency atlas (Supplementary Table 8). We partitioned the datasets at random into three folds, each containing 11 datasets. To ensure minimum adequate representation within each category, we confirmed that each fold contained at least one phenotype per broad potency category. Tabula Muris, which was divided into two sub-datasets according to platform for the original CytoTRACE 2 training cohort due to its size and diversity, was again divided, with one of its sub-datasets assigned to another fold at random. For each split, two folds were combined to form the training cohort and the remaining one left as a test set for evaluation (2:1 training–test split; Supplementary Table 8). Performance per test set of these three randomized splits, along with the original CytoTRACE 2 test set, was assessed by absolute order, relative order, mean multiclass F1 score and MAE (see ‘Metrics'), showing strong consistency across folds (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Performance for the three randomized splits was additionally assessed across all held-out datasets jointly in Extended Data Fig. 2e.

To evaluate the robustness of CytoTRACE 2 to potential noise within potency annotations, we trained models across two scenarios of training cohort annotation error, then evaluated model performance over the test cohort (see ‘Training and test datasets'). To simulate annotation error, we formulated label noise as a transition matrix54, encoding the probability of perturbation from one potency to another (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Transition matrix perturbation probabilities were designed to follow a Gaussian distribution based on the rank distance between the original potency and perturbed potency. In detail, the probability that the potency label of cell \(s\) transitions from true potency \(j\) to perturbed potency i

where potencies \(i,j\) are represented by their rank within the six broad potency categories. The s.d. values (\(\sigma\)) were selected to yield a titration of 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% and 80% perturbation levels. Rows were normalized to unit sum for a net probability of one. For the first annotation error scenario, we considered cell-level annotation error and perturbed the potency annotations of individual cells independently (Extended Data Fig. 3b). For the second, we considered phenotype-level annotation errors and simultaneously perturbed the potency annotations of the entire standardized phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

To determine the influence of variable gene counts and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts on CytoTRACE 2, we performed two experiments in which scRNA-seq expression data from all 14 datasets in the test cohort were perturbed by downsampling gene counts (Extended Data Fig. 3d) and all seven droplet-based datasets in the test cohort (Supplementary Table 1) were perturbed by downsampling UMIs (Extended Data Fig. 3e). We assessed the robustness of the model to different gene counts by downsampling the expression data of each cell to the same number of genes: 2,000, 1,000, 750, 500, 250 and 100. We selected the top genes by highest expression and set the expression of the remaining genes to zero. For any expression level ties at the threshold, we selected the genes to include to reach the target gene count at random. The downsampling process for UMIs consisted of randomly sampling the expression data of each cell based on the transcriptome probability distribution, defined as the fractional expression of each gene after scaling the sum of UMIs in each cell to one. Then, using the raw count matrices, we downsampled the expression data of each cell to the same number of UMIs: 5,000, 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, 500 or 100 UMIs. Cells with UMIs lower than a given threshold were unaltered. We repeated each process for five replicates, then assessed performance for standard metrics as described above (see ‘Metrics') relative to the CytoTRACE 2 predictions without perturbation.

Given the inclusion of neighborhood-based smoothing in model postprocessing, we performed a titration experiment applying CytoTRACE 2 to test datasets with selected phenotypes downsampled to increasingly rare abundance. For 11 phenotypes spanning a range of potencies, we downsampled cells of the selected phenotype to predefined abundances of 50, 20, 10, 8, 5, 2 and 1 cell(s), leaving the remaining cells in the dataset unchanged. We repeated this titration process five times for each phenotype, observing robust predictions down to five cells per phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 3f). As such, we recommend that the final postprocessing step (adaptive k-NN smoothing) be omitted when exceedingly rare cell states (consisting of <5 cells each) are of interest.

For the analyses presented in Extended Data Fig. 5, we downloaded and curated six publicly available scRNA-seq datasets spanning each embryonic day during mouse prenatal development2,21,22,23,24,25 (Supplementary Table 1). One dataset, which covers pre-implantation through early implantation (E0.5–E4.5) (Deng et al.22), was obtained from the 19-dataset training cohort (Supplementary Table 1) and evaluated using a CytoTRACE 2 model trained on the remaining 18 datasets to avoid overfitting (see ‘Benchmarking developmental potential inference methods and annotated gene sets'). Four datasets21,23,24,25 covering embryogenesis periods from implantation to organogenesis were previously assembled by Qiu et al.25 and are accessible through http://tome.gs.washington.edu. Finally, a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset2 covering organogenesis through birth (E8.75-P0) and generated by sci-RNA-seq3 was downloaded from http://mouse.gs.washington.edu. As we compared CytoTRACE 2 against multiple methods with highly variable time complexity (‘Benchmarking developmental potential inference methods and annotated gene sets'), all cells were randomly downsampled to 30 cells per author-supplied phenotype per time point, resulting in a combined dataset of 183,771 cells. This allowed us to balance considerations of performance versus computational efficiency. We ran each method on each dataset individually as described in ‘Benchmarking developmental potential inference methods and annotated gene sets'. No dataset integration or batch normalization procedures were applied. For Organogenesis (E8.5)25 and Organogenesis (E8.5–P0)2, which were sequenced using sci-RNA-seq3, we used count data after running SCTransform of Seurat (v.4.3.0) with default parameters. Due to the large size of the dataset, Organogenesis (E8.75–P0)2 was run with ten randomly divided batches for SCENT (SR) and SLICE. Primordial germ cells were excluded owing to the wide range of potency levels reported in previous literature55.

For the analyses in Extended Data Fig. 5d,e, we leveraged a data-driven lineage tree of mouse embryogenesis encoded as a directed acyclic graph2. Although the tree was constructed using a heuristic approach based on transcriptional covariance across embryonic time, it reflects many known parent-daughter relationships2. It thus serves as a proxy for developmental potential. We defined ground truth as the distance from the root (zygote) to each daughter node (Extended Data Fig. 5d, top). Using matching phenotype labels between the tree and the data presented in Extended Data Fig. 5a, CytoTRACE 2 potency scores were averaged by phenotype, balanced first by time points within a given embryonic day (if any) and then by embryonic day. If the same phenotype was present in more than one dataset, we weighted equally by dataset. For each direct path in the tree (from root to leaf), the resulting scores were then converted to rank space (Extended Data Fig. 5d, center). To reconcile cases where a given node i participates in multiple paths, we used the average rank for i. CytoTRACE 1 predictions were processed in the same manner (Extended Data Fig. 5d, bottom). The resulting ranks were correlated with ground truth distances (distance from the root) in Extended Data Fig. 5e.

For the analysis presented in Extended Data Fig. 6a, we downloaded the Galen et al.56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE116256; PMID 30827681) from the Curated Cancer Cell Atlas website on 28 June 2023 (https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA/)57. We leveraged author-supplied cell type annotations, including classifications of malignant and non-malignant cells from 3CA57. From this dataset, comprising 28 samples with malignant cells, we excluded two cell line samples (‘MUTZ3' and ‘OCI-AML3'). We ran CytoTRACE 2 with default parameters (‘Benchmarking developmental potential inference methods and annotated gene sets') on all annotated malignant cells from each tumor sample. For quality control, we further excluded samples for which each predicted potency label contained <10 malignant cells. For each of the resulting tumor samples (n = 19), we created a single matrix of malignant cells and non-malignant cells, with the latter uniformly downsampled from all patients to 100 cells per author-supplied phenotype (‘B_cell', ‘erythrocyte', ‘myeloid', ‘NK_cell', ‘plasma' and ‘T_cell'; non-malignant cells labeled as ‘undifferentiated' were excluded from additional analysis). We then calculated the log2 fold changes (LFCs) of each potency category versus all other phenotypes by tumor sample and averaged by potency category across tumor samples. Finally, we normalized the logFC values of each gene to mean zero and unit variance across potency categories and plotted the enrichment of AML cell-type-specific gene signatures26 (‘LSPC-Primed-Top100', ‘LSPC-Quiescent', ‘GMP-like-Top100' and ‘Mono-like-Top100'; https://github.com/andygxzeng/AMLHierarchies), each expected to be enriched in multipotent, multipotent, oligopotent and unipotent/differentiated cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 10).

For Extended Data Fig. 6b, we applied CytoTRACE 2 to scRNA-seq profiles of six oligodendrogliomas27, with coordinates for the associated oligodendroglioma 2D lineage hierarchy embedding obtained from https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP12/oligodendroglioma-intra-tumor-heterogeneity. We then assigned malignant oligodendroglioma cells to four transcriptional states following the protocol described by the authors27 and visualized the association of CytoTRACE 2 potency predictions with the author-supplied stemness score. For the latter, we separated cells according to the stemness score by partitioning them into successive intervals of 0.25 units. We then displayed CytoTRACE 2 potency scores as a function of each interval (Extended Data Fig. 6b, right).

To evaluate CytoTRACE 2 against supervised machine learning approaches commonly employed in cell type prediction tasks (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), we selected three dedicated single-cell annotation methods with superior performance in a benchmarking study28 (scPred30, SingleCellNet31 and scmap32) and five general-purpose classifiers (below), each trained to predict six broad potency labels based on single-cell expression profiles.

All tools were trained and tested over a series of four folds, including the original CytoTRACE 2 training–test split (Fig. 1b) along with three randomized splits (see ‘Randomization of training and test sets'), collectively encompassing all 33 ground truth datasets in the single-cell potency atlas described above, with classification performance per test cohort assessed by mean multiclass F1 score and MAE (Extended Data Fig. 7a and b; see ‘Metrics'). For all methods, expression data were first mapped into the uniform feature space used by CytoTRACE 2 (see ‘Preprocessing' and ‘Dictionary of input genes'). Unless otherwise specified, and for all general-purpose classifiers, expression data were then CPM/TPM normalized and log2-transformed and subsequently standardized per cell to zero mean and unit variance. Other normalization schemes generally yielded worse performance and were thus omitted from further consideration (log2-adjusted CPM/TPM data, either used alone or with gene-level standardization). No explicit dataset integration or batch correction was performed. For general-purpose classifiers, versions were trained with and without sample weighting (computed as for CytoTRACE 2; see ‘Loss function') for class imbalance mitigation, with the best performing version across all folds selected for each. All parameters were set to default values unless otherwise specified.

We applied CytoTRACE 2 with model ensembling and postprocessing as described in ‘The CytoTRACE 2 framework' to predict cell potency categories. Datasets containing more than 100,000 cells were processed in batches of 100,000 cells, and diffusion was applied in batches of 10,000 cells for datasets exceeding 10,000 cells.

A dedicated cell type classification method, scPred first performs a dimension reduction, identifying PCs exhibiting significant variation across classes, then, as the default option, applies a support vector machine approach for classification30. Following the recommended pipeline for scPred (v.1.9.2) as described at https://powellgenomicslab.github.io/scPred/articles/introduction.html, we first normalized and scaled expression data using the NormalizeData() and ScaleData() functions in Seurat (v.5.1.0), respectively. We then used scPred's getFeatureSpace() function to identify class-informative PCs, trainModel() to train the default support vector machine (SVM) with radial kernel model for each potency category (one-versus-rest), and scPredict() for classification. A relaxed probability threshold of 0 was used to avoid ‘unassigned' labels.

SingleCellNet performs cell type classification using a random forest multiclass classification approach31. Here, we trained the method over unnormalized expression data via the scn_train function of pySingleCellNet (v.0.1.1) with nTopGenes = 200, nTopGenePairs = 200, nRand = 100, nTrees = 1,000, stratify = False, and propOther= 0.4, following the tutorial provided at https://pysinglecellnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/train_classifier.html. The scn_classify() function with nrand = 0 was used for classification.

scmap uses a clustering approach to project cells onto a reference dataset for cell type classification32. Following the recommended pipeline for scmap (v.1.26.0) provided at https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/scmap/inst/doc/scmap.html, we log2-transformed expression data, then used selectFeatures() to select informative genes and indexCell() to create a scmapCell index for the training dataset. For classification, we used scmapCell() to project the index onto the test dataset and scmapCell2Cluster() to obtain label assignments. A relaxed probability threshold of 0 was set to assign labels to as many cells as possible regardless of assignment confidence.

We trained a logistic regression model to perform cell potency classification using the SGDClassifier from scikit-learn (v.1.4.2) with loss = ‘log_loss', default L2 regularization, and sample weights provided for class balancing. This function internally employs a one-versus-rest (OVR) strategy, training a separate binary classifier for each potency category and selecting the potency category with highest confidence at evaluation.

We trained and applied the XGBClassifier function from the XGBoost library (v.2.1.1) with default parameters and without sample weights. Like logistic regression, this method uses the OVR approach.

We implemented a linear SVM model using Scikit-learn's SGDClassifier with loss = ‘hinge' for linear support vector classification with OVR. Sample weights were provided during training.

We implemented an additional SVM version using SVC from scikit-learn (v.1.4.2) with the default radial basis function kernel and γ = ‘auto'. The default decision function, which employs an inference of OVR from one-versus-one fits internally, was used. Sample weights were not provided during training.

Using LogisticRegression from scikit-learn (v.1.4.2) with multi_class = ‘multinomial', we fit a single logistic regression model for all potency categories simultaneously using cross-entropy loss and the ‘sag' solver. A maximum number of iterations (max_iter = 500) and tolerance (tol = 1 × 10−3) were set to ensure convergence. Sample weights were not provided during training.

To rigorously assess performance on our compendium of 33 curated scRNA-seq datasets, we compared CytoTRACE 2 with eight published methods for predicting developmental potential from scRNA-seq data as well as nearly 19,000 previously annotated gene sets (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Tables 11–13). Unless otherwise stated, all evaluated methods and gene sets were applied to scRNA-seq datasets individually, without batch correction or integration across datasets, with expression data normalized per author recommendations and with default parameters. All expression data were subset to the cells with known potency. Each tissue and platform pair of Tabula Sapiens33 and Tabula Muris43 datasets were run separately.

Several methods rely on human gene symbols, as noted below. For all such instances, we mapped mouse dataset gene symbols to their closest human orthologs, as determined by gene sequence similarity, using the GRCm39 and GRCh38.p13 annotation files available from Ensembl, respectively. In cases where a single human gene \(g\) was identified as the best hit for multiple mouse genes, the mouse gene with maximum sequence similarity to \(g\) was selected.

As several methods have slower running times, to promote an equitable comparison while achieving computational feasibility, larger datasets were first downsampled. The Tabula Muris43 dataset was downsampled to 30 cells per phenotype, separated by tissue and platform pair, and the ‘Immune cell atlas (10x)', ‘Human breast 1 (10x)', ‘Human breast 2 (10x)', and Tabula Sapiens33 datasets were downsampled to 100 cells per phenotype (Supplementary Table 1). Cell types in Tabula Sapiens33 with fewer than five cells were removed after the prediction of each method to overcome the reduced data quality of Tabula Sapiens33 (‘Training and test datasets').

We applied CytoTRACE 2 with model ensembling and postprocessing as described in ‘The CytoTRACE 2 framework' to predict cell potency categories and scores. Datasets containing more than 100,000 cells were processed in batches of 100,000 cells, and diffusion was applied in batches of 10,000 cells for datasets exceeding 10,000 cells. To evaluate the 19 scRNA-seq datasets included in the CytoTRACE 2 training cohort, we trained a separate model for each over the remaining 18 datasets. All other datasets were evaluated with the primary version of CytoTRACE 2 trained over all training datasets.

CytoTRACE 1, the predecessor of CytoTRACE 2, introduced transcriptional diversity quantified through gene counts as a correlate of developmental potential and exploited this concept to predict relative cellular potency from scRNA-seq3. CytoTRACE 1 (v.0.3.3) was applied with default parameters.

SCENT estimates relative cellular potency from scRNA-seq and a reference protein–protein interaction (PPI) network using single-cell signaling entropy (SR), a measure of the diversity of molecular pathway activity in a cell15. SCENT (v.1.0.3) was executed with the ‘net13Jun12' human PPI network provided with the package and otherwise default parameters. For mouse datasets, genes were first mapped to human orthologs as described above. All gene symbols were converted to Entrez ID using org.Hs.eg.db (v.3.15.0) in R. Gene expression matrices were normalized per documentation recommendation (https://github.com/aet21/SCENT/blob/master/vignettes/SCENT.Rmd).

CCAT, implemented within the SCENT package, was developed as a highly efficient alternative to the original SCENT method, SCENT (SR)14. CCAT was applied with the same package, PPI network, and preprocessing steps described above (‘SCENT (SR)') with expression datasets prepared as per documentation recommendations.

Similar to SCENT (CCAT), FitDevo infers cellular potency from the correlation between gene expression and a measure of gene weights20. FitDevo (v.1.2.0) was applied following tutorial instructions with binary gene weight matrix downloaded from the same source (https://github.com/jumphone/FitDevo/#demo-1–infer-developmental-potential-dp-using-expression-matrix-of-scrna-seq-data).

SLICE relies on transcriptomic entropy for cellular potency prediction and lineage reconstruction, estimating entropy over functional groups of genes computed from Gene Ontology annotations17. SLICE (v.0.99.0) was applied according to demo details from the method's GitHub page (https://github.com/xu-lab/SLICE/blob/master/demo/FB.R).

StemID infers cellular differentiation trajectories from scRNA-seq data with a clustering-based algorithm analyzing links between clusters16. StemID, implemented in RaceID (v.0.1.4), was run according to documentation vignette instructions (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RaceID/vignettes/RaceID.html). For each dataset, an SCseq object was initialized from each input gene expression matrix using filterData() with mintotal = 10. Ltree() and compentropy() were then applied consecutively to obtain the StemID score for cell potency.

scTour implements a deep learning architecture combining a variational autoencoder with a neural ordinary differential equation to reconstruct the developmental trajectory of an input scRNA-seq dataset, oriented according to gene counts19. scTour (v.1.0.0) was trained and applied to each dataset individually per ‘Model training' documentation vignette instructions at https://sctour.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook/scTour_inference_PostInference_adjustment.html. When the raw count matrix was available for the dataset, the negative binomial conditioned likelihood loss function was used. Otherwise, the CPM/TPM expression matrix was log2-transformed, and the mean squared error loss function was used instead. Cell potency scores were obtained from the developmental pseudotime predictions extracted from the model training output with get_time().

mRNAsi utilizes a one-class logistic regression framework to construct a cellular stemness index applicable to cell potency estimation from bulk and scRNA-seq data18. mRNAsi was trained as described previously3. All input gene expression matrices were CPM/TPM normalized and log2-transformed.

The predictive capacity of 18,706 annotated gene sets (17,810 gene sets from MSigDB36 and 896 gene sets of transcription factor binding sites from ENCODE/ChEA34,35) was assessed via GSEA. For each gene set, the AddModuleScore() function with default parameters from Seurat (v.4.3.0) was applied to each expression matrix normalized via Seurat's NormalizeData() function.

As scVelo5 relies on splicing kinetics, necessitating the processing of raw sequencing data, we limited our analyses to nine ground truth datasets from the test cohort that were generated by platforms with built-in support by velocyto and for which raw sequencing data are publicly available (Supplementary Tables 1 and 14). Raw FASTQ files for seven of these datasets, namely ‘BM-MNC (CITE-seq)', ‘Retinal neurons (10x)', ‘Pancreas (10x)', ‘Peripheral glia (Smart-seq2)', ‘Skeletal stem cell (C1)' and ‘HSCs and MPPs (inDrop)', were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) from NCBI, with study IDs SRP188993, SRP168426, SRP200419, SRP109011, SRP239468 and SRP094420, respectively. For ‘Peripheral glia (Smart-seq2)', we analyzed sample IDs prefixed with ‘E12.5'. Notably, raw FASTQ files were only available for 227 of 473 cells in the ‘Skeletal stem cell (C1)' dataset. For the remaining two datasets, ‘Mouse neurogenesis (10x)' and ‘Mouse mature neural cell types (10x)', data were obtained as BAM files from SRA study ID SRP476153.

FASTQ files were downloaded using sra-tools v.3.1.1 and processed with cutadapt v.4.9 for adaptor trimming of Smart-seq2/C1 reads. For preprocessing of inDrop samples, dropest v.0.8.6 was used (according to recommended workflow at https://velocyto.org/velocyto.py/tutorial/cli.html#run-dropest-run-on-dropseq-indrops-and-other-techniques). Reads were mapped and sorted BAM files were generated with STAR (v.2.7.11b) and Cell Ranger (v.8.0.1) using GRCm39 and GRCh38.p13 reference genomes for mouse and human datasets, respectively. Loom files containing spliced, unspliced and spanning reads were then generated from the BAM files along with corresponding Gene Transfer Format files using the velocyto.py v.0.17.17 Python command line tool.

Following quantification of spliced/unspliced counts, the scVelo v.0.3.1 Python velocity estimation workflow was run as described in the tutorial at https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. For all datasets, both a generalized dynamical model (as detailed at https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/DynamicalModeling.html) and a differential kinetics adjusted model with grouping by the CytoTRACE 2 standardized phenotypes (as detailed at https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/DifferentialKinetics.html) were employed. With the exception of random_state in scvelo.pp.neighbors(), which was set to 0 to ensure reproducible results, all other parameters were set to those in the respective vignettes, including min_shared_counts in scvelo.pp.filter_and_normalize(), which was set to 20 for dynamical models and 30 for differential kinetics models. Following velocity estimation, cell-internal latent time was inferred using scvelo.tl.latent_time(). The resulting outputs were then evaluated via absolute and relative order (see ‘Performance assessment' above) and CytoTRACE 2 outputs were assessed over the same cells for comparison (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 14).

For the analyses presented in Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 9a, we ran CytoTRACE 2 on each of the training and test datasets, then extracted positive potency score matrix \({{\bf{Q}}}^{{\rm{pos}}}\) from each of the 19 models per dataset. \({{\bf{Q}}}^{{\rm{pos}}}\) is derived from the final layer of each GSBN module; obtained similarly to the potency score matrix \({\bf{Q}}\) in ‘Integration of scores' above, but by multiplying \({{\bf{K}}}^{{\rm{norm}}}\) by only positive weights from the enrichment layer; and has a dimensionality of \(C\) input cells by 114 when combined across the 19 models and six potency category modules. We concatenated \({{\bf{Q}}}^{{\rm{pos}}}\) matrices from the 19 models across all 33 datasets (\(C\) = 124,231 cells; downsampled as described in ‘Benchmarking developmental potential inference methods and annotated gene sets' above) to produce \({{\bf{Q}}}_{{\rm{all}}}^{{\rm{pos}}}\), standardized across all cells in the training and test sets separately. We fitted principal-component analysis (PCA) from scikit-learn (v.1.1.1) to the training set component of the resulting matrix, retaining the first three PCs, then applied the resulting projection to the training and test set components individually. Next, we repeated this process fitting Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) from umap-learn (v.0.4.6) to the PCA projection of the training component, then applying the resulting UMAP projection to the PCA projection of the training and test components individually. To adjust for differences in cell density that confound visualization, we averaged CytoTRACE 2 potency scores within each window of 0.5 UMAP units squared across the two components of UMAP space. The same procedure was applied to visualize the ground truth potency of each cell (Fig. 2b, bottom).

For the analysis presented in Fig. 2c, we examined the expression of the top 500 potency-associated markers learned by CytoTRACE 2 (matrix \({\bf{F}}\) in ‘Interpretability') in training and test sets from the single-cell potency atlas. We first filtered and mapped gene symbols in every dataset to CytoTRACE 2 input features (n = 14,271), then CPM/TPM normalized as appropriate and log2-adjusted the data. Keeping training and test data separate, the expression matrices from each dataset were mean-aggregated into pseudo-bulk expression profiles by phenotype. We then further averaged shared phenotypes across datasets profiled by the same general platform (droplet/UMI or plate-seq/non-UMI) and finally, by species identifier (human or mouse). This resulted in a 14,271 × 237 matrix, with 14,271 genes (rows) and 237 phenotype, species and platform combinations across training and test sets (columns). Using this matrix, we calculated the mean expression of the top 500 positive/negative genes per potency category (matrix \({\bf{F}}\) in ‘Interpretability'; Supplementary Table 15), then unit variance normalized the resulting expression signatures across pseudo-bulk samples separately for training and test sets (Fig. 2c). See also Supplementary Table 16.

To assess the biological relevance of CytoTRACE 2 model features, we analyzed large-scale in vivo CRISPR screening data of mouse hematopoiesis38 (Fig. 2d). These data encompass ~7,000 genes along with CasTLE –log10 P values, representing the effect of knockout (KO) on HSC differentiation. Although these effects were separately measured for lymphoid (n = 6,783 genes) and myeloid (n = 6,732 genes) lineages, directed –log10 P values were well correlated between them (r = 0.78). Therefore, to create a single ordered list of KO effects, we combined directed –log10 P values for genes with effect score data in both lineages, keeping the most significant directed –log10 P value for each gene (positive or negative). Contributions from each lineage were nearly perfectly balanced, with higher positive scores and higher negative scores implying that KO of a gene promotes or inhibits HSC differentiation, respectively. We then intersected the resulting vector with those within the CytoTRACE 2 model space, resulting in n = 5,757 genes. We applied fgsea (v.1.25.1) to the rank-ordered list to jointly evaluate the enrichment of the top 100 positive and negative multipotency markers from the CytoTRACE 2 feature matrix (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 15). P values were computed using the adaptive multilevel Monte Carlo method and Q values represent false discovery rates calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.

To assess robustness across the number of top multipotency markers selected, we repeated the above process checking 50, 100, 200 and 500 markers (Extended Data Fig. 9c and Supplementary Table 15). We also compared the median –log10 Q value of gene set enrichment over the four gene set sizes against the same process repeated for CytoTRACE 2 markers for all other potency categories (Extended Data Fig. 9d and Supplementary Table 15).

To interpret potency-associated genes learned by CytoTRACE 2, we applied fgsea (v.1.25.1) to each rank-ordered gene list in \({\bf{F}}\) with minSize = 15 and otherwise default parameters. \({\bf{F}}\) is an \(N\times G\) matrix consisting of model importance scores for all \(N\) evaluable genes (14,271) in each of \(G=6\) potency categories learned on the training cohort (‘Interpretability' above; Supplementary Table 15). Mouse and human MSigDb signatures from MH/H: hallmark gene sets, M2/C2: curated gene sets, including CGP and CP:WIKIPATHWAYS, CP:REACTOME and CP:KEGG_MEDICUS; and M5/C5: ontology gene sets were downloaded from https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/. We ran fgsea on mouse and human gene sets separately, and human gene sets were limited to those with no counterpart in mouse gene sets. When running human gene sets, genes in \({\bf{F}}\) were first mapped to human orthologs by dictionary \({\mathbb{D}}\) (‘Dictionary of input genes'). Gene sets with an adjusted P value < 0.05 in at least one potency category are provided in Supplementary Table 17. We selected a subset of representative molecular signatures for display in Extended Data Fig. 9e, highlighting both canonical and poorly understood potency-related biology.

All WikiPathways gene sets from canonical pathways (CP) in M2/C2 with positive normalized enrichment scores in multipotency (see ‘Functional annotation analysis' above) are presented in Fig. 2f. Next, we assessed the gene set comprising the UFA factors Fads1, Fads2 and Scd2 (Fig. 2g) for specificity and conservation across tissues.

For this purpose, we analyzed pseudo-bulk-expression profiles of each phenotyp–dataset pair in our 33-dataset potency atlas using single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) from the GSVA package in R (v.1.46.0)58 to mitigate technical variation. Once ssGSEA scores were obtained for the UFA factors, we then averaged them into the same 237 phenotype, species, and platform combinations described in ‘Top potency-associated genes learned by CytoTRACE 2'. Keeping training and test cohorts separate, we further averaged ssGSEA scores by developmental system (here, denoted ‘tissue'), using the phenotype-to-clade mapping scheme provided in Supplementary Table 9. Mean-aggregated ssGSEA scores across 237 phenotype, species and platform combinations in training and test sets are displayed in Fig. 2h.

Statistical assessment of the specificity of UFA genes to multipotency was performed via permutation testing. First, we took the median value of the ssGSEA scores in each ground truth potency category. Next, we calculated the pairwise difference \({\Delta }_{i}\) between the median ssGSEA scores of multipotent and each other potency category i. We then calculated two test statistics: \(\min \left({\Delta }_{i}\right)\) and \(\mathrm{mean}\left({\Delta }_{i}\right)\). To simulate a null distribution, we permuted the phenotype-level ssGSEA scores, recomputed the median ssGSEA score for each ground truth potency category and calculated both statistics. We repeated this process 10,000 times. To determine an empirical P value, we tallied the proportion of times both statistics were as high (or higher) than the test statistics from the original data. We did this for the multipotent category separately across the training and test cohorts (Fig. 2h).

AUCs of UFA genes (main text) were calculated for training and test sets separately using the ssGSEA scores described above, but after averaging the scores by tissue type to address imbalances. AUCs were first calculated in a pairwise manner between multipotency and each other potency category, then averaged.

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and housed in the Stanford Animal Facility. For all analyses shown in Fig. 2i,j and Extended Data Fig. 10, 8–12-week-old mice were used, with equal numbers of males and females. Mice were maintained in-house under aseptic sterile conditions and supplied with autoclaved food and water. The animals were housed under a 12-h light–dark cycle at room temperatures between 20–26 °C, with humidity levels ranging from 30–70%.

For the analyses presented in Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b, mouse HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (cKit+Lin−Sca1+, termed ‘KLS'), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) (cKit+Lin−Sca1lo/−CD34med/hiCD16/32lo/−) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) (cKitloLin− Sca1loCD135+ CD127+) were isolated as described previously59 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In brief, hips, femurs, tibia and humeri were collected from C57BL/6 mice. Bones were cleaned, cut and flushed with a syringe filled with ice-cold FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer). Cells in FACS buffer were filtered through a 40-μm filter, pelleted and then incubated in ammonium–chloride–potassium (ACK) lysis buffer for 5 min on ice. Cells were then spun down and resuspended in 400 µl FACS buffer per mouse. Lineage depletion beads (Miltenyi Biotec 130-110-470) were added to the cells (50 µl per mouse) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the cells were loaded onto an LS magnetic separation column (Miltenyi Biotec 130-042-401), which was subsequently washed with 3 × 3 ml of FACS buffer. Before and after washing, pass-through cells were collected, spun down and resuspended in FACS buffer. For the isolation of KLS and CMP cells, the following antibodies were used: anti-mouse lineage cocktail-A700 (BioLegend 133313, 5 µl per mouse), anti-CD117 (cKit)-BV395 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 363-1171-80, 1:100 dilution), anti-Sca1-BV605 (BioLegend 108133, 1:100 dilution), anti-CD34-eFluor 450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 48-0341-80, 1:40 dilution) and anti-CD16/32-BV711 (BD Biosciences 740659, 1:100 dilution). Following the addition of the anti-CD34 antibody, cells were incubated on ice for 45 min before adding the remaining antibodies. The cells were then incubated with the remaining antibodies for an additional 20 min on ice, followed by washing and FACS analysis. For the isolation of CLP cells, the following antibodies were used: anti-mouse lineage cocktail-A700 (BioLegend 133313, 5 µl per mouse), anti-CD117 (cKit)-BV395 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 363-1171-80, 1:100 dilution), anti-Sca1-BV605 (BioLegend 108133, 1:100 dilution), anti-CD135-BV421 (BioLegend 135313, 1:100 dilution) and anti-CD127 (IL-7Rα)-BV711 (BioLegend 135035, 1:100 dilution). The cells were incubated with the antibodies for 20 min followed by washing and FACS analysis. Flow cytometry was performed with a 100 µM nozzle on a BD FACSAria II using FACSDiva software (v.9.7).

Blood samples were collected from the same mice for the isolation of CD8a+ T cells (CD3+ CD8a+) and B (CD19+) cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation was performed using a SepMate-15 tube (STEMCELL Technologies 85415) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enriched PBMCs were resuspended in FACS buffer and incubated with either T cell antibodies (anti-CD3-BV711, BioLegend 100241, 1:100; anti-CD8a-BV605, BioLegend 100743, 1:100 dilution) or B cell antibodies (anti-CD19-BV605, BioLegend 115539, 1:100 dilution) on ice for 20 min. The cells were then washed with FACS buffer and analyzed on a BD FACSAria II using FACSDiva software (v.9.7). Flow cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo (v.10.9.0).

For the analyses presented in Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 10b, 20,000 sorted cells from each bone marrow and blood population noted in ‘Flow cytometry' were lysed in RNA lysis buffer (RLT) and subjected to RNA extraction using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (QIAGEN, 74034). RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11752-050) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR was conducted on the QuantStudio 7 PRO Real-Time PCR System utilizing Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368706). Actb was used as an internal control. The following qPCR primers were used (5' → 3'). Actb: Forward GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC, Reverse ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC; Hoxb5: Forward CGATCCACAAATCAAGCCC, Reverse TGCCACTGCCATAATTTAGC; Fgd5: Forward CTGGTTTTACTCCTGGTGAC, Reverse AGCTGATACTTCCTGTCTGG; Procr: Forward GGACTCGGTATGAACTGCA, Reverse CAGTGATGTGTAAGAGCGAC; Cd34: Forward ACTATAAGCTTCCTCTCCTGG, Reverse ACACCCAATCCTCTCATCTC; Cd8a: Forward GAGAACATTCCTTAGCACCC, Reverse GCAGTTTTGACAGTCAGCG; Cd19: Forward AGGAAAAGGAAGCGAATGAC, Reverse GCCAGAGGTAGATGTAGGAAG; Fads1: Forward TGGTTTGGGAGGCATTTG, Reverse GCCATCCGTTTTGTCAAGAG; Fads2: Forward CAGGAGTGTAGAGGGAAGAG, Reverse CTCAGAATGACATAGCGTGG; Scd2: Forward ACTCTGCCTGGGATACATG, Reverse CCCACCCCAAAACACAAAA.

Intestinal tissues analyzed in Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 10c–e were collected from C57BL/6 mice, cleaned with cold PBS and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4 °C overnight. Then, 7-μm optimal cutting temperature compound frozen sections were prepared for the RNAscope HiPlex12 Reagents Kit v.2 assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 324409), which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following probes: Mm-Lgr5-T1 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 312171-T1), Mm-Mki67-T2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 416771-T2), Mm-Fads1-T3 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 801641-T3), Mm-Fads2-T4 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 568621-T4), Mm-Fgfbp1-T5 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 508831-T5) and Mm-Scd2-T7 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 486111-T7). Protease Plus (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 322331) was used for tissue pre-treatment. Following the last round of in situ hybridization imaging, fluorophores were cleaved using fresh 10% cleaving solution v.2. The intestinal tissues were then subjected to immunofluorescence staining. In brief, tissues were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The tissues were then incubated with anti-E-Cadherin-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (BD Biosciences 560061, 1:50 dilution) diluted in staining buffer (5% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing and imaging. All fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal microscope. To quantify colocalization, cells along the crypts–villi axis were first categorized into different cell zones, as described in the caption of Extended Data Fig. 10e. Mean fluorescence intensities were then determined using ImageJ (v.1.53t).

Relationships between two ordered variables were assessed by correlation tests or linear regression. Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance for Kendall correlations was determined by a two-sided z-test. Two-group comparisons were assessed using unpaired or paired tests, as appropriate. Results with P < 0.05 were considered significant. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Data analyses were performed using Python (v.3.9.0) and R (v.4.2.0+). Software packages and versions specific to each analysis are detailed in the Methods. For routine plotting and data manipulation, we also used the R packages ggplot2 (v.3.4.3), Matrix (v.1.6.1) and dplyr (v.1.1.3), as well as the Python packages pandas (v.2.2.3) and numpy (v.1.26.3).

a, Schematic overview of the CytoTRACE 2 core model, focusing on architectural details and key operations between the input layer and output layer for a single gene set binary network (GSBN) module. Note that six GSBN modules, one per broad potency category, are included in the full model, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. For additional details, see Methods. b, Serial impact of three postprocessing procedures (“Postprocessing” in Methods) on the accuracy of predicting (i) relative developmental orderings (n = 33 systems; bottom) and (ii) potency classes (F1 score, mean-aggregated across six broad potency categories; top) on training datasets (Methods). All results were obtained via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). c, Box plot showing the performance of CytoTRACE 2 for the prediction of relative orderings (Supplementary Table 4) after subsampling cells for the Markov diffusion step of the postprocessing procedure (Methods). All training datasets were analyzed using LOOCV (Supplementary Table 1). d, Illustration of the difference between absolute and relative developmental potential using two hypothetical scRNA-seq datasets, one spanning totipotent through pluripotent cells (‘Embryo') and the other encompassing multipotent through differentiated cells (‘Blood'). Hypothetical prediction scores are shown for absolute and relative orderings, with the latter reset for each dataset (for example, as for CytoTRACE 1, RNA velocity, Monocle, and CellRank). ESC, embryonic stem cell; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; CMP, common myeloid progenitor; CLP, common lymphoid progenitor; MkE, megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor; GM, granulocyte progenitor; B-p, B cell progenitor; T-p, T cell progenitor; Mk, megakaryocyte; E, erythrocyte; G, granulocyte; M, monocyte. e-f, Impact of hyperparameter values on training set performance, showing weighted accuracy for single-cell potency classification using nested LOOCV (Supplementary Table 6; Methods). e, Left: Each point (n = 500) denotes the results from one iteration of the hyperparameter sweep. Right: Same as the left but showing weighted accuracy plotted by the number of gene sets per GSBN module. f, Weighted accuracy of models trained using distinct gene set enrichment procedures (AMS and/or UCell) after selecting robust hyperparameter values as described in Methods. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided paired Wilcoxon test in panels b and c and a two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon test in panel f. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant. Note that tissue-specific expression matrices from plate- and droplet-based platforms within Tabula Muris43 were analyzed individually in panels b and c for clarity, yielding 33 total systems with known developmental orderings. In b, c, e, and f, the box center lines, bounds of the box, and whiskers denote medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) of the box limits, respectively. Panel a was created using BioRender.com.

a, Performance of CytoTRACE 2 for reconstructing relative developmental trajectories (left) and six broad potency categories (right) in 33 ground truth scRNA-seq datasets (Fig. 1b), stratified by species and platform. Performance was evaluated at the single-cell level using weighted Kendall correlation (τ), as described in Supplementary Table 5 and Methods. To promote a fair comparison, we evaluated absolute order correlations (right) with and without the inclusion of totipotent and pluripotent cells, as the corresponding potency categories were not available for human and droplet-only datasets in the test cohort. ns, not significant (two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon test). b, Same as panel a (left) but showing relative order performance stratified by developmental clade (Fig. 1b). ns, not significant (Kruskal-Wallis test). c, Same as Fig. 1d-e but showing performance on 21 cell phenotypes that were unseen during model training, including cranial neural crest cells, apical progenitors, skeletal stem cells, epsilon cells, and photoreceptor cells (Supplementary Table 7). d, Performance of CytoTRACE 2 on different training-test configurations, comparing the original split (‘Original test set'; Fig. 1b) with three additional splits, the latter of which were randomized to balance potency categories between cohorts (Supplementary Table 8; Methods). Performance was evaluated with four metrics, each calculated at the single-cell level in held-out data: absolute order (weighted τ), relative order (median weighted τ across evaluable systems with known developmental orderings), multiclass F1 for predicting broad potency classes (n = 6), and one minus the mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting broad potency classes (n = 6). For details, see Methods. e, Same as Fig. 1e but showing held-out data from three random training/test splits in d. In a-e, the box center lines (a-d) and circles (c right and e), bounds of the box, and whiskers denote medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) of the box limits, respectively.

a-c, Impact of perturbing potency labels in the training set. a, Heat maps depicting individual potency labels and their transition probabilities at different perturbation levels (Methods). b-c, Performance of CytoTRACE 2 models trained on potency labels with defined perturbation levels (as illustrated in a and described in Methods) applied to individual cells (b) or phenotypes (c) in the training set. Performance in held-out test data was evaluated with four metrics: absolute order (weighted τ of broad potency levels across datasets), relative order (median weighted τ of each dataset analyzed individually), multiclass F1 for predicting broad potency classes (n = 6), and the mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting broad potency classes (n = 6). For details, see Methods. Absolute order (τ), relative order (τ), and F1 score are expressed as a percentage of the results obtained with the unperturbed CytoTRACE 2 model. Each point represents the mean across five replicates of random perturbation. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. d, Analysis of robustness to the number of genes per cell using all test datasets (n = 14) (Supplementary Table 1) assessed with the same metrics as panels b and c. Results for each dataset represent the average across five rounds of gene count downsampling and are expressed relative to results with no downsampling. e, Same as panel d but shown for UMIs per cell in evaluable test datasets (n = 7). f, Impact of the number of cells per phenotype on the consistency of CytoTRACE 2 potency scores in test datasets. Eleven phenotypes spanning a range of potencies were titrated in defined amounts (x-axis) while other cells were left unchanged. CytoTRACE 2 was then applied to predict potency scores. Points represent averages from five random samplings (without replacement) per phenotype and error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

Same as Fig. 1g but focusing on mouse cranial neural crest cells profiled by Zalc et al.11. Left inset: Log expression levels of core pluripotency factor Pou5f1 in mouse cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs). Right inset: Cells predicted as pluripotent by CytoTRACE 2. Cells predicted as pluripotent by CytoTRACE 2 showed significantly higher Pou5f1 expression than others, with P = 2.6 × 10−5 by two-sided Wilcoxon test.

a, Overview of single-cell expression datasets analyzed in b-e and corresponding developmental time points profiled (n = 62). Icons denoting key stages of mouse embryogenesis were created using BioRender.com. b, Linearity between the average CytoTRACE 2 potency score per time point (weighted equally across author-annotated phenotypes) expressed in rank space (y-axis) and the corresponding time points (n = 62; x-axis). Concordance was calculated using linear regression (dashed line) and Kendall correlation (τ), with the latter weighted by the number of time points per embryonic day. c, Scatter plot comparing the performance of CytoTRACE 2 to previous approaches for reconstructing the temporal hierarchy of 45 time points spanning organogenesis (beginning at E8.061) to birth (y-axis) versus 17 time points preceding organogenesis (x-axis). Correlations are weighted by whole day intervals to account for imbalances in the number of evaluable time points per day. Point sizes represent the average weighted Kendall correlation per approach. d, Top: Data-driven lineage tree of mouse embryogenesis, where nodes represent cell types (n = 259), edges represent developmental transitions inferred by Qiu et al.2, and colors represent the corresponding rank distance from each cell type to the root (“Ground truth”). Center and bottom: Same as top, but with CytoTRACE 2 and CytoTRACE 1 predictions each averaged by phenotype, then rank-ordered along the path to the root. Lower ranks indicate shorter distances. Distances were averaged for cell types with multiple direct paths to the root. e, Scatter plots showing all distances in d, with concordance between CytoTRACE methods (center and bottom panels of d) and lineages inferred by Qiu et al.2 (top panel of d). The significance of τ in b and e was determined using a two-sided Z-test.

a, Box plots showing relative expression levels of cell state signatures from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)26 in 13,445 AML cells stratified by potency categories identified by CytoTRACE 2. Each point denotes a single gene from the corresponding gene set ID indicated above the plot (Supplementary Table 10). Genes were internally normalized within each tumor sample as the mean log2 fold change (FC) within a given potency category versus the remaining cells in the tumor, as described in Methods, then z-score normalized (standardized) across potency categories. The four signatures, LSPC-Primed, LSPC-Quiescent, GMP-like, and Mono-like, are expected to be most highly expressed in multipotent, multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent/differentiated cells, respectively (Supplementary Table 10). Statistical significance comparing the expected potency level(s) with each other potency level was determined by a two-sided Wilcoxon test. ****P < 0.0001. Box center lines, bounds of the box, and whiskers denote medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) of the box limits, respectively. b, Left: Scatter plot of oligodendroglioma cells from six tumors organized by previously described stemness and lineage enrichment scores27. Right: Stacked bar plot showing how the fractional representation of cells with predicted potency categories (CytoTRACE 2) changes as a function of author-supplied stemness scores (y-axis). Cells predicted to have the highest oligo- and multilineage potential by CytoTRACE 2 correspond to those annotated as stem-like by Tirosh et al.27. Potency colors reflect eight evenly spaced bins per potency category.

a, Box plots comparing the performance of CytoTRACE 2 against eight baseline methods (supervised machine learning models, including leading tools for reference-guided annotation of scRNA-seq data) implemented for single-cell potency classification (Methods). Each method was trained to assign cells to six broad potency categories using identical training-test splits. Four-fold cross-validation was performed for each method, where each point represents performance in one fold of held-out data (the original training-test split [Fig. 1b] and three random splits [Supplementary Table 8]). Performance was assessed at the single-cell level using multiclass F1 (left) and one minus the mean absolute error (MAE; right) for predicting broad potency classes (n = 6). Box center lines, bounds of the box, and whiskers denote medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) of the box limits, respectively. b, Scatter plot comparing median performance scores for all methods from panel a.

a-b, Representative test datasets comparing CytoTRACE 2 and scVelo. a, UMAP representation of mouse pancreas development (10x) (Supplementary Table 1). Left: Cells colored by ground truth granular potency level (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Table 3). Center: Cells colored by CytoTRACE 2 potency scores. Right: Cells colored by scVelo latent time (differential kinetics model). b, Same as a but showing human bone marrow (CITE-seq) (Supplementary Table 1). c, Left: Bar plot showing mean absolute order (weighted τ applied to single cells) performance across six broad potency levels (circles) and ten granular order potency levels (triangles) for nine test datasets evaluable by CytoTRACE 2 and scVelo (Supplementary Tables 3 and 14; Methods). Two models are shown for the latter: dynamical latent time and differential kinetics latent time. Right: Violin and box plots showing relative order performance (weighted τ applied to single cells) on the same test datasets (n = 8 evaluable datasets with relative developmental orderings, Supplementary Tables 4 and 14). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided paired t test. Violin plot bounds denote minimum and maximum values. Box center lines, bounds of the box, and whiskers denote medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) of the box limits, respectively. d, Same as Fig. 1e but shown for the nine evaluable test datasets in c. Left: CytoTRACE 2 potency scores. Right: scVelo latent time (differential kinetics model). Statistical significance was determined using a one-sided Z-test. ns, not significant.

a, Same as Fig. 2b but separated by cohort, species, cellular system (three general categories shown for clarity), and scRNA-seq platform. The embedding in Fig. 2b is shown as a reference in the upper left. Colors denote potency scores (same as the color bar in Fig. 2b, top) for reference and cohort-stratified embeddings. b, Heat map depicting pairwise similarity of gene sets learned by CytoTRACE 2 across all 19 ensemble models from leave-one-out cross-validation on the 19-dataset training cohort. Overlap was quantified by Jaccard index and stratified into gene sets with positive (left, n = 1,490) and negative weights (right, n = 1,246); gene set polarity was determined as described in “Interpretability,” Methods. c, Same as Fig. 2e but showing the consistency between CytoTRACE 2 multipotency markers and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) knockout (KO) phenotypes across a range of top \(k\) markers, whether positive or negatively associated with multipotency (\(k\) = 50, 100, 200, and 500). GSEA statistics are expressed as directed –log10 Q values. Statistical significance between groups was determined using a two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon test. Box center lines, bounds of the box, and whiskers denote medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) of the box limits, respectively. d, Same as c, but showing the median directed –log10 Q value across all top \(k\) markers shown in c, stratified by positive and negative markers, and extended to all potency categories in the CytoTRACE 2 feature importance matrix (Supplementary Table 15). e, Enrichments of selected gene sets from MSigDb in the CytoTRACE 2 feature importance matrix (Fig. 2a, right; Supplementary Table 15). Bubbles are colored by signed –log10 adjusted p-values (adjusted for multiple comparisons) calculated by GSEA, where the sign is determined by the direction of association between the genes and the potency category. All –log10 adjusted p-values, including those exceeding the color bar range, are provided in Supplementary Table 17. Bubble sizes are proportional to unsigned –log10 adjusted p-values within the color bar.

a, Representative gating schemes for FACS-purification of mouse hematopoietic subsets analyzed in Fig. 2i (HSCs/MPPs, CMPs, and CLPs from bone marrow and T/B cells from peripheral blood). KLS, Kit+ Lin− Sca1+ multipotent cell subset consisting of HSCs and MPPs (multipotent progenitors); KL, Kit+ Lin− Sca1− subset devoid of multipotent cells; CMP, common myeloid progenitor; CLP, common lymphoid progenitor. b, Bar plots showing biological replicates and controls for quantitative PCR experiments, related to Fig. 2i. Each gene is shown normalized to the maximum mean expression across all groups. Top: markers of HSC/MPP (Hoxb5, Fgd5, Procr), progenitors (Cd34), and differentiated lineages (Cd8a, Cd19). Bottom: unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis genes identified as markers of multipotency by CytoTRACE 2 (Fads1, Fads2, and Scd2). Actb was used as an internal control. Error bars reflect s.e.m. (standard error of the mean) across three biological replicates. c-d, Same as Fig. 2j but shown for mouse duodenum (c) and ileum (d). Scale bars, 50 µm (top) and 10 µm (bottom). e, Quantification of mRNA hybridization signal in multipotent and unipotent/differentiated zones of mouse jejunum (left, corresponding to images in Fig. 2j), duodenum (center, corresponding to confocal images in c), and ileum (right, corresponding to images in d). Multipotent zones are divided as previously described40 on the basis of cell location from the crypt base, with red and green regions expected to be most enriched in Lgr5 and Fgfbp1, respectively.

Computational prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence alone has been achieved with unprecedented accuracy, yet the prediction of protein-protein interactions remains a challenge. Here, we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for protein-protein interaction prediction. Existing models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. We propose PLM-interact, which goes beyond single proteins by jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in a widely adopted cross-species protein-protein interaction prediction benchmark: trained on human data and tested on mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast. In addition, we develop a fine-tuning method for PLM-interact to detect mutation effects on interactions. Finally, we report that the model outperforms existing approaches in predicting virus-host interaction at the protein level. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from their sequences alone.

Proteins are the main structural components of cells and mediate biological processes by interacting with other proteins1. Disruption of these protein-protein interactions (PPIs), e.g., mediated by mutations, can underlie human disease2. In virology, PPIs are particularly important as viruses depend entirely on the host cell for replication, achieved mainly through specific interactions with host proteins. In response to infection, our immune system counteracts pathogens via targeted PPIs. Understanding PPI mechanisms offers the potential for developing novel therapy strategies for both human disease and pathogen infections3. Unfortunately, experimentally identifying PPIs is both costly and time-consuming, such that interaction datasets remain sparse with only a few species having comprehensive coverage4,5.

Computational algorithms offer an efficient alternative to the prediction of PPIs at scale. Existing prediction approaches mainly leverage protein properties such as protein structures, sequence composition and evolutionary information6,7,8,9. Applying these features to pairs of proteins, classifiers have been trained using classical machine learning10 and deep learning approaches11. Recently, protein language models (PLMs) trained on large public protein sequence databases have been used for encoding sequence composition, evolutionary and structural features12,13,14, becoming the method of choice for representing proteins in state-of-the-art PPI predictors. A typical PPI prediction architecture uses a pre-trained PLM to represent each protein in a pair separately, then a classification head is trained for a binary task that discriminates interacting pairs from non-interacting pairs13,15 (Fig. 1a). Despite the use of PLMs in PPI prediction, identifying PPIs remains challenging.

a Typical PPI prediction models use pre-trained ‘frozen' protein language models to extract single-protein embeddings with a trainable interaction classifier. b PLM-interact uses a protein language model with a longer context to handle a pair of protein sequences directly. Both the mask language modelling task and a binary classification task predicting interaction status are used to train the model.

The main issue is PLMs are primarily trained using single protein sequences, i.e., while they learn to identify contact points within a single protein16, they are not ‘aware' of interaction partners. In a conventional PLM-based PPI predictor architecture, a classification head is used to extrapolate the signals of inter-protein interactions by grouping common patterns of intra-protein contacts in interacting and non-interacting pairs, respectively (Fig. 1a). However, this strategy relies on the classification head being generalisable. Unfortunately, with the use of ‘frozen' embeddings and a feedforward neural network being the dominant option, these classifiers have limited parameters to deal with complex interaction patterns.

To address the lack of inter-protein context in model pre-training, we propose PLM-interact, which directly models PPIs by extending and fine-tuning a pre-trained PLM, ESM-217. PLM-interact (trained on human PPI data) achieves a significant improvement compared to other predictors when applied to mouse, fly, worm, yeast and E. coli datasets, and can be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. We also demonstrate that a fine-tuned version of PLM-interact can predict mutation effects on interactions.

To directly model PPIs, two extensions to the widely used PLM ESM-217 are introduced (Fig. 1b): (1) longer permissible sequence lengths in paired masked-language training to accommodate amino acid residues from both proteins; (2) implementation of “next sentence” prediction18 to fine-tune all layers of ESM-2 where the model is trained with a binary label indicating whether the protein pair is interacting or not (see Methods for details). Our training task is, thus, a mixture of the next sentence prediction and mask language modelling tasks. This architecture enables amino acids in one protein sequence to be associated with specific amino acids from another protein sequence through the transformer's attention mechanism.

The training of PLM-interact begins with the pre-trained large language model ESM-2. We fine-tune it for PPIs by showing it pairs of known interacting and non-interacting proteins. In contrast to similar training strategies in machine learning18, we find that the next sentence prediction and mask language modelling objectives need to be balanced. We therefore conducted comprehensive benchmarking for different weighting options, before selecting a 1:10 ratio between classification loss and mask loss, combined with initialisation using the ESM-2 (with 650 M parameters), as this achieved the best performance (see Methods for details, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2).

To examine the performance of PLM-interact, we benchmark the model against six PPI prediction approaches: TUnA19, TT3D13, Topsy-Turvy20, D-SCRIPT15, PIPR6 and DeepPPI21. We use a multi-species dataset created by Sledzieski et al.15. Each model is trained on human protein interaction data and tested on five other species. The human training dataset in this multi-species dataset includes 421,792 protein pairs (38,344 positive interaction pairs and 383,448 negative pairs), human validation includes 52,725 protein pairs (4794 positive interaction pairs and 47,931 negative pairs) and the mouse, worm, fly and yeast test datasets each includes 55,000 pairs (5000 positives interaction pairs and 50,000 negative pairs), except for the E. coli test dataset, which includes 22,000 pairs (2000 positive interaction pairs and 20,000 negative pairs). The positive PPIs in these datasets are experimentally-derived physical interactions, while the negative pairs are randomly paired proteins not reported to interact.

PLM-interact achieves the highest AUPR (area under the precision-recall curve)22 followed by TUnA19 and TT3D13 (Fig. 2b). Testing on mouse, fly and worm test species datasets, PLM-interact demonstrates AUPR improvements of 2%, 8% and 6% compared to TUnA19, and 16%, 21% and 20% compared to TT3D13, respectively. The predictions for yeast and E. coli PPIs are more challenging because they are more evolutionarily divergent from the human proteins used for training than the other species (see Fig. 2b). Our model achieved an AUPR of 0.706 on yeast, a 10% improvement over TUnA's AUPR of 0.641, and a 7% improvement on E. coli with an AUPR of 0.722; it also shows a 28% improvement over TT3D's AUPR of 0.553 on yeast and a 19% improvement over TT3D's AUPR of 0.605 on E. coli.

A bar plot of AUPR values illustrates the PPI prediction benchmark. The distribution of predicted interaction probabilities of positive and negative protein pairs for each PPI model is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. All species icons in panel (b) are created in BioRender (Liu, D., 2025; https://BioRender.com/1ezsj7q). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Importantly, the improvement in PLM-interact is due to its ability to correctly identify positive PPIs: Comparing the predicted interaction probabilities, PLM-interact consistently assigned higher probabilities of interaction to true positive PPIs. In contrast, other methods give lower interaction probability estimates in all held-out species. The distribution of predicted interaction probabilities of positive and negative protein pairs for each model is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

Next, we showcase five positive PPI instances, one for each test species, for which our model produces a correct prediction, and both TUnA and TT3D produce incorrect predictions (Fig. 3). These PPIs are necessary for essential biology processes including inducing leukaemia cell differentiation23, dynein light chain roadblock24, RNA polymerisation25, import of protein precursors into mitochondrial26 and protein transportation27. We use Chai-128 and AlphaFold329 to predict and visualise these interacting protein structures – these visualisations are shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4, respectively. The self-assessment scores pTM and ipTM from Chai-1 and AlphaFold3 are reported in Supplementary Table 2.

Protein-protein structures are predicted by Chai-128 and visualised with ChimeraX45. The predicted interaction probabilities of PPI models range between 0 and 1. A predicted interaction probability > 0.5, is considered to be a positive PPI, while < 0.5 is a negative pair. Interacting proteins are shown from left (yellow) to right (green), respectively. Mouse: P97287 (Induced myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 homologue) and P63028 (Translationally-controlled tumour protein); Fly: Q9W0F0 (Dynein light chain roadblock) and Q7K035 (AT23443p); Worm: Q21955 (Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 15) and Q9N4F2 (Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 19); Yeast: P23644 (Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM40) and P53507 (Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM7); and E. coli: A0A454A7G5 (ABC transporter permease protein) and A0A454A7H5 (Possible ABC-transport protein, ATP-binding component). See Supplementary Fig. 4 for the corresponding AlphaFold329 predicted structures. The ipTMs of both Chai-1 and AlphaFold3 for each structure are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To investigate if the order of protein in each test pair has an impact on the prediction results, we also perform inference on the test protein pairs with the reversed order. We observe almost identical AUPR performance (Supplementary Fig. 5) and predicted interaction probability distributions (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To probe the role of sequence identity on PLM-interact's performance, we evaluate the model's performance with the different protein identities between training and test datasets (see “Methods” for details). As expected, we observe marked sequence similarity between human and mouse, similarities reduce significantly between fly, worm, yeast and E. coli with human. Notably, both PLM-interact and the second-best performer, TUnA, in the cross-species benchmark benefit from sequence similarity. Their performance improves as protein identity increases, with PLM-interact consistently outperforming TUnA (Supplementary Fig. 7).

To further evaluate our model's performance in relation to sequence similarity, we train PLM-interact on a leakage-free human ‘gold' standard training dataset created by Bernett et al.30 and compare with the state-of-the-art PPI approaches. In this benchmarking dataset, there are no overlaps and minimal sequence similarities among the training, validation and test datasets.

Due to computing limitations on the maximum sequence length of a pair, we only use 80% of the training set for training. The result on the test set is shown in Fig. 4, where PLM-interact exhibits identical AUPR (0.69) and AUROC (0.7) to TUnA. Interestingly, when adopting a neutral 0.5 threshold on predicted interaction probabilities for final classification, PLM-interact outperforms TUnA and other baselines in F1-score and recall. The improvement in recall is 9% over TUnA, while the precision is comparable with TUnA, indicating PLM-interact performs better at predicting positive interactions.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Here, we examine PLM-interact's ability to predict the mutation effect on interactions. We use mutation data from IntAct31, specifically, mutations that increase (IntAct ID: MI:038232) or decrease (IntAct ID: MI:011933) interaction rate or strength of binding (Fig. 5a). These collectively give us 6,979 total annotated mutation effects. Each annotated mutation effect sample consists of the wild type and mutant sequences of one protein and its interacting protein, which is always in its wild type, i.e., only a single protein is mutated in a PPI. The effect is treated as a binary label for increasing (+) or decreasing interaction (-). To make predictions on the mutation effect, we compute the log-predicted interaction probability ratio between the mutant and canonical (wild type) pairs. A positive log ratio indicates the increasing interaction class and negative otherwise (Fig. 5b). This strategy is similar to the log-likelihood ratio approach for variant effect prediction in single proteins34,35.

The log formula in this panel is the log-predicted interaction probability ratio between the mutant and canonical pairs. c Precision-Recall curves of two fine-tuned PLM-interact models and four zero-shot models (PLM-interact, TUnA, Topsy-Turvy and D-SCRIPT) on the test dataset. d The ROC curves of the fine-tuned PLM-interact models and four zero-shot models on the test dataset. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We develop a fine-tuning strategy for predicting mutation effect on interactions (see Fig. 5b and “Methods”). Our method leverages the log-predicted interaction probability ratio as input to a cross-entropy loss, allowing the gradient to be backpropagated to update all layers of PLM-interact. This training allows the model to calibrate changes in predicted interaction probability in mutant case in relation to the canonical scenario.

We construct training, validation and testing sets from the combined IntAct increasing and decreasing interaction set (see Datasets for details) and benchmarked two fine-tuned PLM-interact and four models without fine-tuning (i.e., zero-shot), including TUnA, Topsy-Turvy, D-SCRIPT, and a zero-shot PLM-interact (Fig. 5c, d). We find all zero-shot models to perform poorly, with close to random performance in AUPR and AUROC, despite the overlapping proteins existing between the human PPI training set and the mutation PPI test set. Remarkably, we observe marked improvement (150% in AUPR and 36% AUROC) when fine-tuning all layers of PLM-interact. To assess how traditional methods perform in the fine-tuning setting, we also train a version of PLM-interact where only the classification head is fine-tuned; the result is significantly worse than fine-tuning the full model.

We show an example of a successfully predicted mutation that increases interaction strength or rate in Fig. 6a, the DNA replication licensing factor MCM7, which is important for DNA replication in human cells. MCM7 is reported as a biomarker in human cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer36,37. MCM7 Y600 phosphorylation is associated with breast cancer, and the mutant Y600E of MCM7 enhances the interaction levels with MCM members38. PLM-interact predicts a positive log ratio of 0.165 between the mutant PPI and the canonical PPI, correctly suggesting an increase in interaction.

a shows an example of a mutation causing an increase in binding affinity, while (b) shows a mutation causing a decrease in binding affinity. These PPI structures are predicted using Chai-128 and visualised with ChimeraX45; here, the mutated amino acids are highlighted in purple. In each panel, the log-predicted interaction probability ratio between the mutant and canonical protein pairs is shown for fine-tuned PLM-interact and zero-shot TUnA and Topsy-Turvy, respectively. The positive log ratio indicates a mutation-increasing PPI, while the negative log ratio indicates a mutation-decreasing PPI. The ipTMs of both Chai-1 and AlphaFold3 for each structure are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Interacting protein structures are shown from left (yellow) to right (green). a Residue 600 Tyrosine (Y) of P33993 (DNA replication licensing factor MCM7) is mutated to Glutamic Acid (E), increasing its interaction with P33992 (DNA replication licensing factor MCM5). b Residue 151 Asparagine (N) of Q16595 (Frataxin, mitochondrial) is mutated to Alanine (A), decreasing interaction with Q9H1K1 (Iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU). See Supplementary Fig. 8 for the corresponding AlphaFold3 predicted structures. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Next, we show an example of the mutation that decreases interaction (Fig. 6b). The protein Frataxin encoded by FXN is important for the synthesis of iron–sulfur cluster, and a mutation of FXN has been discovered to be associated with a neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA)39. The wild-type FXN interacts with ISCU (Iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU). The N151A variant of FXN is reported to decrease the binding affinity with ISCU40. PLM-interact correctly predicts that the missense mutation N151A reduces the interaction probability (log ratio is − 0.649).

To study virus-host PPI prediction, we train PLM-interact on a virus-human PPIs dataset from Tsukiyama et al.11. The dataset is derived from the Host-Pathogen Interaction Database (HPIDB) 3.041, and comprises a total of 22,383 PPIs, which include 5882 human and 996 virus proteins. We compare our model with three recent virus-human PPI models: PLM-based approach STEP14 and the protein embeddings-based approaches LSTM-PHV11 and InterSPPI42. STEP is similar to existing PPI models benchmarked previously in our study; it leverages protein sequence embedding extracted by the pre-trained PLM ProtBERT43. The results show that PLM-interact outperforms the other models. For the STEP comparison, this corresponds to improvements in AUPR, F1 and MCC scores of 5.7%, 10.9% and 11.9%, respectively (Fig. 7a). The length of virus, human proteins and the combined length of virus-human PPIs are shown in Fig. 7b. To further analyse our model's performance, we select three pairs of virus-human PPIs from our test data, all with corresponding experimental virus-human complex structures available in the HVIDB44. We then use ChimeraX45 to visualise these structures and present PLM-interact's predicted interaction probability for each example (see Fig. 7c).

From left (green) to right (yellow), these interacting protein structures are: Tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14 (Human protein: Q92956) with Envelope glycoprotein D (human herpes simplex virus 1: P57083), Ephrin-B2 (human protein: P52799) with Glycoprotein G (Nipah virus protein: Q9IH62) and Retinoblastoma-associated protein (human protein: P06400) with Large T antigen (Simian virus 40: P03070). Note: The metrics results of the other three models in panel (a) are taken from STEP14 paper. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In this study, we have developed PLM-interact, a PPI predictor that extends single protein-focused PLMs to their interacting protein partner. We report significant improvements in held-out species comparisons and with further fine-tuning highlight successful examples of predicting mutational effects on protein interactions. We further demonstrate PLM-interact's performance in a virus-human PPI prediction task, showing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art prediction approaches.

Underlying the benefit of PLM-interact is the improved capability of correctly predicting positive PPIs in the held-out species. Notably, PLM-interact, based solely on a large language model approach, significantly outperform two baselines that incorporate multi-modal input, namely TT3D13 and Topsy-Turvy20. TT3D includes explicit structural information, the per-residual structural alphabet from Foldseek46. Topsy-Turvy incorporates network data. Inclusion of such additional features should further improve PLM-interact's performance.

Furthermore, our fine-tuning experiments show the potential of predicting mutation effects on PPIs from sequence alone. This could lead to interaction-aware in-silico variant effect predictors where methods rely on PLMs of the single proteins34,47,48. However, current training data remains limited. The number of high-quality structures of mutant proteins and their interaction partners are low. Algorithmically, models with long and multimodal context49,50,51 that include multiple proteins, structures and nucleotides could be specialised for interaction tasks.

Finally, effective sequence-based virus-host PPI predictors could provide the much-needed molecular detail to conventional virus-host species prediction tools, which tend to rely on genome composition signals, ignoring host molecules that are interacting physically with viral molecules52,53,54,55. In those approaches, the host species only acts as a label. Recent progress within SARS-CoV-2 PPI studies mapped out a complex interaction landscape between the virus and human proteome56,57. Other viruses are likely to have similarly complex interactions with human and animal hosts. Leveraging these interactions could lead to tools that are better at predicting zoonotic events and the potential for the emergence of novel viruses. While PLM-interact has demonstrated significant improvements, there is much to do in terms of generating reliable predictions, in particular, the need for high-quality virus-host experimental PPI data for training. What is clear is that attention-based large language models applied to longer-range sequence interactions are enhancing our understanding of both proteins and their interactions--the fundamental ‘language' of molecular biology.

Overview of all datasets used in this paper:

Cross-species dataset: The human training and five test datasets: mouse, fly, worm, yeast and E. coli from Sledzieski et al.15 are used for benchmarking between PLM-interact and the state-of-the-art PPI approaches (Fig. 2), and PPI model evaluation under the different protein sequence identity between training and test datasets (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Bernett dataset: The leakage-free human training, validation and test benchmarking dataset created by Bernett et al.30 is used to further benchmark PLM-interact and other PPI approaches (Fig. 4).

Mutation effect dataset: The mutation dataset collected from IntAct31 is used to fine-tune PLM-interact for predicting increasing or decreasing strengths of interactions associated with mutations (Figs. 5 and 6).

Virus-human PPI dataset: The virus-human benchmarking dataset from Tsukiyama et al.11 is used to compare PLM-interact and other virus-human PPI models (Fig. 7).

STRING V12 training dataset: The database STRING V1258 is used to construct a larger dataset for PLM-interact training.

The benchmarking human PPI dataset, from Sledzieski et al.15, comprises human training and validation data, and test data from five other species: mouse, Mus musculus; fly, Drosophila melanogaster; worm, Caenorhabditis elegans; yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and E. coli, Escherichia coli, all retrieved from STRING V1159. We train and validate our model on human PPIs and then conduct inference on PPIs from five other species. All training, validation and test datasets maintain a 1:10 ratio of positive to negative pairs, reflecting the fact that positive PPIs are significantly fewer than negative pairs in PPI networks. Negative pairs are generated by randomly pairing proteins not reported to interact. The length of protein sequences ranges from 50 to 800, and PPIs are clustered at 40% identity using CD-HIT60 to remove the redundant PPIs. The human training dataset includes 38,344 positive PPIs, whereas the validation set includes 4794 positive PPIs. Each of the five species includes 5000 positive interactions, except for E. coli, which only has 2000 positive interactions due to the fewer positive PPIs in the STRING dataset used15.

The human benchmarking dataset constructed by Bernett et al. explicitly to minimise data leakage, is also used to evaluate PPI models' performance30. The positive protein pairs are from the HIPPIE v2.361 human PPI dataset, and negative protein pairs are randomly selected, and the ratio between positive and negative pairs is 1:1. Their data-splitting strategy removes overlaps and minimises sequence similarity among the training, validation and test datasets. There are 163,192 training protein pairs, 59,260 validation protein pairs and 52,048 test protein pairs. CD-HIT60 was used to remove redundant protein pairs that share more than 40% protein sequence similarity with existing training protein pairs. Due to the storage limitation, we train on protein pairs that have the maximum combined paired length of 2193, which covers 80% of this benchmarking training data.

The mutation effect dataset is obtained from IntAct31. We collect mutations that increase (MI: 0382) or decrease (MI: 0119) interaction rate or strength. Each sample is a group of three proteins consisting of a canonical protein, a mutant protein and a participant protein. We remove PPIs that have the same canonical and participant proteins, i.e., self-interactions. The resulting dataset contains 1281 mutation-increasing PPI samples and 5698 mutation-decreasing PPI samples (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Due to GPU memory limitations on the length of protein pairs, we prioritise short protein pairs (< 2201 amino acids, ~ 80% of the data) to maximise the training size, while allowing the validation and test sets to have pairs with much longer combined lengths. In the end, we have 5103 training, 841 validation and 841 test samples.

The benchmarking dataset of 22,383 virus-human PPIs includes 5882 human and 996 virus proteins. This dataset was obtained from Tsukiyama et al.11, sourced from the HPIDB 3.0 database41; the ratio of positive to negative pairs is 1:10 and negative pairs are chosen based on sequence dissimilarities. The length of protein sequences ranges from 30 to 1000, and the redundant PPIs are filtered based on a threshold of 95% identity using CD-HIT60. The processed dataset was split into training and test datasets with a ratio of 8:2. Our training and test split is identical to the one in Tsukiyama et al.11.

In addition, we provide a model trained on human PPIs from STRING V1258. The positive PPIs are selected by collecting physical links with positive experimental scores, while excluding PPIs with positive homology scores and confidence scores below 400. Previous studies have typically limited the maximum length of protein sequences to 800 or 1000 due to GPU memory limitations. We process the training protein sequences with a combined length threshold for protein pairs of 2101. This human dataset includes 60,308 positive PPIs for training and 15,124 positive PPIs for testing. Furthermore, protein sequences are clustered at 40% identity using MMSeq262, and only PPIs from the distinct clusters are chosen to eliminate redundant PPIs. Again, the positive-to-negative protein pair ratio is 1:10, consistent with the aforementioned two benchmarking datasets.

We use ESM-2 as the base model in PLM-interact. ESM-2 is an encoder transformer model with a parameter size range from 8 million to 15 billion. The results presented are PLM-interact based on ESM-2 with 650 M parameters. We also provide PLM-interact model checkpoints trained with ESM-2 35 M on our Hugging Face repository to help with testing. The input representation contains amino acid token representations from two proteins. This setup is similar to the original BERT model63, also known as the cross-encoder, which simultaneously encodes a pair of query and answer sentences.

A standard input sequence of PLM-interact, \(x\), can be shown as the following:

where \({CLS}\) is the classification token, \({P}_{1}\) contains amino acid tokens of protein 1, \({P}_{2}\) contains amino acid tokens of protein 2, and \({EOS}\) is the end-of-sentence token. The initial EOS token marks the end of the amino acid sequence in protein 1. This setting allows us to use the original ESM-2 tokenizer to generate embedding vectors \(e\), and pass them to the transformer encoder of the ESM-2:

where \(f\) is ESM-2, \(e\) contains the token embeddings of \(x\), and \(h\) contains the output embeddings of all input tokens. \(h\) can be presented as:

where \({h}_{{a}_{1}}\) and \({h}_{{a}_{n}}\) represent amino acid tokens in proteins 1 and 2. Then, we use the \({CLS}\) token embedding to aggregate the representation of the entire sequence pair and as the features for a linear classification function \(\varphi\), and parameterised as a single feed-forward layer with a ReLU activation function. The output of the FF layer is converted by the sigmoid function \(\sigma\) to obtain the predicted interaction probability \(g\),

PLM-interact is trained with two tasks: (1) a mask language modelling (MLM) task predicting randomly masked amino acids and (2) a binary classification task predicting the interaction label of a pair of proteins. PLM-interact is trained for 10 epochs using a batch size of 128 on both benchmarking datasets of human PPIs and virus-human PPIs. For all training runs, the input protein pairs are trained using both orders as the interaction between protein 1 and protein 2 is the same as the protein 2 and protein 1, which leads to doubling of the training set size. The validation and testing sets are not subject to the same data argumentation. The learning rate is 2e-5, weight decay is 0.01, warm-up is 2000 steps, and the scheduler is WarmupLinear, which linearly increases the learning rate over the warm-up steps. These parameters are the same as the cross-encoder training in the Sentence-BERT paper18. During training, we evaluate the model's performance at every 2000 steps on the validation set. For every evaluation, a set of 128 protein pairs are randomly sampled from the validation set, and the results are averaged over 100 times to ensure metric reliability. Here, we use both masking and classification losses to optimise our model, the loss function for each data point \(l\) can be represented as:

where \({l}_{{\mbox{mlm}}}\) and \({l}_{{ce}}\) are separately represent the MLM loss and classification (i.e., cross entropy) loss. \(l\) can be written as:

where \(M\) is the number of the masked tokens, \({x}_{i}\) is the true token at position \(i\), \(p\left({x}_{i} \, | \, {x}_{-i}\right)\) is the probability of the true token \({x}_{i}\) given the unmasked amino acid \({x}_{-i}\). \(y\) is the label of the interaction, and \(g\) is the predicted probability for \(y=1\), obtained from Eq. 4. \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are weights for the MLM and classification losses, and they are determined in the following “Technical benchmark for hyperparameter selection” section.

All of the models are trained on the DiRAC Extreme Scaling GPU cluster Tursa. A typical 10-epoch training run of the model with ESM-2 (650 M) with human PPIs takes 31.1 h on 16 A100-80 GPUs. A typical 10-epoch training run of the model with ESM-2 (650 M) trained on virus-human PPIs takes 30.5 h on 8 A100-80 GPUs. The model with ESM-2 (650 M) trained on STRING V12 human PPIs used 16 A100-80 GPUs for 86.4 h. For model training time with different ratios and model sizes, see the following section, technical benchmark and Supplementary Table 1 for details.

We provide model checkpoints that include human PPI models trained on the benchmarking dataset constructed by Sledzieski et al.15 and retrieved from STRING V1159, a human PPI model trained on a benchmarking dataset created by Bernett et al.30 and sourced from HIPPIE v2.361, a virus-human PPI model trained on the benchmarking virus-human PPIs created by Tsukiyama et al.11 and sourced from HPIDB 3.041, as well as a human PPI model trained on human PPIs that we collected from STRING V1258.

To find the optimal value of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in Eq. (6), we benchmark a range of different options between mask loss and classification loss on human benchmarking data. For each ESM-2-35M and ESM-2-650M model, we train five models with different settings of ratios \(\alpha\): \(\beta\) between mask loss and classification loss. The ratios are \(\alpha\): \(\beta\) = 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 0:1 (with mask), and 0:1 (without mask, denoted as classification) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The difference between 0:1 (with mask) and 0:1 (without mask) is whether masking the training protein pairs before inputting the CLS token embedding to the classification layer. We used the human validation set for each model to identify the optimal epoch checkpoint achieving the best AUPR. Next, the final model is selected based on testing on five other host PPIs.

PLM-interact trained with ESM-2-650M performs better than models trained with ESM-2-35M (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). We find that a ratio of 1:10 is the optimal choice for ESM-2-650M. The AUPR of E. coli shows a 4.3% improvement over the second-best model, while other species remain comparable or better with this 1:10 ratio (Supplementary Fig. 1c). According to these results, we select a loss ratio of 1:10 for ESM-2-650M. The ratio setting is implemented in benchmarking of human PPI training and virus-human PPI training, as well as human PPI training using the STRING V12 database.

Typically, 15% tokens are masked out to train protein language models, such as ESM-1b47 and ESM-217. Given that PLM-interact deals with much longer sequence lengths than typical ESM-2, we test the model's performance under different masking percentages. We test a range of different masking percentages (7%, 15%, 22% and 30%) to train ESM-2-650M with a mask-to-classification loss ratio of 1:10.

We also included a binary model without masking as the base model. We compare this base model with masking models that are trained with different masking ratios to determine the benefit of masking percentages on performance. We use McNemar's test to evaluate if the masking model is significantly better than the binary model (p-value < 0.05). As this is an unbalanced binary classification task, we determine true and false predictions using the threshold that gives the best F1 score. Finally, we compare the AUPR performance of each model on five test species.

The results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. For each species, we show a line plot of AUPR performance with the different masking ratios: 0% (binary), 7%, 15%, 22% and 30%. A gold star is marked if the masking model is significantly better than the binary classification model (0% masking). The model with 15% masking ratios is the only masking model that consistently outperforms the binary model. Overall, we also observe insignificant differences among the masking percentages.

Let \({x}_{{mutant}}\), \({x}_{{canonical}}\), and \({o}_{{effect}}\) be the mutant, canonical interaction pair representation and binary effect label, respectively. The basic data unit in this task contains a triplet \(\{{x}_{{mutant}},{x}_{{canonical}},{o}_{{effect}}\}\).

Inference is performed based on computing the log-predicted interaction probability ratio between the mutant and canonical protein pairs:

Where \(g\) is the predicted interaction probability in Eq. 4. A positive log ratio indicates a positive class and negative otherwise. Both AUPR and AUROC are computed based on the log ratio itself.

We use a binary cross-entropy loss to fine-tune PLM-interact as follows:

Here, \(\sigma\) is the sigmoid function to obtain the predicted interaction probability of the binary mutation effect classification. We fine-tune two versions of PLM-interact models, one with all layers fine-tuned, the other with only the classification layer being updated. The latter is designed to mimic fine-tuning the traditional approach of a frozen pretrained protein encoder followed by a learnable classification head.

We use the checkpoint trained with the human dataset from Sledzieski et al.15 for two versions of PLM-interact fine-tuning. Both fine-tuned models are trained for 40 epochs, and the best epoch is obtained when the validation loss reaches its minimum (Supplementary Fig. 10). The effective batch size is 128, the learning rate is 2e-5, weight decay is 0.01, warm up is 2000 steps and the schedular is WarmupLinear, which linearly increases the learning rate over the warmup steps.

We compute the prediction interaction probabilities based on checkpoints of TUnA19, TT3D13, Topsy-Turvy20 and D-SCRIPT15 to generate precision-recall (PR) curves in Fig. 2b. Due to the absence of publicly available checkpoints for DeepPPI21 and PIPR6, these methods are excluded from the PR curve comparison. The AUPR value for TUnA is sourced from the TUnA paper, the AUPR values for DeepPPI and Topsy-Turvy are sourced from the Topsy-Turvy paper20, those for D-SCRIPT and PIPR are from the D-SCRIPT paper15, and the AUPR value of TT3D is obtained through email communication. For the benchmarking on the Bernett dataset30, we obtain the AUPR value of TUnA from the TUnA paper19 and other models' AUPR values are obtained from Bernett et al.30. A complete list of the main features, architectures, references and code links for each baseline method can be found in Supplementary Table 4. As for model comparison on the mutation effect prediction task, Topsy-Turvy and D-SCRIPT cannot handle protein pairs longer than 2000, resulting in 598 out of 841 test samples being used for prediction. Therefore, we show Precision-Recall and ROC curves under these 598 predictions in Fig. 5c, d.

We use the sequence search and clustering tool MMseq2 Release 13-4511162 to obtain the protein sequence-based alignment results between each pair of proteins; the parameters setting is: --threads 128 --min-seq-id 0.4 --alignment-mode 3 --cov-mode 1.

To evaluate each PPI model's performance with different levels of protein sequence similarities between training and test datasets, we use MMseq262 to obtain the protein sequence identity for each protein in the test pairs from five test species against all human training proteins, with identity values ranging from 0 to 100. The sequence identity between each test protein pair and training proteins is determined by the maximum identity of any protein in each test pair. In Supplementary Fig. 7, we report the AUPR values of PLM-interact and TUnA under different levels of identity “bins” [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100] between training and test proteins.

Chai-128 is a state-of-the-art model for molecular structure prediction, available at https://lab.chaidiscovery.com/. We use Chai-1 with the “specify restraints” option to predict protein-protein structure complexes and visualise predicted PPI structures using the molecular visualisation programme ChimeraX-1.7.145.

AlphaFold3 is a tool to predict the biomolecular interactions, including protein, DNA, small molecules, ions and modified residues29, available at https://alphafoldserver.com/. We use AlphaFold3 in its PPI mode to predict protein structure complexes. The results are visualised with the molecular visualisation programme ChimeraX-1.7.145.

The ipTMs and pTM scores for the Chai-128 and AlphaFold329 predicted structures are reported in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3. IPTM scores below 0.6 indicate failed predictions, while scores above 0.8 indicate high confidence predictions. pTM scores above 0.5 suggest that the predicted structures are similar to the ground truth. For more details about these self-assessment scores, refer to the AlphaFold329 paper and official description at https://alphafoldserver.com/faq#how-can-i-interpret-confidence-metrics-to-check-the-accuracy-of-structures.

McNemar's test64 is a statistical test that determines if there are significant differences between paired nominal data.

Here, b represents the count of correct predictions obtained by \({model}1\) and incorrect predictions by \({model}2\), while \(c\) represents the count of incorrect predictions obtained by \({model}1\) and correct predictions by \({model}2\).

To investigate if our models with masking perform significantly differently from a binary model without masking, we conducted a McNemar's test for any models under different masking percentages with the binary classification model (0% masking). This test is based on the number of correct and incorrect between two models. Predicted interaction probabilities from each model are used to get predicted labels, which are used to obtain the counts of correct and incorrect predictions. A McNemar's test p-value < 0.05 indicates a significant difference between the predictive performance of two models. The model with more correct predictions is considered superior to the other.

Psychologist Steven Pinker argues that people have an intuitive sense of what's known to be known, even when they don't say it explicitly.  Credit: Chona Kasinger/NYT/Redux/eyevine

When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows...: Common Knowledge and the Science of Harmony, Hypocrisy and Outrage Steven Pinker Allen Lane (2025)

How do we know when others know what we know? Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker's latest book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows, delves into how ‘common knowledge' can cement or explode social relations.

Common knowledge — awareness of mutual understanding — can explain the emergence of social-media shaming mobs, academic cancel culture and revolutions that seem to erupt from nowhere. It drives how people coordinate with others and can explain everything from awkward first-date conversations to financial bubbles and stock-market crashes.

Pinker tells Nature why it helps to better understand the ways we get into each other's heads — and what happens when we know that we have.

It is the state in which I know something, you know it, I know that you know it, you know that I know it, I know that you know that I know that you know it, and so on, ad infinitum. It differs from private knowledge, in which someone knows something without knowing whether anyone knows they know it.

Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health

Common knowledge is usually tacit, and it can be generated at a stroke when we witness something that is conspicuous, public or self-evident — I see something while seeing you see it, and vice versa. From there, we can deduce that each observer knows that the other knows it, and so on, to as many levels as we care to reel out — a process that cognitive psychologists call recursive mentalizing.

Common knowledge is necessary for coordination: two or more people making arbitrary choices that benefit them, as long as they make the same choice. A classic example is a rendezvous. It's not enough to know that your friend likes to go to Starbucks and so to head there, because he might know that you like to go to Pret A Manger and head there. It's not even enough to know that he knows that you know that he likes Starbucks, and head there, because he knows that you know that he knows that you like Pret, which is where he might go.

Nothing short of common knowledge will get you to the same place at the same time. The obvious means of achieving this is a phone call, because direct speech is an excellent common-knowledge generator. The next best thing is common salience. The friends might gravitate to a nearby landmark, such as Nelson's Column in London's Trafalgar Square, because each can anticipate that it would pop into the mind of the other.

Our conventions depend on common knowledge, starting with language. The word ‘rose' refers to a rose for no reason other than that everyone knows that everyone knows it does. Another convention is driving on the left rather than the right, or vice versa: there's no reason to choose one side or the other, but every reason to choose the same side as everyone else. This convention is backed up by law, but that doesn't matter: people have an incentive to follow the convention as long as they know that everyone else is following it.

How to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI

How to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI

Even legally binding conventions depend more on common knowledge than on enforcement, because no government has enough snitches and rooftop snipers to enforce every law. When ‘no smoking' signs were first put up, people didn't report violators to the smoking police, but they could stand their ground when asking a smoker to stop and expect them to give way, because the smoker expected the complainant to stand their ground.

This is also how we can have social and moral norms, such as not telling ethnic jokes, revealing certain body parts in public or insulting someone's looks. The norms can persist by the common expectation that everyone knows that everyone knows there are certain things decent people just don't do.

When there's a public signal that a belief might no longer be commonly held, the doubt can be self-fulfilling. In a bank run, a rumour that the bank might not have enough reserves to cover withdrawals can drive people to withdraw their savings out of fear that other people are withdrawing theirs out of the same fear. That can crash the bank, and, as the doubts reverberate, the economy.

When then-US president Franklin D. Roosevelt said in 1933, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself”, he was expressing a theorem of common knowledge. Other runaway phenomena, such as financial bubbles or hyperinflation — or even the hoarding of toilet paper during a pandemic — are also driven by common expectation.

I was led into the study of common knowledge by my interest in language. A lot of speech can't be interpreted at face value. For example, “If you could pass the salt, that would be brilliant” has a veiled imperative meaning: “Give me the salt.” I wanted to know why we don't all just say what we mean.

Common knowledge is what aligns us in social relationships. Our rituals of ignoring the elephant in the room, not blurting out everything we think, framing criticism tactfully, and other exercises of social skill consist of judgements of whether to make some fact common knowledge or whether to avoid doing so.

How to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics

How to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics

I advance a hypothesis — which has driven my research over the past 15 years — that social relationships (such as friendship, romance, authority and transactional partnerships) are coordination games, ratified by common knowledge signals such as eye contact, laughter, dominance displays and direct speech.

And I address the cognitive question of what goes on in people's heads when they have common knowledge, given that multiple nested propositions about beliefs are cognitively strenuous.

Mosquitoes Invade Iceland, Earth Darkens, and Bird Flu Returns

Bird flu surges and a government shutdown collide, complicating efforts to track cases and protect flocks.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. You're listening to our weekly science news roundup.

Let's kick things off with some climate news. Back in 2016 an article in the New York Times referred to Iceland as a “mosquito-free island paradise.” While nearby countries host mosquito populations during warmer times of the year, one of the going theories was that Iceland's propensity for harsh swings between thawing and freezing helped keep the bloodsuckers from getting a foothold. But that same Times piece warned that this skeeter-free status could be in peril. Temperatures were increasing in the Land of Fire and Ice, and a local biologist told the news outlet that mosquitoes could get cozy there if the country kept heating up.

Now mosquitoes have made themselves at home in Iceland for the first time. According to local news sources, an insect enthusiast got in touch with the Natural Science Institute of Iceland after finding three suspected mozzies out in the wild. An expert confirmed that the bugs were indeed mosquitoes, marking the first time these insects had been found taking up residency on the island. This development is a troubling reminder of rapid global warming's potential impacts on our planet, especially up in the Arctic: one 2022 study in Nature reported that this region had warmed almost four times faster than the rest of the planet between 1979 and 2021.

Speaking of climate change, a study published late last month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USAsuggests that Earth is getting darker—and that this shift could speed up global warming.

The measure of how much sunlight our planet reflects back into space is called albedo, and this reflectivity has been decreasing for decades. But according to the new study, the Northern Hemisphere is getting noticeably darker than its southern counterpart. This could be creating somewhat of a climate-change feedback loop. The Northern Hemisphere is experiencing more warming, and warmer air holds more water vapor, which tends to absorb solar radiation. Meanwhile, melting ice and snow in the north means less white surface is available to reflect sunlight back into space. As the Northern Hemisphere gradually reflects less sunlight, it is expected to absorb more heat, which scientists think could then decrease its albedo even more. You can read more about the potential implications of the darkening north on Scientific American's website.

Now let's move into some health stories. After a summer lull bird flu is back on the rise. The surge aligns with the annual southern migration of wild birds, which creates opportunities for domestic flocks to mingle with infected outsiders and their droppings. Since the beginning of September 2025 outbreaks have resulted in the deaths of nearly seven million farmed birds across the country, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That includes more than a million turkeys, the New York Times reported, and according to Axios, wholesale turkey prices are roughly 40 percent above last year's rates.

At the same time the Associated Press said last week that the ongoing government shutdown would force Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers to skip IDWeek, a “pivotal conference on infectious disease” in Atlanta, Georgia, where experts were expected to share findings on diseases like bird flu, HIV and more. The shutdown is also impacting communication between state health agencies and federal entities such as the CDC and USDA, making it more difficult to track and respond to bird flu cases. If you haven't already given it a listen, check out our recent miniseries on the history and future of bird flu. The first episode aired on June 23.

Meanwhile, also at the intersection of agriculture and health, a study published last Thursday in the journal mBio suggests that our conversations about food safety might need to include urinary tract infections. The researchers screened isolates of E. coli, which is often the cause of UTIs, from more than 5,700 California patients with the infection. The team then screened meat samples from retail sources located in the patients' neighborhoods in an attempt to determine which infections came from nonhuman animal sources. Ultimately, the researchers linked 18 percent of the UTI cases they examined to E. coli strains from animals, with chicken and turkey samples most likely to contain infection-causing bacteria. People in low-income communities were also 60 percent more likely to contract a foodborne UTI than people in wealthier neighborhoods.

While the new study is localized and can't prove a causal link between contaminated meat and human infections, it's never a bad idea to up your food-safety game. Remember to thoroughly cook all of your meat and poultry, wash your hands and kitchen surfaces during and after food prep, and avoid cross contamination by keeping your raw animal proteins from dripping juices onto other food items. Those precautions can help protect you from zoonotic viruses such as bird flu, too, in addition to, of course, lowering your risk of common foodborne-illness symptoms like vomiting.

In other California health news earlier this month the state's Department of Public Health announced three unrelated cases of clade I mpox in residents who had not recently traveled abroad. That suggests that clade I is spreading locally, which is a first for the U.S. The mpox virus has two distinct genetic lineages, clade I and clade II. Clade II has been circulating in the U.S. at low levels in recent years, but cases of clade I have always been tied to international travel. The news of suspected transmission in California is somewhat concerning because clade I has historically had a higher mortality rate than clade II. But some of the more recent data is mixed, and it's not clear whether the potential circulation of clade I in the U.S. would result in more severe cases.

Mpox is mostly spread through close contact, including sex, and these new cases align with past clade II surges that primarily hit communities of men who have sex with men, as well as transgender and nonbinary individuals and people with HIV. If you or any of your sexual partners fall into one of those categories and you're not vaccinated for mpox yet, now is a great time to go get your first shot.

In some more positive health news, a study published last week in Pediatrics found that peanuts lost their spot as the top allergen for kids under three in the U.S. following a shift in parental guidance around the legume. You can learn more about the changing science of peanut allergies and other food intolerances by listening to our August 22 episode or by reading SciAm's recent feature article on the subject.

We'll wrap things up on a high note with some cautiously optimistic news about the North Atlantic right whale. According to a report from the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium published last Tuesday, these critically endangered behemoths continue to show slow but steady population growth. Scientists estimate that the whale's population now totals 384, which is eight higher than last year. The number of North Atlantic right whales plummeted by roughly 25 percent between 2010 and 2020, according to the Associated Press. The population decline is reportedly thanks to threats such as boat collisions, fishing nets, and decreased food on their migration path as a result of global warming. While the whales still need our protection, experts are pleased to see them moving in the right direction.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. Tune in on Wednesday for a conversation about how the highly anticipated sale of TikTok's U.S. operations could impact its infamously powerful algorithm—and what a skew in “For You” page content could mean for the country.

Researchers from Heriot-Watt University have released striking images of an asteroid impact crater hidden deep beneath the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.

These images confirm that the 9 km (~5.6 mile) wide Nadir Crater, lying about 300 meters (~1000 feet) below the ocean floor, was created when an asteroid slammed into Earth roughly 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period.

The timing matches that of the Chicxulub impact in Mexico, the colossal 200 km (~125 mile) wide crater linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

Using the new data, scientists have pieced together what unfolded immediately after the Nadir impact: the crater initially formed as a deep bowl, molten rock surged upward from below, a vast zone of fractured rock spread outward for thousands of square kilometers, and an enormous tsunami more than 800 meters (~2600 feet) high swept across the Atlantic.

The research was published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

66 million-year-old underwater imprint 

Dr. Uisdean Nicholson of Heriot-Watt University first identified the Nadir Crater in 2022 while examining seismic reflection data from the Atlantic seabed off the coast of Guinea in West Africa.

The data revealed a circular depression measuring more than 8.5 km across, leading Dr. Nicholson to suspect it was the site of an ancient asteroid strike.

He then collaborated with experts in planetary science and geology from the UK and the USA to analyze the evidence. Early results suggested the crater was formed by an asteroid several hundred meters wide about 66 million years ago, but proof remained uncertain.

That confirmation has now arrived.

From a grainy ultrasound to a 3D image 

High-resolution, three-dimensional seismic data collected by the global geophysical company TGS and shared with Dr. Nicholson provides clear evidence that an asteroid created the Nadir Crater.

Dr. Nicholson said: "There are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail. It's exquisite.

"Craters on the surface are usually heavily eroded and we can only see what is exposed, whereas craters on other planetary bodies usually only show the surface expression.

"These data allow us to image this fully in three dimensions and peel back the layers of sedimentary rock to look at the crater at all levels.

"One way to understand it is to think about a pregnancy ultrasound. A few generations ago, the ultrasound would show a grainy blob. Now you can see the baby's features in 3D, in incredible detail -- including all the internal organs.

"We've gone from 2D, fuzzy imaging to amazing high-resolution imaging of the Nadir Crater."

Data reveals minute-by-minute chaos after collision 

Dr. Nicholson said: "The new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event.

"We originally thought the asteroid would have been around 400m wide. We now think it was 450-500m wide, because of the larger crater size as shown by the 3D data.

"We can tell it came from about 20-40 degrees to the northeast, because of spiralling thrust-generated ridges surrounding the crater's central peak -- those are only formed following a low-angle oblique impact.

"And we think it would have hit Earth at about 20 km per second, or 72,000 km per hour, although we still need to confirm this with a new set of impact models."

Using the data, the scientists created a timeline of what happened in the seconds and minutes after impact.

Dr. Nicholson said: "After the impact and the central uplift forming, the soft sediments surrounding the crater flowed inwards towards the evacuated crater floor, creating a visible 'brim'.

"The earthquake shaking caused by the impact appears to have liquefied the sediments below the seabed across the entire plateau, causing faults to form below the seabed.

"The impact was also associated with large landslides as the plateau margin collapsed below the ocean.

"As well as this, we see evidence for a train of tsunami waves going away from, then back towards the crater, with large resurge scars preserving evidence of this catastrophic event."

A natural laboratory for asteroid impact research 

Dr. Nicholson points out that humans have never witnessed an asteroid of this size crashing into Earth.

"The closest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event, when a 50-meter asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia."

"The new 3D seismic data across the whole Nadir Crater is an unprecedented opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses, develop new models of crater formation in the marine environment and understand the consequences of such an event.

"We've applied to IODP3, which is a new international drilling program, to drill into the seabed and recover cores from the crater. These will give us more information about the shock pressures experienced during impact, and the precise age and sequence of events that occurred after this event."

Unlike the moon, Earth's craters erode 

Collaborator Dr. Sean Gulick of the University of Texas at Austin, USA, a geophysicist and expert on impact processes, noted: "3D seismic images of a fully-preserved impact crater are a fantastic research opportunity that can allow us to consider how impact processes and craters scale with the size of the impactor both for understand the evolution of the Earth, and other worlds."

Collaborator Dr. Veronica Bray of the University of Arizona, an expert in impact cratering across the solar system, commented: "We see pristine impact craters on airless bodies like the Moon, but don't have subsurface structural information.

"On the Earth, that is reversed: we have structural data from seismics, field mapping and drill cores, but the craters are usually very eroded at the surface.

"The new 3D seismic imaging of Nadir gives us both. It's a startlingly good look at an impact crater!"

Could an asteroid this size hit Earth soon?

The rubble pile asteroid Bennu is around 400m in diameter. It is considered the most hazardous object in near-Earth orbit. According to NASA scientists, its total impact probability through the year 2300 is about 1 in 1,750 (or 0.057%). The researchers were also able to identify September 24, 2182, as the most significant single date in terms of a potential impact, with an impact probability of 1 in 2,700 (or about 0.037%)

Climate models have long predicted that global warming would weaken the Southern Ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2). Yet decades of measurements show little sign of this decline. Scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) have now uncovered a likely reason for the surprising stability. Their findings suggest that fresh, low-salinity water near the surface has helped trap carbon in the deep ocean, slowing its return to the atmosphere. But climate change is steadily altering these delicate ocean layers and could soon disrupt this natural carbon storage system. The study appears in Nature Climate Change.

Why the Southern Ocean Matters So Much

The world's oceans capture roughly one quarter of all human-produced CO2 emissions. The Southern Ocean alone accounts for about 40 percent of that total, making it one of the planet's most powerful natural defenses against global warming. This immense carbon sink functions through a complex circulation system: deep water rises to the surface, exchanges gases with the atmosphere, and then sinks again, carrying absorbed CO2 back into the depths.

The balance depends on how much natural CO2 from ancient deep waters resurfaces. When more carbon-rich water from below reaches the surface, it limits how much new, human-made CO2 the ocean can take in. This interplay is governed by the layering, or stratification, of different water masses and by the strength of ocean currents.

Ancient Waters and Strengthening Winds

The deep water that resurfaces in the Southern Ocean has been isolated for centuries or even millennia, accumulating large amounts of CO2. Climate models predict that stronger westerly winds, a result of human-driven climate change, will bring more of this carbon-rich water to the surface, reducing the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 in the long term.

However, despite these stronger winds, data collected over recent decades show that the Southern Ocean remains a strong carbon sink. The new AWI research helps explain why: ocean layering has changed in a way that keeps much of the deep carbon locked away.

The Invisible Barrier Holding Carbon Below

"Deep water in the Southern Ocean is normally found below 200 meters," says Dr. Léa Olivier, AWI oceanographer and lead author of the study. "It is salty, nutrient-rich and relatively warm compared to water nearer the surface."

This deep water contains large stores of dissolved CO2 that entered the ocean long ago. In contrast, near-surface water is cooler, less salty, and holds less CO2.

As long as this density layering remains strong, the CO2-rich deep water stays sealed off. But if the boundary between layers weakens, that trapped carbon could more easily reach the surface and escape into the atmosphere.

Stronger Winds, Rising Risks

"Previous studies suggested that global climate change would strengthen the westerly winds over the Southern Ocean, and with that, the overturning circulation too," says Léa Olivier. "However, that would transport more carbon-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface, which would consequently reduce the Southern Ocean's ability to store CO2."

Although such wind intensification has been observed and linked to human activity, measurements still show no major decline in the ocean's carbon uptake -- at least not yet.

Freshwater Inputs Strengthen Ocean Layers

Long-term monitoring by AWI and other research institutions shows that climate change is already altering the characteristics of both surface and deep waters. "In our study, we used a dataset comprising biogeochemical data from a large number of marine expeditions in the Southern Ocean between 1972 and 2021. We looked for long-term anomalies, as well as changes in both circulation patterns and the properties of water masses. In doing so, we only considered processes related to the exchange between the two water masses, namely circulation and mixing, and not biological processes, for example," explains Léa Olivier. "We were able to determine that, since the 1990s, the two water masses have become more distinct from one another." The Southern Ocean's surface water salinity has reduced as a result of increased input of freshwater caused by precipitation and melting glaciers and sea ice. This "freshening" reinforces the density stratification between the two water masses, which in turn keeps the CO2-rich deep water trapped in the lower layer and prevents it from breaking through the barrier between the two layers.

A Temporary Shield Against Climate Change

"Our study shows that this fresher surface water has temporarily offset the weakening of the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean, as model simulations predicted. However, this situation could reverse if the stratification were to weaken," summarizes Léa Olivier. Strengthening westerly winds are already pushing the deep water closer to the surface. Since the 1990s, the upper boundary of the deep water layer has risen by about 40 meters.

As CO2-rich water replaces more of the surface layer, the boundary between them becomes more vulnerable to mixing, likely caused by those same winds. Once mixing increases, stored CO2 could begin to leak upward and escape into the atmosphere.

Warning Signs Beneath the Waves

Recent research suggests that this process may already be starting. If more carbon from the deep ocean reaches the surface, the Southern Ocean's role as a global carbon sink could weaken, accelerating climate change.

"What surprised me most was that we actually found the answer to our question beneath the surface. "We need to look beyond just the ocean's surface, otherwise we run the risk of missing a key part of the story," says Léa Olivier.

"To confirm whether more CO2 has been released from the deep ocean in recent years, we need additional data, particularly from the winter months, when the water masses tend to mix," explains Prof. Alexander Haumann, co-author of the study. "In the coming years, the AWI is planning to carefully examine these exact processes as part of the international Antarctica InSync program, and gain a better understanding of the effects of climate change on the Southern Ocean and potential interactions."

How do volcanoes function beneath their rocky surfaces? What drives the rumbling vibrations, called tremor, that occur when molten rock or gases travel upward through underground channels? Professor Dr. Miriam Christina Reiss, a volcano seismologist at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), and her research group have traced these tremor signals beneath Tanzania's Oldoinyo Lengai volcano.

"We were not only able to detect tremor, but also to determine its exact position in three dimensions -- its location and depth below the surface," said Reiss. "What was particularly striking was the diversity of different tremor signals we detected."

The team's work offers fresh insight into how magma and gases move within the planet and could help scientists better understand volcanic behavior. Their research also carries practical importance, as it may one day make volcanic eruption forecasts more accurate. The findings were published in Communications Earth & Environment.

Tremor as a Window into Volcanic Activity

When magma ascends from deep within Earth, it can make the ground shake. Under high pressure, magma can crack surrounding rock, producing earthquakes. Other movements create weaker, continuous vibrations known as tremor. These occur when magma pushes through existing conduits, when gas bubbles escape, or when pressure fluctuates inside volcanic channels.

"For volcano seismology, it is extremely interesting to study these signals and wave types that arise when magma moves below the surface," explained Reiss. Her research centers on two key questions: Where exactly does tremor begin, and what causes it to form? The answers reveal important clues about a volcano's internal state and level of activity.

Reiss and her colleagues monitored Oldoinyo Lengai for 18 months using an array of seismometers positioned around the volcano to record ground vibrations. Once back in Mainz, they analyzed a nine-week segment of data in detail. "For the first time, we were able to determine the precise location where tremor occurs," said Reiss. "We discovered that two types of tremor seem to be linked: one originated at around five kilometers depth and the other near the base of the volcano -- with a time delay between them. It is clear that these signals are connected, thus we see a directly linked system here." The variety of tremor signals they observed was unexpectedly wide, suggesting that the vibrations come from different parts of the volcano with distinct physical conditions and processes at work.

Oldoinyo Lengai is unlike any other volcano on the planet. It is the world's only active carbonatite volcano, producing lava that is unusually fluid and relatively cool at about 550 degrees Celsius, compared to the 650 to 1,200 degrees typical of most magmas. "The results were particularly surprising because the magma is so fluid. We had expected few or no tremor as the interaction with the surrounding rock would likely be weaker," noted Reiss.

Advancing the Science of Volcano Seismology

The team's results mark an important step forward in understanding how magma moves within volcanoes. "Tremor occurs whenever magma is moving -- including before eruptions," Reiss explained. "But which tremor signals are true precursors of an eruption, and which are just background 'gurgling'? Our results lay the foundation for improving eruption forecasting in the future."

For nearly five years, a Chinese spacecraft has remained in geostationary orbit for unspecified reasons. Virtually nothing was known about the government payload, aside from it being a test of new technology. Toward the end of this top-secret mission, an Australian firm managed to image the mysterious spacecraft, revealing its hidden nature for the first time.

On Monday, High Earth Orbit Robotics (HEO) released a rare glimpse of the Xinjishu Yanzheng-7 (XJY-7) satellite, characterizing its large dish antenna and two fixed solar panels. Using a network of satellites in space, HEO was able to capture the Chinese spacecraft from different angles and create a 3D rendering of XJY-7. The images provide insight into China's rapidly evolving space technology, as well as highlighting the role of satellite-on-satellite imaging in revealing the hidden nature of spacecraft.

XJY-7 launched in December 2020 on board the inaugural flight of China's Long March 8 rocket. It was described as a new technology verification satellite developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CAST), but its exact purpose remained unknown.

The satellite reentered Earth's atmosphere on October 16 over Tenerife in the Canary Islands, according to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek, who identified the object based on its orbit. “A bright, slow, fragmenting fireball moved from south to north over the sky,” Langbroek wrote in a blog post. “Sonic booms were heard and registered by several seismic stations on Tenerife. The event clearly was a reentry of artificial space debris.”

Prior to its reentry, HEO used its network of imaging satellites to identify XJY-7 in orbit and sneak up on it for a close-up. “HEO analysed XJY-7 with high-frequency Non-Earth Imaging, building a 3D model from multiple angles and orbits,” the company wrote on X. “We verified it as a SAR satellite with a large dish antenna and two fixed solar panels that required full-body rotation to charge.”

A SAR (synthetic aperture radar) is an Earth-observation satellite that uses a pulse of energy to create high-resolution images of our planet regardless of weather conditions or daylight. SAR satellites are used for remote sensing and mapping of Earth's surfaces and can also be used to monitor large infrastructure projects or for defense and intelligence purposes.

A technology verification satellite spent 5 years in orbit and most relied on a single render to guess its capabilities.

China is known to keep its space technology under wraps, launching several satellites with undisclosed purposes. The country's aerospace sector has seen rapid growth over the last few years, kicking off 2025 with the successful launch of the Shijian-25 satellite to test in-orbit refueling technologies, which aim to extend the lifespan of spacecraft. Similar to XJY-7, little is known about China's Shijian series, including what the satellites look like or what their intended targets are.

At the same time, satellite-on-satellite imaging technology has shown significant progress with companies like HEO and Maxar, revealing hidden details about those sneaky spacecraft.

For the first time ever, OpenAI has released a rough estimate of how many ChatGPT users globally may show signs of having a severe mental health crisis in a typical week. The company said Monday that it worked with experts around the world to make updates to the chatbot so it can more reliably recognize indicators of mental distress and guide users toward real-world support.

In recent months, a growing number of people have ended up hospitalized, divorced, or dead after having long, intense conversations with ChatGPT. Some of their loved ones allege the chatbot fueled their delusions and paranoia. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have expressed alarm about the phenomenon, which is sometimes referred to as AI psychosis, but until now there's been no robust data available on how widespread it might be.

In a given week, OpenAI estimated that around 0.07 percent of active ChatGPT users show “possible signs of mental health emergencies related to psychosis or mania” and 0.15 percent “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.”

OpenAI also looked at the share of ChatGPT users who appear to be overly emotionally reliant on the chatbot “at the expense of real-world relationships, their well-being, or obligations.” It found that about 0.15 percent of active users exhibit behavior that indicates potential “heightened levels” of emotional attachment to ChatGPT weekly. The company cautions that these messages can be difficult to detect and measure given how relatively rare they are, and there could be some overlap between the three categories.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users. The company's estimates therefore suggest that every seven days, around 560,000 people may be exchanging messages with ChatGPT that indicate they are experiencing mania or psychosis. About 2.4 million more are possibly expressing suicidal ideations or prioritizing talking to ChatGPT over their loved ones, school, or work.

OpenAI says it worked with over 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in dozens of countries to help improve how ChatGPT responds in conversations involving serious mental health risks. If someone appears to be having delusional thoughts, the latest version of GPT-5 is designed to express empathy while avoiding affirming beliefs that don't have basis in reality.

In one hypothetical example cited by OpenAI, a user tells ChatGPT they are being targeted by planes flying over their house. ChatGPT thanks the user for sharing their feelings but notes that “no aircraft or outside force can steal or insert your thoughts.”

OpenAI says the medical experts reviewed more than 1,800 model responses involving potential psychosis, suicide, and emotional attachment and compared the answers from the latest version of GPT-5 to those produced by GPT-4o. While the clinicians did not always agree, overall, OpenAI says they found the newer model reduced undesired answers between 39 percent and 52 percent across all of the categories.

“Now, hopefully a lot more people who are struggling with these conditions or who are experiencing these very intense mental health emergencies might be able to be directed to professional help and be more likely to get this kind of help or get it earlier than they would have otherwise," Johannes Heidecke, OpenAI's safety systems lead, tells WIRED.

While OpenAI appears to have succeeded in making ChatGPT safer, the data it shared has significant limitations. The company designed its own benchmarks, and it's unclear how these metrics translate into real-world outcomes. Even if the model produced better answers in the doctor evaluations, there is no way to know whether users experiencing psychosis, suicidal thoughts, or unhealthy emotional attachment will actually seek help faster or change their behavior.

OpenAI hasn't disclosed precisely how it identifies when users may be in mental distress, but the company says that it has the ability to take into account the person's overall chat history. For example, if a user who has never discussed science with ChatGPT suddenly claims to have made a discovery worthy of a Nobel Prize, that could be a sign of possible delusional thinking.

There are also a number of factors that reported cases of AI psychosis appear to share. Many people who say ChatGPT reinforced their delusional thoughts describe spending hours at a time talking to the chatbot, often late at night. That posed a challenge for OpenAI because large language models generally have been shown to degrade in performance as conversations get longer. But the company says it has now made significant progress addressing the issue.

“We [now] see much less of this gradual decline in reliability as conversations go on longer," says Heidecke. He adds that there is still room for improvement.

Christopher Nolan's upcoming film, The Odyssey, is generating such buzz that major movie theaters are taking notice and getting ready. Earlier this year, Regal Cinemas announced plans to build or upgrade new IMAX theaters equipped to play the 2026 blockbuster, and today, Cinemark joined the party, announcing even further upgrades.

According to Variety, “Cinemark will build three new 70mm film projection systems and four new IMAX with Laser systems in the United States. Cinemark will also upgrade its remaining 12 IMAX screens to IMAX with Laser, a 4K laser projection system developed to deliver the clearest images and best audio through proprietary technology.” Those 70mm locations will be at Cinemark Seven Bridges in Woodridge, IL; Cinemark Carefree Circle in Colorado Springs, CO; and Cinemark Tinseltown in Rochester, NY.

As of today, there are only about 30 theaters in the world capable of showing films in 70mm IMAX, which is the format Nolan shot the entire film in and will be the preferred format for it to screen in. But, by the time its July 2026 release rolls around, the number is now likely to be closer to 40. Which doesn't seem like a huge deal overall, but for film fans in those extra cities, it sure is. Plus, there are also the theaters that won't have 70mm IMAX but are upgrading their IMAX projectors, increasing the picture quality extensively.

You'd think theaters would always be doing things like this. Making changes, updating technology, etc. But more often than not, it's not the case. That's why this news feels more significant than usual. Theaters are looking at an upcoming movie and saying, “We need to be better for this.” It's a move that's been a long time coming, especially since, in recent years, IMAX releases of major blockbusters have pretty regularly had higher attendance numbers than normal screenings. Fans know they can wait a few weeks or months to see Sinners at home, but they'll never ever be able to see it at home on a screen the size of a building. So, people pay a premium and turn out for that.

The other huge factor here is that The Odyssey is the first feature-length Hollywood film ever shot entirely in 70mm IMAX. It's a feat that was basically impossible in the past due to the size of the cameras. But, for Nolan, IMAX developed whole new cameras that are smaller and quieter and are now going to allow filmmakers to make even more of their films in the large-scale format. Up next? Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part Three.

IMAX sold out several key 70mm IMAX screenings of The Odyssey back in July in an unprecedented promotional stunt. Clearly, interest is there. And now, by the time the film comes out, there will be many, many more places to see the film in that format.

The Odyssey, which stars Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, and Robert Pattinson, opens July 17, 2026. A teaser has been playing exclusively in theaters for a few months, but expect to see one released online in December, around the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash.

A painful and serious gut problem is increasingly afflicting younger Americans, and no one's sure why. Recent research shows that cases of severe diverticulitis among people under the age of 50 have substantially risen over the past two decades.

Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and others examined data from millions of Americans hospitalized by diverticulitis. They found that the proportion of severe, or complicated, diverticulitis cases in younger Americans noticeably increased between 2005 and 2020. The reasons for this surge are unclear, the researchers say.

“Additional research is needed to determine the cause of these trends and identify public health policies aimed at potentially preventing the increasing burden of diverticulitis among younger populations,” they wrote in their paper, published in the journal Diseases of the Colon & Rectum.

The outer wall of our large intestine can develop a pocket- or pouch-like structure alongside it, formally known as a diverticulum (diverticula for plural). These pouches are harmless on their own, and most people will never be bothered by them. But the pouches can become inflamed and/or infected: a condition we call diverticulitis.

Most cases of diverticulitis are uncomplicated, meaning the inflammation is localized. Though painful, this form can usually be managed with rest, a change in diet, and occasionally antibiotics. Complicated cases are caused by more widespread inflammation, which can then lead to severe, potentially life-threatening issues like gastrointestinal bleeding, abscesses, and even a ruptured colon. It's these cases that often require hospitalization and sometimes radical interventions like the surgical removal of some or all of a person's colon (a colectomy).

Cases of diverticulitis, both mild and severe, are much more common in people over 50. But this latest research suggests that things are changing, and not for the better.

The researchers analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the country's largest publicly available database of hospital visits.

Between 2005 and 2020, they found, at least five million Americans were hospitalized for their diverticulitis. About 16% of these cases were early-onset, occurring in people under 50. Over time, the researchers found, more of these early-onset cases led to severe illness. During the study period, the percentage of severe diverticulitis among early-onset cases significantly increased, from 18.5% to 28.2%.

On the positive side, people with early-onset diverticulitis were less likely to die from their condition than older cases and had shorter hospital stays on average. The proportion of early-onset cases treated with colectomy also declined over time (from 35% to 20%), suggesting that doctors have gotten better at managing the condition with less intrusive measures. But younger people were also more likely to require surgery or other invasive treatments for their condition than older patients.

Gastrointestinal Cancers Are Surging Among Young Americans, and No One Is Quite Sure Why

At this point, the researchers say, there's no easy explanation for why these cases are becoming more common in younger Americans. It is possible that some of the same risk factors linked to increased early-onset cases of colorectal cancers, such as obesity, may also be driving an increase in diverticulitis. Other lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in fiber, are thought to lower people's risk of diverticulitis, and most Americans simply aren't getting enough fiber in general. Younger people also seem to be exercising less than earlier generations, and physical activity is another protective factor against diverticulitis.

Without more study, though, we can't know for sure just how much these and other factors could be playing a role in early-onset diverticulitis.

“Little is known about why we're seeing this increase in younger patients,” said lead author Shineui Kim, a researcher at UCLA Health, in a statement from the university. “We urgently need additional research to determine what's driving these trends, whether it's dietary factors, lifestyle changes, obesity rates or other environmental influences.”

Pioneer Square Labs has launched more than 40 tech startups and vetted 500-plus ideas since creating its studio a decade ago in Seattle.

Now it's testing whether its company-building expertise and data on successful startup formulas can be codified into software — with help from the latest AI models.

PSL just unveiled Lev, a new project that aims to be an “AI co-founder” for early stage entrepreneurs. 

Developed inside PSL and now rolling out publicly, Lev can evaluate ideas, score their potential, and help founders develop them into companies.

Lev grew out of an internal PSL tool that used PSL's proprietary rubric to score startup ideas. The studio decided to turn it into a product after outside founders who tested early versions wanted access for themselves.

Here's how it works: 

“We're mapping a lot of the PSL process into it,” said T.A. McCann, managing director at PSL.

Lev's structured workflow sets it apart from generic chatbots, said Shilpa Kannan, principal at PSL.

“The sequencing of these components as you go through the process is one of the biggest value-adds,” she said.

Lev joins a growing number of startups leveraging AI to act as an idea validation tool for early-stage founders, though its precise approach makes it stand out.

Upcoming features will add team-building and fundraising modules and let users trigger actions — such as sending emails or buying domains — directly from within the platform.

McCann envisions Lev eventually connecting to tools like Notion and HubSpot to serve as a “command center” for running a company — integrating tools, drafting investor updates, tracking competitors, and suggesting priorities. There are several competitors in this space offering different versions of “AI chief of staff” products.

On a broader level, Lev raises an existential question for PSL: what happens when a startup studio teaches an AI to do the things that make a startup studio valuable?

“In some ways, this is ‘Innovators Dilemma,' and you have to cannibalize yourself before someone else does it,” McCann said, referencing Clayton Christensen's concept of technology disruption.

PSL also sees Lev as a potential funnel for entrepreneurs it could work with in the future. And it's a way to expand the studio's reach beyond its focus on the Pacific Northwest. 

“It's scaling our knowledge in a way that we wouldn't be able to do otherwise,” McCann said.

Kannan and Kevin Leneway, principal at PSL, wrote a blog post describing how PSL designed the backbone of Lev and how the firm used it to generate its own high quality startup ideas at higher volumes with lower cost.

“As we see more and more individuals become founders with the support of AI, we are incredibly excited for the potential increase in velocity and successful outcomes from methodologies like ours that focus on upfront ideation and validation,” they wrote.

For now, PSL is targeting venture-scale founders — people in tech companies or accelerators with ambitions to build fast-growing startups. But McCann believes Lev could eventually empower solo operators running multiple micro-businesses.

Lev is currently free for one idea, $20 per month for up to five ideas, and $100 per month for 10 ideas and advanced features. It's available on a waitlist basis.

Lev also offers a couple fun tools to help boost its own marketing, including a founder “personality test” and an “idea matcher” that produces startup concepts based on your interests and experience.

One uphill battle of It: Welcome to Derry is that, at this point, the titular entity is a very familiar fear to audiences. Between King's classic novel and the movie adaptations that inspired the new series, we've seen Pennywise do some terrifying things—so given a fresh crop of characters, mostly with largely unknown fates, Welcome to Derry needed to prove really quickly that it still had a lot of bite.



Best way to do that? Kill a bunch of your fresh-faced child actors.

The opening of Welcome to Derry‘s premiere—a gruesome scene we've been thinking about since it was screened at San Diego Comic-Con over the summer—sees a young boy named Matty (Miles Ekhardt) try and get a lift out of the cursed titular town, only for his would-be rescuers to be revealed as one of the entity's manifestations, leaving the poor kid's fate sealed as he bears witness to the birth of a blood-covered demonic baby that promptly lunges at him.

But Matty isn't the only kid who ends up biting it over the course of the episode… most of the new kids set up as Welcome to Derry‘s next generation of protagonists end up being slaughtered in the episode's climactic moments. Lilly (Clara Stack), Ronnie (Amanda Christine), Phil (Jack Molloy Legault), Teddy (Mikkal Karim-Fidler), and Susie (Matilda Legault) form a kind of neo-Loser's Club over the course of the premiere, trying to figure out what happened to their classmate Matty, only for the demon baby to make a shock return during the climax of the episode, trapping the kids in a theater as all but Lily and Ronnie are gruesomely killed.

There was a version of the episode where all of the kids made it out of the movie theater incident in one piece. But speaking to Entertainment Weekly, the Muschietti siblings, Barbara and Andy, revealed that the gory twist was developed in secret with themselves and showrunners Brad Caleb Kane and Jason Fuchs after the original pilot script, with the kids surviving, had been sent to HBO executives. The twist was then revealed when the team went on to pitch the whole series, in a suitably dramatic fashion, which feels necessary when the pitch includes “hey, we want to kill so many kids on this show.”

“So the network didn't know that was going to happen in the context of the pitch,” Fuchs told EW. “We had a wall with headshots of child actors who would've played the kids in [episode] 101. Andy [Muschietti] theatrically stood up as I was pitching. I got to the part where all of them, other than Lilly and Ronnie, being eaten. Andy pulled the paper down, and there was a whole other group of kids [headshots] under there. I'll never forget seeing their faces and feeling like, ‘If we can replicate their reaction in the room with audiences at home, we'll have a really interesting, exciting, satisfying way to end episode 1.'”

“This is strategically a devastating event to set the audience into that sense of ‘nothing is safe in this world,'” Andy Muschietti added, “We kind of trick the audience into thinking that these are the new Losers. Well, guess what? I guess they're all dead.”

HBO was at least on board with letting it all happen (among other things, apparently), so now Lilly and Ronnie are going to have to find some new friends to confront the eventual murderous clown that's stalking their town. They made it out of episode 1—will they make it out of the season?

It: Welcome to Derry is now streaming on HBO Max.

I remember some email from them saying the Copilot was now on my plan, but I don't recall anything saying that this was actually a different, more expansive plan, or that Copilot was just a trial and the plan would switch until I took action, or anything like that.Here's how to get back to your old plan:• find the Services & Subscriptions page on your account and select Manage.• click "Cancel Subscription".• On the page that brings up there will be an option to switch to a different plan. That should have the "Personal Classic" plan. There's also "Family Classic" for people that want the family plan without Copilot.Another way that some have reported works is to simply turn off recurring billing. That then sometimes triggers an offer to switch plans that includes the Classic plans.

Behavior like what some of the tech giants do (and I don't crusade against "big tech" but individual cases are ridiculous) wouldn't be justified if you, like, wrote it down on a piece of paper and showed it to them, but they get away with it because you can just ignore all feedback, you don't have to actually answer support tickets from a distance of potentially hundreds of miles away (if you acted like that to my face, well, you wouldn't dare)Some are worse than others; some legitimately just do not care how much evil they're pumping out into the world (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1692122 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42651178)

I am an executive design leader and all hires from these three companies are screened in detail about their honesty level in their designs due to how many issues I have with these companies training their workers to lie.If you work for them know that it's a black mark on your record.I have hired two from these companies who literally opened the interview with “I want to leave X because they literally are lying”

Presumably the hyperscalers can begin conflating the number of “agents” created with “boring jobs eliminated” and thus herald the industrial revolution.But first: Your subscription price is increasing and now includes 5 Agents.

Are Microsoft just in to deep at this point? They killed one off their flagship brands (Office) in favour of Microsoft 365 Copilot, shouldn't someone be fired for that decision at this point?I'm looking forward to the books and articles in 10 - 20 years time, attempting to explain what happened internally at Microsoft these past years.

So, if you're a Microsoft 365 Business user, you now get "Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat" for free, which is just a standard web interface for interacting with Copilot (not to be confused with GitHub's Copilot, which is also owned by Microsoft, but I digress).But, if you pay for an upgrade from M365 Copilot Chat to M365 Copilot-without-the-chat, then you also get an AI button in Microsoft 365 apps (Outlook, Teams, Word...)!Realistically this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that ever owned or at least considered purchasing an Xbox, or even worse ever had to interact with Azure.

Even though it is still a relatively good deal for a Family Plan (compared to say Google Drive or Dropbox) for OneDrive, I finally dropped my Microsoft 365 Family plan.The final straw was that the Copilot was completely unhelpful and hallucinated features Office portal does not have.

The features don't matter as long as people put up the price for what they require. The job of the salesman/marketing team is to bet on a balance that will net the company money. The features are just the sales pitch that convince you you need the latest and greatest (comparable to a sports car salesman selling you the new v8 model instead of the more economical v6).

I got Microsoft's emails, did not want Microsoft's forced imposition of Copilot in my Office subscription (regardless of price), found the classic option mentioned in online forums, and managed to switch to it just before my renewal.My 89 year old aunt on the other hand got stung for the unwanted forced upgrade. I had to call Microsoft, complained about them unfairly exploiting vulnerable customers, and eventually got a downgrade and the difference refunded.What really annoys me about this - quite apart from the initial deception/misrepresentation - is I now expect Microsoft to pull similar tricks in future. A real disincentive to sign up to any other 'value-added' services.Why make subscriptions so full of traps that consumers end up hating you? (Yes, I know, so some GM can hit this quarter's bonus)That reminds me, having just cancelled Spotify (due to their price rise), Disney+ is next on the list. Maybe Netflix too.

Could unlock ultra-detailed, miniature displays for smart glasses and other wearables.

Researchers at the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany, have developed a new form of an organic LED that is many times smaller than existing options - measuring just 300 x 300 nanometers, according to SciTechDaily. If scaled up and built into a standard display, it would enable a 1080p screen that measured just 1mm across.

In the quest for lighter, more detailed, and brighter displays for augmented reality headsets and smart glasses, the most compact individual light-emitting diodes available as of 2025 are micro OLEDs. These measure just under five by five micrometers each, which is absolutely tiny compared to even the mini-LEDs that power many modern high-end TVs. But the new nanometer-scale OLEDs out of this German university and more than 10 times smaller.

“With the help of a metallic contact that allows current injection into an organic light-emitting diode while simultaneously amplifying and emitting the generated light, we have created a pixel for orange light on an area measuring just 300 by 300 nanometers. This pixel is just as bright as a conventional OLED pixel with normal dimensions of 5 by 5 micrometers,” says Bert Hecht, in the study published in Science Advances.

As this technology matures, it has the potential to develop ultra-compact displays for portable devices, saving on weight and power enormously, as well as new, highly-detailed displays (all the better for gaming with). At this scale, enormous pixel densities could be achieved, unlocking lifelike visuals - if you could get the processing power to render it.

The researchers achieved this new feat by modifying existing OLED structures. Simply miniatuizing OLED designs leads to issues with the gold antenna at the heart of each OLED gradually leaching its gold surface into the surrounding organic material, causing a short circuit.

To prevent this, researchers introduced a specially developed insulating layer around the optical antenna within each diode, focusing the currents and enabling long-lasting operation of the nano-scale OLED. Still, this "long" length of time only accounted for two weeks of testing, so building this proof-of-concept technology into something that is viable for real-world products and economies is a whole other ball game.

Researchers will now work on increasing the color gamut that the diodes can emit to the full RGB spectrum and improving their efficiency. As it stands, it's only at one percent, which would make these displays extremely power hungry to run.

Despite the growing chatter of an AI bubble, Sequoia Capital insists its investment approach is unswayed by the market frenzy.

“Markets go up and down, but our strategy remains consistent. We're always looking for outlier founders with ideas to build generational businesses,” said Bogomil Balkansky, a partner on Sequoia's early-stage investment team.

To prove this consistency, Sequoia announced two new funds on Monday that nearly match the sizes launched about three years ago: a $750 million early-stage fund targeting Series A startups and a $200 million seed fund.

These funds were introduced after what has been a tumultuous period for the legendary firm. In 2021, Sequoia overhauled its structure into an evergreen main fund supported by strategy-specific “sub-funds,” primarily to enable the firm to retain stock in portfolio companies long after their IPO. The firm took a significant financial hit in late 2022, losing over $200 million when its investment in cryptocurrency exchange FTX blew up, followed by the 2023 separation from its India and China divisions.

The storied firm, which famously backed Airbnb, Google, Nvidia, and Stripe in their infancy, is putting recent challenges behind it and returning to its core purpose: investing in promising founders at the earliest stages of creation.

Balkansky reinforced this mission: “Our ambition has always been and continues to be to identify these founders as early as possible; to roll up our sleeves and be a very active participant in their company-building journey.”

With AI startup valuations skyrocketing, Sequoia wants to use the new funds to invest in the most promising founders at the beginning of their startup-building journey. This strategy allows the firm to secure a low price while locking in a significant ownership stake.

This early-stage focus is even more crucial for the firm now. As valuations soar at an unprecedented pace, getting in early is the key to locking in a lower price and securing a substantial stake.

This approach is paying off: Sequoia's seed and Series A investments in Clay, Harvey, n8n, Sierra, and Temporal have appreciated manyfold amid the AI boom.

Even with its renowned Series A history, Balkansky made it clear that Sequoia aims to defend its legacy by investing even earlier: “We have an amazing track record and tradition to partner with companies at the very earliest stage, which today will be classified as a pre-seed.”

He highlighted the firm's early conviction: Sequoia recently wrote the first check into security tester Xbow, AI reliability engineer Traversal, and DeepSeek alternative Reflection AI — all companies that have since raised significant capital at much higher valuations. Among the ways the firm has helped behind the scenes, it says it recruited a former Databricks CRO to Xbow's board, connected Traversal with more than 30 potential customers, and arranged a meeting between Reflection AI and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, leading directly to a $500 million investment from the chipmaker.

Even with these recent successes, Sequoia is relentlessly focused on upholding its five-decade legacy as Silicon Valley's top investor. To ensure this mindset persists, the firm's newly renovated office features a wall where every investor handwrote this reminder: “We are only as good as our next investment.”

No price, but you can see it in action in November

A collaboration between two London-based companies, Generative Machine and Aibuild, has heralded a new type of 3D printer. The GenerationOne 5-axis is a generatively designed 3D printer, and will soon be available via a limited batch.

The cantilever design of the GenerationOne looks very much like a Bambu Labs A1 Mini, but with an organic twist in the form of tendrils that resemble fluidic arms that support the main body of the printer. We get around 140 x 180mm of build volume, but the printing platform is interchangeable, and leveling is all automatic. Precise and fast movement across the axis is made possible using linear rails, and the printer is made from off-the-shelf components. So what filaments does it print? This is more for the PLA and PETG makers out there. No exotic carbon fibre or specialist engineering filaments, yet.

Generative Machine CEO, Ric Real, talks about bringing advanced printing capabilities, usually found in robotics and Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM). What are these advanced capabilities? The main capability is printing in 5-axis. Instead of the traditional three-axis used in almost all FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printers, such as the Bambu Labs A1, Elegoo Centauri Carbon, etc. Printers using three axes have strength along the X and Y axes, but the Z axis, where layers of plastic are built up to create the object, relies on the strength of the layers. Strength that is much weaker than the other axis.

The 5-axis system can reorient the nozzle to print non-conformally. Why is this important? It means that prints can be re-oriented to print stronger and "allows for complex geometries to be printed without support structures and conformally, enabling improved surface finishes and part properties that can be tailored to specific use cases," according to the press release. With this, we should get improved interlayer strength through better adhesion. This translates into stronger prints.

Controlling all of this is industry-grade software, enhanced by Aibuild to slice and fully utilize all of the axes. The software provides parametric slicing strategies, automated toolpath generation, and of course multi-axis printing optimization tailored for 5-axis printing.

Details on price and availability are scarce, but a limited batch of the printers will be at the Formnext Expo and Convention from November 18 in Frankfurt, Germany.

A pre-built gaming PC that features the latest components to overpower any game laid before it. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you want to avoid the strain of hunting down all the individual hardware and software components for a massively powerful new gaming rig, then opting for a pre-built gaming PC is probably the best answer for you. When first released, these gaming desktops are usually overpriced to the max, with humongous markups in price. Now that graphics cards are returning to MSRP levels or below, and both the most popular CPUs and GPUs are in stock and available to purchase, the price of these prebuilt gaming PCs has had to drop to remain competitive.

At Newegg, you can get your hands on Gigabyte's Aorus Supreme 5 desktop gaming PC for $2,499.99. A hefty sum, but considering it's usually priced at $3,999.99, it's a very decent discount. The Gigabyte Nvidia RTX 5080 graphics card alone accounts for $1,199.99 of the price, with the most popular gaming CPU, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, taking up another $449.98. Therefore, for just those two powerful components, the cost is $1,649.87, leaving $850.12 for the remainder of the hardware build.

Inside the Gigabyte Aorus Supreme 5 is a swathe of top-notch components, many of which are Gigabyte-branded hardware. Inside the Gigabyte Design Lab case is the aforementioned RTX 5080 GPU with 16GB of VRAM, a 9800X3D processor, a Gigabyte Aorus X870E motherboard, 64GB of RAM, a 2TB Gigabyte Aorus Gen 5 14000 SSD, a 1000W Aorus power supply, and an Aorus AIO liquid CPU cooler with a 360mm radiator.

The Aorus Supreme 5 from Gigabyte uses Gigabyte's own components to build a powerful gaming rig capable of ripping high frame rates out of the very latest game titles. Inside the custom case is an RTX 5080 GPU, Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, 2TB Gen 5 SSD, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, 1000W PSU (ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 ready), and an Aorus X870E motherboard. 

The Nvidia RTX 5080 is the second most powerful Blackwell architecture GPU currently on the market. Beating out the rest of the competition on the majority of game titles, bar its big brothers, the RTX 5090 and RTX 4090. With meagre generational gains over the previous RTX 4080 and 4080 Super, the RTX 5080 launched without much praise, but was still snapped up because of the rarity of graphics cards in general and stock issues. The RTX 5080 can make the most out of Nvidia's latest software features like DLSS 4, and now that the early driver issues have been resolved, this card is the best you can get, unless you want to pay double for the RTX 5090 upgrade.

Developers hate (bad) marketing, but they still need a way to find useful tools and services. That's why you'll find a preponderance of developers on forums and sites like Hacker News, Reddit, and Stack Overflow discussing their dev kits and why some tools are better than others.

That buying intent is the signal that Israeli startup Onfire wants to help software vendors capture. The company monitors public forums to learn what tools devs are discussing, and then uses AI to identify which companies those commenters work with and who the decision makers there are. The platform also layers in data on budget cycles, and puts it all together to help B2B sales teams time and contextualize their outreach.

Onfire is now coming out of stealth with $20 million in funding, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. This includes a fresh $14 million Series A co-led by Israeli VC firms Grove Ventures and TLV Partners. IN Venture, the venture arm of Japan's Sumitomo Corporation, also participated, as did LeumiTech 77, a special fund marking Israel's 77th anniversary.

Like many other Israeli founders and VCs, Onfire's CEO Tal Peretz, CTO Shahar Shavit, and CPO Nitzan Hada are alumni of the Israel Defense Forces' Unit 8200, an intelligence unit akin to the NSA that both won awards and sparked controversy for its alleged mass surveillance of civilians using advanced AI and data tools.

After joining the private tech sector, the trio (pictured above, from left to right: Hada, Peretz, and Shavit) saw the opportunity to use their intelligence expertise in SaaS. The startup estimates it has driven “more than $50 million in closed deals” for its clients since its beta launch 12 months ago, and says its early users include ActiveFence, Aiven, Cyera, Port, and Spectro Cloud, as well as other companies selling data, cybersecurity, FinOps, and observability solutions to technical buyers.

Still, one can't ignore the elephant in the room: Given the founders' intelligence background, Onfire's trawling of public data to identify commenters' employers is sure to raise eyebrows. But Grove Ventures managing partner Lotan Levkowitz frames the startup's outcomes as a win-win. “Our customers are happy, and by the way, even their prospects are happy, because people pitch them with the right things at the right time,” he said.

The company hopes its vertical, data-centric focus will give it an edge over competitors. While other AI-enabled tools promise to boost enterprise sales, Peretz says one can't do personalized outreach without something to base it off. “What set us apart is we started as a data-first company, and then we added the AI engine on top of that,” he said.

According to Levkowitz, Onfire is filling a gap that the venture firm had identified before it met the founders: software infrastructure companies aren't leveraging AI in their go-to-market (GTM) strategy. “The missing piece there was the data,” he said.

Onfire comes at a time when companies are facing challenges leveraging only product-led growth for enterprise sales. Some in the industry think a new data layer is now necessary to support GTM teams, and Grove had already come to that conclusion when it connected with Onfire, Levkowitz said. He helped Onfire connect with companies his team had met while developing that thesis.

“Before we wrote a single line of code, we interviewed around 275 revenue leaders in the IT space,” Peretz told TechCrunch. The co-founders found that most companies were still deriving the majority of their revenue from direct sales efforts, but the adoption of AI tools was changing things.

They learned that buyers could benefit from using AI-based contextual tools to “do more with less.” But CISOs, CTOs, and engineering teams, traditionally considered “tough buyers,” now have to filter out more noise than ever thanks to AI tools that enable mass outreach, and context could help salespeople here.

Peretz stressed that Onfire's solution is also about mapping signals to the context of a customer — for example, you'd need a different approach to sell a data solution to a large organization compared to a cybersecurity solution. Levkowitz says this is particularly interesting, as it means that “with every customer Onfire has, the dataset is actually getting better and better.”

That compounding data layer is what Onfire considers its moat to defend against CRM incumbents like Salesforce and HubSpot. “This verticalized approach enables them to have a very unique value proposition for these go-to-market teams of software infrastructure companies,” Levkowitz said.

Peretz said the startup plans to use its new funding to make hires in AI, R&D and sales. Its core AI system is built in Israel, where 60% of the team is based, but the “go-to-market machine” is based in New York, as the startup expects the U.S. to be one of its main markets.

Microsoft's filings obscure the cost of OpenAI, but Wednesday's earnings may offer clarity.

Microsoft's AI ambitions are in large part tied to OpenAI, but the financial picture surrounding the connection is pretty murky. In its latest annual report, Microsoft disclosed a $4.7 billion line item under “other, net” expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, with no itemized breakdown. What it did admit is that the bulk of that figure reflects “net recognized losses on equity method investments,” according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal. And while it's long been understood that OpenAI falls into that category, the filing never mentions the company by name, nor does it classify OpenAI as a related party.

Under US GAAP, the equity method is applied when a company has “significant influence” over another, typically with a 20% to 50% stake. That level of influence generally requires clear disclosure of material related-party transactions, particularly if the investee is financially significant. In OpenAI's case, it is. A recent secondary share sale reportedly valued OpenAI at around $500 billion. Even if Microsoft's economic stake is diluted below 49% by profit caps or partnership mechanics, the fair market value of its position is still potentially north of $100 billion.

And yet, as of June 30, Microsoft reported less than $6 billion in total equity-method investments across its balance sheet — the same figure as last year. That suggests either OpenAI's losses have wiped out Microsoft's carrying amount, or that much of the $13.75 billion it committed hasn't been recognized as invested capital in accounting terms.

That's plausible under the equity method because once the carrying value hits zero, further losses are not recorded unless Microsoft commits more funding, at which point the base resets. However, as a result of this opacity, investors cannot tell whether Microsoft is quietly losing billions on OpenAI operations, front-loading infrastructure subsidies, or holding back capital for later phases.

For all its AI dominance in mindshare, Microsoft is spending aggressively to keep Copilot performant and useful across the likes of Azure and Office. Much of that cost is still offloaded to OpenAI's inference stack, particularly for GPT-4 and Codex-class deployments. If OpenAI's losses continue to rise and Microsoft refuses to break out how much it's underwriting the back end, the company's cloud AI economics will remain speculative. The waters are further muddied by its long-standing deal with OpenAI, containing a clause that would drastically alter the terms of the two's relationship should OpenAI achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

However, Microsoft is due to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on Wednesday, October 29. If OpenAI still isn't identified in its reporting as a related party, and the “other, net” line remains the only hint of how much it's bleeding to stay on top of the model race, investors will be forced to read between the lines yet again. For a $3.9 trillion company whose stock is now priced in part on AI execution, that's a risk Microsoft probably can't continue to take.

Fixing the Extreme mode on Linux.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Lenovo Legion devices have different power profiles for controlling the performance of laptops and handhelds. Unfortunately, if you install Linux on these machines, the power profiles don't work correctly and often misreport their stats, causing stability issues. This has largely been a problem for the handhelds since they have to run on battery, where controlling wattage is crucial for a pleasant experience. But now, as reported by Phoronix, it seems like there's finally a fix coming.

Derek Clark, an independent developer who's done a lot for Linux support on Legion devices, has just pushed a patch series that adds proper support for an "Extreme" mode. If approved, only devices that are explicitly verified would be able to run this profile, ensuring users don't encounter bugs on lower-end or thermally-constrained units. To understand this a bit better, let's dial back and add a bit of context.

On Linux, the performance modes are handled by the Lenovo WMI GameZone driver, which is what translates Lenovo's firmware controls to the OS. Only certain models are designed to run the Extreme power profile because it sets the PPT/SPL values as high as possible, which would stress the cooling systems and, more importantly, destroy your battery life. Oftentimes, the CPU would consume power beyond what the battery can safely provide, so it's really only meant for plugged-in use.

"This series adds a new "extreme" platform profile mode and uses it for the lenovo-wmi-gamezone driver. It also prevents bugs that are being reported by some users by switching the current deny list to an allow list... These users will still be able to set extreme mode using the Fn+Q keyboard chord, so no functionality is lost. Currently no models have been validated with extreme mode," messaged Derek in his patch admission thread.

 




Despite being such a sensitive setting, the BIOS on some Legion devices would incorrectly report that they support Extreme mode when they very much don't. Since these devices are meant to run Windows by default, Lenovo's own utilities and software can communicate with the OS to avoid any mishaps — a luxury not afforded by Linux, where it would often be tricked into thinking the other way.

This would result in a conflict where turning on Extreme mode actually meant that you were just running the Performance mode and, in turn, using the so-called Performance mode would resort to the Balanced Mode, which led many to (falsely) dismiss it altogether. This is what Derek's proposed patch addresses; it fixes the profiles, adding support for a proper Extreme mode but keeps it disabled by default.

That's because no device is currently validated to run Extreme mode on Linux, likely due to insufficient testing and prior user complaints. Previously, the firmware would rely on a "deny list" that would ensure models not rated for the Extreme power profile wouldn't get an option for it, which is what was causing so many misreports. Derek switched this to an "allow list" instead, so only machines that are verified can run it.

Accordingly, all Lenovo Legion devices on Linux should soon be able to enjoy correct power profiles, and perhaps by the time the patch is approved, there will be some models on the Extreme mode allow list as well. Linux is becoming a great place to game, especially for lower-end devices and handhelds that benefit from efficiency, as seen in our recent coverage of the ROG Xbox Ally X running Bazzite.

Beating the M4 by over 3x in read tests.

When Apple unveiled the 2025 MacBook Pro last week with the new M5 chip, one of the main upgrades it listed was 2x SSD speeds, a claim that rings true in our review of the device. However, a directed comparison between the outgoing M4-equipped MacBook Bro and the new M5 one was still on the cards, and now, we've gotten just that. YouTuber Max Tech put both laptops head-to-head to see whether Apple's claims were true, and it turns out, the company may have actually undersold the new machine's SSD speeds.

In the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, the SSD in the M5 MacBook Pro achieved read speeds of up to 6,323 MB/s, compared to just 2,031 MB/s on the M4 MacBook Pro. It's not like the M4 is "slow" in a vacuum, but the M5 SSD is over three times faster, which is a great generation uplift. Moving to the write speeds, the trend continues but less aggressively, with the M5's SSD reaching a similar 6,068 MB/s while the M4's SSD could only manage 3,293 MB/s, constituting an 84.31% difference. If you average out both results, the SSD in the M5 MacBook Pro is actually ~2.5x faster overall.

These speed improvements could be a result of a better controller allowing the flash to run faster, since PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSDs on PCs can achieve similar numbers. Apple routes 4x PCIe lanes to the SSD on its base chips, but doubles that to 8x on the Pro/Max/Ultra variants of the same silicon. Nonetheless, 6K+ MB/s across both read and write means smoother video editing for professionals that can benefit them in edge-case scenarios, not that it felt particularly slow before. You can also expect better random read/write speeds that should make the OS feel snappier in general.

Max Tech opened up both devices before performing the test to show the internal layout, which was identical. They share the same cooling systems with a single fan and a single heatpipe, along with two NAND modules (256 GB each) to ensure optimal performance. The base variant of the M2 Pro MacBook Pro from 2023 was stained with controversy because of this, when Apple decided to use a single 512 GB NAND chip, which crippled storage speeds drastically, so it's nice to see such a massive turnaround a couple of years later.

The sensitive personal details of more than 450 people holding “top secret” US government security clearances were left exposed online, new research seen by WIRED shows. The people's details were included in a database of more than 7,000 individuals who have applied for jobs over the last two years with Democrats in the United States House of Representatives.

While scanning for unsecured databases at the end of September, an ethical security researcher stumbled upon the exposed cache of data and discovered that it was part of a site called DomeWatch. The service is run by the House Democrats and includes videostreams of House floor sessions, calendars of congressional events, and updates on House votes. It also includes a job board and résumé bank.

After the researcher attempted to notify the House of Representatives' Office of the Chief Administrator on September 30, the database was secured within hours, and the researcher received a response that simply said, “Thanks for flagging.” It is unclear how long the data was exposed or if anyone else accessed the information while it was unsecured.

The independent researcher, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the findings, likened the exposed database to an internal “index” of people who may have applied for open roles. Résumés were not included, they say, but the database contained details typical of a job application process. The researcher found data including applicants' short written biographies and fields indicating military service, security clearances, and languages spoken, along with details like names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Each individual was also assigned an internal ID.

“Some people described in the data have spent 20 years on Capitol Hill,” the researcher tells WIRED, noting that the information went beyond a list of interns or junior staffers. This is what made the finding so concerning, the researcher says, because they fear that if the data had fallen into the wrong hands—perhaps those of a hostile state or malicious hackers—it could have been used to compromise government or military staffers who have access to potentially sensitive information. “From the perspective of a foreign adversary, that is a gold mine of who you want to target,” the security researcher says.

WIRED reached out to the Office of the Chief Administrator and House Democrats for comment. Some staff members WIRED contacted were unavailable because they have been furloughed as a result of the ongoing US government shutdown.

“Today, our office was informed that an outside vendor potentially exposed information stored in an internal site,” Joy Lee, spokesperson for House Democratic whip Katherine Clark, told WIRED in a statement on October 22. DomeWatch is under the purview of Clark's office. “We immediately alerted the Office of the Chief Administration Officer, and a full investigation has been launched to identify and rectify any security vulnerabilities.” Lee added that the outside vendor is “an independent consultant who helps with the backend” of DomeWatch.

There are many unsecured and publicly accessible databases across the internet, and the researcher says that they might not have paused to investigate the DomeWatch data had they not noticed key words involving top-secret security clearances. This underscores the concern, the researcher says, that while the database is small, it contains information that would be potentially valuable in nation-state espionage. One entry, for example, listed a person who had “intelligence” and “US-China relations” experience.

“Exposed databases are a widespread, non-partisan cybersecurity problem. Left unchecked, they enable targeted espionage, fraud, and identity abuse,” says Alexander Leslie, senior advisor for government affairs at the threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, who was not involved in the research. “If accurate, this dataset would be extremely sensitive. Military histories and clearance status give adversaries precise reconnaissance and pretexting opportunities, and foreign espionage actors could further use this data for spear-phishing, impersonation, and targeted social-engineering to gain access or compromise accounts.”

According to the researcher, the data also included information about people's political affiliations. Among the estimated 7,000 entries, there were around 4,200 people who appeared to have experience working in Congress. In total 6,300 people were marked as having Democratic Party affiliation, while 17 were listed as having Republican Party affiliation, and another 250-plus were listed as independent or other. The researcher says there were also some links to files or documents housed in other cloud storage systems.

Recorded Future's Leslie also points out that known breaches of data related to US government employment—most notably the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack—create what he calls “long-term US national security and personnel risks.”

“This research was not targeted toward any political party or affiliation,” the researcher who found the unsecured database says. “It was just finding data, realizing that it could be vulnerable, and thinking of all the ways that not just criminals could use it, but foreign adversaries. It shouldn't be exposed.”

One day last fall, Kristine Barrios' 9-year-old daughter got stuck on a lesson in IXL, the personalized learning software that served as her math teacher. She had to multiply three three-digit numbers without using a calculator. Then she had to do it again, her mom says, more than 20 times, without making mistakes.

At Alpha School, the private microschool the girl and her younger brother attended in Brownsville, Texas, she had been working a grade level ahead of her age in math, Barrios says. She could do three-digit multiplication correctly most of the time. But whenever she made an error in IXL, the software would determine she needed more practice and assign her more questions. She told her mom that she had asked her “guide,” the adult who supervised her classroom in lieu of a teacher, to make an exception and let her move on. She said the guide's reply was that she needed to get it done, that it was expected of her.

The adult guides in Alpha's classrooms “don't do any teaching,” says the current head of the Brownsville school.



Who is Ed Zitron? What is Ed Zitron? How is Ed Zitron? Tommy Craggs profiles the man, the myth, the hater.

Over the next weekend, Barrios says, she and her husband sat with their daughter for hours each day until she finished the multiplication lesson, even as she broke down and sobbed that she'd rather die than keep going. Ultimately, Barrios says she double-checked all the answers on a calculator before the 9-year-old entered them. But when the girl returned to school with the lesson completed, her mom says, she came back reporting crushing news: In the time she had spent stuck, she had fallen even farther behind her targeted goals.

Within a couple weeks, Barrios says, the school reported to her and her husband that their daughter wasn't eating lunches. According to Barrios, Alpha said it was “because she would rather stay in and work.” The girl later explained to her parents that she was spending lunchtimes catching up on IXL. (In a statement to WIRED, IXL representatives wrote that Alpha School's account was deactivated this past July and claims that it is “no longer an IXL customer due to violating our terms of service,” adding that IXL “is not intended—and we do not recommend its use—as a replacement” for “trained, caring teachers.”)

When Barrios' husband brought their daughter to a previously scheduled checkup soon after, her doctor noted with concern that she had lost a significant amount of weight in a short time. Her dad then brought her to school with a note from the pediatrician, Barrios says, instructing her to eat snacks in between regular meals and saw her walk into school with it in her hand. She told her parents she delivered it to staff. Even though Alpha had asked parents in its handbook to “refrain” from sending in “midday snacks,” Barrios and her husband wanted to follow the pediatrician's recommendation, she says.

For the first few days, Barrios says, her daughter ate her snacks. Then one afternoon she returned with them still in her backpack, uneaten. Barrios, alarmed, asked if Alpha was providing different food instead. No, the 9-year-old answered. She told her mom that staff at the school said she didn't earn her snacks and wouldn't get them until she met her learning metrics.

In a central room at Alpha School Brownsville, the school's promise is written on the wall.

A timer on a classroom white board counts the minutes to be spent on a learning app.

“ As a parent, you're like, this is not OK,” Barrios recalls. She pulled both her kids out of Alpha School that November.

Barrios and her husband joined a growing group of families who had chosen to leave the school's Brownsville campus. About two dozen kids were in the inaugural class in 2022, according to Paige Fults, the current head of Alpha School Brownsville. At least five families (including some with more than one child) have departed. That hasn't stopped Alpha's leaders from pointing to Brownsville as an example, in at least one white paper and in applications to open new charter schools, of how the proprietary model Alpha uses, 2 Hour Learning, can succeed in communities with “low SES" (meaning socioeconomic status).

With 2 Hour Learning, which is in use not only at Alpha but also a host of its private “sister schools,” students are meant to spend just two hours per day on “learning sessions.” Personalized learning software—or what the 2 Hour Learning homepage began referring to last year as an “AI tutor”—does the teaching. MacKenzie Price, one of the founders of Alpha and 2 Hour Learning, told WIRED: “ Our students are learning twice as much, our classes are top 1 percent across grades and subjects, and we're doing it all in a much, much shorter amount of time.” (Price's claim is based in part on comparisons of standardized test data. While Price initially said that Alpha would share its data with WIRED, it has not done so.)

As the nation confronts a teacher shortage crisis, Alpha's audacious promise has propelled it from a small Texas private school into a budding educational empire. It's a darling of the Trump administration and the very wealthy. Joe Liemandt, a Stanford dropout turned tech founder whose billions come from selling automation software, is the school's “principal.” This past summer, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman promoted the school on X and hosted a panel about it in the Hamptons. Reid Hoffman, the cofounder of LinkedIn, has had Price on his podcast and has said on X that the “best news” is that Alpha's AI tutor approach “can be a reality for every student, anywhere.” In September, US secretary of education Linda McMahon visited the original Austin campus and said the models presented there were “the most exciting thing I've seen in education in a long time.”

The school is in the midst of a national expansion, including roughly a dozen new campuses in Arizona, California, Florida, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia to add to the five already open in Texas. An “affiliate” charter school called Unbound Academy is enrolling students in Arizona. Although Unbound is independent from Alpha, its leadership team includes Price and her husband, Andrew, and some of the other initial members of its board either work at or have connections to Alpha. Unbound's application to open in Arizona cited Alpha School Brownsville, saying that it “demonstrated how the 2hr Learning Model can effectively address educational disparities” and make “high-quality education accessible to all students.”

Certainly, the school has its fans: When Newsweek recently visited the Brownsville campus, one older student said she appreciated her time there so much that she was looking to found an upper school herself so that she and her cohort could continue with an Alpha-like model rather than attend the local public high school. “The Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, and all the cities surrounding it are lagging behind in education in the US, so students going from a fast-paced environment like Alpha and then having to cut it off and go to a traditional school doesn't make sense," the 12-year-old said. (After offering in August to connect WIRED with this student, Alpha did not respond to subsequent requests to do so.)

But in interviews with WIRED, more than a dozen former employees, students, and parents say what they expected from Alpha School wasn't what it delivered. Former “guides” from different campuses, many of whom requested anonymity because they fear negative consequences, say Alpha's educational philosophy was driven by software metrics and, sometimes, Liemandt's whims. One guide said they believed Alpha wanted to prepare students for a hypercompetitive “late capitalism, dog-eat-dog” environment. Parents like Kristine Barrios say the school impacted their children, left them with glaring gaps in their education, and is now using them to sell a story of success. “They set her up for failure,” Barrios says, and then it felt like “they punished her for failing.”

In response to WIRED's October 10 requests for comment for this story, Alpha School shared a Google Doc of partial responses six days later that it subsequently rescinded access to. On October 20, Alpha informed WIRED: “We possess records that materially contradict key elements of your current reporting.” After several extensions of the original deadline requested for response, WIRED received no further substantive replies from Alpha to the requests sent on October 10. Last Friday morning, October 24, WIRED received a letter from lawyers for Alpha seeking more time to respond and further information from WIRED, including “waivers” from individual students' parents. That night, Alpha's lawyers sent WIRED a statement reading, in part: “Allegations that Alpha has mistreated, punished, or caused harm to any student are categorically and demonstrably false. Alpha and its employees prioritize a safe and productive environment to accelerate academic mastery and allow students to thrive.”

When scientists want to condition lab animals to perform tasks repetitively, they may use a Skinner box, a device invented by Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner that rewards test subjects for responding to certain stimuli. In 1953, Skinner adapted the idea into one of the world's first personalized learning machines. On parents' day in his daughter's fourth-grade class, he noticed that some students were bored waiting for the teacher to review their math work while others were struggling to keep up. Skinner got to tinkering and ultimately developed boxes that could accept questions on punch cards and two-digit answers via levers. When a student got the question right, the box would shine a light to let them know they could move on.

After the digital revolution, learning machines got more adaptive. Personalized software could present students with questions that changed in difficulty and subject matter based on previous answers. By 2014, a small group of wealthy families from Austin's burgeoning tech scene—including entrepreneur Brian Holtz and MacKenzie Price—felt confident enough in the software and in their own backgrounds to bet their kids' educations on a new model. They founded Emergent Academy, renamed Alpha School in 2019. Some of the earliest students included Liemandt's kids. The core philosophy, says Graham Frey, the school's CEO from 2017 until 2022, was “the only way we're going to know if the apps work is if we let them do the teaching.”



Do the machines have blood on their hands? Will Knight reports from the front.

As Alpha was getting off the ground in Austin, the tech world's billionaire philanthropists were coming around to a similar vision of the future of education. In Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's 2015 “Letter to Max,” released with the launch of their nonprofit, they pledged to build a world of new opportunity for their firstborn child and her peers. “Our generation grew up in classrooms where we all learned the same things at the same pace regardless of our interests or needs,” they wrote. “You'll have technology that understands how you learn best” and get “as much help as you need in your most challenging areas.”

Zuckerberg's initiative committed to spending more than $100 million to support a learning platform called Summit. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also gave millions in grants to encourage the adoption of personalized, software-based curricula.

Up until 2022, Alpha had applied its models to groups of students from wealthy, largely white, mostly college-educated families in Austin. A guide named Brennan Wong says she felt “OK with experimenting on this group of students because all the students I taught were coming from very well-off families and were already a couple grades ahead.” With its Brownsville campus, Alpha would be expanding to a different population of students.

When Alpha began recruiting Brownsville students with generous scholarships, there was nothing else like it in the predominantly Hispanic city of about 190,000, which sits at the southernmost tip of Texas, just across the Rio Grande from Matamoros, Mexico.

Kristine Barrios, who had been homeschooling her children, says she was drawn to the vibrant mural in the new school building's lobby and the unconventional seating options that encouraged kids to get comfortable while they learned, rather than sit rigidly in desks.

A student works on software exercises on a classroom couch.

Jessica Lopez says she wanted her two daughters to learn at their own pace and was intrigued by the life-skills workshops that would fill up their afternoons at Alpha once the software-based academics were done.

Silvia Solis and Juan Jose Garcia, who had moved back to Brownsville a year before, were eager to get their children into a school with other kids from the neighborhood, and Alpha was opening about a mile down the road.

Other parents said they enrolled because they were fleeing bullying at previous schools or looking for a flexible schedule that could accommodate frequent doctor's appointments.

For much of the school's first year, parents said, the place was held together by a dedicated staff who managed to create a fun, albeit chaotic, learning environment. Lopez's older daughter, a confident, gregarious 13-year-old who was 10 when she first enrolled, says she was a motivated student who would ask her parents if she could stay up late at home to work on her Alpha apps in order to earn rewards. She was selected as one of the top students, and she told her mom that she got to sit in a special room, eat snacks, and listen to music while she worked.

A parent who requested anonymity to protect their child said that the school had regular week-long breaks to recharge, during which students weren't allowed to bring home their laptops to work. They said they loved the school and spread the word to their neighbors.

Liemandt took over as principal around the same time Alpha School Brownsville was opening, and it was then, Price says, that “we got really, really committed to making sure we were providing academic rigor and showing great results.” Even before the change, Liemandt had been hands-on with operations in Austin, former staff said. He would engage with the guides in long meetings about curriculum, or how to best keep the students motivated, and would sometimes send emails outside of working hours asking for updates on individual students.

At the Austin campus, guides said, students benefited from various opportunities. In one workshop, students designed custom slide sandals, then got to order them from the company. In another, a student says they created a model city for Tesla and won a two-day trip to Disney World. For hitting their learning metrics, they could possibly earn hundreds of dollars over the course of a school year.

Toward the end of that first year, Barrios says, she got a message one day from Alpha saying that her daughter had been selected to be an “ambassador” and would need to stay after school. When Barrios arrived to pick her up, she found Liemandt there too. She says her daughter and other students were giving tours to prospective parents who worked at the newly opened SpaceX Starbase nearby.

Soon after, Liemandt held a brief question-and-answer session for parents. When asked why Alpha had chosen to open a school in Brownsville, parents say they recall that Liemandt responded: For SpaceX.

Price says Alpha chose to open its campus in Brownsville because of the influx of SpaceX employees into an “impoverished area” with what she alleges is a “really tough” public school district. (The Texas Education Agency has given it an overall rating of B for the past two years, the most common rating for public schools and charters in the state.) Price adds, “We thought it would be a great place to go and serve a population that was interested in something that was, you know, kind of innovative and then also see how it worked with the local population.”

Even after what parents say could be a rocky first year, Barrios and others still saw Alpha as a pathway to the future for their kids, the kind of opportunity that rarely comes along for working-class families in communities like Brownsville. Many of them had been homeschooling previously or came from charter or other nontraditional schooling backgrounds. They were used to less structure. They felt that together, they could build the school into the vision of it that Alpha had sold them.

That summer, the beloved head of the school left. When families returned the following fall, according to a memo obtained by WIRED, parents were told that Alpha would be debuting a new “version” of itself, called “Limitless,” that was the “culmination” of its “learning” from prior years. “This means we can sunset programs and thinking, and build something that takes us further with the same limitless concepts and thinking,” the memo said. As part of that effort, the school established goals “deliberately designed to cause a parent to think or say, ‘That sounds impossibly difficult for my kid,'” the memo said, in order to “demonstrate the limitless possibilities of their children.”

As Barrios sees things, “it switched from being about the kids to the metrics and the data and the numbers.”

Recess at Alpha School Brownsville.

Spend a day at Alpha Brownsville and it's easy to see the school's curb appeal. The classrooms are small and cozy, with beanbags to sit on, inspirational reminders of students' “limitless” potential painted on the walls, and diffusers pumping subtle, calming scents into the air. As the school has grown, Fults said, the older students have started using a dedicated room a few miles away at the Children's Museum of Brownsville, steps from the activities and exhibits.

There are hints of a corporate coworking space—like the soundproofed phone booths that serve as test-taking cubicles—and clear signs of the school's tech-evangelist, entrepreneurial ethos. In the room for 5- to 7-year-olds, a large TV on one wall displays circle charts that update every minute with completion rates and other metrics from each student's personalized learning software. Against the opposite wall is a display of toys with price tags listed in “Alphas,” one of many motivational awards students can earn by hitting various learning metrics. One Alpha is equivalent to 25 cents, and a small Fortnite Lego set costs 350 Alphas. (That's about six times the retail price.) Students can also earn visits to local amusement parks, lunch at restaurants, or trips to the grocery store.

Lessons take place in an eerie hush—a dozen kids with headphones on, plugged into laptops, occasionally raising their hand to indicate that they've finished a lesson or are having technical problems with their app. The adult guides in every classroom “don't do any teaching,” says Fults, the current head of school for Alpha Brownsville. “Usually what it looks like when a guide helps is more like having the student read the question out loud, show where they have done their work, or show what resources they have already accessed and already used.” If a student really gets stuck, she says, they can book a call with an academic coach who is “part of” 2 Hour Learning.

A student takes a coaching call from a booth.

A list of the 31 academic coaches Alpha provided for the 2023-24 school year, obtained by WIRED, includes LinkedIn profiles for 26 that show they have been employed, usually as “analysts,” by either Trilogy, Liemandt's software automation company, or Crossover, another Liemandt firm, which has been described as the world's largest recruiter for remote full-time work. At least 27 of the coaches live outside the US, from the Philippines to Colombia, according to their Linkedin profiles.

While some guides—the adults who are actually in the room with students—have previous experience as educators, others do not. Frey says that when he was Alpha's CEO, he often “targeted individuals without teaching backgrounds.” Guides told WIRED that while some of their colleagues had experience at other schools, they also had coaching, motivational, or entrepreneurial backgrounds.

At Alpha, the guides' support and oversight is meant to supplement the technology—and not just the personalized learning system the school has dubbed an AI tutor. Alpha can also use an array of management surveillance tools, which it calls “basic and extended capabilities,” to flag “incorrect usage” of the learning apps. These “anti-patterns” can “help detect engagement and focus issues.” The school may record students' screen activity and their mouse and keyboard usage. Alpha may employ eye-tracking programs. Using what it calls a “pro sports analogy,” Alpha compares these tools to “game film.”

While parents are asked to consent to these surveillance programs, the school's handbook says that there is “no expectation of privacy” on campus. If parents want to restrict recordings of their children outside of the school, they have to manually opt out of the “anywhere” option—as Jessica Lopez learned midway through her older daughter's second year at Alpha. The girl says she remembers sitting on her bed one night working on schoolwork when she received a notification that she'd been flagged for an anti-pattern. She says Alpha's system sent a video of her in her pajamas, taken from the computer's webcam, that showed her talking to her younger sister.

Neil Selwyn, an education professor at Monash University and author of Should Robots Replace Teachers?: AI and the Future of Education, says attempts to automate teaching usually underestimate how much the profession requires improvisation and adapting to a particular student's needs. Alpha's trust in software-enabled repetition and students' self-motivation is often typical of education ventures started by people with backgrounds in tech who were self-taught and “then fix onto self-regulated learning or one-to-one tutoring as the way that one can learn math or science or engineering or coding most effectively,” Selwyn says. “But they didn't tend to learn history, poetry, or archaeology, or any of the humanities” that way.

Some Alpha Brownsville students say that the software they used could adapt to what they were learning, but not how they learned it. In her second year at the school, Lopez's older daughter says she began to stress about meeting the goals for her math and English lessons. Some of her learning apps had “a video in the corner that you could click on” for further instruction, she says, but she felt that was it: “You just trial-and-error.” She became so frustrated at falling behind—not behind her grade level, but behind the rate of production she needed to complete her goals and possibly earn rewards—that she says she took it out on herself physically.

“I was pulling my hair out, ripping my skin off,” says the former student, who her mom says had had trouble with sensory issues and hyperactivity since before her time at Alpha. “I think at one point I didn't eat for most of the day because I told myself I don't eat unless I get something right. I have to do this. Rewards, rewards, motivation, everything became a reward.” When one of the guides noticed she was distressed, she says that person gave her a piece of paper to tear at instead. She told WIRED that they also gave her a plushie toy that she used as a punching bag.

Earlier this year, Lopez published some of her critiques of Alpha School on Substack. Price says that Lopez is a “loud example” of someone who has “a huge difference in philosophy” and that Alpha is not for everyone. “Students thrive when they're in an environment with high standards and high support, which our guides do,” Price said. “But not everyone believes that, right? There are so many parents who do not really believe in high standards. There are parents who don't believe in high support.”

As Price sees it, what 2 Hour Learning's team of scientists and software developers have built—an AI system that can track students' progress and match them with appropriate lessons—is “like being able to do a CAT scan of a child's brain to understand what do they know, what don't they know, and how can we go and fill in that knowledge to mastery?” Currently, Alpha defines “mastery” as correctly completing 90 percent of a lesson.

In its marketing, Alpha says its students should spend two hours a day completing their sessions. But parents and former guides told WIRED that in order to keep up with the rate of lessons required to earn rewards, their students felt they needed to regularly work late into the night at home. Brooks Wiley, an Austin parent, says his son received $2,000 over the course of academic years for scoring well on tests and reaching other goals. But at 13 years old he was reading at an 11th-grade level, Wiley says, making it harder to demonstrate mastery at the same 2x rate. “He felt stress and anxiety to meet rewards,” Wiley says. At the same time, he adds, “I don't think that's a bad thing. That standard or frame of mind has helped him now.”

Another parent, who withdrew their son from Alpha Brownsville, says guides offered to buy him something from Amazon if he retook a standardized test and improved his score. But the parent says their son felt shame when he wasn't completing enough lessons in his apps. “He went from a really happy kid, where school completely changed him that first year,” the parent says, “to just a work machine who would do whatever it took.”

Students can purchase prizes using Alphas, the school's in-house currency, which they earn through work.

Last year, the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools approved Unbound Academy's application to open a public, online-only charter. The charter school governing bodies in at least two other states—Arkansas and Pennsylvania—rejected the school's proposals, and Utah's board decided not to move forward with its application process. “Even my own home state of Texas rejected our charter application,” Price told WIRED, though the Texas Education Agency told WIRED it “has no record of Unbound Academy as a charter applicant.” The Pennsylvania Department of Education wrote in its denial that “the artificial intelligence instructional model being proposed by this school is untested and fails to demonstrate how the tools, methods, and providers would ensure alignment to Pennsylvania academic standards.” The department noted that the curriculum plan Unbound presented was vague and did not expressly include subjects like physical education, health, languages, or social studies.

Students and families from Alpha School Brownsville who spoke to WIRED say younger age groups at the school lacked a dedicated social studies or history curriculum, though older kids learned those subjects. Brownsville parents said they also saw other gaps in their kids' educations. One parent says that when their son left Alpha as an 8-year-old, he could read words quickly but didn't comprehend what he was reading. When he enrolled as a third grader at his new school, the parent says, he was writing at a kindergarten level. And when writing by hand, he would get to the end of a line and curve down into the margins, not knowing he was supposed to move to the next line. “All Alpha taught him was read fast, learn your vocabulary, and move on,” the parent says.

When Solis and Garcia had enrolled their kids at Alpha, they say they told the school that their youngest needed help with reading. Alpha staff had told them not to get a tutor and to trust the process, they say. (An information packet from a parent orientation night that year says: “We are creating self-driven, 2x learners and having a tutor spoon feed you help is the opposite of that.”) But with six weeks left in the school year, Solis and Garcia say, Alpha informed them that their son was so far behind in reading that he might not be invited back in the fall of 2023. They say Alpha gave them a large package of make-up work to be completed during the summer. “They were making us do the work that they had failed to do,” Solis says. (The family withdrew their two children from the school after that first year.)

Kristine Barrios, a pediatric occupational therapist by profession, noticed while her youngest was still at Alpha that he still had an inefficient pencil grip. After pulling him out, she found his writing struggles were worse than she'd realized. He didn't even know to start from the top of a letter and move down, she says. His older sister, 9 at the time she left Alpha, also had an inappropriate pencil grip, Barrios says. She would frequently misspell words longer than three letters and she couldn't distinguish between nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech.

Some Brownsville parents' anger has been compounded by a feeling that while they say their children were suffering, Alpha used the school to sell its product to other families. “They're using our people as bait,” Lopez says. “They're sharing that they're in Brownsville, and how they helped us grow academically in a 98 to 99 percent low-income Hispanic community, so yes, it works for everybody. I don't want to be their statistic, the reason somebody else goes through this.”

Lopez's daughters both attend public school now. The transition wasn't without stress, she says, but her oldest has continued to excel academically, and her younger daughter has a newfound confidence in her studies. All she needed was “someone who could walk her through content that's just not landing,” Lopez says.

Within weeks of leaving Alpha and returning to homeschooling, Kristine Barrios' daughter began eating regularly again, she says. Regaining her interest in school was more of a struggle. “It's taken the better part of this past year to get her back to baseline,” Barrios says, “that natural exuberance and love of learning and life.”

My impression is that it is little more than cynicism masquerading as software. 

OpenAI rolled out a new web browser last week called Atlas. It comes with ChatGPT built in, along with an agent, so that you can browse, get direct answers, and have automated tasks performed on your behalf all at the same time. 

I've spent the past several days tinkering with Atlas. I've used it to do all my normal web browsing, and also tried to take advantage of the ChatGPT functions—plus I threw some weird agentic tasks its way to see how it did with those. And my impression is that Atlas is…  fine? But my big takeaway is that it's pretty pointless for anyone not employed by OpenAI, and that Atlas is little more than cynicism masquerading as software. 

If you want to know why, let's start by looking at its agentic capabilities—which is really where it differentiates.

When I was browsing Amazon, I asked the Atlas agent to do some shopping for me, using a pre-set prompt of its own suggestion. (“Start a cart with items I'm likely to want based on my browsing here and highlight any active promo codes. Let me review before checkout.”) It picked out a notebook that I'd recently purchased and no longer needed, some deodorant I'd recently purchased and no longer needed, and a vacuum cleaner that I'd considered but decided was too expensive and no longer needed because I bought a cheaper one. 

I would guess that it took 10 minutes or so for it to do all that. I cleaned out my cart and considered myself lucky that it didn't buy anything.  

When I logged onto Facebook, which is already lousy with all sorts of AI slop, I asked it to create a status update for me. So it dug through my browser history and came back with an incredibly long status I won't bore you with all of it (and there was a lot) but here are the highlights from what it suggested:  “I dipped into Smartsheet and TeamSnap (because editors juggle rosters too!), flirted with Shopify and Amazon (holiday gift‑shopping? side hustle? you decide), and kept tabs on the news … . Somewhere in there I even remembered to log into Slack, schedule Zoom meetings, and read a few NYTimes and Technology Review pieces. Who says an editor's life isn't glamorous? 😊” 

Uh. Okay. I decided against posting that. There were some other equally unillustrious examples as well, but you get the picture. 

Aside from the agent, the other unique feature is having ChatGPT built right into the browser. Notice I said “unique,” not “useful.” I struggled with finding any obvious utility by having this right there, versus just going to chatgpt dot com. In some cases, the built-in chatbot was worse and dumber. 

For example, I asked the built-in ChatGPT to summarize a MIT Technology Review article I was reading for me. Yet instead of answering the question about the page I was on, it referred back to the page I had previously been on when I started the session. Which is to say it spit back some useless nonsense. Thanks, AI. 

OpenAI is marketing Atlas pretty aggressively when you come to ChatGPT now, suggesting people download it. And it may in fact score a lot of downloads because of that. But without giving people more of a reason to actually switch from more entrenched browsers, like Chrome or Safari, this feels like a real empty salvo in the new browser wars. 

It's been hard for me to understand why Atlas exists. Who is this browser for, exactly? Who is its customer? And the answer I have come to there is that Atlas is for OpenAI. The real customer, the true end user of Atlas, is not the person browsing websites, it is the company collecting data about what and how that person is browsing.

We've all been there: you're halfway through the day, your phone's battery is flashing red and that trusty 10,000mAh power bank you grabbed? It barely gives your iPhone one full charge before tapping out. If you're tired of hunting for outlets or rationing your device usage during trips, this 56,800mAh 22.5W fast charging portable charger might just be the game-changer you need. Right now, Amazon is slashing the price from $159 down to just $34, an unprecedented 78% discount that marks an all-time low for this beast of a power bank.

See at Amazon

The main feature here is obviously that enormous 56,800mAh capacity. To put this in perspective, this power bank can fully charge an iPhone 17 multiple times over throughout the day without needing a recharge itself. For tablet users, you're looking at several complete charging cycles which makes this an absolute lifesaver during camping weekends or those marathon workdays when you're bouncing between meetings with no time to plug in. One important note: due to its massive capacity, this power bank cannot be taken on airplanes.

Speed is also a consideration and that is where the importance of the 22.5W PD fast-charging technology comes in. Rather than having to spend several hours waiting for your device to charge to almost full, the improved power delivery feature sends a boost to the power levels in your phone, tablet, or any device that will allow it to charge faster. This allows for a quick recharge that will see it kick-started to almost 50% or more, something that can only require waiting for approximately the time it takes to grab a bite.

The ability to charge three devices simultaneously is another feature that has made this power bank so handy. With two USB-A ports and a USB-C port, you can charge your smartphone, wireless earbuds, and tablet simultaneously without having to prioritize them for charging. The USB-C port is also bi-directional, so it can either charge the power bank or use it to charge your other gadgets, depending on the cables that are readily available. Smart current management automatically detects each connected device and distributes the appropriate power level, so your phone gets the fast charge it can handle while your smartwatch receives a gentler, safer current.

The LED digital display on the front panel removes all guesswork from power management: Instead of vague indicator lights that leave you wondering if you have 10% or 40% remaining, you get an exact percentage reading. This precision lets you plan ahead, knowing whether you need to recharge the power bank overnight or if you have enough juice left for another full day of device charging. Safety features are built directly into the circuitry including protections against overvoltage, short circuits, overheating, and overcurrent situations.

The design has got a balance between portability and that strong functionality. Of course, it's larger and weighs more than a portable power bank but it still can fit comfortably in backpack pockets, side pockets of luggage or in the storage compartments that come along in cars. The design does not feature any cables, and surprisingly, it's an advantage for you since it will allow the use of better quality cables that came along with laptops or chargers.

— Deb Hall Lefevre, the longtime tech exec who was most recently CTO at Starbucks, announced her retirement on Sunday in a LinkedIn post.

Hall Lefevre resigned from Starbucks last month, according to a Sept. 26 report from Reuters, which cited a memo sent to staff about her departure. 

The move came amid layoffs and various tech-related changes at the Seattle coffee giant. 

“After an incredible journey leading technology and digital transformation across some of the world's most iconic brands, including Starbucks, Circle K/Couche Tard and McDonald's, it's time to step into retirement,” Hall Lefevre said in her LinkedIn post.

“As I turn the page, I look forward to more time with family, continuing my tech and board work, and cheering on the next generation of leaders shaping the future,” she added. 

Hall Lefevre, who was also an executive vice president, joined Starbucks in 2022. She previously spent more than 16 years at McDonald's, where she was a corporate vice president and CIO, leading the fast food giant's technology and digital commerce strategy. She was also EVP and CTO at Circle K Stores.

Ningyu Chen, who was senior vice president of global experience technology, is now interim chief technology officer at Starbucks. 

Starbucks last month announced plans to lay off around 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores mainly in the U.S. and Canada. Starbucks previously cut 1,100 corporate workers in February.

Under the leadership of CEO Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who joined the company last year, Starbucks is making a bevy of technology tweaks as it tries to curb slumping sales.

— Lindo St. Angel, vice president of hardware for Amazon's Lab126 devices group, is departing at the end of the month. Reuters first reported the news.

St. Angel joined Lab126 in 2010. The business unit, based in Silicon Valley, launched in 2004 and helped develop Amazon devices such as the Kindle Fire, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and other hardware.

— Mark Jewett joined New York City health data company Komodo Health as chief marketing officer. Jewett was previously a senior vice president at Informatica and CMO at SmartRecruiters. He also was a SVP and co-interim CMO at Tableau, and spent 15 years at Microsoft in various leadership roles. 

Founded in 2014, Komodo Health reached a $3.3 billion valuation in 2021. The company helps healthcare stakeholders integrate data and generate insights related to treatment, research, and more.

— Nancy Mounir joined Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a vice president leading security programs and platforms. 

Mounir previously spent more than 12 years at Microsoft, most recently as a senior director and chief of staff overseeing the company's Secure Future Initiative. 

In a LinkedIn post, Mounir said she is “looking forward to a great journey of learning, innovation and growth with the Security Platform team!”

She added: “Extremely grateful for my time at Microsoft and could not be more proud of what we accomplished together over the years!”

Mounir initially worked at Microsoft from 2012 to 2015 in supply chain, and left to spend a year at Amazon working on advertising and accounting teams. She returned to Microsoft in 2016.

— Priya Vaidyanathan took a new role at Microsoft as director of product and design for Microsoft's AI skilling platform. Vaidyanathan returned to Microsoft in 2020 after two previous stints and was most recently a group product manager. She previously founded a mealkit startup called SnapCurry and was a senior technical product manager at Amazon.

“This next chapter is about helping people everywhere gain the skills and confidence to grow with AI, creating opportunity, resilience, and impact at every level,” she wrote on LinkedIn. 

— Jim Chi was named executive director of Oregon Startup Center, which is going through a relaunch, according to Portland Business Journal. Chi is also president of Oregon Sports Angels and is a longtime product management leader.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

SAN FRANCISCO — Putting on Amazon's new smart delivery glasses felt surprisingly natural from the start. Despite their high-tech components and slightly bulky design, they were immediately comfortable and barely heavier than my normal glasses.

Then a few lines of monochrome green text and a square target popped up in the right-hand lens — reminding me that these were not my regular frames. 

Occupying just a portion of my total field of view, the text showed an address and a sorting code: “YLO 339.” As I learned, “YLO” represented the yellow tote bag where the package would normally be found, and “339” was a special code on the package label.

My task: find the package with that code. Or more precisely, let the glasses find them.

As soon as I looked at the correct package label, the glasses recognized the code and scanned the label automatically. A checkmark appeared on a list of packages in the glasses. 

Then an audio alert played from the glasses: “Dog on property.”

When all the packages were scanned, the tiny green display immediately switched to wayfinding mode. A simple map appeared, showing my location as a dot, and the delivery destination marked with pins. In this simulation, there were two pins, indicating two stops. 

After putting the package on the doorstep, it was time for proof of delivery. Instead of reaching for a phone, I looked at the package on the doorstep and pressed a button once on the small controller unit —the “compute puck” — on my harness. The glasses captured a photo.

With that, my simulated delivery was done, without ever touching a handheld device.

In my very limited experience, the biggest concern I had was the potential to be distracted — focusing my attention on the text in front of my eyes rather than the world around me. I understand now why the display automatically turns off when a van is in motion. 

But when I mentioned that concern to the Amazon leaders guiding me through the demo, they pointed out that the alternative is looking down at a device. With the glasses, your gaze is up and largely unobstructed, theoretically making it much easier to notice possible hazards. 

Beyond the fact that they're not intended for public release, that simplicity is a key difference between Amazon's utilitarian design and other augmented reality devices — such as Meta Ray-Bans, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap — which aim to more fully enhance or overlay the user's environment.

KC Pangan, who delivers Amazon packages in San Francisco and was featured in Amazon's demo video, said wearing the glasses has become so natural that he barely notices them. 

Pangan has been part of an Amazon study for the past two months. On the rare occasions when he switches back to the old handheld device, he finds himself thinking, “Oh, this thing again.”

“The best thing about them is being hands-free,” Pangan said in a conversation on the sidelines of the Amazon Delivering the Future event, where the glasses were unveiled last week.

Without needing to look down at a handheld device, he can keep his eyes up and stay alert for potential hazards. With another hand free, he can maintain the all-important three points of contact when climbing in or out of a vehicle, and more easily carry packages and open gates.

The glasses, he said, “do practically everything for me” — taking photos, helping him know where to walk, and showing his location relative to his van. 

While Amazon emphasizes safety and driver experience as the primary goals, early tests hint at efficiency gains, as well. In initial tests, Amazon has seen up to 30 minutes of time savings per shift, although execs cautioned that the results are preliminary and could change with wider testing.

Regulators, legislators and employees have raised red flags over new technology pushing Amazon fulfillment and delivery workers to the limits of human capacity and safety. Amazon disputes this premise, and calls the new glasses part of a larger effort to use technology to improve safety.

Using the glasses will be fully optional for both its Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) and their drivers, even when they're fully rolled out, according to the company. The system also includes privacy features, such as a hardware button that allows drivers to turn off all sensors.

For those who use them, the company says it plans to provide the devices at no cost. 

Despite the way it may look to the public, Amazon doesn't directly employ the drivers who deliver its packages in Amazon-branded vans and uniforms. Instead, it contracts with DSPs, ostensibly independent companies that hire drivers and manage package deliveries from inside Amazon facilities. 

This arrangement has periodically sparked friction, and even lawsuits, as questions have come up over DSP autonomy and accountability.

With the introduction of smart glasses and other tech initiatives, including a soon-to-be-expanded training program, Amazon is deepening its involvement with DSPs and their drivers — potentially raising more questions about who truly controls the delivery workforce.

The smart glasses, still in their prototype phase, trace their origins to a brainstorming session about five years ago, said Beryl Tomay, Amazon's vice president of transportation.

Each year, the team brainstorms big ideas for the company's delivery system. During one of those sessions, a question emerged: What if drivers didn't have to interact with any technology at all?  

“The moonshot idea we came up with was, what if there was no technology that the driver had to interact with — and they could just follow the physical process of delivering a package from the van to the doorstep?” Tomay said in an interview. “How do we make that happen so they don't have to use a phone or any kind of tech that they have to fiddle with?”

That question led the team to experiment with different approaches before settling on glasses. It seemed kind of crazy at first, Tomay said, but they soon realized the potential to improve safety and the driver experience. Early trials with delivery drivers confirmed the theory. 

“The hands-free aspect of it was just kind of magical,” she said, summing up the reaction from early users.

The project has already been tested with hundreds of delivery drivers across more than a dozen DSPs. Amazon plans to expand those trials in the coming months, with a larger test scheduled for November. The goal is to collect more feedback before deciding when the technology will be ready for wider deployment.

Typically, Amazon would have kept a new hardware project secret until later in its development. But Reuters reported on the existence of the project nearly a year ago. (The glasses were reportedly code-named “Amelia,” but they were announced without a name.) And this way, Amazon can get more delivery partners involved, get input, and make improvements.

Future versions may also expand the system's capabilities, using sensors and data to automatically recognize potential hazards such as uneven walkways.

Amazon's smart glasses are part of a system that also includes a small wearable computer and a battery, integrated with Amazon's delivery software and vehicle systems.

The lenses are photochromatic, darkening automatically in bright sunlight, and can be fitted with prescription inserts. Two cameras — one centered, one on the left — support functions such as package scanning and photo capture for proof of delivery. 

A built-in flashlight switches on automatically in dim conditions, while onboard sensors help the system orient to the driver's movement and surroundings.

The glasses connect by a magnetic wire to a small controller unit, or “compute puck,” worn on the chest of a heat-resistant harness. The controller houses the device's AI models, manages the visual display, and handles functions such as taking a delivery photo. It also includes a dedicated emergency button that connects drivers directly to Amazon's emergency support systems.

On the opposite side of the chest, a swappable battery keeps the system balanced and running for a full route. Both components are designed for all-day comfort — the result, Tomay said, of extensive testing with drivers to ensure that wearing the gear feels natural when they're moving around.

Connectivity runs through the driver's official Amazon delivery phone via Bluetooth, and through the vehicle itself using a platform called “Fleet Edge” — a network of sensors and onboard computing modules that link the van's status to the glasses. 

This connection allows the glasses to know precisely when to activate, when to shut down, and when to sync data. When a van is put in park, the display automatically activates, showing details such as addresses, navigation cues, and package information. When the vehicle starts moving again, the display turns off — a deliberate safety measure so drivers never see visual data while driving.

Data gathered by the glasses plays a role in Amazon's broader mapping efforts. Imagery and sensor data feed into “Project Wellspring,” a system that uses AI to better model the physical world. This helps Amazon refine maps, identify the safest parking spots, pinpoint building entrances, and optimize walking routes for future deliveries. 

Amazon says the data collection is done with privacy in mind. In addition to the driver-controlled sensor shut-off button, any imagery collected is processed to “blur or remove personally identifiable information” such as faces and license plates before being stored or used.

The implications go beyond routing and navigation. Conceivably, the same data could also lay the groundwork for greater automation in Amazon's delivery network over time.

In addition to trying the glasses during the event at Amazon's Delivery Station in Milpitas, Calif., I experienced firsthand just how difficult the job of delivering packages can be. 

The simulator, known as the Enhanced Vehicle Operation Learning Virtual Experience (EVOLVE), has been launched at Amazon facilities in Colorado, Maryland, and Florida, and Amazon says it will be available at 40 sites by the end of 2026. 

It's part of what's known as the Integrated Last Mile Driver Academy (iLMDA), a program available at 65 sites currently, which Amazon says it plans to expand to more than 95 delivery stations across North America by the end of 2026.

“Drivers are autonomous on the road, and the amount of variables that they interact with on a given day are countless,” said Anthony Mason, Amazon's director of delivery training and programs, who walked me through the training demos. One goal of the training, he said, is to give drivers a toolkit to pull from when they face challenging situations.

Suffice it to say, this is not the job for me. But if Amazon's smart glasses live up to the company's expectations, they might be a step forward for the drivers doing the real work.

In a new study, researchers found high levels of ultrashort-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in blood samples taken from Wilmington, N.C. residents between 2010-2016. Two ultrashort-chain PFAS - perfluoromethoxyacetic acid (PFMOAA) and trifluoracetic acid (TFA) - were detected at high levels in almost every sample. In contrast, GenX - the chemical that jumpstarted public concern about PFAS in the Cape Fear River Basin - was detected in 20% of the samples. The work adds to the body of evidence that short-chain PFAS can accumulate in the human body.

Ultrashort-chain PFAS such as PFMOAA and TFA have not been well-studied in people for two reasons: they were not thought to bioaccumulate due to their chemical structure, and until recently there were no analytical methods that allowed scientists to reliably detect them in blood.

With the development of analytical methods targeting ultrashort-chain PFAS, researchers have found these compounds to be the dominant PFAS in environmental matrices including water and human blood. Given the long history of PFAS exposure in Wilmington, we wanted to look for these compounds in historical water and blood samples of residents."

Detlef Knappe, professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at NC State and co-corresponding author of the study

In 2016, NC State and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency researchers published findings highlighting high concentrations of several PFAS, including GenX, in Wilmington residents' drinking water. The Fayetteville Works plant, an upstream chemical facility, had been releasing PFAS into the Cape Fear River, the city's primary drinking water source, since 1980. After 2017, the chemical manufacturer was required to control PFAS discharges into the river and air.

For the current study, the researchers looked for 56 different PFAS in water samples from the Cape Fear River taken in 2017 as well as in 119 adult blood serum samples from a UNC biobank that were collected between 2010-2016. The serum samples were anonymized, but all were taken from residents in and around the Wilmington area.

The findings were surprising. In the blood serum, 34 of the 56 PFAS were detected in at least one serum sample. Five PFAS accounted for 85% of the total found in the samples. PFMOAA had the highest median concentration at 42 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), comprising 42% of the summed total, followed by TFA (17 ng/mL), PFOS (14 ng/mL), PFOA (6.2 ng/mL), and PFPrA (5.4 ng/mL).

Additionally, they found that TFA comprised 70% of the total PFAS in the 2017 water sample, with a concentration of 110,000 nanograms per liter (ng/L). PFMOAA had a concentration of 38,000 ng/L. While TFA has a variety of sources, including fluorinated refrigerants, the publication highlights that Fayetteville Works was the dominant source of both TFA and PFMOAA in the lower Cape Fear River.

"For reference, one European guideline recommends a drinking water level of 2200 ng/L for TFA," Knappe says. "Our sample contained over 50 times that concentration."

"These data gave us a 'timestamp' of exposure before people knew their drinking water was contaminated," says Jane Hoppin, professor of biological sciences, principal investigator of the GenX Exposure Study, member of NC State's Center for Human Health and the Environment (CHHE), and co-corresponding author of the paper describing the work.

"The conventional wisdom is that short-chain PFAS are of lesser concern because they don't bioaccumulate, but what we're seeing is that they can occur at high levels in people," Hoppin adds. "These results point out the need to start thinking about how to study the human health effects of these PFAS, particularly TFA and PFMOAA.

"The other issue is how limited the human health data are for any of these chemicals. Most chemicals in the PFAS class affect the liver and immune system, but this work is still in its infancy in many cases."

Next steps include analyzing samples from the GenX Exposure Study for TFA and PFMOAA levels.

"The sample set gives us a glimpse into the past," Hoppin says. "Seeing what the levels are now will help us determine how these chemicals accumulate in the body and what their health effects might be."

The study appears in Environmental Science and Technology and was supported by research funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (1R21ES029353, P42ES0310095), Center for Human Health and the Environment (CHHE) at NC State University (P30ES025128), and the North Carolina Collaboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with funding appropriated by the North Carolina General Assembly. Other NC State collaborators were Lan Cheng, Sarah Teagle, Jeffrey R. Enders and Rebecca A. Weed. Hazel B. Nichols from UNC-Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Public Health also contributed to the work.

A multinational collaboration at Eitri medical innovation center in Bergen, Norway, has used machine learning models to identify patient groups at risk of being mistreated.

Doctors must make hard choices every day at the emergency department (often called the ED or ER). They usually have a system that helps them get the right level of care for patients, called triage.

Triage systems help doctors determine when a patient is facing a true medical emergency and need treatment immediately, or when it is probably safe to delay treatment. Still, mistakes can happen, and sometimes patients don't get the help they need."

Dr. Sage Wyatt at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway

There is no universal triage system, and it can be difficult to evaluate how well different systems function.

Now, an eclectic team of Norwegian and German researchers from academic, industry, and medical sectors, has used machine learning to shed light on how well the triage systems work in Bergen and Trondheim, Norway.

The collaboration sprung out of a "Datathon" at Eitri Medical Incubator, Bergen in 2022, supervised by Dr. Christopher Sauer, an oncologist from the Institute for AI in Medicine from Essen, Germany. This project eventually led to a publication in the

First author, Dr. Sage Wyatt, defends the value of using machine learning to analyze medical data:

"In this setting, machine learning methods allowed us to consider the importance of many complex factors that impact triage classification simultaneously, providing more nuanced results than conventional methods", she says.

The data scientists in Wyatt's team wanted to find out what kinds of patients were failed by the triage system, such as patients who were given low priority but who later died or got transferred to the intensive care unit (undertriage) or patients who were given high priority unnecessarily (overtriage).

Luckily, incorrect triage was very rare, affecting less than one percent of the patients.

The data science team members with industry training used machine learning models to determine the importance of many different patient characteristics simultaneously, a novel method that has not been used in this setting before.

The machine learning models ranked importance of variables on the dataset by a metric known as "SHAP-values."

"SHAP is a metric from game theory and is a way to quantify how much a variable contributes to prediction", explains Wyatt.

When they applied these methods to emergency department data, the results were surprising:

"A previous study using conventional methods in Bergen showed that overtriage was most prevalent in patients younger than 18 years, implying that age is one of the most important variables contributing to overtriage" Wyatt says

"Yet the automated variable selection based on SHAP-values in our study revealed that age might not be the most important characteristic contributing to overtriage in Bergen, as might have been an assumption in a study directed by domain knowledge."

By "domain knowledge" Wyatt refers to the knowledge derived from the expert opinion of doctors who use the system. Wyatt says that it might have downsides to base a study on expert opinion alone:

"While it's valuable to hear opinions from people who know the triage systems best, this information can also be based on attitudes and assumptions unrelated to the tool itself", says Wyatt, and continues:

"With a lot of focus in society on gender equality, which is an important topic to discuss, doctors and patients might assume that incorrect triage could also be due to gender bias", she says.

The earlier study found that patient gender was an important factor, however, as Dr. Wyatt explains:
"Instead, with machine learning methods, we identified that the clinical referral department and diagnostic codes are more important factors associated with overtriage in the Bergen dataset."

While machine learning methods and artificial intelligence aren't perfect tools, Wyatt hopes that these tools can be used to provide new perspectives in science.

"For optimal usage, appropriate methods must be tailored to the specific research context, and common pitfalls need to be avoided," she says, and concludes:

"More research is needed in the future about triage systems and new applications of machine learning methods, such as automated triage classification systems".

In an effort to stem the death toll from opioid overdose, United States public health officials have promoted the prescription and use of medications like buprenorphine that blunt the effects of illicit opioids such as fentanyl.

However, what happens when patients on these medications require surgery and anesthesia?

Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians handle this patient population.

To fill in knowledge gaps, Mark Bicket, M.D., Ph.D., and his team examined trends in use of medications for opioid use disorder among surgical patients.

The results are published in the journal Anesthesiology.

Looking at 2016-2022 claims data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, the team focused on surgeries amongst adults 18-64 who had a claim for buprenorphine, methadone or extended-release naltrexone (together categorized as MOUD, medications for opioid use disorder) between 1 and 180 days before their procedure.

They found that rates of MOUD use went up from 154 per 100,000 procedures in 2016 to 240 per 100,000 procedures in 2022, mostly resulting from increases in the use of buprenorphine.

The prevalence of MOUD use increased in all age subgroups except in patients 18-34, which slightly decreased.

As for types of surgeries undergone by these patients, debridement and orthopedic procedures, such as shoulder arthroplasty, lower extremity amputation and hip or pelvis fracture open repair had the highest prevalence of MOUD use.

The findings highlight a need to establish clinical practice guidelines for patients receiving MOUDs, especially around orthopedic surgery, to coordinate care and pain management and mitigate risk of harm.

Stillbirths occur at a higher rate in the U.S. than previously reported, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Mass General Brigham.

The researchers also found that, while most stillbirths had at least one identified clinical risk factor, a substantial share had none, particularly those occurring at 40+ weeks gestation.

Stillbirths impact nearly 21,000 families each year in the U.S., and nearly half of those occurring at 37+ weeks are thought to be preventable. Yet there is very little research in this area. Our study highlights the pressing need to improve stillbirth risk prediction and prevention."

Jessica Cohen, professor of health economics, co-senior author

The study will be published Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in JAMA. According to the researchers, it's one of the largest, most data-rich studies of stillbirth burden to date.

The researchers studied the outcomes of more than 2.7 million pregnancies across the U.S. between 2016 and 2022 using commercial health insurance claims and demographic data from the Health Care Cost Institute, the American Community Survey, and the March of Dimes. Among these pregnancies, 18,893 stillbirths were identified. The researchers examined associations between these stillbirths and a variety of clinical factors, including gestational age at delivery; pregnancy risks such as obesity, pregnancy-related and chronic hypertension, gestational and pre-pregnancy diabetes, and substance use; fetal risks, such as decreased movement, growth restriction, and anomalies; and obstetric risks, such as history of stillbirth or adverse pregnancy outcomes and low or excess amniotic fluid levels. They also considered a variety of socioeconomic factors, including rurality and area-level measures of income, race, and access to obstetric care.

The study found that more than 1 in 150 births end in stillbirth-a rate higher than the rate of 1 in 175 births that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published as the national average. The rate was even higher for families living in low-income areas, where 1 in every 112 births ended in stillbirth. The researchers also observed that the stillbirth rate was 1 in every 95 births in areas with higher proportions of Black families compared to White families. Stillbirth rates did not significantly vary according to rurality and levels of access to obstetric care.

The study also found that while 72.3% of stillbirths had at least one clinical risk factor, a sizable portion of stillbirths occurred with no identified clinical risk factor. Across all of the stillbirths in the study, nearly 27.7% had no risk factor. Later gestational ages showed the highest rates of having no clinical risk factor: Among stillbirths that occurred at 38 weeks gestation, 24.1% had no risk factor; at 39 weeks, 34.2%; and at 40+ weeks, 40.7%. Stillbirth rates were highest among pregnancies with low amniotic fluid levels, fetal anomalies, and chronic hypertension.

"Although momentum toward improving stillbirth research and prevention efforts has increased in recent years, rates in the U.S. remain much higher than in peer countries," said co-senior author Mark Clapp, maternal-fetal medicine provider in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital. "I hope this study will inform policy, practice changes, and future research to ensure no person or family has to experience this outcome."

The researchers also noted that the study's findings indicate the need for further research into what's driving socioeconomic variances of stillbirth rates-whether that be social factors, health systems factors, and/or clinical risk factors.

Haley Sullivan, student in the Harvard PhD Program in Health Policy, was the study's first author. Harvard Chan's Anna Sinaiko was also a co-author.

New research shows that eosinophils, immune cells usually linked to allergies, also play a protective role against Candida infections by using the CD48 receptor to recognize the fungus and release proteins that stop its growth. This discovery is important because it reshapes how we understand the immune system and opens the door to new therapies that could strengthen natural defenses against life-threatening fungal infections, a growing challenge in hospitals worldwide.

A new study, conducted under the guidance of Prof. Francesca Levi-Schaffer from the School of Pharmacy at the Hebrew University and led by PhD candidates Ilan Zaffran, Prince Ofori, and postdoctoral fellow Pratibha Gaur, uncovers how a surprising player in the immune system, eosinophils, best known for their role in allergies and asthma, also helps protect the body against Candida albicans, one of the most common and dangerous fungal infections in humans.Eosinophils are white blood cells typically associated with allergy, asthma, and inflammation. But their role in fighting infections has been less clear. The new research shows that these cells are not just bystanders: they can recognize and attack Candida albicans, a fungus that can cause life-threatening infections in people with weakened immune systems.

The study identifies CD48, a key receptor on eosinophils, as central to this defense. CD48 binds to a fungal surface protein known as Als6, helping eosinophils recognize and respond to infection. This interaction triggers the release of powerful proteins, including major basic protein 1 (MBP-1), that limit fungal growth and survival.Invasive Candida infections are notoriously difficult to treat and remain a serious threat in hospitals worldwide. By showing that eosinophils, cells once thought to act mainly in allergies, also play a protective role, this research opens the door to new therapeutic strategies that could strengthen the body's natural defenses."This work changes the way we think about eosinophils," said the researchers. "Far from being only culprits in allergic disease, they may actually be allies in fighting dangerous infections."By defining a new CD48-Als6 pathway, the study points to future possibilities for therapies that boost natural immunity. Harnessing the protective potential of eosinophils could one day improve treatment for patients vulnerable to invasive Candida disease.

A groundbreaking study published in the peer-reviewed journal Music and Medicine demonstrates that intraoperative music therapy significantly reduces the amount of propofol and fentanyl required during laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed under general anesthesia. Patients exposed to therapeutic music also experienced smoother awakenings and lower physiological stress, as measured by decreased perioperative cortisol levels.

"These findings show that this is more than just simple background music, rather an integration of a novel intervention into anesthetic practice," said Dr. Tanvi Goel, principal investigator and anesthesiologist at Lok Nayak Hospital and Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi, India.

"By delivering intraoperative music, we're engaging the patient's nervous system even under anesthesia-blunting the neuroendocrine stress response when the body is most vulnerable," added Dr. Farah Husain, co-investigator and certified music therapist.

"The auditory environment under anesthesia is often neglected, but sound-when delivered with therapeutic intent-may accelerate healing, reduce stress, and improve recovery in ways we are only beginning to quantify," noted Dr. Sonia Wadhawan, Director Professor of Anesthesia and Intensive Care at Maulana Azad Medical College.

Key findings of the study include:

"This study adds to the growing empirical evidence that the neural effects of patient-preferred music translate to behavioral benefits," said Wendy L. Magee, PhD, Professor of Music Therapy at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance. "For people with disorders of consciousness following brain injury, patient-preferred music improves arousal and cognition. This research furthers the evidence that music with personal meaning enhances salience and emotional impact-maximizing music's neural effects and supporting recovery."

"This study shows the real potential of music to improve anesthetic care, but we must go further," said Joseph J. Schlesinger, MD, FCCM, Professor of Anesthesiology, Critical Care Medicine, Hearing & Speech Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "To truly understand how music affects the brain during surgery, we need multimodal EEG and a broader view of the perioperative sound environment that includes both patient outcomes and provider safety."

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772501422000264

These findings open the door for future studies to expand sample sizes, explore music therapy across general anesthesia for different types of surgery, and develop standardized music protocols that could be implemented in hospitals worldwide."

Youth opioid use is increasing in Canada, as are related emergency department visits and deaths, yet governments are not providing adequate support to address this public health crisis, argue the authors of a CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) editorial https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251682.

"If this crisis is not properly addressed now, Canada's health systems will play a part in perpetuating the opioid crisis for decades to come," write Dr. Shannon Charlebois, medical editor, CMAJ, and Dr. Shawn Kelly, a pediatrician and addictions medicine specialist, CHEO and the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario.

In Ontario, students' use of prescription opioid pain relievers for nonmedical reasons increased significantly from 12.7% in 2021 to 21.8% in 2023. Students in younger grades (7 to 9) were more likely to report use than older high school students (grades 10 to 12). Youth aged 15 to 24 made up 9% of emergency department visits in Ontario for opioid use, and opioid-related deaths increased 369.2% from 2.6 to 12.2 per 100 000 population from 2013 to 2021.

Paradoxically, youth struggle to access opioid agonist therapy, with evidence showing that fewer prescriptions are written even as the need increases. Other effective treatments, such psychological therapy and substance use disorder programs, are sparse, have long wait-lists, and are often privately funded, making them inaccessible to those most at risk.

"Health systems' inaction and lack of investment to provide evidence-based addictions services for youth is inexcusable, as the opioid crisis involves this population. Physicians who treat youth need support to be able to care for their patients with OUD [opioid use disorder]. Anything less represents complicity in the next decade of preventable deaths," they conclude.

Efforts to promote safer opioid prescribing in Canada appear to be having an effect, as new research in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250670 shows a decrease in opioid dispensing between 2018 and 2022.

In the early 2000s, use of prescription opioids to treat acute and chronic noncancer pain increased substantially in Canada, and with it came a rise in opioid-related harms. The availability of more opioid products, coupled with aggressive marketing of these drugs, contributed to these early increases in Canada and in other countries.

Many initiatives have been introduced with the goal of reducing these harms throughout the country, including policy changes, a focus on continuing medical education for evidence-based prescribing, and a national Canadian guideline for opioid prescribing published in 2017. 

With these changes, a need has emerged for national information on prescription opioid use in Canada and how this varies in different parts of the population. Researchers aimed to help fill this gap with a study of opioid prescribing in 6 Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec) between 2018 and 2022. The number of people newly starting opioids declined 8% during the study period, and the total number of people accessing opioids declined 11%. In 2022, across Canada, approximately 1.8 million people started an opioid to manage pain for the first time. However, the rate of opioid prescribing varied among provinces, ranging from 55 new opioid starts per 1000 people in Ontario to 63 per 1000 people in Alberta.

"The interprovincial variations in our findings may indicate differences in the implementation of prescribing guidelines, underscoring the need for coordinated national strategies and ongoing evaluation of their effects on patient outcomes," writes Dr. Tara Gomes, a researcher in the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network at St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, with coauthors.

Annual rates of new prescriptions were higher for females, older adults, and people living in lower-income neighbourhoods and rural regions. Codeine was most usually prescribed in most provinces, with the exception of Quebec, where people were more commonly dispensed morphine and hydromorphone. Oxycodone dispensing decreased over time, although in Ontario over one-quarter of opioids prescribed were still for oxycodone in 2022.

The authors caution that although lower rates of opioid prescribing may reflect doctors' efforts to ensure safe and appropriate prescribing, a balance is needed to ensure that people are not left without pain relief or cut off from medications without appropriate supports and coordination of care.

"Importantly, although these recommendations intended to promote safer opioid prescribing, improper implementation can lead to rapid dose tapering, abrupt opioid discontinuation, and reluctance to initiate patients on opioids when clinically indicated. In some cases, these changes have led to patients seeking access to opioids from the unregulated drug supply, which are inherently more harmful," write the authors.

The researchers suggest that clinicians engage in conversations with patients to ensure shared decision-making, and assess pain levels and ability to function.

"The truth is … that opioids are less effective and less safe than many care to admit," writes Dr. David Juurlink, an internist and researcher at Sunnybrook Research Institute and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, in a related commentary https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251666 praising the continued decline in opioid prescribing.

Opioids can be effective when carefully prescribed, particularly for short periods. But, with long-term use, their effectiveness can wane and they can harm patients in ways that are hard to appreciate.

"Most clinicians have seen how well opioids can work when first given," writes Dr. Juurlink. "But they are at their pharmacologic best in the initial days of treatment. Continue them for weeks, months, or years and the calculus becomes progressively less favorable."

Juurlink urges thoughtful prescribing, which "begins with recognizing that all patients in pain fall into 1 of 3 mutually exclusive groups: those not yet on opioids, those taking opioids chronically (sometimes called 'legacy patients'), and those with established addiction. The latter 2 groups overlap and are easily harmed by rapid dose reduction, but they can also be harmed by dose escalation. For such patients, when pain intensifies, nonopioid strategies are preferred. The first group, by contrast, has the most to gain from thoughtful opioid stewardship."

A team led by the UAB Institut de Neurociències (INc-UAB) has for the first time identified the mechanism behind a potentially fatal type of epilepsy, a symptom of mitochondrial diseases. The discovery, based on mouse models, challenges the traditional idea that these disorders are caused by a generalized energy deficiency and instead reveals a precise disfunction in specific brain circuits.

Mitochondrial diseases are a group of very severe disorders caused by defects in the mitochondria, the machinery in charge of producing cell energy. They affect approximately one out of every 4,300 births. Due to this low incidence, they are considered rare diseases, and therefore few resources are set aside for their research.Not all cells in the body are equally vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction: those with higher energetic needs tend to degenerate faster. As one of the organs consuming the most energy, the brain is one of the first to be affected and to a greater degree. In this sense, one of the most common and particularly severe symptoms is a form of epilepsy that does not respond to conventional treatments.

Now, in a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI), a research team led by the Institut de Neurociències of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona was able to further investigate this type of epilepsy. By using mice models of Leigh syndrome, one of the most frequent mitochondrial diseases, researchers were able to investigate specific brain circuits and the neural alterations causing it.Since epileptic crises involve excessive neural activation, the team worked on inhibitory neurons, known as GABAergic neurons (which release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA), with the hypothesis that perhaps these neurons were not functioning properly. The scientists suspected that the problem could stem from a loss of the brain's natural inhibitor control. “We posed the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction in the GABAergic neurons connecting two key regions of the brain, the external globus pallidus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), could be the reason for the hyperexcitability observed in this circuit”, explains Laura Sánchez-Benito, researcher at the INc-UAB and first author of the study.The team used two different Leigh syndrome mice models to test the hypothesis: the KO model, in which mitochondrial function is deteriorated throughout the entire body and most of the disease's symptoms are reproduced; and the cKO model, in which mitochondrial dysfunction only affects the GABAergic neurons of the GPe, allowing the isolation of the effects of this localized defect.Using advanced imaging, electrophysiological and genetic techniques, the team discovered that the GPe GABAergic neurons are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction, which led to their generalised degeneration. Since these neurons are in charge of keeping STN activity under control, losing them makes the nucleus become hyperactive, which produced recurrent epileptic crises in the animals.In contrast, when the team restored the GPe mitochondrial functions, the crises almost disappeared. The mice lived longer and showed a notable improvement in neurological functions.“We were surprised to see how the loss of only one inhibitory neuron population could spread through the network and trigger epileptic crises”, Laura Sánchez-Benito explains.

Our study demonstrates that it is not the whole brain that is propelling the crisis, but rather that restoring the function of these specific neurons is enough to drastically suppress this fatal form of epilepsy.”

Professor Albert Quintana, coordinator of the study, and researcher at the INc-UAB and at the Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, UAB

“Moreover, since the inactivation of STN with deep brain stimulation is already a therapy being used, this option could be considered for patients with Leigh syndrome”, he concludes.The study, conducted in collaboration with researchers from the Institut de Neurociències d'Alacant, the Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), and the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, opens up new horizons for patients with mitochondrial diseases who currently have no therapeutic options when it comes to treating their crises.

Qureight, a techbio company advancing the understanding of lung and heart disease through application of its AI-powered imaging and clinical data curation platform, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed study validating its Vascul8™ model for pulmonary vascular disorders, in the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology. The study demonstrated that the Vascul8 model provides accurate, automated insights into response to surgery for patients treated for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). These insights enabled the identification of patients at high-risk of residual pulmonary hypertension, reducing the need for routine post-operative right heart catheterization.

CTEPH is caused by the presence of chronic blood clots (chronic pulmonary thromboembolisms) in the arteries of the lung that do not fully break down. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) surgery is often carried out to remove the clots; however, patients can be left with residual pulmonary hypertension (PH) and require further intervention or treatment. The current approach to stratify patients at risk of pulmonary hypertension involves right heart catheterization (RHC), an invasive and resource intensive procedure, to measure pressure and blood flow in pulmonary circulation. The findings reported in this paper show we can effectively screen patients for residual PH, and therefore perform right heart catheterization only on those with high risk for residual PH, reducing the number of invasive, costly procedures.

Qureight's AI-powered imaging and clinical data curation platform and deep learning models identify key structural changes in the lung to assess disease progression. In this study, Qureight's Vascul8 model was used to analyse Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiograms (CTPAs) to quantify changes in blood vessel volume in patients with CTEPH following PEA surgery. Analysis with Vascul8 enabled precise vascular segmentation, including differentiating between arterial and venous blood volume, providing an objective, automated approach to identifying changes in vessel volume and predicting which patients are most at risk of residual pulmonary hypertension. This study demonstrates how Qureight's deep learning technology offers a more personalized, accurate and non-invasive approach to CTEPH treatment management, providing physicians with deeper insights into a patient's severity of disease and need for further intervention.

Joanna Pepke-Zaba, Consultant Physician, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Associate Professor, University of Cambridge, and lead author of the paper, said: "CTEPH has for a long time had a complex disease management pathway, requiring the subjective expertise of multidisciplinary teams. We are excited to have worked on this study where we show an alternative approach to imaging CTEPH and patient management, employing Qureight's imaging analysis model, Vascul8. This signals a major step forward in deploying imaging in severe and complex respiratory and vascular diseases."

Hakim Ghani, Research Fellow, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and first author of the paper, added: "Powered by Vascul8, automated quantification of lung blood volumes from CT scans can help identify patients with chronic blood clots who remain at risk of residual pulmonary hypertension after surgery. This AI-driven imaging approach could guide better treatment decisions, support more personalized care, reduce the need for invasive tests, and enable new endpoints in clinical trials - overall offering huge potential for patient benefit."

This study shows the promise of our deep-learning vascular biomarkers and demonstrates that our imaging platform can be used beyond fibrotic lung disease, in pulmonary vascular disorders such as CTEPH. This breakthrough establishes the foundation for future biopharma partnerships in pulmonary vascular disease, reinforcing our leadership position in regulatory-grade, disease-agnostic imaging biomarkers built for clinical and translational research, to accelerate drug development, enable smarter patient selection, and support precision medicine."

Lawsonia inermis is best known for making henna, a versatile dye that is used to change the color of skin and clothes. Now, researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University have found another use for the pigments extracted from the dye: treating liver disease.

Specifically, they could treat liver fibrosis, a disease that causes excess fibrous scar tissue to build up in the liver as a result of chronic liver injury caused by lifestyle choices such as excessive drinking. Patients with liver fibrosis have increased risks of cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer. Despite 3-4% of the population having the advanced form of the disease, treatment options remain limited.One potential treatment for the disease involves hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Usually, these cells maintain balance in the liver; however, when too many are activated, such as during liver injury, they produce excessive fibrous tissue and collagen, disrupting normal liver function.A research group led by Associate Professor Tsutomu Matsubara and Dr. Atsuko Daikoku at the Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University, developed a chemical screening system that identifies substances that directly act on activated HSCs. Using the system, they identified Lawsone, a chemical component from Lawsonia inermis - also known as the henna tree - as a potential inhibitor of HSC activation.When the researchers administered Lawsone, the mice that received the treatment showed reductions in markers of liver fibrosis, such as YAP, αSMA, and COL1A. They also found upregulated cytoglobin, a marker associated with antioxidant functions in HSCs, suggesting that the HSCs were reverting back toward the non-fibrotic, quiescent type.The professors believe that by making drugs based on Lawsone, they could create the first treatment that controls and even improves fibrosis.

We are currently developing a drug delivery system capable of transporting drugs to activated HSCs and ultimately hope to make it available for patients with liver fibrosis. By controlling fibroblast activity, including HSCs, we could potentially limit or even reverse the effects of fibrosis."

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) accounts for up to 10% of childhood cancers and nearly half of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas. While multimodal therapies have improved outcomes for low- and intermediate-risk patients, high-risk or metastatic cases still suffer poor survival rates below 30%. Existing treatments are often toxic and limited by drug resistance. Thiostrepton (TST), first isolated in the 1950s from Streptomyces azureus, has recently emerged as a promising anticancer agent due to its unique ability to inhibit tumor-related transcription factors and signaling pathways. Based on these challenges, it is necessary to explore thiostrepton's therapeutic mechanisms in rhabdomyosarcoma through comprehensive experimental research.

A research team from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China, reported (DOI: 10.1002/pdi3.70014) on June 29, 2025, in Pediatric Discovery that thiostrepton can significantly suppress rhabdomyosarcoma progression by targeting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Using bioinformatics screening of GEO datasets and connectivity mapping, they identified thiostrepton as a top candidate for reversing tumor-associated gene expression. Laboratory experiments confirmed its ability to curb tumor growth both in cultured cells and animal models, providing compelling preclinical evidence for repurposing thiostrepton as an anti-rhabdomyosarcoma drug.

The study combined transcriptome analysis and pharmacological validation to uncover thiostrepton's antitumor mechanisms. Researchers analyzed gene expression data from 84 tumor and 22 normal muscle samples, identifying 269 conserved differentially expressed genes and selecting thiostrepton via Connectivity Map scoring. In vitro, thiostrepton inhibited RMS cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 4.986-9.764 μmol/L. It also blocked migration and invasion, triggered G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis. In a xenograft mouse model, thiostrepton treatment (3.4 mg/mL for four weeks) substantially reduced tumor volume without damaging vital organs. RNA sequencing revealed that thiostrepton downregulated multiple oncogenic regulators, including AKT, JAK, and CDKs, while suppressing the PI3K-AKT pathway. Adding a PI3K activator partially reversed these effects, confirming the pathway's central role. These findings position thiostrepton as a multi-mechanistic inhibitor that disrupts cancer cell survival, signaling, and proliferation.

Our findings demonstrate that thiostrepton exerts broad-spectrum antitumor effects through a dual mechanism—directly impairing ribosomal protein synthesis and suppressing the PI3K-AKT signaling axis. This approach not only halts cancer cell growth and invasion but also minimizes toxicity, which is crucial for pediatric therapy. Given its well-characterized safety profile as a veterinary antibiotic, thiostrepton could be rapidly advanced through preclinical testing and adapted for combination therapies in childhood rhabdomyosarcoma."

Professor Xiao-Mao Tian, corresponding author 

The discovery of thiostrepton's efficacy opens new avenues for drug repurposing in pediatric oncology. By targeting the PI3K-AKT signaling network—a pathway commonly associated with tumor resistance—thiostrepton offers a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of existing treatments while reducing side effects. Future research will focus on evaluating synergistic combinations with mTOR or immune checkpoint inhibitors to overcome therapeutic resistance. If validated in clinical studies, thiostrepton-based regimens could become an affordable and safe alternative for managing aggressive forms of rhabdomyosarcoma, improving survival prospects for young patients worldwide.

Physical fitness, physical activity and screen time are associated with brain mechanisms underlying mental health and learning, according to two recent studies from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital. Research into the effects of lifestyle and physical fitness on adolescent brain function remains limited to date.

Our new findings highlight the importance of an active lifestyle, good physical fitness and moderate screen time for brain development in adolescence."

Hannamari Skog, Doctoral Researcher from the Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland

In the first study, participants' physical fitness and lifestyle habits were monitored from childhood. The researchers found that better physical fitness was associated with increased excitability and stronger inhibition of the motor cortex in adolescence - with excitability and inhibition regulating brain development and learning processes. The second study examined the associations of screen time and physical activity with brain function. According to the results, the amount of screen time is not the sole critical factor for brain development, but the way people engage with various digital devices also plays a significant role.

"Passive engagement with digital devices, such as scrolling on the phone or watching TV and videos, weakened adolescents' cortical inhibition, that is, the so-called 'braking system' of the brain," Skog says.

Conversely, active engagement with digital devices was associated with increased cortical excitability, as was participation in organised sports in sports clubs.

According to Skog, it is beneficial for adolescents to have access to organised sports:
"Besides supporting social well-being, participation in organised sports also seems to promote adolescents' brain health. Screen time should be kept within reasonable limits, and it should preferably involve digital media that stimulates activity and movement."

The studies, conducted as part of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study (PANIC) and the FitBrain study, involved 45 healthy Finnish adolescents aged 16-19, including 25 girls and 20 boys. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed via a direct maximal cycle ergometer test, muscular strength via a standing long jump test, speed and agility via a 10 x 50 metre shuttle run test, and upper limb coordination via a box and block test. Questionnaires were used to evaluate screen time and participation in organised sports, supervised exercise other than sports, and unsupervised physical activity.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, was used to measure, e.g., the brain's response to stimuli induced by a magnetic pulse, and the brain's ability to inhibit or suppress activity as needed. These measurements reflect excitatory and inhibitory brain function regulated by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA. These same neurotransmitters influence brain plasticity, and their dysregulation is associated with problems with attention, and with mental health disorders.

The findings were published in Neuroscience and in Frontiers in Neuroscience.

Treating chronic neuropathic pain with spinal cord stimulation may help prevent excess mortality associated with chronic pain, a new study from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital shows. The findings were published in Neurosurgery.

Chronic neuropathic pain is a difficult-to-treat condition affecting up to one in ten people. Most individuals living with chronic pain will have a good and durable response to treatment in the case of, e.g., neuropathic pain medications, or pain-targeting physical and occupational therapy. However, some patients end up on long-term opioid therapy, which is known to be addictive and associated with increased overall mortality. Moreover, chronic pain itself has also been shown to be independently associated with elevated mortality rates.

Spinal cord stimulation is a neuromodulation therapy for chronic pain, in which an electrode placed in the spinal canal delivers electrical impulses to the sensory tracts of the spinal cord, specifically the dorsal column. The device is powered by, and programmed via, an impulse generator implanted under the skin. Before permanent implantation, patients undergo a one-week trial period to assess their response to pain alleviation.

The study found that patients who did not respond to spinal cord stimulation had a higher mortality rate than the control cohort. A similar increase in mortality was observed among patients whose treatment was discontinued during the follow-up period. However, there were no differences in either group's causes of death, compared to the control cohort. These findings are consistent with previous research on excess mortality associated with chronic pain.

However, the study is the first in the world to show that patients who continued spinal cord stimulation throughout the follow-up period did not differ from the control cohort in terms of mortality.

This finding suggests that excess mortality associated with chronic pain can be avoided through successful pain management. As a pain management strategy, spinal cord stimulation differs significantly from long-term opioid therapy, which is addictive and increases mortality."

Researchers have discovered that people exposed to brighter light at night face up to 50% higher risks of heart disease, while daytime light may protect the heart by reinforcing healthy circadian rhythms.



Study: Light Exposure at Night and Cardiovascular Disease Incidence. Image Credit: Krakenimages.com / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers explored whether being exposed to light at nighttime is associated with a higher risk of developing heart disease, particularly for those of a specific age, sex, or genetic makeup.

Their findings indicate that people over 40 exposed to bright lights at night face higher risks of heart disease, including stroke and heart failure. Associations were larger in females for heart failure and coronary artery disease, and in younger participants for heart failure and atrial fibrillation, with no clear modification for myocardial infarction or stroke.

Healthy cardiovascular function relies on well-regulated circadian rhythms, which in turn influence vascular function, glucose tolerance, hormone levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. Disruption of these rhythms, through exposure to light or irregular sleep patterns, can elevate blood pressure and heart rate, increase inflammation, and reduce heart rate variability.

Animal studies show that prolonged circadian disruption can cause structural heart changes, such as hypertrophy and fibrosis. It worsens heart failure. Epidemiological evidence also links shift work, which disturbs these rhythms, to greater cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, and heart failure.

Light exposure at night is a key source of circadian disruption and has been linked to higher rates of coronary artery disease and stroke, as well as conditions like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, which are known cardiovascular risk factors. However, previous studies often relied on satellite-based measures of outdoor lighting or on small cohorts rather than on direct personal light-exposure data.

Using wrist-worn light sensors from about 89,000 UK Biobank participants, earlier research found that brighter nights were associated with higher cardiometabolic mortality and type 2 diabetes. Building on this, the present study examined whether individual day and night light exposures predict incident cardiovascular diseases over 9.5 years of follow-up.

This large-scale cohort study used data from UK Biobank participants who wore wrist-worn light sensors for one week between 2013 and 2016. Participants' light exposure was recorded continuously, processed to remove invalid data, and averaged into 24-hour profiles.

Factor analysis identified two main exposure periods: daytime (7:30 AM–8:30 PM) and nighttime (12:30 AM–6:00 AM). Participants were categorized into light-exposure percentiles, with the 0–50th percentile representing the darkest nights.

Cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease, were identified using hospital, primary-care, and death-registry records. Individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) were excluded.

Cox proportional-hazards models assessed the relationship between light exposure and disease risk, adjusting sequentially for demographic factors (ethnicity, age, and sex), socioeconomic variables (deprivation, education, and income), and lifestyle factors (urbanicity, diet, alcohol, smoking, and physical activity). Additional models were tested for potential interactions with genetic risk scores, age, and sex.

Researchers analyzed data from 88,905 UK Biobank participants, with an average age of 62.4 years and 57% female, over an average follow-up of 7.9 years. Participants were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline.

Nighttime light exposure showed a clear, dose-dependent association with a higher risk of heart disease, while daytime light exposure was linked to lower risks in minimally and socioeconomically adjusted models, but these associations were not significant after full lifestyle adjustment. When physical activity was excluded from the full model, inverse associations re-emerged for heart failure and stroke.

Compared with those in the darkest-night environment, participants with the brightest night exposure had significantly greater risks of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke after adjusting for lifestyle, demographic, and socioeconomic factors.

In contrast, an increase in night-light exposure by one standard deviation raised the risk of all five cardiovascular outcomes by about 5–8%. The associations were consistent across models and remained robust after adjustments. Sex and age showed selective modifying effects, with larger associations in females for heart failure and coronary artery disease, and in younger individuals for heart failure and atrial fibrillation, with no clear modification for myocardial infarction or stroke. Associations also remained after accounting for polygenic risk, suggesting gene–environment correlation is unlikely to explain the results.

This large prospective study demonstrates strong associations of higher nighttime light exposure with elevated cardiovascular risk, though causality cannot be inferred. The mechanisms underlying this association could include circadian disruption and sleep disturbance, leading to vascular and metabolic stress. Reduced melatonin secretion was not directly examined in this study.

In contrast, greater daytime light exposure may support cardiovascular health by reinforcing circadian rhythms.

Key strengths of this analysis include a large sample size, objective light measurements, and a long follow-up period. However, limitations include potential residual confounding, limited ethnic diversity (primarily White participants), lack of information on light sources, and the inability to infer causality. Sleep duration and efficiency were objectively measured and included in sensitivity analyses; short sleep partially attenuated some associations. Source information was unavailable, limiting the ability to adjust for behaviors correlated with light exposure.

Overall, these findings highlight artificial nighttime lighting as a potentially modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiovascular disease, underscoring the importance of maintaining dark nights and adequate daylight exposure in urban health strategies.

ZURICH (AP) — FIFA added another personal link to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100 million education project part-funded by 2026 World Cup ticket sales.

Ivanka Trump, tennis great Serena Williams, singers Shakira and The Weeknd, actor Hugh Jackman and soccer star Kaka are on the advisory board of the charity fund created by FIFA and the Global Citizen anti-poverty nonprofit.

“The board will provide strategic guidance to maximize the fund's reach and impact,” FIFA said in a statement. The project is split between grants awarded to grassroots education in more than 200 countries and the soccer body's worldwide schools program.

FIFA said $30 million is already raised toward the fund's $100 million target and will get $1 from each World Cup ticket sold. More than seven million spectators are expected to attend the 104 games in 16 host cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has joined President Trump on overseas trips this year — causing him to be late arriving from the Middle East for a soccer officials' congress in Paraguay in May — and been a regular visitor to the White House. 

A replica of the gold World Cup trophy sits in the Oval Office and President Trump is scheduled to present the original to the winning captain after the July 19 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

President Trump also should attend the World Cup draw on Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

Ivanka Trump has previous ties to FIFA. With her son Theodore, she took part on stage in FIFA's draw ceremony last December in Miami for the Club World Cup in the U.S. this past summer.

Grants of up to $250,000 from the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund can be applied for by “organizations providing access to education and sport for children in underserved communities around the world,” the soccer body said.

ZURICH (AP) — FIFA added another personal link to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100 million education project part-funded by 2026 World Cup ticket sales.

Ivanka Trump, tennis great Serena Williams, singers Shakira and The Weeknd, actor Hugh Jackman and soccer star Kaka are on the advisory board of the charity fund created by FIFA and the Global Citizen anti-poverty nonprofit.

“The board will provide strategic guidance to maximize the fund's reach and impact,” FIFA said in a statement. The project is split between grants awarded to grassroots education in more than 200 countries and the soccer body's worldwide schools program.

FIFA said $30 million is already raised toward the fund's $100 million target and will get $1 from each World Cup ticket sold. More than seven million spectators are expected to attend the 104 games in 16 host cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has joined President Trump on overseas trips this year — causing him to be late arriving from the Middle East for a soccer officials' congress in Paraguay in May — and been a regular visitor to the White House.

A replica of the gold World Cup trophy sits in the Oval Office and President Trump is scheduled to present the original to the winning captain after the July 19 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

President Trump also should attend the World Cup draw on Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

Ivanka Trump has previous ties to FIFA. With her son Theodore, she took part on stage in FIFA's draw ceremony last December in Miami for the Club World Cup in the U.S. this past summer.

Grants of up to $250,000 from the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund can be applied for by “organizations providing access to education and sport for children in underserved communities around the world,” the soccer body said.

The USWNT midfielder scored a brace in a 3-1 over Portugal on Sunday (26 October) to add to her growing reputation in football.

Earlier this month, Olivia Moultrie scored her first-ever professional football brace. Exactly 20 days later, she repeated the feat for her nation.

The 20-year-old played a starring role as the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) beat Portugal 3-1 on Sunday, 26 October, her first goal coming in the first minute, with the second following in the tenth.

Despite being given plenty of plaudits for guiding Emma Hayes's fresh-faced side to victory, Moultrie was quick to deflect and give them instead to her teammates.

“I think the U.S. has been known for a long time for starting fast and I think we definitely want to continue that,” she told U.S. Soccer at full-time.

“From the people who were on the field who started, to the people who came on, the bench… the energy. I really felt connected with my teammates tonight in all ways, and I feel like that is what allowed us to finish strong.”

Despite her young age, Moultrie is looking to establish herself in Hayes's side in the same way she has become a mainstay in the Portland Thorns in the National Women's Soccer League.

Such drive and determination come from one thing—the desire to be considered one of, if not the, best player in the world.

Born into a sporting family, becoming an athlete felt more like a rite of passage than anything else for Moultrie.

She had tried a handful of sports as a kid, basketball included, but as soon as she stepped onto the football pitch, it felt like home.

Encouraged by those around her, turning pro was a matter of when rather than if, despite being so young. The California native has always desired to be better than all those before.

“I want to be considered the best player in the world, that is what I'm striving for,” she explained in an interview with SoccerBible.

“Does that equal trophies? Of course. Does that mean winning with my club and country? 100 per cent. I don't know exactly where that will take me in terms of what teams I'll play for, but I know that's what I want.

“Every decision that has been made and everything I do is with that goal in mind.”

A self-proclaimed ‘type-A personality', Moultrie will not rest until the goals laid out have been checked off her list.

It is the one piece of advice she would give to aspiring players who may wish to follow in her footsteps: make a plan and stick to it.

“I wasn't planning on being a role model… for me, I just want kids to chase their dreams,” she continued.

“My one piece of advice is to set goals. Decide on the things that you want to be better at and create a plan for how to get there. Give me a list, give me something I've got to do and I'll finish it – that's how I approach the world.”

To become the best, you must learn from the best.

It's a motto Moultrie lives by, which makes sense given that the midfielder's footballing hero is Lionel Messi.

There is one aspect of his game in particular that Moultrie is modelling her own technique around: free kicks.

After netting one earlier this season, which also saw her become the leading teenage scorer in the league's history, she spoke of her admiration for the Argentine.

“I've watched Messi become too good at them, so I decided I want to add it to my arsenal,” she said in a half-time interview, as quoted by She Kicks.

“If I want to be the best, I want to learn from the best, and I try to apply that in every area of my life. I think he is arguably, at least one of the best at those in the entire world.

“I wanted to add another thing that made me dangerous.”

With her sights firmly set on similar greatness and a blueprint built on discipline, it may not be a question of whether or not Olivia Moultrie becomes the best in the world, but how soon she can cross it off her checklist.

Boston's host committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup believes that its ability to “stage a successful month-long event next summer is in ‘jeopardy'” if state legislators “cannot meet the committee's request” for $20M in funding, according to Michael Silverman of the BOSTON GLOBE. The committee “wants state funds for backup transportation plans, fan celebration events, and its own operations,” but negotiations over the state supplemental spending bill to date have resulted in $10M from the House and “nothing from the Senate.” Without the state funding, the committee “envisions scenarios that would cast a sizable pall over the course of the seven games” next June and July at Gillette Stadium. A lack of funding would mean a “backup bus system could not be implemented” if one or more of the 11 commuter rail trains running on game days between South Station and Foxborough “break down.” Extensive fan fest celebrations planned in the area “could be either drastically scaled back or eliminated.” Even if the state were to ultimately meet the committee's request for $20M, that amount still “trails support in other host cities.” The committee “estimates it will need” $20M from corporate sponsors for “operational costs and to meet FIFA-mandated stadium accommodations” (BOSTON GLOBE, 10/27).

FIFA began the process of selling another 1 million tickets for next year's World Cup on Monday, with the opening of a new ticket draw marking the start of the tournament's second phase of sales.

This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries — the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation.

The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live.

“We already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,” said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament's chief operating officer. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say ‘thank you' to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.”

Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Those slots will be issued through Nov. 15. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens.

Residents of the three host countries — the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order — purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10.




Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said.

FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year's World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. So far, 28 of the 48 spots for teams in the field have been filled.

The start of ticket sales doesn't take away from how there are unique questions for consumers heading into the tournament, particularly about how they'll get visas, if necessary, to visit the U.S. as the country cracks down on immigration. An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina — featuring Lionel Messi — and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown.

Based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches for the tournament around 16 North American venues. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.

Ticket data has shown that the lowest-priced seats — set at $60 — were available for at least 40 matches. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month.

Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer's biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.

We took Sunday off to just enjoy some other games and think about other things – but there's no dodging it forever, we need to break down Saturdays' defeat to Sunderland.

The Evening Standard have an interesting piece today which takes a bigger picture look at Chelsea's issues, and a lot of it we agree with.

“This is also a Chelsea team who, for all their youthful vigour, are struggling to contend with the impact of last season's congested schedule. The after-effects of the Club World Cup are already taking hold. Levi Colwill's serious knee injury on the eve of the season was the start rather than the end of Chelsea's injury issues.”

That's true, although at this stage it feels like fatigue is a bit of an excuse. Those players out on the pitch on Saturday had largely been rested in the midweek game. Many of them just had a fortnight of international break where they didn't play.

“Control and consistency are the two things they continue to strive for under Maresca,” they conclude.

We couldn't have put it better ourselves – although we've said similar things many times in the last year. The two qualities are closely linked. A team needs experience in order to exert control or achieve consistency, and Chelsea just don't have that experience.

Joe Cole was speaking on TNT Sport this morning, where he said that the Blues need two years to be title challengers. That's not something that will go down well with a lot of fans.

Cole had previously said he hoped that the Blues can go one better than last year by qualifying for the Champions League with a bit more of a cushion. Well, that's not looking likely right now.

AC Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri said he's hopeful to have Christian Pulisic available for a Nov. 8 match against Parma.

Pulisic has been sidelined since he suffered a hamstring injury on Oct. 14 while on international duty with the U.S. men's national team.

The 27-year-old has missed Milan's first two games out of the international break, with the Rossoneri defeating Fiorentina 2-1 before drawing Pisa 2-2 on Friday.

Pulisic has been a vital part of Milan's early-season success, with the club in third place and just one point back of the top of the table. The USMNT star has six goals and two assists in just eight matches this season, earning Serie A Player of the Month honors for September.

Speaking ahead of Milan's match against Atalanta on Tuesday, Allegri offered a potential return date for the American attacker.

“Absolutely not against Roma. We hope to have him on the bench against Parma," Allegri said.

Milan will face Roma on Sunday before playing Parma the following weekend in the club's final game before the international break.

That has led to another potential conflict between the USMNT and AC Milan, which was reportedly unhappy with Pulisic's usage during the October window.

According to MilanNews, Milan CEO Giorgio Furlani is in talks with U.S. Soccer, with the Rossoneri chief hoping to convince the American federation to not call Pulisic in for a pair of November friendlies.

It's not clear how U.S. Soccer would take such a request if Pulisic demonstrates he is healthy before games against Paraguay on Nov. 15 and Uruguay three days later.

The matches are the penultimate chance Mauricio Pochettino will have to see his side in action before he names his 2026 World Cup roster.

EAST HARTFORD, CT– The U.S. Women's National Team bounced back with an energetic 3-1 win over Portugal behind a lively performance from a young lineup in front of the second-largest crowd ever recorded for a USWNT match played at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field.

The U.S. promised a “fired up” response after dropping the first of a two-match set to Portugal last Thursday, Oct. 23 in Chester, Pa., and the group stayed true to their word to record the team's ninth win of the year. This time around, Olivia Moultrie played hero by scoring two goals in the span of 10 minutes, including the opener 44 seconds into the match, which marked the fourth first-minute goal of the year for the USWNT and the 21st in program history. Sam Coffey added a terrific late goal to ice the match for the U.S.

U.S. head coach Emma Hayes sent out a very young lineup with eight changes from the first meeting with Portugal three days ago with only defenders Avery Patterson, Emily Sonnett and forward Alyssa Thompson starting both matches. Sonnett, earning her 112th cap, sported the captain's armband for the third time in her international career. By herself, Sonnett out-capped the rest of the Starting XI, which combined for 100 caps at the start of the match.



Portugal had just one shot on target, and scored, making for five shots on goal over the two games and three goals, which were the first goals Portugal has ever scored on the USA.

The starting XI for Hayes averaged 19.2 caps entering Sunday and featured the three youngest players in camp, all teenagers: 18-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes, 19-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton and 19-year-old defender Jordyn Bugg. They were joined by two 20-year-olds, Moultrie and Jaedyn Shaw, who are the current and former highest-scoring teenagers in NWSL history. Defender Lily Reale and goalkeeper Claudia Dickey each earned the start and their third career cap.

For the second straight game, it took the U.S. less than one minute to open the scoring. On Thursday, it was Rose Lavelle who got things started with a goal 33 seconds into the match. This time, it was the youngster Moultrie, knocking in her third international goal 44 seconds from the opening whistle.

After the lightning-fast start, Portugal answered just a few minutes later. Jéssica Silva flicked a header into the far side netting off a Beatriz Fonseca cross from the right wing. It was the first goal conceded by Dickey in three matches after she recorded shutouts in her first two USWNT starts.

The deadlock did not hold long and in the 10th minute this young United States squad showed the resilience to break through and score the go-ahead goal. After the U.S. whipped the ball around the back, Yohannes locatedShaw making a run across the box. The midfielder's brilliant backheel teed up a shot on goal for Moultrie, and the 20-year-old delivered. With the well-placed strike into the left corner, Moultrie bagged her brace on the day, the second of her young international career, to put the home side back in front 2-1.

After a flurry of action and three goals in the opening 10 minutes, the match settled down for the remainder of the first half. Thompson nearly extended the lead for the United States in the 27th minute after some nifty footwork in a congested area, and her shot on goal caught a deflection to roll out of bounds for one of two U.S. corner kicks in the first half.

To start the second half, the United States nearly created another chance in the 49th minute. Yohannes, who played effective short and long passes all night, delivered a service from the U.S. defensive half to Thompson on the left. The speedy midfielder took her defender 1v1 then crossed a low ball into the box that Portugal nearly knocked into their own goal except for goalkeeper Patrícia Morais's dive to collect. Five minutes later, the U.S. nearly got there again after Patterson smartly pivoted the ball from Shaw on the right to Thompson on the left, but Thompson's shot attempt was blocked. In the 63rd minute, Hutton had a good look at goal from just outside the 18-yard box, but she drove her shot wide.

In the 69th minute, Hayes made her first changes of the day, sending Emily Fox to replace Patterson and Emma Sears for Thompson.

Moments after entering the match as a second-half substitute, Coffey scored the third goal of the day for the U.S. in the 82nd minute, connecting with Sentnor's pinpoint service off a corner kick. Coffey's first-time shot off a single bounce brought her international scoring total to five and extended the lead to 3-1.

The match marked a celebratory occasion for one of Connecticut's own, USWNT legend Alyssa Naeher. One of the greatest goalkeepers in U.S. and world history was honored for her remarkable career, which includes two FIFA Women's World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal and the third-most goalkeeper caps (113), starts (110), wins (88) and shutouts in program history. Those in attendance for Naeher's pre-match retirement ceremony included her family, friends and current Chicago Stars FC teammates who flew in for the day to support their laudable goalkeeper.

For the second year in a row, the USWNT teamed up with a U.S. Deaf National Team for a doubleheader in an effort to reflect the U.S. Way philosophy, which aims to prioritize strategic investment in U.S. Extended National Teams to ensure they are well-equipped to compete and succeed at the sport's highest level. The U.S. Deaf Men's National Team opened the day at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, home of the UConn Huskies, with a 3-1 win over Germany in the team's final tune-up before the Deaflympics in Tokyo, Japan in November.

Sunday's USWNT game was the second in a three-match set for the USWNT in the October FIFA window. Next, the U.S. will take the pitch on Oct. 29 in Kansas City, Mo. at CPKC Stadium for an international friendly against New Zealand.

USA – OLIVIA MOULTRIE, 1st minute: Ally Sentnor chased the ball down the right flank to advance the U.S. attack. Yohannes collected Portugal's attempted clearance, then played a short pass to Moultrie on the edge of the 18-yard box. A Portuguese defender blocked Moultrie's looped cross into the box, but the midfielder charged to clean it up and drilled a one-time strike from about 10 yards out into the lower left-hand corner to open the scoring. USA 1, POR 0

POR – JÉSSICA SILVA (BEATRIZ FONSECA), 5th minute: Francisca Nazareth swung the ball to Beatriz Fonseca on the right flank in Portugal's attacking third. Fonseca sent a cross into the box, and Silva's header drove into the far side netting to level the match. USA 1, POR 1

USA – OLIVIA MOULTRIE (JAEDYN SHAW), 10th minute: The U.S. held possession effectively, moving the ball quickly from one side of the pitch to the other. Yohannes arched a ball over the top to Shaw making a run inside the box. The midfielder collected the pass then backheeled a pass on a platter for Moultrie. The midfielder took a touch to put the ball on her left foot, then placed a driven shot that dinged off the left post and into the back of the net. USA 2, POR 1

USA – SAM COFFEY (ALLY SENTNOR), 82nd minute: Sentnor delivered a low, precise pass toward the penalty spot on a corner kick with her right foot. Coffey took the ball off one bounce and knocked it with a right-footed touch toward the left post. USA 3, POR 1 FINAL

Sargent and Adams in action Getty Images

It was a weekend of very contrasting fortunes for American players in Europe, featuring giddy highs at Bournemouth and steep learning curves in the Bundesliga.

Welcome to this week's USMNT Player Tracker.

It has rarely been better for Tyler Adams in England.

The USMNT star is one of the Premier League's best defensive midfielders at the moment, and his club, Bournemouth, is hitting new heights.

Despite selling some of their best talent again in the summer, the south-coast club have relied on ever-smart recruitment to recalibrate and go again in their indefatigable style under manager Andoni Iraola.

Now Adams, who missed the U.S.'s October international window as he and his wife expected their second child, can take double satisfaction from Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Not only did it push them up to second in the top flight, remarkably just four points behind leaders Arsenal, but he played a pivotal part in his team's second goal.

It was Adams who touched the ball forward as he burst past Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, and the England international could only drag down the 26-year-old as the ball fell to teenager Eli Junior Kroupi inside the Forest half. Kroupi drove forward 20 yards before firing his effort into the bottom left-hand side of the goal to make it 2-0 — and seal the win.



It's all the more impressive because Bournemouth had to effectively replace their entire back line during the transfer window, meaning Adams' experience and ability to screen the new unit has been needed more than ever.

Iraola will at least be pleased that Adams' quality is staying somewhat under the radar, because chances are richer clubs could start to sniff around him if he continues this form in USMNT colours this summer.

For now, though, Bournemouth and Mauricio Pochettino will be glad they have a model of consistency to call upon who, at 26 years old, can keep improving.

It's not been quite so upbeat for Josh Sargent at Norwich City lately.

The Canaries are usually in the Championship promotion mix but a woeful start to the season, cemented by Saturday's fifth consecutive defeat, left them second from bottom.

Manager Liam Manning is under pressure and the club's American majority shareholder Mark Attanasio is due to fly over to meet with the board this week.

For Sargent, who created Norwich's goal in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea City, and worked unselfishly to get his side back level, it might lead to a period of introspection. He decided against a summer move to Bundesliga team Wolfsburg after a deal had been agreed between the clubs, and could have been forgiven for hoping Norwich could finally engineer a Premier League return.



Of course, with much of the season to go, anything is still possible, but he could not have predicted such a difficult start.

Despite injury problems that required a groin operation, causing him to miss 14 league games, he scored 15 goals last season.

He started the current campaign in rich form, with five goals in four games, but since then Norwich's results have gone downhill and the 25-year-old's form has suffered.

It will likely compound his international frustrations. Sargent was left out of the most recent USMNT roster and is struggling badly for goals for his country, with his last in 2019.

If he is to keep in contention for a summer call-up, something has to give soon.

It hasn't been a barrel of laughs for Weston McKennie in Turin either.

After performing his annual trick of convincing another Juventus manager of his worth and getting back into the team, Igor Tudor was sacked on Monday after seven months in charge, with Massimo Brambilla — who coaches the club's reserve team Juventus Next Gen in Serie C — taking interim charge.

Juventus haven't won in five Serie A games, seven in all competitions, and while McKennie was getting the chance to settle into a midfield role (he was deployed often as a wing-back last term) it remains to be seen who will replace Tudor on a permanent basis and how that will affect the 27-year-old after Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lazio.

Things are cheerier for another USMNT midfielder. Aidan Morris' form remains strong and Middlesbrough are second in the Championship.

Morris had a strong game in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Wrexham at the Riverside Stadium. According to Opta, the 23-year-old completed the most passes (94) in the match, and won the most duels (eight). 

But things don't always go smoothly for young players thrust into the senior set-up in one of Europe's big leagues. Noahkai Banks has had some great afternoons this season at Augsburg in the Bundesliga, not least when he scored his first goal against Wolfsburg at the start of the month.

The 18-year-old has started his team's last three games, but Saturday was a tough lesson. Augsburg were thrashed 6-0 at home by RB Leipzig, and it was a difficult match for the entire home backline.

“Defensively, we didn't do well,” manager Sandro Wagner told the club's website. “Against a team with such individual quality as Leipzig, you get punished ruthlessly for that. Today we got a real slap in the face, but that's part of our development.”

Banks can only learn from what team-mate Robin Fellhauer described as a “brutal” game and will hopefully have the chance to bounce back when Augsburg play Bochum in the DFB-Pokal tomorrow.

In the Netherlands, it was a cheerier game for Sergino Dest at PSV. He was dropped from the squad after turning up late for a pre-game meeting ahead of their Champions League win over Napoli last week.

But manager Peter Bosz was willing to forgive him and restored the full-back to the team for their game at Feyenoord on Sunday. PSV won 3-2 and moved to level on points with their opponents at the top of the table.

Today's News

Sargent and Adams in action Getty Images

It was a weekend of very contrasting fortunes for American players in Europe, featuring giddy highs at Bournemouth and steep learning curves in the Bundesliga.

Welcome to this week's USMNT Player Tracker.

It has rarely been better for Tyler Adams in England.

The USMNT star is one of the Premier League's best defensive midfielders at the moment, and his club, Bournemouth, is hitting new heights.

Despite selling some of their best talent again in the summer, the south-coast club have relied on ever-smart recruitment to recalibrate and go again in their indefatigable style under manager Andoni Iraola.

Now Adams, who missed the U.S.'s October international window as he and his wife expected their second child, can take double satisfaction from Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Not only did it push them up to second in the top flight, remarkably just four points behind leaders Arsenal, but he played a pivotal part in his team's second goal.

It was Adams who touched the ball forward as he burst past Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, and the England international could only drag down the 26-year-old as the ball fell to teenager Eli Junior Kroupi inside the Forest half. Kroupi drove forward 20 yards before firing his effort into the bottom left-hand side of the goal to make it 2-0 — and seal the win.



It's all the more impressive because Bournemouth had to effectively replace their entire back line during the transfer window, meaning Adams' experience and ability to screen the new unit has been needed more than ever.

Iraola will at least be pleased that Adams' quality is staying somewhat under the radar, because chances are richer clubs could start to sniff around him if he continues this form in USMNT colours this summer.

For now, though, Bournemouth and Mauricio Pochettino will be glad they have a model of consistency to call upon who, at 26 years old, can keep improving.

It's not been quite so upbeat for Josh Sargent at Norwich City lately.

The Canaries are usually in the Championship promotion mix but a woeful start to the season, cemented by Saturday's fifth consecutive defeat, left them second from bottom.

Manager Liam Manning is under pressure and the club's American majority shareholder Mark Attanasio is due to fly over to meet with the board this week.

For Sargent, who created Norwich's goal in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea City, and worked unselfishly to get his side back level, it might lead to a period of introspection. He decided against a summer move to Bundesliga team Wolfsburg after a deal had been agreed between the clubs, and could have been forgiven for hoping Norwich could finally engineer a Premier League return.



Of course, with much of the season to go, anything is still possible, but he could not have predicted such a difficult start.

Morris had a strong game in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Wrexham at the Riverside Stadium. According to Opta, the 23-year-old completed the most passes (94) in the match, and won the most duels (eight).

DALLAS - The second chance to secure single-match tickets for the World Cup begins Monday, Oct. 27, when FIFA opens its Early Ticket Draw entry period.

Fans can enter the lottery to purchase single-game tickets via FIFA's ticketing portal from 11 a.m. Monday, Oct. 27, through Friday, Oct. 31, at 11 a.m. 

The lottery covers all 104 matches across 16 venues. According to a FIFA release, the governing body will randomly select applicants and notify them with a "dedicated time slot" to purchase tickets.

During this phase, fans can also apply to buy tickets based on a qualifying nation or for matches at a specific venue.

This lottery is the third ticket offering from FIFA and the second that includes single-match purchases. FIFA first released hospitality packages in August, followed last month by a single-game presale exclusively for Visa cardholders. That presale drew one million applications, according to the organization.

One final presale is scheduled after the FIFA World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5. Remaining tickets are expected to be released to the general public in what could be a final sales push. Despite many calling the initial ticket prices and fees exorbitant, FIFA's use of dynamic ticket pricing in these early stages does not appear to have deterred many hopeful buyers.

For instance, the least expensive ticket for the World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., starts at $2,030, with premium seats reaching as high as $6,730.

Earlier this month, FIFA defended its pricing, claiming dynamic pricing is standard practice and that market demand dictates ticket value.

The organization also stated that as a nonprofit, proceeds are reinvested to "fuel the growth of the game [men, women, and youth]" throughout FIFA's 211 member associations. FIFA added that 90% of its budget investments from 2023 through next summer's World Cup are directed back into the game to "significantly boost global football development."

FIFA officials also met with Dallas Area Rapid Transit leadership during the Red River Rivalry game to see how the DART system handles special events with a surge in riders.

The October international break is over, with the U.S. men's national team overcoming early deficits in a 1-1 draw with Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia. With eight months to go before we co-host the World Cup, some players (Diego Luna!) are clearly in the good graces of Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino. We're not talking about them right now. 

Rather, we're assessing which players are having trouble earning themselves playing time for Team USA under the distinguished manager and what they might be able to do about it between now and next summer.

The first USMNT goalkeeper since the early 1990s to need to spend money on hair-care products has fallen down the pecking order since stopping 11 shots in last year's 1-1 friendly draw against Brazil. 

He has an FA Cup winners' medal from last season with Crystal Palace, but Poch seems to prefer Matt Freese in Team USA's net. This is despite Turner getting regular playing time once again at his old stomping grounds at the New England Revolution. 

While that's undeniably better than being rooted to the bench at Lyon, if he doesn't see the pitch during this winter's friendlies, he'll have to be lights-out in MLS in the spring to play his way back into contention. Or he'll have to hope that Freese and New York City FC get considerably worse. Such is the life of a backup goalkeeper.

He played for Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur, which is why neutral observers felt like he'd be a mainstay when the coach got the top job with Team USA. They love him at Celtic, too, and yet Pochettino has given him sparing playing time for the Stars and Stripes. 

The stellar play of Chris Richards is undoubtedly a factor, yet even with Sergiño Dest's problems with injuries, discipline and defensive duties, CCV hasn't been able to see time on the right side of defense. He has experience playing as a right-back, too, but instead, Pochettino has been playing Tim Weah as the right wingback in his 3-4-3 formation. 

Now it turns out he has hurt his Achilles and will be racing just to be match-fit for the World Cup. We'll be monitoring the situation.

Carter-Vickers' Celtic teammate is also hurting for playing time. Maybe Pochettino is secretly a Rangers fan? 

Trusty's ability to play as a left-back makes him more likely to find a way back to a meaningful role, especially given Antonee Robinson's concerning fitness issues. It's still weird that he hasn't seen more action on the left side of Team USA's defense. Club teams are always looking to shore up their left flank, so maybe some English Premier League side (Brighton?) picks him up in the winter transfer window?

AC Milan has loaned the midfielder out to Atalanta, which at this point is actually a move up. The question is where he fits in Team USA's setup. The emergence of Tanner Tessmann in the middle of the park has made Pochettino play Weston McKennie as a wide forward and Tim Weah as a right wingback. 

The coach seems intrigued by Cristian Roldan in Team USA's engine room, too. Where does that leave the 2022 Young Male Player of the Year? Does he go back to playing as a forward? Maybe he plays there if Christian Pulisic can't go for the November friendlies? Or maybe he shifts to right wingback and Weah moves to a forward position? My head is starting to hurt. 

Fortunately, Pochettino is smarter about the X's and O's stuff than we are. We'll see what happens when Team USA faces Paraguay and Uruguay next month.

Fans turned out at Pratt & Whitney Stadium to watch the U.S. Women's National Team beat Portugal in a friendly match Sunday. Their performance gave thrills and inspiration for young girls in our state.

Excitement was in the air in East Hartford and young fans like Emma Hinckley, of Ellington, said seeing the women play was inspiring for her.

“It's helpful for me because then I can, like, do it in my games too,” she said.

There were many young soccer players taking it all in as they watched they watch the U.S. women's team beat Portugal, 3-1.

“It's crazy to see like your idols just like here on the field in real life, like they're actual real people. I'm this close to them in my state. Like, whoa, it's so amazing,” Caitlin Kristofak, of West Hartford, said.

Fans applauded the effort of the team.

“They made lots of good connections and passes,” Jordyn Hutchison, of Hartford, said.



But also tipped their hats to the Portuguese women for their effort as a team on the rise, contending with a U.S. that remains among the world's elite.

“Portugal has some speed,” Kristofak said.

For many, it was a chance to appreciate both teams and the continued growth of international women's soccer.

“I'm Portuguese, so Portugal game you've got to come to, and the U.S. women, too. You've got to see it,” Dan Reis, of South Windsor, said.

And see it they did as fans made sure to soak in the moment.

“Them being able to be this good at soccer is really inspiring,” Clara Guidos, of Guilford, said.

Boston's World Cup host committee believes its ability to stage a successful month-long event next summer is in “jeopardy” if state legislators cannot meet the committee's request for $20 million in funding.

 

The committee wants state funds for backup transportation plans, fan celebration events, and its own operations, but negotiations over the state supplemental spending bill to date have resulted in $10 million from the House and nothing from the Senate. 

“The bid contemplated funding from the state to make sure that the host committee was viable and we've proceeded on that assumption,” said Mike Loynd, CEO of the Boston 26 Host Committee. “We will have to go back to the drawing board and review our plans so that transportation, volunteer plans, fan communications for international travelers, and honestly, simple things like our website that promotes not only the event but our city will be in jeopardy.”

Without the state funding, the committee envisions scenarios that would cast a sizable pall over the course of the seven games next June and July at Gillette Stadium.

If one or more of the 11 commuter rail trains that will run game days between South Station and Foxborough break down, a lack of funding would mean a backup bus system could not be implemented. Extensive FanFest celebrations planned in Boston and around the Commonwealth could be drastically scaled back or eliminated. The committee itself could be stripped down to a baseline level of service.

In talks with Governor Maura Healey's office over the past year, the host committee came down from its initial $37.5 million request before the governor and committee settled on $20 million as the lowest it could go and still be viable with its own work, plus the transportation and fan celebration components.

Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, chair of the House Ways and Means committee, acknowledged the high-profile nature of the soccer expenditure that represents less than 1 percent of an entire budget.

He said that the book was not closed on revising the number upward. 

“We believe that the $10 million piece that was put into the House's version of the supplemental budget is a starting marker, given our fiscal constraints that we're facing due to the challenges related to the federal government's unreliability,” Michlewitz said last week. “The $10 million is something that we can potentially build upon going into 2026 later in the fiscal year, when we can revisit and see where we are from a fiscal stability standpoint — knowing full well that we want to put on a good show for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and for the city of Boston. Doing that certainly requires resources that the state should have a part in.”

 

Senate Ways and Means chair Michael Rodrigues said the State House did deliver $5 million in World Cup funds to the Department of Transportation earlier this summer.

“As a longtime fan of European football, and the Portuguese national team in particular, I am very excited to see Massachusetts host the 2026 World Cup, right here in our backyard,” said Rodrigues in a statement. “Earlier this year, the Senate proposed and secured $5 million to help support public transit associated with World Cup travel to Foxborough. I welcome future discussions about how the Commonwealth can continue to help the event be successful and look forward to having those conversations.”

While the $5 million that's dedicated to commuter rail infrastructure and service improvements is separate from the transportation portion of the $20 million request from the Boston 26 committee, a spokesperson said the committee was “hugely appreciative” of the allocation.

In a comment from her spokesperson, Healey reiterated that the initial $20 million request she and the committee asked for is the right path forward.

“Massachusetts is excited to host the FIFA World Cup and to showcase all that we have to offer to players and fans from around the world,” said the spokesperson. “This will have major economic benefits for our businesses and our state. Governor Healey appreciates the Legislature's consideration of her proposal.”

Even if the state were to ultimately meet the committee's request for $20 million, that amount still trails support in other host cities.

According to multiple news sources, Atlanta and Miami are each receiving $25 million in state funding; Philadelphia $36.5 million; Seattle $45 million; Dallas and Houston $50 million each; New York/New Jersey $87.5 million combined; and Kansas City $102 million combined from Kansas and Missouri. 

Ron O'Hanley, chairman and CEO of State Street Bank, is the honorary board chair of the committee.

With Boston organizers projecting 2 million visitors who will create more than $1 billion in economic impact, 9,000 jobs created, and $100 million in revenue, O'Hanley said in a statement to the Globe that in “getting it right,” a fully funded committee can pull off an event that will more than pay for itself next summer and beyond.

“I urge the House, Senate, and Governor Healey's administration to invest in bringing to Massachusetts the economic development associated with hosting the World Cup. This is a wonderful opportunity to benefit the citizens of the Commonwealth and position Massachusetts for future success on the global stage.”

Like the other 15 North American host city committees, Boston's is nonprofit and receives no funding from FIFA, the governing body of soccer. 

FIFA reported $4.76 billion in assets at the end of last year, with $483 million in revenues in 2024.

The Boston 26 committee derives funds from three sources: federal, corporate, and state.

Boston received $46.6 million from the federal government that is earmarked only for security. Organizers said the paychecks of police, fire, and EMS personnel will be taxed by the state.

The committee estimates it will need $20 million from corporate sponsors for operational costs and to meet FIFA-mandated stadium accommodations that include a new underground irrigation system for a new grass field, removal of seats to meet field size requirements, and replacing (or obscuring) every piece of stadium advertising with FIFA's corporate partners.

To date, besides O'Hanley, top executives from four other state-based entities ― Chris Davis of New Balance; Miceal Chamberlain, Bank of America Massachusetts; Martha Sheridan, Meet Boston; and Marcel Vernon Sr., Massachusetts Convention Center Authority ― have joined the honorary board as corporate partners.

 

 

It is the uncertainty over what the state winds up allocating monetarily that is causing the committee to bring awareness to its fiscal plight.

“We're living day to day as we wait for these funds to come in, and it's going to be really difficult for us if the state doesn't help,” said Loynd, who is well aware the World Cup is not atop the list of concerns for the legislators.



The event is expected to bring indirect revenue benefits far greater than the taxpayers' cost ― and boost the state's ability to stage future major sports events ― which Loynd believes make their fiscal calculations easier.

“I just don't believe that this one is really so much of a difficult choice as it is a win that won't take away from really important funding requirements,” said Loynd.

Chobani announced a multi-year partnership with the U.S. Soccer Federation on October 23, making the New York-based food company the Official Nutrition Partner across all 27 National Teams, including the U.S. Men's National Team and U.S. Women's National Team.

The deal also brings La Colombe Coffee, acquired by Chobani in 2023, into the partnership as the Official Coffee and Cold Brew Partner of U.S. Soccer. La Colombe will provide craft coffee to the U.S. Soccer community on game days.

Alex Morgan, the retiring U.S. Women's National Team player and two-time World Cup champion, filmed a video during her retirement ceremony to mark the partnership launch.

The partnership includes several youth-focused initiatives. Chobani Ball Kids will provide on-field opportunities for young players at U.S. Soccer events. The company will also support coach development pathways and the Soccer Forward Foundation, which provides scholarship grants to youth soccer clubs nationwide.

Chobani food scientists and U.S. Soccer growth experts will co-create a nutrition education tool for coaches. The resource will teach coaches how to incorporate nutrition values and lessons into their programs, and will be accessible through Soccer Forward's Resource Hub.

“This partnership with Chobani helps us take that impact even further by creating opportunities and investing in the next generation,” said JT Batson, CEO and General Secretary of U.S. Soccer.

Chobani will serve as a Founding Partner of the Arthur M. Blank National Training Center, the future home of U.S. Soccer. The facility will house all National Teams and technical departments under one roof, creating a centralized hub for athlete and coach development.

The training center is part of U.S. Soccer's broader plan to grow the sport and prepare for a significant period that includes hosting the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

The partnership arrives as U.S. Soccer continues its long-term growth strategy ahead of hosting two major international competitions. The Federation is focused on expanding participation at the grassroots level while strengthening its elite programs.

For Chobani, the deal represents its largest professional sports partnership. Founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya described the collaboration as an extension of the company's mission to make nutritious food accessible while building stronger communities.

“This partnership with U.S. Soccer is more than just a match or drills on the pitch, it's about nourishing potential, strengthening communities, and creating a future where everyone can move, grow, and dream,” Ulukaya said.

Chobani announced a multi-year partnership with the U.S. Soccer Federation on October 23, making the New York-based food company the Official Nutrition Partner across all 27 National Teams, including the U.S. Men's National Team and U.S. Women's National Team.

The deal also brings La Colombe Coffee, acquired by Chobani in 2023, into the partnership as the Official Coffee and Cold Brew Partner of U.S. Soccer. La Colombe will provide craft coffee to the U.S. Soccer community on game days.

Alex Morgan, the retiring U.S. Women's National Team player and two-time World Cup champion, filmed a video during her retirement ceremony to mark the partnership launch.

The partnership includes several youth-focused initiatives. Chobani Ball Kids will provide on-field opportunities for young players at U.S. Soccer events. The company will also support coach development pathways and the Soccer Forward Foundation, which provides scholarship grants to youth soccer clubs nationwide.

Chobani food scientists and U.S. Soccer growth experts will co-create a nutrition education tool for coaches. The resource will teach coaches how to incorporate nutrition values and lessons into their programs, and will be accessible through Soccer Forward's Resource Hub.

“This partnership with Chobani helps us take that impact even further by creating opportunities and investing in the next generation,” said JT Batson, CEO and General Secretary of U.S. Soccer.

Chobani will serve as a Founding Partner of the Arthur M. Blank National Training Center, the future home of U.S. Soccer. The facility will house all National Teams and technical departments under one roof, creating a centralized hub for athlete and coach development.

The training center is part of U.S. Soccer's broader plan to grow the sport and prepare for a significant period that includes hosting the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

The partnership arrives as U.S. Soccer continues its long-term growth strategy ahead of hosting two major international competitions. The Federation is focused on expanding participation at the grassroots level while strengthening its elite programs.

For Chobani, the deal represents its largest professional sports partnership. Founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya described the collaboration as an extension of the company's mission to make nutritious food accessible while building stronger communities.

“This partnership with U.S. Soccer is more than just a match or drills on the pitch, it's about nourishing potential, strengthening communities, and creating a future where everyone can move, grow, and dream,” Ulukaya said.

The U.S. avenged Thursday's loss behind a brace from Olivia Moultrie.

by



It was a tale of tens on Sunday afternoon in East Hartford, Conn., with all four goals scored in the U.S. women's national team's 3-1 victory over Portugal coming in the first and last ten minutes of the match. Setting the pace was 20-year-old Olivia Moultrie, who sandwiched a brace around an equalizer from Portugal's Jessica Silva in a packed first ten minutes of play. A late goal from Sam Coffey off the American bench sealed the victory in the 81st minute as the U.S. women's national team avenged an unexpected 2-1 loss to the visitors on Thursday. 





The start was eerily reminiscent of Thursday's match: a goal from Moultrie within the first minute of play on Sunday mirrored midfielder Rose Lavelle's opener 33-seconds into the first meeting between the two teams just days prior. But it wasn't just the outcome that was different Sunday night.

Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz will return to the Nitto ATP Finals to defend their title.

One year ago, the Germans made their team debut at Inalpi Arena. From 9-16 November, they will try to lift the trophy once again.

Krawietz and Puetz have shown consistency throughout the 2025 season and by doing so became the sixth team to qualify, joining Julian Cash/Lloyd Glasspool, Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic, Marcel Granollers/Horacio Zeballos, Harri Heliovaara/Henry Patten and Joe Salisbury/Neal Skupski in Turin.

The pair's two biggest moments of the season came in Halle and Shanghai, where they lifted the trophy. Krawietz and Puetz also made finals in Adelaide and Munich, as well as semi-finals at the Australian Open, Madrid and Toronto.

Krawietz has also competed in the Nitto ATP Finals twice with Andreas Mies and once with Horia Tecau. Puetz has only played in the season finale with Krawietz.

Rubin and fellow Tennis Channel Analyst Jan-Michael Gambill also tagged defending champion Coco Gauff as one to watch in Riyadh.ByDavid KanePublished Oct 27, 2025 copy_link

The 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh field is set and thoroughly stacked with the eight best players from the season, but who will ultimately lift the trophy? Tennis Channel Analysts Chanda Rubin and Jan-Michael Gambill argue the title could come down to a mix of conditions and mental toughness.🖥️📲 Stream Race to the ATP Finals and Race to the WTA Finals on the Tennis Channel App!“On these courts, when you're inside an arena and conditions are pretty standardized, it favors those clean ballstrikers,” said Rubin, a former Australian Open semifinalist, of the indoor event. “I kind of like that for Amanda Anisimova, but it's her first time making the tour finals. So, we'll see how quickly she gets used to just everything surrounding it. But she has been fabulous.”Anisimova will indeed cap a breakthrough season with a maiden berth at the WTA Finals, having reached back-to-back major finals at Wimbledon and the US Open. This fall, she captured a second WTA 1000 title of the year at the China Open, beating both two Riyadh rivals along the way in Jasmine Paolini and Coco Gauff.

This fall, she captured a second WTA 1000 title of the year at the China Open, beating both two Riyadh rivals along the way in Jasmine Paolini and Coco Gauff.

Gauff, who won the title last year in a three-set final over Zheng Qinwen, and Anisimova are two of four Americans set to compete in Riyadh, joining countrywomen Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys to make up half the field at the WTA Finals.“It's hard to bet against Coco Gauff with what we see her doing during this swing,” Rubin said. “She did it last year, of course, culminating with winning the WTA Finals. She has looked good. The serve seems more confident and that translates to the rest of her game.“Sometimes at the end of the year, it's also about mental toughness, and that's what Coco Gauff has in spades,” agreed Gambill. “That's why I do give her an advantage in situations like this, when it's the end of the year and everyone has played a lot of tennis. With so much on the line, that's Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini, two mentally tough individuals.”

Gambill was also high on Anisimova, who could land in a round-robin group featuring either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or No. 2 Iga Swiatek—but not Gauff, due to her Top 4 seeding.Another one to watch? Elena Rybakina, the eighth and final qualifier who sealed her spot with a six-match winning streak through tournaments in Ningbo and Tokyo to deny teenager Mirra Andreeva a WTA Finals debut.“Do not sleep on Elena Rybakina,” Rubin argued of the former Wimbledon champion, another clean ballstriker. “She withdrew from her last match; hopefully there's nothing lingering there, nothing major. She hasn't performed well at the WTA Finals in the past, so I think she's due for a good run.”The 2025 WTA Finals will begin on November 1, with the Top 2 finishers from two round-robin groups advancing into the semifinals and a championship match playing out on November 8.

While there were no shifts at all in the Top 13 of the race standings following last week's ATP 500 events in Basel and Vienna, that doesn't mean nothing has changed in the race, points-wise.First of all, the four players in the best position for the last four spots in Turin—Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Alex de Minaur and Lorenzo Musetti, currently No. 5 to No. 8—are now separated by just 160 points, with Fritz at 3,835 and Musetti at 3,675. Last week, that spread was 350 points.Second of all, the gap between that quartet and the rest of the field has grown this week, with Musetti now 480 points ahead of No. 9 Felix Auger-Aliassime. Last week, that gap was 340 points.Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is the only player who makes any move among the Top 15 this week, rising from No. 17 to No. 14 after reaching the final in Basel, where he fell to Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca.RACE TO THE ATP FINALS, TOP 15 (as of October 27th, players qualified in bold):No. 1: Carlos Alcaraz—11,040 pointsNo. 2: Jannik Sinner—9,000 pointsNo. 3: Novak Djokovic—4,580 pointsNo. 4: Alexander Zverev—4,560 pointsNo. 5: Taylor Fritz—3,835 pointsNo. 6: Ben Shelton—3,770 pointsNo. 7: Alex de Minaur—3,735 pointsNo. 8: Lorenzo Musetti—3,675 pointsNo. 9: Felix Auger-Aliassime—3,195 pointsNo. 10: Jack Draper—2,990 pointsNo. 11: Casper Ruud—2,825 pointsNo. 12: Holger Rune—2,590 pointsNo. 13: Daniil Medvedev—2,560 pointsNo. 14: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina—2,535 points [+3]No. 15: Alexander Bublik—2,470 points(Note: Draper and Rune, currently No. 10 and No. 12 in the race, have ended their seasons due to arm and Achilles injuries, respectively.)

All of the leading contenders for spots in Turin are in action in Paris this week, and with so many points up for grabs, anything can happen—Auger-Aliassime could even rise from No. 9 to No. 5, depending on how he and the four leading contenders ahead of him perform.The champion will earn 1,000 points, the runner-up earns 650 points, semifinalists 400 points and quarterfinalists 200 points, and so on.However, with three of the four players who have already qualified for Turin—Alcaraz, Sinner and Zverev—also in the draw, it's not going to be easy to earn the biggest of those points hauls this week.It's also worth noting that there's one more week of tournaments after Paris that counts towards Turin, though they're smaller tournaments—a pair of ATP 250 stops in Athens, Greece and Metz, France.Stay tuned to TENNIS.com for all the latest race updates this week, and stream ATP action this week on the Tennis Channel App!

Joao Fonseca had a breakthrough week in Basel last week, going all the way to the first ATP 500 title of his career, the biggest title a Brazilian man has won since Gustavo Kuerten won Cincinnati in 2001.And today, Fonseca makes a big breakthrough on the rankings, soaring from No. 46 to a new career-high of No. 28, shattering his previous high of No. 42 for his simultaneous Top 40 and Top 30 debuts.With that leap, at just 19 years old, he's already the fifth-highest-ranked Brazilian player in ATP rankings history, which dates back to 1973, and just the seventh Brazilian player overall to crack the ATP Top 30.HIGHEST-RANKED BRAZILIAN PLAYERS IN ATP RANKINGS HISTORY:Gustavo Kuerten, career-high No. 1 [December 2000]Thomaz Bellucci, career-high No. 21 [July 2010]Thomaz Koch, career-high No. 24 [December 1974]Fernando Meligeni, career-high No. 25 [October 1999]Joao Fonseca, career-high No. 28 [October 2025]Luiz Mattar, career-high No. 29 [May 1989]Marcos Hocevar, career-high No. 30 [June 1983]Fonseca will try to continue his climb up the rankings this week at the Masters 1000 event in Paris, where he'll be making his career debut.

Jannik Sinner didn't just leave Vienna with the trophy this year, but also a haul of 500 ranking points that keeps him in the running for year-end No. 1. But there was one more thing—the champion's paycheque, and that paycheque has pushed him past a very big milestone.Sinner has now surpassed $50 million dollars in career prize money, going into Vienna with $49,591,462 and leaving it with $50,460,897.The 24-year-old Italian is just the eighth player in either ATP or WTA history to hit that number, and the second player born in the 2000s to do it, after Carlos Alcaraz, who surpassed it after the US Open.PLAYERS TO HIT $50M IN CAREER PRIZE MONEY IN ATP OR WTA HISTORY:Novak Djokovic: $191,117,423Rafael Nadal: $134,946,100Roger Federer: $130,594,339Serena Williams: $94,816,730Andy Murray: $64,687,542Alexander Zverev: $55,662,085Carlos Alcaraz: $54,725,285Jannik Sinner: $50,460,897

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix

Charles Leclerc followed up his podium in Austin with another visit to the rostrum at the Mexico City Grand Prix, the Ferrari driver fending off Max Verstappen to take P2.

Charles Leclerc was thrilled to claim a second podium in as many weekends at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with the Monegasque admitting that the result came as a “surprise” on a day in which Ferrari overtook Mercedes for P2 in the Teams' Championship.

Having lined up in second place on the grid, Leclerc was one of four cars to enter Turn 1 vying for the lead as the race got underway. While he had to settle for second behind McLaren's Lando Norris, that position came under threat later in the 71-lap event when Max Verstappen chased him down, setting up a thrilling battle in the final moments.

Despite the Red Bull driver's charge – which was slightly interrupted amid a Virtual Safety Car phase during the closing stages – Leclerc was able to hold onto P2, marking another visit to the rostrum after his P3 result one week ago in Austin.

“Very happy with this weekend,” the 28-year-old said after the chequered flag. “United States was very positive for us but we didn't know what to expect for this weekend, and to end up again on the podium is a great surprise. Very happy to be on this amazing podium once again.”

Reflecting further on how he managed his medium tyres to the end in his fight with Verstappen, Leclerc added: “I was quite happy about the [Virtual] Safety Car at the end. My tyres were completely gone and I could see Max was coming back on the softer tyre, so it was tough. I think the [Virtual] Safety Car saved me at the end.”

Sharing more of his thoughts on the race later on, Leclerc also looked back to the eventful start of the Grand Prix.

“I hated every metre of that first corner!” the eight-time race winner laughed. “There was the start, which wasn't a great one – strangely that kind of helped me because I don't think Lando would have come back to the right if I had a good start, so luckily I could have a slipstream.

“But then after that I was just a passenger trying to defend my place. I think Lewis [Hamilton] didn't especially know that there was Max on the outside of me and that created… everything was super, super tight. But luckily my race or Lewis' race didn't end up here because I really thought it would.”

Four race weekends remain in the 2025 season, the next being the Sao Paulo Grand Prix on November 7-9.

Pushed on whether his back-to-back podiums give some extra confidence entering into those final events, Leclerc answered: “Yeah, I think we are doing a really good job at extracting every single bit out of this car.

“In the last two weekends I don't think we've got anything to be angry about – I think we really did everything we could. The potential of the car remains the same and we know that in the development race we stopped earlier than the others to focus on next year, but I think we are doing a really good job with what we have.”

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix

Max Verstappen came home in third in Mexico, as McLaren's Lando Norris sealed a dominant victory while also taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship.

Red Bull's recent flurry of form, which has brought Max Verstappen roaring back into championship contention, came up short in Mexico.

The RB21 had nothing like the pace of Lando Norris' dominant McLaren, in sharp contrast to recent races, and Verstappen had a tough battle on his hands just to finish third, around half-a-minute behind Norris. What was it about the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit which brought the Red Bull up short?

Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” crowns the Billboard Hot 100 for a third week.


	The superstar's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, concurrently adds a third week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, following its modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million equivalent album units two weeks earlier.


	Thanks to the set and the song, Swift makes more history. Two weeks ago, she logged the 17th instance of an artist launching atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously. It marked the record seventh time that she earned the honor (which she inaugurated in August 2020 with Folklore and “Cardigan”). In only two of the first 16 such double debuts, an album and song tallied a second consecutive week atop the charts — both by Swift, via Midnights and “Anti-Hero” in 2022 and The Tortured Poets Department and “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, in 2024.


	Now, The Life of a Showgirl and “The Fate of Ophelia” make for the first occurrence of an artist debuting atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 side-by-side and both titles maintaining their respective commands for their first three weeks.


	Meanwhile, two acts earn their first Hot 100 top 10s: Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” bounds 17-8 and Leon Thomas' “Mutt” charges 18-10.


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Nov. 1, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Oct. 28. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Plus, for all chart rules and explanations, click here.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.






	“The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift's 13th career Hot 100 No. 1, drew 33.6 million official streams (down 31%) and 49.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 17%) and sold 6,000 (down 42%) in the United States Oct. 17-23.


	The single secures a third week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart and a second week atop Digital Song Sales and holds at its No. 5 high on Radio Songs.


	Swift scores four songs in the top 10 of the latest Hot 100, all from The Life of a Showgirl, following her eight top 10s a week ago and all 10 songs in the region the week before:




	Swift achieves her record-breaking seventh career week with at least four of the Hot 100's top 10 (all since 2022), one-upping Drake (six, 2018-23). Kendrick Lamar (2022-25) and The Beatles (1964) follow with five such weeks each.


	Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” surges 17-8 on the Hot 100 (besting its prior No. 12 peak). The song drew 14.3 million streams (up 1%) and 17 million in airplay audience (up 36%) in the tracking week.


	The track became the English singer-songwriter's first Hot 100 hit in September and topped the Official UK Singles chart for a week earlier in October.


	“Every day, I'm being told a new stat,” Dean recently said to Billboard with a chuckle. “I've been putting out music for quite a long time, so it's a bit of a new world for me.”


	Leon Thomas' “Mutt” sprints 18-10 on the Hot 100 (after reaching a previous No. 11 high), with 7 million streams (up 2%) and 59.7 million in radio reach (up 1%).


	With “Mutt,” Thomas unleashes the third-longest trip to the Hot 100's top 10 — 38 chart weeks — in the list's 67-year history (tying three other titles). The only hits to complete longer journeys: Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” (42 weeks, 2021) and Bailey Zimmerman's “Rock and a Hard Place” (41 weeks, 2022-23).


	While Thomas earns his first Hot 100 top 10 as a recording artist, “Mutt” is his fourth as a writer and producer. He earned his first three top 10s in the latter two fields via Drake's “In the Bible,” featuring Lil Durk and Givēon (No. 7, 2021), and “Love All,” featuring Jay-Z (No. 10, 2021), and SZA's “Snooze” (No. 2, 2023).


	“Mutt” rules the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for an 11th week and Hot R&B Songs for a 28th week.


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, rises 3-2, following eight weeks at No. 1 beginning in August.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which led the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, pushes 4-3, while topping Radio Songs for a 19th week, up 1% to 79 million in audience — a new weekly best for the track.


	Plus, Justin Bieber's “Daisies” jumps 15-7 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 2, and Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” climbs 16-9, after reaching No. 7. The latter leads the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a third week.

The businesswoman made it clear that "some of the most beautiful women in the world and men in the world are trans."

	At this point, Hailey Bieber is used to seeing insults about her online, but in a new interview, she pointed out there's one particular brand of disparaging comment that she just doesn't understand.


	Appearing on Owen Thiele's In Your Dreams podcast on Friday (Oct. 24), Bieber began talking about rude comments shared about her online, saying that one particular type of comment never made much sense to her. “When people are trying to be mean, they're like, ‘She looks trans.' And I'm like, ‘Why do you think that's a diss?'” Bieber asked. 

	











	The beauty guru continued, pointing out that those transphobic lines of “attack” only make her feel better about herself when she reads them. “As if being trans is a diss, some of the most beautiful women in the world and men in the world are trans. So I just don't take that offensively at all.”


	Bieber is just one of a number of celebrities who have been exposed to “transvestigation,” an online trend in which users create conspiracy theories that cisgender public figures are secretly trans, presenting pseudo-scientific “evidence” based on their physical appearance in photographs. LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD has classified “transvestigation” as a hate term, pointing out examples including campaigns against Olympic boxer Imane Khelif and French first lady Brigitte Macron that have resulted in real-life consequences.

	











	Elsewhere on the podcast, Hailey also chatted with Thiele about whether or not she and her husband, Justin Bieber, were talking about having more kids since the birth of their son, Jack Blues, in August 2024. “I know I want more than one, but I'm not in a rush,” she said. “I always knew I wanted to be a mom, though … The older I've gotten and now that I have a kid, I think any decision anyone makes about having them or not having them is totally amazing.”

	Long before Ben Stiller became a key figure in the screen-comedy boom of the 1990s, a top-notch director, an Emmy-winning TV producer, and the man who convinced Tom Cruise to yell “take a step back and literally fuck your own face” while wearing a fat-suit, he was Jerry and Anne's kid. Meet the Stillers: There's the guy who's given the world Severance, Zoolander, and a general phobia of zippers.  of course. There's his sister, Amy Stiller, a stand-up comic who wrote a one-woman show about being “the only nonfamous person in a very famous family.” There's Ben's father Jerry, a prolific character actor probably best known for playing Frank “Serenity Now!” Costanza on Seinfeld. And there's Ben's mother Anne Meara, who wrote plays, acted in everything from TV sitcoms to Shakespeare in the Park productions, and always preferred her son's more serious work to his broader, big-budget laugh riots.


	Because Meara never wanted to become one half of a world-famous duo that would play The Ed Sullivan Show close to 40 times and helped revolutionize how gender dynamics worked in mid-20th century comedy acts. She aspired to be the second coming of Sarah Bernhardt, or the 1950s equivalent of Meryl Streep. But then this tall “Irish princess from Long Island” met Jerry Stiller, a short Polish-American Jew from the Lower East Side, and he immediately realized that, in addition to being gorgeous and strong-willed, his future wife was also hilarious. Jerry convinced Anne to help him craft a double act that made the most of their different backgrounds, different heights, different personalities, and different perspectives on life. And soon after that first appearance on the Sullivan show, Stiller & Meara became a household name, a constant presence on talk shows and the club circuit, and beloved by many. Including Ben and Amy, who found they were vying with millions of Stiller & Meara fans for their parents' attention.

	











Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost (now streaming on Apple TV) starts out as something like a memorial, with Ben and his sister returning to the Manhattan apartment on 84th and Riverside that they grew up in. Meara died in 2015; Jerry passed away five years later. Their kids have come to clean the place up, put it on the market and say goodbye. This was where they were raised, where the future Reality Bites director would goof around with the other kids in their building and shoot their escapades with a Super 8 Canon his dad bought him. You can never truly go home again, but you can sit on the couch where you once watched your parents' performances on television and sift through a lifetime's worth of photos, old letters, scripts and scrapbooks.

	Ben, however, decided to bring cameras along to capture everything — “it was my first instinct,” he admits, “because that's what my dad always did.” The elder Stiller was an amateur auteur with a bit of a hoarder's mentality when it came to documentation, constantly filming home movies of his kids. He also incessantly taped private conversations and professional improvisations with his wife-slash-comedic partner, both of which would figure in their bits. “Where does the act end and the marriage begin?” Meara asks, complicating the matter further by wondering this inquiry aloud while the two of them are chatting with Mike Douglas on his daytime show. It wasn't that the line between the life and work were blurred. It was more like: What do you mean by “line?” 


	This was the old normal for Ben, a comfortable innie-outie melding of creative and family lives, until it wasn't — and isn't. And here's where Nothing Is Lost gets really knotty, extremely meta, and very, very interesting. Stiller could have kept this at the level of a fond look back, with him and Amy reminiscing about their late, great folks, and honoring the groundbreaking work they did. Remember the classic “computer dating” sketch? And the one about the last two people on Earth, except y'know, she's not really feeling his repopulating vibe? You'll get to see those vintage clips, along with a lot of ready-for-primetime banter and the many times that young Benji and Amy were paraded for studio audiences and encouraged to be precocious for laughs. There are more polyester outfits per capita than any other celebrity-directed doc this year. A nostalgia festivus for the rest of us!

	Then those cameras get turned on the person behind them, and we see how maybe growing up in a family in which Mom and Dad were famous, and constantly having intense arguments behind closed office doors that might be real or merely rehearsals, had its share of setbacks. The dynamic between Anne and Jerry fed their act and also fueled their IRL problems, like her excessive drinking and his need for attention. They loved each other. Also: ambition and restlessness mixed with animosity and resentment. (“I was a good actress before I met you,” Meara says at one point to her spouse, and that's maybe only the seventh most brutal exchange you hear in the film.) Both kids were clocking everything, and absorbing a few lessons that would help and hinder them down the line.

	It isn't inevitable that people become their parents, or some version of them spiced with a number of natural personality quirks mixed in with the wonderful-to-warping effects of nurturing. But when Ben starts hearing from his own kids about how he wasn't around as much as they wished, and how fatherhood may have taken second place to his career, you start to see how the complaints he had about his parents are now being echoed back to him. The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, etc. Stiller and his wife Christine Taylor had separated from each other in 2017, before getting back together several years later (thank you for at least one thing, Covid!). How much the conversations we see between them about his need to succeed, and the mindset he replicated from Mom and Dad after they view old footage together, contributed to the marital healing process is purely speculative. But you can guess the percentage is larger than zero.


Nothing Is Lost takes its subtitle from Jerry, who's talking to his father on tape and waxing poetic about why he pathologically tries to capture even the most mundane parts of life in media amber. By the end, the resonance of naming the movie after that remark takes on more layers than a seven-year-old Benji Stiller sliding down a snowy hill in Central Park. What starts off as a tribute turns into an autopsy of a long marriage as seen by the kids who witnessed the best and worst of it, done with humor, anger, hindsight, and empathy. Then it makes a hard left and examines the way that legacies, even ones with the best intentions, have a way of shaping us and sometimes setting us back and always, always leaving us with lessons to repeat or refute. Perhaps nothing truly is lost. What's more important is that when it comes to family, all — or at least as close to all as possible — is eventually forgiven.

After teasing her first new song in two years with sheet music and a clip of a black-clothed orchestra following her down a street, Rosalía has finally shared “Berghain”—the lead single for her upcoming new album, Lux. The song features Björk and Yves Tumor and comes with a music video directed by Nicolas Méndez in which the orchestra follows Rosalía as she goes about her day. Check it out below.

Lux is out November 7 via Columbia. Rosalía recorded her fourth studio album with the London Symphony Orchestra, as conducted by Daníel Bjarnason, and executive-produced it herself. Lux is split into four movements, and joining Rosalía for select contributions are Björk, Yves Tumor, Portuguese fado singer Carminho, Spanish flamenco artist Estrella Morente, Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz, Washington-based trio Yahritza, and the boys choir Escolania de Montserrat i Cor Cambra Palau de la Música Catalana.

Motomami, Rosalía's third studio LP, came out back in 2022. In the years since, Rosalía has shared “LLYLM,” “Tuya,” “Beso,” “Oral,” “New Woman,” and “Omega.”

“Man on the Run,” Oscar winner Morgan Neville‘s new documentary about Paul McCartney, is not a film about The Beatles. In fact, the story begins the day The Beatles broke up.

In the first teaser for “Man on the Run,” which IndieWire shares exclusively, we hear from McCartney in late 1969 as he begins to wonder what in the world he will do now, and how he can ever live up to anything as good as The Beatles ever again.

“Wings was part of it, but it's really the story of this person who has been on this ride to outer space with The Beatles. He's been doing it since he was 17. He's never known anything else in his adult life, and he has to figure out everything from scratch,” Neville told IndieWire in one of his first interviews discussing the film.

“Man on the Run” premiered at Telluride this fall and was acquired by Amazon MGM prior to the festival. As announced today, the film will be released in theaters on February 18, 2026 and will then drop on Prime Video for streaming on February 27. Neville also revealed exclusively to IndieWire that alongside the film's release will be a new soundtrack for the documentary of Paul McCartney and Wings music.

 










Neville's film highlights McCartney's 1970s, when he began the decade living reclusively on a farm away from the press and speculation about The Beatles. It charts his years-long legal battle with American record producer Allen Klein over The Beatles' music and fortune, how he navigated the perception that he was the one who broke up the band and rumors that he was actually dead, and how he managed to mature from a Liverpool lad into a family man building a life with his first wife, Linda McCartney.

But most significantly, it's a movie about the music. Neville takes us on a journey through how McCartney recorded his intimate, stripped-down solo records like “McCartney” and “Ram,” which were panned by critics in their day, and eventually made it back to the top of the pop charts with Wings for records like “Band on the Run.”

“We talk about how Paul himself has been coming to terms with what this music means over time, because at the time, a lot of this stuff was very painful for him,” Neville said. “Paul takes a lot of licks in the film. There's a lot of stuff happening where it's not working for him. I think Paul now is still processing and still figuring out how he feels about all this, trying to separate what was often painful at the time from how this music has endured. Having just spent years doing a deep dive through this catalog, it's amazing the amount of incredible work he did through this decade.”

 










Neville said that part of what makes McCartney such a creative genius is that he's a “deeply instinctual creator,” one who embraces whatever he's feeling when something sparks. Sometimes that produces “Maybe I'm Amazed” or inspires him to travel to Africa to record “Band on the Run,” and other times, it has him recording a rendition of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” or an Old Hollywood-style musical special alongside a cartoon mouse.

“He just makes stuff, and some of it is fantastic and some isn't, but I don't think he's there to judge himself,” Neville said. “I think he's there to make stuff, and I actually find that really inspiring as a creative person, just that ability to not worry about the judgment too much.”

Neville began conducting interviews with McCartney and other members of Wings and his family around four years ago, and the resulting film is as remarkably edited and comprehensive as any of Neville's recent biographical docs, including the two-part Steve Martin documentary, the Mister Rogers film “Won't You Be My Neighbor?,” and his Anthony Bourdain doc “Roadrunner.” But if “Man on the Run” is still not enough McCartney content for fans, there's a book about Wings arriving soon that draws from some of Neville's interviews.

Neville manages to squeeze some truly intimate anecdotes out of McCartney, who is as widely documented and interviewed as any public figure alive. In “Man on the Run,” McCartney reveals his inner thoughts from when he was in jail in Japan for marijuana possession, potentially facing up to seven years of hard labor, and a story of how he nearly drowned after swimming at a treacherous cliffside resort.

 










But what you will not see in “Man on the Run” is the now 83-year-old McCartney on camera. Neville made the conscious decision to only include audio interviews of McCartney in the film, and it makes “Man on the Run” that much more vital as a biographical documentary as a result.

“What you get from being audio-only is [that] it becomes a present-tense story. It feels like you're living through it as it happens, as opposed to cutting to a much older person reflecting back on when they were young,” Neville said. “One thing Paul said when we discussed it, he said, ‘I don't really want to be an old person in a young person's story.'”

Chip and Joanna Gaines are easily HGTV's biggest success story, going from the 2013 airing of a pilot for what would become their hit show, “Fixer Upper,” to overseeing their own empire a dozen years later. 

But the couple experienced some incredibly lean years, they shared during an October 2025 appearance on the “How I Built This Podcast” with Guy Raz, revealing that they flirted with filing for bankruptcy as they struggled to make their home flipping business profitable. 

Joanna admitted, “That was a rough 3 to 4 years of just every day, we were like, ‘Is this where we do the bankruptcy thing?'”

Married in May 2003, the couple juggled two businesses at first. Chip was doing his best to get his home renovation business off the ground while Joanna ran a little gift and decor shop called Magnolia in Waco, Texas. 

She shared on Raz's “How I Built This” podcast that after doing the math, her goal at the shop was to make $250 a day to make ends meet for their family. But by 2006, already parents to two of their five kids, she closed up the shop to focus on being a mom and helping Chip design homes. 

“I felt like I was letting go of my dream,” she admitted, “(but) it was a God moment where I was like, ‘If I let this go, is it gone forever?' And I'll never forget, as I was turning the key for the last time as I locked the door on the last day it was open, I felt like God said, ‘It's gonna come back in a way bigger way because of your trust.'”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

By letting go of Magnolia — which would eventually become their multimillion-dollar brand — and helping design the homes that Chip was flipping, Joanna said they realized they made a great team. 

“For us (working) together, that's where the magic hit,” Joanna told Raz, but that didn't mean their house flipping business took off right away. 

When the financial crisis of 2008 arrived, things looked dire. Joanna explained they had just decided to move from flipping one to two homes at a time to buying a six-acre plot of land where they'd build 38 “patio homes.” 

With four kids under four and the housing market spiraling, Chip recalled, “We were in trouble … but because of our naivety, we didn't even know you could file bankruptcies, so that wasn't really on the table because we didn't know anything about it.” 

“Everybody was being super gracious because we weren't the only people going through this,” he continued. “You know, we'd owe somebody $500 and we'd give 'em a hundred, and we'd owe somebody $5,000 and we'd give them a thousand. And we just kind of kept stair-stepping, making the best of these worst-case scenarios.” 

“It was years of just doing this virtual bankruptcy,” Chip added. “We were always broke, we were always begging people for one more minute, one more day, one more week.”

Living in the houses they were renovating — nine houses in 10 years, packing their belongings in garbage bags — Joanna said they got “scrappy” and “creative” to make things work. 

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

By 2012, the Gaines felt like their business had finally stabilized and they'd developed a local following of people who loved to see the homes and interior design they were creating. 

When a producer from HGTV called in 2013, Chip said he “thought it was a scam.” But they allowed a camera crew to come to Waco and film them working together. At the time, they didn't even own a TV, Joanna said. Chip said he had a “phobia” of the cameras and would clam up, but they eventually found their way, and the show took off like a rocket ship in 2014. 

All these years later — with an empire that includes their own Magnolia cable network, a successful magazine, a tourist destination in Waco, and a thriving product line at Target — the Gaines will star in “Fixer Upper: Mountain House,” premiering on December 9 on both Magnolia and HGTV.

Nicole Kidman is leaning into her work right now, and she's doing it with striking, effortless glamour. Kidman made a dramatic entrance at Vogue World: Hollywood, capturing attention as she walked the runway at Paramount Studios.

The actress, 58, leaned fully into Old Hollywood glamour for the star-studded event, appearing confident and radiant as she continues to focus on her work and family amid personal life changes Kidman, who is Vogue's October cover star, opened the show with a backstage rendition of “Put the Blame on Mame,” the song performed by Rita Hayworth in the 1946 film “Gilda.”

For her runway moment, Kidman wore a black, draped-satin bustier gown by Matthieu Blazy, adorned with black satin camellias.

The floral detail echoed the iconic black dress Hayworth wore in the memorable “Gilda” performance, which also soundtracked Kidman's walk.

Her glam paired beautifully with the tribute. She wore a bold red lip, smoky eye, and soft blonde curls parted to the side, creating a polished Old Hollywood aesthetic.

Kidman's appearance comes after she filed for divorce from Keith Urban on September 30 after 19 years of marriage, as reported by TMZ. She cited irreconcilable differences. Despite the shift in her personal life, Kidman remains busy and grounded.

People reported that Kidman is focused on the two areas that matter most to her: her work and her family. 

The star has several upcoming television projects, including a return to “Big Little Lies” and a reprisal of her role in the “Practical Magic” sequel. According to a People report, she is “keeping it positive” and believes “everything happens for a reason.”

The estranged couple were most recently seen together on June 20, when they attended a FIFA Club World Cup match for Kidman's 58th birthday. 

The “Practical Magic” star looked elegant in a white floral dress with a boatneck silhouette and full skirt as they watched Los Angeles Football Club take on Esperance de Tunis.

Vogue World: Hollywood blended fashion, music, and film history, highlighting both original costume design and new interpretations of classic movie looks. Designers such as Colleen Atwood and Ruth E. Carter contributed pieces, while Doja Cat and Gracie Abrams were among the performers.

All ticket proceeds supported the Entertainment Community Fund, which benefited costume professionals affected by the recent Los Angeles wildfires.

Kidman's striking runway appearance not only delivered pure glamour, but also reaffirmed her steady presence, confidence, and artistic focus as she moves ahead.

An estimated date of release for the convicted rap mogul has been disclosed in federal prison records – but a lot could happen to change it.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	Weeks after Sean “Diddy” Combs was sentenced to over four years in prison on prostitution convictions following a sweeping sexual abuse case, inmate records posted by the federal Bureau of Prisons show that Diddy, 55, is now expected to be set free on May 8, 2028.


	Combs had already been expected to serve less than the full sentence, thanks to roughly a year of time-served as he sat in jail awaiting his trial and verdict. But the newly-revealed release date would represent an even-earlier release than previously thought — only roughly two years and seven months after his date of sentencing.


	Such dates are just estimates, reflecting the “inmate's projected release date based on BOP calculations.” The earlier-than-expected date could reflect that Combs will serve the final few months of his sentence at a residential reentry center, or halfway house, or his participation in BOP's drug abuse rehab program, which can sometimes shave months off an inmate's sentence.


	Reps for Combs did not immediately return a request for comment. Reps for the federal Bureau of Prisons were unavailable for comment, citing the government shutdown.


	Once one of the music industry's most powerful figures, Combs was arrested and charged in September 2024 with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations. Prosecutors said he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating “freak-offs” — elaborate events which he allegedly forced ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	Following a blockbuster trial this spring, jurors issued a verdict clearing Combs on the RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. But he was still convicted on two lesser counts for transporting Ventura and others across state lines for the purposes of prostitution.


	At a sentencing hearing earlier this month, Judge Arun Subramanian sentenced him to 50 months in prison on those convictions. That was far less than the 11 years sought by prosecutors, but well more than the 14 months his lawyers had asked for. Counting his year of time-served credit, that sentence would seemingly have seen the star released at some point in September or October 2028.


	Regardless of BOP estimates, Diddy's release date could change dramatically if he wins his appeal, which he launched last week at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. His lawyers will challenge not only the length of his sentence, but also his underlying convictions themselves.


	If such arguments are successful – read what Diddy's lawyers might argue here – he could get out even earlier than May 2028. But the appeals process is often slow, and Combs will likely serve a sizeable chunk of his prison term before the case is even decided.


	That is, unless he's pardoned or commuted by President Donald Trump – the other big factor could significantly change his release timeline. Though Trump confirmed that Diddy's team reached out to the administration about such an edict, the White House has publicly denied that it is considering clemency for the convicted mogul.

Make it like your birthday every day.

Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau made their romance public as they held hands while celebrating the singer's 41st birthday in Paris.

Over the weekend, the pop star and the former Canadian prime minister walked in hand in hand as they arrived at a cabaret show at the Crazy Horse Paris.

In photos obtained by Page Six, Trudeau, 53, carefully helped his date out of the car before they walked into the venue. 

After the show concluded, the couple continued holding hands as they walked out of the cabaret.

As they exited, a fan gave a red rose to Perry and wished her a “happy birthday.”

The pair then got into a black SUV and headed to their next destination.

Perry stunned in a body-hugging, red gown and black pumps. She wore her dark hair in a slicked-back low bun.

Trudeau, on the other hand, looked dapper in a dark colored suit that he paired with a black shirt.

The date night came weeks after Page Six exclusively reported that Trudeau's new romance was a “midlife crisis” following his divorce from his wife of 18 years, Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau.

“Dating Katy may just be Justin's answer to going to Burning Man,” a Canadian society source told us. “It's a bit of a midlife crisis.”

The “Dark Horse” singer and the politician first sparked romance rumors in July when they were seen taking a stroll and later grabbing a bite to eat in Montreal.

A few days later, Trudeau was seen watching Perry perform at her “Lifetimes” tour stop in Montreal's Bell Centre.

Things got hot and heavy for the couple earlier this month when they were spotted making out while spending time together on a yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. 

Perry's new romance comes on the heels of her split from Orlando Bloom.

In July, the 13-time Grammy nominee and the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor, 48, confirmed in a joint statement that they had split after 10 years together.

The exes share 5-year-old daughter Daisy Dove, whom they welcomed in August 2020.

In 2023, Trudeau and his estranged wife, Sophie, announced their separation.

“Hi everyone, Sophie and I would like to share the fact that after many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate,” the former Liberal Party leader wrote in a since-deleted post on Instagram at the time. 

“As always, we remain a close family with deep love and respect for each other and for everything we have built and will continue to build,” he added.

They share three children: Xavier, 18, Ella-Grace, 16, and Hadrien, 11.

Don't hold it against her.

Britney Spears appeared to give her Instagram followers a bizarre excuse for her erratic driving via Instagram over the weekend.

“If anyone is wondering the lookalike was not me…🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤓,” the Princess of Pop, 43, wrote on Saturday.

Footage of the singer dangerously swerving into other lanes after leaving the Red-O restaurant in Thousand Oaks, Calif., went viral late Thursday.

The Grammy winner drifted into a bike lane, crossed the road's center divider and made a tire-screeching U-turn in the video, obtained by Page Six on Friday.

Spears did not specifically reference the video in her social media upload, which featured a graphic of Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck hugging.

In a subsequent post, the pop star wrote that she doesn't “feel respected at all by the most unbelievably horrible things being said about me.”

Spears explained that she didn't feel “inspired or motivated AT ALL to show new art” — but did share a throwback video of herself painting.

The “Crossroads” star, who has comments turned off on her Instagram account, also modeled a pink bathing suit in an additional post.

Spears' rep has yet to respond to Page Six's request for comment.

The Daily Mail reports that the songwriter's family members fear she is “losing control” as her ex-husband Kevin Federline promotes his bombshell memoir, “You Thought You Knew,” about their time together.

“There's a lot of concern. … It's terrifying,” a source told the outlet. “There's a lot of talk about what to do, if anything. How can we protect her from herself.”

The insider claimed that Spears' loved ones are in crisis talks.

Spears has hit back at Federline's allegations, which range from cheating on him to doing cocaine while breastfeeding their sons, via X.

“The constant gaslighting from [my] ex-husband is extremely hurtful and exhausting” she wrote. “Those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I am the only one who genuinely gets hurt here.”

Her spokesperson, meanwhile, called the former backup dancer's book a means of “profiting off” his ex-wife's story.

	Anne Hathaway made the trek all the way from Genovia to see Sabrina Carpenter kick off her five-night run at Madison Square Garden in New York. It's unclear how international law works for fictional countries, but the actress must have been in violation of some rule — so it's only fitting that Carpenter arrested her during “Juno.”


	“It's a crime to be this gorgeous. I just don't know what to do when I see a face like this,” Carpenter said from onstage at the Oct. 26 show. When Hathaway told the singer she's from Genovia, she responded, “Has anyone ever told you you look like a princess? I'm getting so flustered. Anne, can I arrest you for being the most perfect princess in the world?”

	Carpenter handed Hathaway her fuzzy pink handcuffs and announced, “This one's for Anne, everybody.” She joins recent arrestees Gigi Hadid, Joe Keery, and Olivia Dean, who were all arrested at past shows.


	The extended edition of the Short n' Sweet tour will continue on Tuesday, Oct. 28 with another show at Madison Square Garden. The singer will be stationed in NYC all week, with additional shows scheduled on Oct. 29 and 31, as well as Nov. 1.

	Meanwhile, Hathaway is in fashion mode as she steps back into the role of Andy Sachs in The Devil Wears Prada 2, now in production. She's been taking a few pages out of Carpenter's pop playbook, too. Earlier this year, Hathaway went into the studio with the singer's close collaborator, Jack Antonoff, to cut songs for David Lowery's upcoming film Mother Mary.

	











	“I had to submit to being a beginner,” Hathaway told Vogue about finding her singing voice for the titular role. “The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be okay. You're not ‘bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset—I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome.”

John Dickerson, co-anchor of CBS Evening News who has been with the network since 2009, said that he is exiting at the end of this year.


	“I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me — the work, the audience's attention and the honor of being a part of the network's history — and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who've made me a better journalist and a better human. I will miss you,” Dickerson said.


	Along with Maurice DuBois, Dickerson has anchored CBS Evening News since January. The duo presided over a format change that emphasized stories from correspondents in the field. But the broadcast has lagged in the ratings, while new editor in chief Bari Weiss is said to be eyeing an overhaul of the network's signature newscast. Weiss reports to David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount.

	











	Dickerson has multiple high-profile roles across the network: moderating debates, co-hosting CBS This Morning, correspondent for 60 Minutes and political director and chief Washington correspondent. He also hosted a show for CBS News‘ streaming channel, as well as the Whistlestop podcast. He also is a contributor to The Atlantic and podcaster for Slate's Political Gabfest. His mother, Nancy Dickerson, was the first female correspondent for the network.

	In his Instagram post, Dickerson cited his work as moderator of Face the Nation, a role he held from 2015 to 2018.


	His exits comes amid concerns over Weiss' plans for the news division, and whether she will force a shift rightward. A center-right opinion writer who launched the site Free Press, Weiss was tapped for the role overseeing CBS News following Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global. As part of the FCC approval of the transaction, Skydance committed to hiring an ombudsman to take viewer complaints, but that person, Kenneth R. Weinstein, was hardly a neutral figure: He once ran the conservative Hudson Institute.


	As CBS Evening News co-anchor, Dickerson asked critical questions of the network's decision to settle Donald Trump's lawsuit for $16 million, even though company attorneys had previously labeled the litigation baseless.

	











	After the settlement was announced, Dickerson said that the “Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle. Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you've traded away that trust? The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up, to honor what we witness on behalf of the people we witness it for.”


	Dickerson did not say what his future plans are.


	Paramount is expected to implement widespread and significant layoffs soon, perhaps this week. 


	Tom Cibrowski, president and executive editor of CBS News, said in a memo to employees that Dickerson “epitomizes the very best of journalism.” He said that he will remain co-anchor of CBS Evening News until the holidays.


	Since Weiss was named to her role atop the news division earlier this month, it's put an extra level of scrutiny on the news division. On Thursday's CBS Evening News, there was no mention of Donald Trump's pardon of money-laundering cryptocurrency billionaire Changpeng Zhao, even though it was a top story on other outlets. On Sunday, Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan's questioning of House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries went viral, as she challenged his use of the term “rigged” elections to warn of next year's midterms to Donald Trump's claims that he won the 2020 presidential race.


	“I have been using that term in the context of Donald Trump's unprecedented effort to gerrymader congressional maps in a partisan fashion all across the country,” Jeffries said.


	“You know Democrats are also going through gerrymandering and redistricting,” Brennan said. Efforts in California, though, are a response to GOP-controlled Texas' move to redraw districts mid-decade. 


	“Democrats are going to push back aggressively to make sure we have fair maps across the country, not partisan gerrymandering, which Republicans have initiated in state after state after state,” Jeffries said.

As fascism tightens it's grip it will be up to news organizations to combat it.
Apparently CBS is supportive of the fascist movement. It is not difficult to understand  why Dickerson wants out even if pushed out.
Maybe the intelligent news people who are leaving regular jobs can start their own network.

They should bring back Catherine Herridge. She was the only actual journalist they had.

It says a lot when a reporter like John Dickerson is too much for a news organization.

	When Princeton history professor Sean Wilentz was a student at Columbia in 1969, a new Bob Dylan record titled The Great White Wonder began popping up in record stores. Completely unsanctioned by Bob Dylan or his label, it mixed Basement Tapes material with informal recordings of Dylan during his early folk period between 1961 and 1962. “It was revelatory,” Wilentz says. “You got to hear Dylan talk, make jokes, boast. It brought you the person behind the idol.”


The Great White Wonder became such a sensation that it essentially gave birth to the entire bootleg industry. And even though acts like Led Zeppelin, the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, and the Who were very popular in this world of illegal releases, the number of Dylan bootlegs on the market dwarfed them all. 


	“The bootleg records, those are outrageous,” Dylan complained to Cameron Crowe in 1985. “I mean, they have stuff you do in a phone booth. Like, nobody's around. If you're just sitting and strumming in a motel, you don't think anyone's there. It's like the phone is tapped…Then you wonder why most artists feel so paranoid.”

	











	In 1991, Dylan decided to beat the bootlegers at their own game by launching the Bootleg Series. It's stretched to 16 volumes over the past three decades, chronicling practically every era of his career, and they were all overseen by Dylan's longtime manager, Jeff Rosen. But for the forthcoming 18th volume, Through the Open Window, 1956-1963, which concentrates on Dylan's earliest recordings during his folk period, the baton was passed to Wilentz. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Not only is Wilentz a renowned Dylan scholar and author of the stellar 2010 book Bob Dylan in America, but he was around the Greenwich Village folk scene as a kid and knows its history like few others. In addition to combing through all the tapes from this time period — many unheard by even the most serious Dylan fans — he also contributed a 125-page essay to the box. We hopped on a Zoom with Wilentz to hear about his long history as a Dylan fan, the creation of the box set, and what he hopes to see come out in the future.

I've been hearing rumors of some sort of “Villager” box set for years. It's exciting that it's finally here.Yeah, I know it is. I heard about it first at a party for the [2023] book, Mixing Up the Medicine. There was this rumor floating around, and I said, “Oh, that sounds interesting.” But in some ways, people have been wanting this for forever because ever since the first Bootleg Series in 1991 or even Biograph [in 1985], there's always been this fascination with Dylan's very, very early career. Finally, we got together to do this.


	My guess is that, especially old folks who kind of remember the Village vaguely in the old days, that this will be not a nostalgia trip as I hope, but a way to kind of close the gap between the past and the present.


When were your first exposed to Bob Dylan's music?I was exposed to his name before I was exposed to his music because I remember my dad talking to [Folklore center proprietor] Izzy [Young] about him. Izzy said, “There's this great new guy in town, you got to listen to him,” and then he proceeded to give my dad a Greenbriar Boys album. I don't know why he didn't give me a Dylan album, but I'd heard his name. 


	Then when Freewheelin‘ came out, I remember I was in a Sunday school class in Brooklyn. There was a very, very hip slightly older girl I was no doubt lusting after. She came in with this record, and it was almost like holy scripture already. This would've been, I guess sometime in '62 or '63.


Then you saw him at Philharmonic Hall in 1964.Yeah. My dad had a couple of tickets, and I went with my cousin.

What's the strongest image in your head from that performance?I remember seeing him, and Joan [Baez] was there too. She was wearing this sort of weird Scots cap, which was very strange because I don't think of her as a Scots woman, but it was more the music itself that left an impression because it was way over our heads. There was the stuff that everybody knew that he sang, like “The Times They Are A-Changin'” and so forth, but then he debuted “It's Alright, Ma,” “Gates of Eden,” and that was the stuff that I remembered thinking, “What is this about?” None of us understood it particularly, and there were no lyrics in front of us.

	











To really understand the breadth of Dylan's work, fans had to dive into the bootlegs. This just wasn't the case with most other artists. If you wanted to understand the Beatles, the albums got the job done. There wasn't this whole hidden cache out there of other things that deepen your knowledge.Yes. Also, Dylan improvised in a way the Beatles didn't. When they went on stage they played the same thing that was on the record. With Dylan, there would often be something new. He always wanted to do his new material. This is the hallmark of a Dylan concert. He'd play couple of things you would've heard, but he was very, very eager to get his new material out there, and that was always very special too.


	That said, we knew there was a world of recordings, a world of music that we'd never heard, and that's what we wanted to hear. We wanted to hear him sing the folk songs. We wanted to hear the songs that hadn't really come out. There was a lot more there we knew, and the bootlegs just brought that out.


It's amazing how often he was recorded when he was a very unknown artist. This just isn't the case for the Stones, Beatles, Who, Beach Boys. Recordings of their early live concerts simply don't exist. What is important to realize is that there was a real community in the Village, which I don't think that any of the others had. There was a world around Liverpool, sure, but there was a real community in the Village that was about more than just music. It was a way of life, really. 


	A lot of the recordings we have are Cynthia Gooding recording for her show on WBAI or someone just happened to have a tape recorder at the Folklore Center or something like that. But Gooding, among others, was very aware that there was a culture that had to be recorded, and they were going to record it any way possible. And she did a very good job of it.


	And then there's Terri Thal's tapes too. I mean, she was the manager, but there they are. But it was a community, and this is another thing we try to get across in the Bootleg Series. It wasn't just Dylan himself. It wasn't just Dylan at Columbia Records. There was a whole world of the Village that was recording stuff.


Up until now, the Bootleg Series was produced by Jeff Rosen. How did this one wind up in your hands?That's a good question. Basically, I'd heard these rumors and nothing seemed to be done. [Former Sony Legacy head] Steve Berkowitz and I had a conversation one day and we said, “What's going on here?” I approached Jeff [Rosen] and one thing led to another. The next thing you knew, I was doing this thing with Steve. Jeff offered it to me, and I very gratefully accepted the chance to do this. 

	











	It was more than just writing the liner notes because I've done that before. This was a chance to actually learn a great deal being in the studio with not only Steve Berkowitz, with [producer] Steve Addabbo as well. I learned a great deal about how you go about doing this kind of thing.


We've heard some of these tapes before, but they were often copies of copies with pretty horrid sound. I presume they tracked down the masters for this.I don't know much about the background. That was very much the office's doing, Jeff [Rosen] and Parker [Fishel]. But we still had to do a lot of work on the tapes that we had. I'll give one example, the stuff from [the July 6, 1963, voter registration rally in] Greenwood, [Mississippi], because that's really patched together. Steve did a brilliant job, but what we had was very rough. We didn't even have a full tape of “Only a Pawn in Their Game.” We had to stitch that all together, so there was a lot of work to be done in the studio. 


	The tapes, as good as they are, there's always room for improvement. I was listening to it with my ear for a particular thing, and then Steve would figure out what he wanted, and we went on from there. He'd do all the technical stuff.


Tell me your initial thoughts about how to frame this, since there was so many ways you could have gone.As a historian, the first thing is chronology. Where are you going to begin, and where are you going to end. We knew we wanted to begin in Minnesota, as close to Hibbing as we could get. That stuff had been out there, although not the Jokers stuff. That had not been heard widely. It was great to have that there, just to have a 15-year-old Bob Dylan having fun with doo-wop with his cousin and friend.


	That was easy, the beginning. The question was where to end it, and I went back and forth about this in my own mind. We could have gone through '64 if we wanted to because there's a wonderful tape of that one night in July of '64 where he records Another Side of Bob Dylan. You could do that. It would be fascinating because it's an interesting tape and lots was going on there. So do you go that far? Where are you going to cut it?


	It fairly quickly emerged that Carnegie Hall ought to be the end point. It really is a culmination of everything he'd been doing before. There is a significant break thereafter. Kennedy is killed in November. He meets Allen Ginsberg in December. He's in a very, very different place, so by the time that Another Side comes out, people like [Sing Out! editor] Irwin Silber and so forth are going to be angry at him already even though he hasn't even played an electric guitar. 

	











	There had been plans to release that concert, and it never really happened. There was a cover made up, but the record was never released. Some of that stuff has been out there, but what's missing from it is not only the other tracks, obviously, but the response of the audience. What's going on in this concert? It's an event. It's an extraordinary event.


	Town Hall was first. Suze Rotolo described it very, very well. Town Hall was something special. They knew that something special was happening at the Town Hall concert. But Carnegie Hall is a different matter. There is where you see him in his full…this is Bob Dylan in his full blossoming as Bob Dylan. He's then going to be another Bob Dylan, and many other Bob Dylans, but that is the culmination of it. 


The set starts with Dylan, his cousin, and his camp buddy singing “Let the Good Times Roll” in a music shop in 1956. How did that surface?I don't know. There's some things I don't ask about. As long as we have it, that's fine, good enough for me. But what it shows is, first of all, his early enthusiasm for doo-wop, and rhythm and blues. He didn't start up as a folk singer, and there's no better way to show that than hear him as a 15-year-old singing Shirley & Lee, or Little Richard, or what have you. 


	We read about it, but there's no recording as far as I know of him with his bands in Hibbing. So this is him in his very early stage. If you listen hard enough, you can hear his voice. He's the one who's banging on the piano, and he's the one who knows all the lyrics or most of them. It's unclear what the other two guys do, but you can hear his enthusiasm for this stuff, and it's a youthful enthusiasm. They don't quite find a groove or anything like that, but they really love this music.


	You can't understand Bob Dylan without understanding Little Richard from the very beginning, so there was a chance for us to do that. We chose the Shirley & Lee because I thought it was the first cut that they made that night in 1956. It's the very, very first, but it was also a rendition that I thought was fun, so we put it on.


Tell me about this rendition of “Jesus Christ” from 1960.He is doing Woody Guthrie his own way already. He has said that he was a Guthrie jukebox, and that's true. He spent a lot of time singing Woody Guthrie songs, although not only Woody Guthrie's songs, which is another point we want to make, but he's doing it his own way. He's not doing it the way that you would've heard it on a Stinson [record] or on the Library of Congress tapes or whatever “Jesus Christ” first appeared. He did it his own way, and that's important to understand about Dylan from the start, even before he starts writing his own material.

	











	He is not interested in replicating. He is not interested in imitating, as many people in the Village would end up doing and that's fine. From the very beginning, he wanted to do his own way, and you hear that even in 1960 on a tape in his own apartment. I would invite people to go compare Dylan's version of any of these songs with those of the people you heard it first, including Woody Guthrie.


I loved hearing “Remember Me” from Bob Gleason's house right after he got to New York.Yeah. He gets out to the Gleasons pretty early on, which has a number of different meanings, layers, because he's basically adopted by this very charmed circle of people around Woody Guthrie. The Gleasons were great. They have him out to the house before he'd even really arrived. And he's hanging out with the likes of Pete Seeger, and Cisco Houston, and all the people that are going to be [mentioned] on “Song for Woody.” He's already meeting them very early on.


	The thing about “Remember Me” apart from everything else is Dylan's voice. This is a Dylan voice that people are not expecting when they think of the early Bob Dylan. It's much more like the voice actually that he's had back in Minnesota. He's crooning more than he is Guthrie-ing his songs


	One of the things we wanted to do with this was to change pace, to throw people off a little bit, to challenge their expectations of what an early Bob Dylan would've sounded like, and how he was going about learning how to perform, and he's learning how to perform by singing songs like this.


Right. People often think he was using an Okie accent in this time.And continued to do so. You can't understand Bob Dylan without understanding his many, many voices.


You put in “Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues” pretty early. It really shows how funny he was, and how he could take a story out of a newspaper and turn it into that.Well, he could take a story that was kind of a downer and turn it into a frolic. One of the things about the [Timothée Chalamet] film that they didn't catch was how funny Bob Dylan was, and is. He's hilarious. He's making jokes all of the time. One of the things about the Village that people don't really get is they think of the Village as a music place, and it the very places that they played, in fact, like the Gaslight. Woody Allen was getting a start there. Richard Pryor was getting a start there. Bill Cosby was there.

	











	Everybody listened to everybody else. We leave it off the record because it just gets too long, but he has like a four-minute monologue before the song actually begins. He's setting the whole thing up in a very humorous way, and people are laughing, and you can hear that on the recording that we have too. I mean, it is just hilarious.


There's a lot of recordings of him by Bonnie Beecher when he went back to Minnesota in late 1961. It's interesting to hear them because the New York people always say he took this quantum leap forward when he came back after that trip.That's true. It's funny because the people in Minnesota thought he was nothing special, then he comes back from New York and he looks like he's just been at the crossroads. Where was the crossroads, in Minnesota or was it in New York?


	But the point of all this is that he was improving by leaps and bounds. Improving, that's not the right word. He was discovering himself, discovering new stuff. He was insatiable, and he was working very, very hard. That's the other thing I think we want to get across, is that genius is not just born, genius is made, and it's made by the genius himself. You can hear Dylan on a lot of the cuts here working very, very hard at mastering his craft.


Bob's life story has been told a lot, both by him and by others. But he's such an unreliable narrator. And the people who speak to biographers about these days are relying on very old memories they've recounted many times. The whole story starts to get really warped. What's great about this bootleg series is it tells the story of this time solely through the music.Well, in some ways a lot of Dylan's fakery of his own bio has always been very amusing. He's been doing this from the very beginning, he's never telling anybody the truth about who he is because he doesn't want people to know who he really is. He wants people to know him through his art. He wants people to know him through his work, and what we're presenting is that. 


	I'm less interested in what Bob Dylan had for breakfast on any given day. I actually don't care about that. Some people are obsessed with it, I don't care. But I really care about what he sang that night, and what he was saying into a tape recorder at Mel and Lillian Bailey's house to try to figure out a tune or something new. That's the process that I'm interested in.


These party tapes are really interesting since he's performing very differently than he does at a coffee house or folk club.Yeah, and it's a different community too. When he's playing in Minnesota, when he's back in Minneapolis, these are old friends from college days. There are people who are growing up with him and with the music. I think of Tony Glover above all, and he's showing off to them what he's done in the city. At first, it had to do with the fact that he met Woody Guthrie, and he was very excited about meeting Woody Guthrie, and he's writing all about, “Well, I met Woody, it's so great.” 

	











	But then it's about how he's perfecting his craft, and they're meanwhile perfecting their own too, especially somebody like Tony. So it's a kind of meeting of people who are friends, but they're also showing off to each other, they're also showing what they can do, what they've picked up.


	It's not a one-way street. It's not just Bob showing his friends where he's been. These are people who are in the know, many of whom actually thought of him as kind of a loser, as kind of an imitator. Now he's coming back and showing them, and they're going to show him what they know, and they kind of go back and forth. 


	It's not just in the music, it's actually in words as well. There's stuff on the tapes that we couldn't put in that have him in conversation with people. There's a great conversation with Paul Nelson about the character of folk music. So these are people who are not living together anymore, but came up together, whom he trusts, whom he has great affection for, but they're also growing up together and learning from each other, and that shows up on the tapes too.


You went through the raw session tapes from his first album session with John Hammond. That must have been interesting since he's never recorded his songs in a studio before. It was a very foreign environment for him.Absolutely, and folk music is sort of a foreign environment for John Hammond, who's a great jazz producer. We have a rehearsal of “Man of Constant Sorrow,” and you can hear John Hammond's kind of perplexed about what this song is, and any rate, they're learning it together. 


	What really impressed me about those tapes was how much he had learned between January and November of '61. When he gets into the studio, the first album is kind of thought of as a juvenilia, as his first attempt to do something. Well, no. First of all, for the Woody Guthrie jukebox talk, Bob Dylan has never released a recording of him singing a Woody Guthrie song. There are two of his own songs on there. But my favorite outtake from that session is him singing the Woody Guthrie song “Ramblin' Round,” which is just a stunning performance. 


	He is growing almost daily, but he's far different, far more possessed. He can enter a song in a way that he always wanted to, but had to teach himself how to do over eight months or however long it was.


The April 1962 Gerde's tape is pretty extraordinary. You get to hear “Blowin' in the Wind” before it's even finished. It's amazing that tape exists.It is, and nobody knows who made it. We tried to find out, but it's one of these anonymous things. I'm sure there are people who claim to know, but we couldn't track it down. 

	











	In the space of four songs you can hear Bob Dylan moving from where he had been when he recorded his first album back in November '61 to “Blowin' in the Wind.” It's in a club, you can hear people cheering him. He has a following now, the very first. We have an earlier Gerde's performance and there are only six people showing up. It was a Sunday, true, but still there was nobody there. Now he has a following. You can hear the following there, and he's responding to the following.


	But then out of nowhere comes this song that nobody was prepared for, that he had just written, which he said he didn't write, but he just recorded it. He's always had this idea that he doesn't write the songs, the songs write themselves, and they could just flow through him, he says that then.


	You also got the ambiance of what a club was like, which we wanted to capture as well. He does have a following, they are yipping and yapping and having a good time, and he's joking back and forth with them too. We wanted to get some of the intimacy of Gerde's. We wanted to get Gerde's across along with getting Bob Dylan across.


The Riverside church tape also has great moments. They recreate it in the movie since it's where he first met Suze.Our big discovery was there's a guy who comes on and introduces Bob Dylan as Bobby Dylan from Gallup, New Mexico. “He's been singing around town, and he sings a lot of Woody Guthrie songs, and so here's Bobby Dylan.” We didn't know who that was, who introduced him, so we all went on a big search to find out who — we discovered it was Bob Yellin from the Greenbriar Boys. He's still around, and he was able to confirm that was his voice.


	That is where he first lays eyes on Suze, although the film distorts it a bit. He sings a song with Jack Elliott. He sings a song with Danny Kalb. This was a community event. It was an all-day folk hootenanny. This was a community. They were all there together. They were all having fun. If you hear the whole tape, you get that sense as well. 


Bob made the first albums in two days. Then Freewheelin' took the better part of a year. In listening to the session tapes, did you gain any insights into it?I think that it's a manifestation of his rapid growth. They had a lot of tracks early on, but they weren't satisfied with it. He wasn't satisfied with it. He had other things to say. He had other things to write, so there were these big gaps, and then there would be these gaps for a bunch of reasons that the notes help to explain, but he wasn't really satisfied. 

	











	They did the famous experiment where John Hammond has the idea that he wants to get a single, so he's going to put Bob with a big band, and they're going to record this song that he wrote called “Mixed Up Confusion.” They're actually going to record a lot of Elvis because Bob wants to be Elvis too. So they record “Mixed Up Confusion,” backed up with a kind of jacked-up version of “Corinna, Corinna,” which we'd heard him sing earlier in the Village, and boy, did it bomb. They release it as a single and it doesn't take off.


	So there's a lot of fits and starts in making that record, and then they thought they might've had the whole thing done when it goes off to England in December of 1962, and that's a whole other rebirth. He learns a whole new set of things. He'd not really been in touch with Anglo-Celtish, Scottish songs anywhere near as adept as he was going to get when he was playing the folk clubs in London. He's hanging out with Martin Carthy in particular, and learning all sorts of things from him. So by the time he comes back to America…he'd written “Masters of War “while he was in London, and then he goes off to Greece afterwards, and he writes “Girl From the North Country,” and “Boots of Spanish Leather.”


	They end up putting “Girl From the North Country” on [the album]. But the album only became itself after he came back from London. And because of another famous dispute, they had to take four songs off. They had to take the John Birch Society song off because CBS was worried about getting sued. Then Grossman had also replaced John Hammond with Tom Wilson, and it's unclear how much different the songs would've been if Hammond had produced them, but nevertheless, they do this all at the very last minute. 


	The record had been produced, it was ready to be shipped, it was all ready to go, and then they have to make a new one. Freewheelin' is in many ways his real breakthrough as a songwriting genius. But it was a patchwork of different phases of that year and a half. 


The box set devotes a lot of time to the summer of 1963. That was such a crucial time because of the Newport Folk Festival, the March on Washington, and then he's in Greenwood too.The summer of '63 was important historically. In many ways, it's the crescendo of the Civil Rights Movement and of Dr. King. It's Birmingham. All sorts of things are happening in the Civil Rights Movement, really violent things that are changing the character of what the movement was about. It's going to be pushing the Kennedy administration to a kind of open support that it had never given before.

	











	Dylan's in the middle of all of that. He's not going to join any picket lines, he's not going to lick envelopes. Suze very much was. But it was in the air. I mean, he'd written about Emmett Till in early '62, so it was something that he was responding to. You couldn't help but respond to it at a deep emotional level, which is where Dylan's music comes from, from inside him. 


	The Greenwood event happened because Theodore Bikel convinces Grossman to allow  Bob to come down to Mississippi, where they're going to have a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. That area had been dark and bloody ground. It was really dangerous to be there, but Bob went along with Bikel and Pete Seeger. 


	As John Lewis later said, it was the first time that Blacks and whites together were singing freedom songs in the Mississippi Delta. That might seem like, “So what?” But it was not, “So what?” It was a big deal. 


	It's not remembered anymore particularly, it's remembered maybe only because of Don't Look Back, but it really was an important statement at that moment, and for him to sing for the first time publicly “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” which shook people up. It's not a simple story at all. It's showing that there's a system involved here rather than just good and evil. It's complicated.


	And then he sings “Blowin' in the Wind.” The answer is blowing in the wind. Well, okay, what is the answer? We're never told what the answer is. So it's Dylan at his most thoughtful, but also very clear where his heart and his mind are, the Civil Rights Movement. He's literally putting his body on the line. There are cops all over the place. It's a scary scene.


	Very soon after, there's the March on Washington at the end of August. And Dylan is much closer to the Civil Rights Movement, and the young people in the Civil Rights movement than I think people have realized.


I think they conflate it with the Vietnam protests and just presume he wasn't involved in any of it. But he was very involved.Very involved. I mean he's hanging out with them, they're friends. Now, his job is not to write speeches, it's not to go on the line and say, “I'm for the…” He's going to write his songs, he's an artist. So he's involved, but he's involved in a very particular way. 


	Then you have the Newport Festival afterwards where they kind of reenact Greenwood at the very first night when he calls up Seeger, and the Freedom Singers. The same people who have been at Greenwood are now on the stage in Newport, except it's a whole different scene. There's no cops. It's like everybody is adoring him, and they sing “Blowin' in the Wind.” It blows your mind.

	











Then he goes and records The Times They Are-A Changin'. I love the version of “One Too Many Mornings” you picked out for this.It was very important to have “One Too Many Mornings” on there because there is this political move that he's making. He goes out to Carmel and he's hanging around with Joan Baez, and with [Richard] Fariña, and Mimi Baez. Joan said the songs were coming out like ticker tape. He writes all of these songs, they're coming off of him like crazy, but they're not all political songs. 


	“Lay Down Your Weary Tune” is kind of a taste of things to come in many ways. That's not a political song, it's about to nature and the imminence of the holy, and all the rest. Then he does do “One Too Many Mornings,” which I think is one of the greatest songs he ever wrote. That, again, it's of a piece with things he'd been writing a year earlier, there's “Don't Think Twice,” and there's “One Too Many Mornings,” and I see there's a connection between those two.


	They both have to do with love and regret, and a certain degree of bravado maybe in the first song, and a certain degree of remorse and regret on the second. But the thing about Dylan is that he thinks at many different layers and holds them all together at the same time so he's not going to be any one thing, and you can't put him in a box. 


	People put him in periods, and yeah, there are periods, I suppose, to his music. But there's always something else, many, many other things going on at the same time, and you cheat yourself if you try to restrict it to any one of those things.


What do you hope they pick for the next chapter of the Bootleg Series?Well, that's endless. There's all sorts of things I wish that they'd released. I'd like to see the Another Side session brought out. You could do it probably on one or two CDs. It wouldn't be much to do since it's just a few hours, and there's so many wonderful songs on that record. There's all the stuff that he did with David Bromberg. We've never heard that material. 


I keep hearing rumors about an Oh Mercy box set.Oh Mercy would be obvious because of [producer Daniel] Lanois and what he wrote about in Chronicles. You could wrap it around that whole moment in his career. The tapes are all there.


What I'd really love more than anything is a 1978 box of Street Legal material and the tour that year.The Street Legal tour is much underestimated. People jump right to the gospel stuff, but they forget that there was this tour out there before. Did it do well? I can't remember.

	











It played to arenas that were pretty full. But this was happening right when Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young were peaking with Darkness on the Edge of Town and Rust Never Sleeps. Those are basically two of the best tours of all time, and critics often compared Dylan's tour to them unfavorably. Well, he survived. There's lots of good stuff that people don't remember as good stuff. I don't know how long they're going to be bringing them out though. They could go on forever, I suppose, but we will see.

I'm sure after being a fan your whole life, it was a dream to be the one putting one of these together.Oh, beyond. And the book itself is just so beautifully done. I sometimes said that the book I wrote about Bob was really about my father, and it was really about growing up in the Village. It was a way of trying to desublimate that stuff. It was somewhat refracted. 


	This wasn't about that because I'd settled my scores in that book, but to go back there, and to remember it all, and to hear it…I mean I'm 10 years younger than Bob Dylan, so I was a kid. I was a close to it, I could almost touch it, and I did go to Philharmonic Hall, but I was a kid, and so to hear it now at a ripe old age is really… well, I can't even go into it. It's very personal. I still have dreams about it.

EXCLUSIVE: Star Trek co-stars Simon Pegg (Mission Impossible franchise) and Sofia Boutella (The Mummy) are starring with Charlotte Gainsbourg (Melancholia) and Quentin Tarantino in feature Only What We Carry, marking Tarantino's biggest on screen role since Robert Rodriguez classic From Dusk Til Dawn (1996).


	The drama, which has quietly wrapped in Deauville, France, is the latest from Welsh writer-director Jamie Adams, whose credits include She Is Love and Wild Honey Pie! Also starring are French actor Liam Hellmann (Ibiza) and U.S. singer Lizzy McAlpine in her feature debut.

	Set against the windswept coast of Normandy, Only What We Carry is described as “a meditation on love, loss, and the quiet courage it takes to move forward”. Producers are Charles Benoin, Liam Hellmann, and Jouri Smit. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Pegg plays Julian Johns, “a once-formidable instructor whose former student Charlotte Levant (Boutella) returns home to face the ghosts of her past. Joining them are John Percy (Tarantino), Julian's old friend whose sudden arrival stirs long-buried truths; Josephine Chabrol (Gainsbourg), Charlotte's protective sister; Vincent (Hellmann), a restless artist caught between love and loyalty, and Jacqueline (McAlpine), a young aspiring dancer whose presence forces everyone to confront the weight of what they've left behind.”


	Director Jamie Adams, who specializes in an improvisational style, said: “It's always been a dream of mine to shoot an Eric Rohmer styled picture in Normandy, a dream that included collaborating with an exceptional international ensemble cast and crew. It turns out that by embracing the freedoms of independent cinema, that dream has come true. I'm forever grateful to the cast and crew of Only What We Carry for this moment.”


	Tarantino has cameod in most of his own movies, including Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (2019). He has also had small roles in other films and series and narrated 2022 series Super Pumped. The Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained filmmaker had lined up The Movie Critic as his tenth and final film but pulled the plug on that one and is said to be weighing up next directing effort.

Tom Hanks gushed over his longtime wife, Rita Wilson, in honor of her 69th birthday.

The actor, also 69, took to Instagram Sunday to post a close-up shot of the actress rocking a swimsuit.

“This beautiful woman celebrates her birthday TODAY,” he captioned the sweet snap. “She is beloved by her husband. Happy Birthday, @ritawilson!”

In the photo, Wilson was captured mid-laugh as she got ready to tuck her wet hair behind her ears.

Only the neckline of her black bathing suit was visible, and she accessorized with layered bracelets.

It appeared the “Jingle All the Way” star was on a boat as she posed in front of crystal-clear ocean water and the side of a cliff.

Interestingly, Hanks disabled the comments section of the post.

However, several notable names “liked” the upload, including Jennifer Garner, Paulina Porizkova and Isla Fisher.

Wilson and the “Forrest Gump” star have been married since April 1988.

In honor of their most recent wedding anniversary, Hanks previously shared a picture from the same tropical vacation.

“37 years married. Today! Love you, Mrs. -Mr.THanks,” he wrote alongside the selfie, which showed the couple smiling for the camera while taking in the sights around them.

Hanks and Wilson are parents to sons Chet, 35, and Truman, 29.

The Oscar winner is also dad to son Colin, 47, and daughter E.A., 43, whom he shares with his first wife, Samantha Lewes.

The exes were married from January 1978 to March 1987.

Ah, inspiration. Where does it come from? When it comes to clever Halloween costumes, we've got the answer: it's your favorite movies and shows! While there's no denying the power of the classics, your witches and ghouls and cats and vampires and all those old standbys, building a costume around a particular bit of pop culture fun is one of the big joys of this holiday.

As such, we've polled the IndieWire staff to pull together a list of potential costumes — including notes on what to source, where you should be shopping, and even who you might partake in this bit of sartorial fun with — that all honor some of the best films and series of the year 2025. We've got some obvious picks (“One Battle After Another” outfits that mix and match quite well, Aunt Gladys from “Weapons”), some out of the box ideas (you will never see our “Kpop Demon Hunters” idea coming, we promise), and plenty for couples and groups (yes, that “Long Walk” photo up top is a big hint).

Have at it! And when you're done, why not share a picture with the IndieWire team or our socials, so that we can also enjoy the fruits of our mental labors? Go ahead, scare (or impress) us to death!

Wilson Chapman, David Ehrlich, Alison Foreman, Jim Hemphill, Marcus Jones, Sarah Shachat, Ben Travers, Brian Welk, and Christian Zilko also contributed to this list.

Halloween 2024 was dominated by “The Substance,” with cinephiles, horror fans, and members of the LGBTQ+ community alike caking themselves in makeup to dress as the iconic Monstro Elisasue from Coralie Fargeat's popular body horror comedy. This year, that particular niche seems destined to be occupied by Aunt Gladys, the instantly hateable main villain of Zach Cregger's “Weapons,” played with a menacing smile by the delightful Amy Madigan.

Yes, you'll probably see 50 Aunt Gladys out and about if you live in Los Angeles or New York, but that doesn't make the costume any less fun. It helps that, unlike other horror villains to catch on as of late, Aunt Gladys isn't a particularly demanding character to dress as (tons of drag queens are already doing it!). Just a red bobbed wig, a pair of chunky glasses (ideally green), and some red lipstick haphazardly smeared on the lips is enough to get the point across. Those who want to go all out need to invest in a fake green pearl necklace, and either a red cardigan with a pink blouse or (or personal favorite) a purple tracksuit. To really complete the ensemble and get extra brownie points in your local costume contest? A massive purse and a few twigs (ideally tied with hair) will remind everyone who's the scariest witch around. —WC

When it comes to pop culture-centric Halloween costumes, the explanation is almost as important as the execution. A conceptual genius can turn a few simple clothing items into a clever reference that delights the entire party as long as they're ready to explain the context. The only catch is that you need to make sure a majority of the room gets said reference. So why not double your odds?

If you (correctly) believe Zach Cregger's “Weapons” is the best horror movie of the year and want to stick out among all the Aunt Gladys costumes, Alden Ehrenreich's Officer Paul Morgan is an easy alternative. Just tack a throwback mustache and receding hairline onto any cop costume and you should be good to go. And given that the look was blatantly inspired by John C. Reilly's character in “Magnolia,” you can easily adjust your description of the outfit and say you're Jim Kurring if you somehow end up at a Halloween party devoid of horror fans. —CZ

This one is for all the cat ladies out there (myself included). Don't want to part with your fluffy little guys and gals for the evening? Want to rep the best movie of the year? Looking for comfort? We've got you.

Eva Victor's luminous debut feature is all about different paths of healing. For Victor's character Agnes, an early toe-dip into feeling better about a horrible event that has befallen her comes at the hands (paws?) of a tiny new pal she meets during an otherwise everyday trip to the store. Immediately besotted by the tiny feline she finds in the middle of a parking lot, Agnes tucks her into her comfy barn jacket and takes her inside said store for a snack.

This one's easy: you'll need a kitten (stuffed will do, especially if you're leaving your house for the evening, everyone knows cats are homebodies), a blue jacket, comfy sweats, work boots, and cans and cans of cat food. For many of us (again, me), this is an outfit that can come together without any new purchases, culled entirely from our own closets and couches. What's better than that? —KE

My favorite way to do Halloween is being able to cobble together something creative with what I can find from Goodwill. No need to go to a Spirit Halloween and, in fact, if you ask “One Battle After Another” costume designer Colleen Atwood, even she will tell you that a trip to “a nice Goodwill shop will do the job” if you want to dress as Leonardo DiCaprio's Bob this year.

You're looking for a faded plaid robe, a slightly different design than the Big Lebowski robe you have lying around from one of your old slacker costumes. That's the biggest facet of this costume if you want to get Bob right, and if your local Goodwill really doesn't have something acceptable, this new LL Bean one might get some use beyond October 31 if you really want to go that route. Tie it together with a black beanie, some thick dark sunglasses you can find at a Walgreens, a gray T-shirt, and dark sweats, and you're good to go, though it'll help if you grow that goatee too.

Add in a duffel bag or a fake gun if you really want to accessorize, and above all, don't forget to take a few long drags even after you've found out you're already late. —BW

Paul Thomas Anderson's VistaVision extravaganza “One Battle After Another” is filled with iconic looks and characters, from Leonardo DiCaprio's Bob in his sunglasses and Lebowski-esque robe to Sean Penn's creepy and hilarious riff on Michael Flynn (complete with off-putting hair that Penn slurps into place with his saliva-drenched comb). Yet perhaps the most memorable single image is that of Teyana Taylor as a pregnant Perdidia Beverly Hills firing off a machine gun with rage and delight.

To recreate Taylor's look doesn't require much; just get yourself a red flannel shirt, some army fatigue pants, a simple knit ski cap, and a pair of combat boots. The only truly challenging part of the costume is a convincing prosthetic belly that looks as though it contains a young Charlene/Willa just waiting to bust out into the world. But if you can nail that — along with an appropriately excessive mock gun and a perpetual revolutionary howl — you've got a Halloween costume that pays perfect homage to one of the best films of 2025. —JH

Fielder's HBO series was designed to help people overcome their social anxieties, so it's only fitting that the second season inspired multiple costume options for Halloween party-goers to choose from — whichever makes them feel most comfortable. 

First off is Fielder Classic: Grab a pair of New Balance sneakers, dark jeans, and a light sweatshirt or pullover (perhaps from Summit Ice?). The only slightly impractical expenditure would be a mobile laptop harness, but who knows? Maybe you'll find it as convenient as Fielder, even if you don't enjoy creating decision trees. 

If you're feeling a touch more ambitious, try Captain Fielder. For this one, you'll need a pilot's uniform: the hat, the jacket, a tie, dark slacks, and ideally an ID badge hung from a lanyard. If you want to make sure people know you're Captain Fielder, not just any ol' pilot, you could add the laptop harness, or stand in the corner of the party, watching everyone intently.

Or you could take it one step further and become Nathan Fielder as Sully Sullenberger. There's a few ways to realize this version, including as a couple's costume where one of you walks around on stilts (as Sully's dad) and the other wears a little boy's green suit, complete with white dress shoes, white dress socks, and a white button-down shirt with the collar spread on top of the jacket. But you can also fly solo with a gray wig, gray mustache, and blue pilot's shirt (including the striped epaulets and metal wings pin). For the final touch, wear a pair of corded headphones and have your iPod cued to the “Evanescence” song “Bring Me to Life.” 

Just rest assured: No matter which version of Fielder you choose to be, there's no way you'll go wrong. —BT

Speaking of bringing people to life, why not honor this year's breakout animated show by embodying “Common Side Effects” lead Marshall Cuso? He's nice, he's smart, he's rich — and he's relatively easy to portray. All you need is a red, short-sleeved button-down (left unbuttoned), a pair of green cargo shorts, a white Panama hat, and a thick brown beard. For bonus points, you can carry around a blue mushroom, a white pill-shaped creature, and/or your beloved pet tortoise, Socrates. Oh, and if you want to indulge in a few earthbound hallucinogens, that's just part of the character. But don't lose your mushroom. It might save you (“from the nothing I've becoooooooome”)! —BT

For a different take on a unicorn costume, try emulating Pedro Pascal's too-good-to-be-true financier who tries to sweep Dakota Johnson off her feet in Celine Song's latest romantic dramedy. If you are the type to frequent as many weddings as say, a matchmaker, all you would need to do to achieve the top half of this look is break out your summer tuxedo jacket, shirt, and bowtie. The more bespoke, the better.

The bottom half, however, comes with a spoiler alert. Rather than jet off to the best plastic surgeons in the business to break your legs on behalf of a breaking six feet in height, simply hem your black pants up an exaggerated amount — maximum six inches, giving off capri vibes — to convey how often the perfect man is not all that he seems to be. —MJ

On an actually serious note, the costumes that Malgosia Turzanska designed for Chloé Zhao's film adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel — which already become a book club staple — are as visually stunning as they are relatively simple to imitate. As Jessie Buckley's witchy woman of the woods, simply don a long sleeve dress as close to crimson red as one can get, and a Ren Faire-esque brownish red vest. For Will, just pull out anything denim, linen, chambray, etc., for another monochromatic vest over shirt look, in more of a muted blue. Why not carry a quill as well, to bring one bit of fun to an outfit evocative of the Oscar contender bringing audiences to tears. Still, a chic couples costume with complementary warm and cool tones is sure to get a pair on the best dressed list of any Halloween party. —MJ

OK, so we may not be the first people to think of dressing as the characters from “KPop Demon Hunters” this year. Indeed, word on the street is that even the dumbest of the Saja Boys — Romance Saja, obviously — is shaping up to be a more popular costume than Halloween staples like Spider-Man, Miles Morales, and perennial Ricky's favorite: Generic Blue and Red Jumpsuit with Non-Proprietary Web Pattern.

In other words, you and your besties are going to have to up your game if you want to stand out from all the other HUNTR/X wannabes. But what if you don't have a friend who's willing to draw movie-accurate purple demon patterns over her entire body? What if your bird keeps flying away from you every time you try to superglue four extra eyes onto its head? (Sorry, but if your Jinu getup doesn't come with a perfect blinking Sussie the Magpie you're a huge loser.) What if you forgot to buy a costume and wish you could just spend the whole night hiding inside a fluffy cocoon of goose down and polyester?

Mira might be the only person who could wear a sleeping bag to the Met Gala, but she isn't the only person who could wear a sleeping bag to your local Halloween party! Black, form-fitting, and pulled tight around the face so you can pull off just the right pose — that's how it's done, done, done, done, done. —DE

Nothing says, “Don't drink and drive!” like a low-lift group costume that's significantly funnier when you choose to walk everywhere. Adapted from the first book Stephen King ever wrote, “The Long Walk” was originally published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and finally arrived on screen this year as a major horror event thanks to Lionsgate. Director Francis Lawrence (“The Hunger Games”) and screenwriter JT Mollner (“Strange Darling”) screwed the terror of King's brilliant dystopian nightmare even tighter to make nightmare fuel that's an ideal fit for the movie format. 

“The Long Walk” also cast the perfect actors for a lean-mean ensemble effort, giving Halloween-ers like you the chance to dress up as a revolutionary Cooper Hoffman, fascist Mark Hamill, devastated Judy Greer, and more memorable characters. You'll need lots of beige, olive green, and khaki clothing to go with your ratty shoes, dirty wristwatches, dystopian dog tags (with your walkers' numbers on them!), and a big banner with orange lettering to announce your murder-themed marathon. Finally, when the night's ready to conclude, throw your heads back and as a group scream, “FUCK THE LONG WALK.” Then, maybe call that Uber. —AF

Halloween costumes, too, can be mysterious and important! The advantage of going with “Severance” as an inspiration is that it should be fairly easy to acquire some blue lanyards to help you move from “Outie” to “Innie,” and you may already have Lumon-approved workware that is roughly the same colors and shapes as Helly's blue sweater/skirt combo and Mark's slightly disheveled suit in their finale hallway sprint.

This is the one time of year it's not weird to be ordering fake blood on Amazon, either, to complete the Mark side of the look. It should be fairly easy to coordinate a couple's costume from the final shot of “Severance's” Season 2 cliffhanger — or indeed a throuple's costume, if you have someone down to dress as Gemma, stuck on the other side of the door. The only real potential dangers are getting too wrapped up in finding just the right shade of weird, muted teal for Mark's tie, finding the right time at the party to go shoes off with Helly, and, of course, avoiding marching bands at all costs. —SS

Despite us saying it was the most important movie of the summer, not enough of you saw the hilarious “Naked Gun” reboot to make Liam Neeson's opening scene outfit truly iconic. But even if people don't know what the heck you're wearing, you're bound to still get a laugh if you have the literal balls to confidently pull off this Halloween costume.

You might already have a white dress shirt and even a black tie lying around. Tie the former up by your waist and the latter ultra short. The maroon sweater vest and the plaid skirt are trickier to come by, and you may have to very politely ask your wife/girlfriend/sister/teenage Catholic school daughter to pull it off. The last and most crucial thing are the tighty-not-whiteys. Frank Drebin Jr.'s have what look like strawberries on them, and we imagine that's not going to be easy to track down, but we give you permission to get creative with your own colorful pair of briefs. And we'll also forgive you if you don't have a rainbow lollipop with a shiv on the end either.

Anyone who does actually do this for Halloween, be sure to send a pic to “The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast” (Quaid Army!) to see if you get a much-deserved shout out from director Akiva Schaffer. —BW

America's new favorite (fictional) doctor is an excellent Halloween costume for a few reasons: “The Pitt” is a very popular show, his outfit can be assembled in a day or two, and it provides a built-in level of warmth and comfort without running the risk of getting too hot. All you need to complete the ensemble is three layers: a white undershirt, a black scrubs top, and a navy-blue hoodie, unzipped. Nab yourself a prop stethoscope to wear around the neck, and you can head out for Halloween in your fave pair of beat-up jeans. No, few people look as good in scrubs as Noah Wyle, but for the dads and middle-aged men with plans on October 31, there's no easier costume to pull off this holiday. —WC

Are you an identical twin who's too white to go as Smoke and Stack from “Sinners,” too scrawny to go as Chad and Alex Wagner from Jean-Claude Van Damme's “Double Impact,” and/or too LAME to go as renowned gynecologist duo Beverly and Elliot Mantle (of “Dead Ringers” fame)? Well, have I got some good news for that presumably very small portion of IndieWire's readership: You and your siblings are just some gray pajamas and a pair of bad haircuts away from transforming into both of Robert Pattinson's most beloved* roles as the Expendable Mickey 17 and the clone he was never supposed to meet.

You could flesh the costume out even further with some numbered bibs, those flappy-earned hats, or even a life-sized Steven Yeun (this is one of those situations where it would come in really handy to be close personal friends with renowned actor Steven Yeun), but either way everyone you see will be delighted by your clever take on the characters from the “doesn't it feel like that came out forever ago?” sci-fi satire of the year. —DE

The passing of David Lynch is among the worst movie memories of 2025. But the tradition of Halloween is rooted in real death, and you won't get a more theatrical chance to honor the late surrealist in his final earthside year. A fearless explorer of different artistic mediums, Lynch bounced from 35mm to 16mm to digital and back again, creating scads of bizarre paintings, statues, viral videos, mixed-media experiments, furniture pieces, and more along the way.

From the ethereal madness of “Eraserhead” to the quaint nausea of “Twin Peaks,” you've got more inspiration than you need to craft the ideal Lynchian costume using his timeless visuals and characters. But you just know Lynch would give it a twist, so take time to seriously meditate on the matter and make this tribute your own.

Here are just a few ideas to get you started:

(1) “Mullholland Drive” couples costume — only using materials you find on a real road!

(2) Vladimir Putin post-Ice Bucket Challenge — a stunt Lynch really requested in 2014!

(3) A literal representation of the feeling you had when you heard Lynch was gone. —AF

All five members of Radiohead spoke with Jonathan Dean for a new wide-ranging interview in The Sunday Times. At one point, Thom Yorke reflected on the band's decision to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2017, and the backlash that ensued. “I was in the hotel,” Yorke recalled, “when some guy, clearly connected high up, approaches me to thank me. It horrified me, truly, that the gig was being hijacked. So I get it—sort of. At the time I thought the gig made sense, but as soon as I got there and that guy came up? Get me the f*** out.”

Dean followed up by asking Yorke if he would perform again in Israel, noting that the interview took place before the latest cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas. “Absolutely not,” Yorke said. “I wouldn't want to be 5,000 miles anywhere near the Netanyahu regime but Jonny has roots there. So I get it.” (Yorke is a longtime critic of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government.)

Jonny Greenwood, who is married to the Israeli artist Sharona Katan and has collaborated with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa, disagreed with his bandmate. “I would also politely disagree with Thom,” Greenwood said. “I would argue that the government is more likely to use a boycott and say, ‘Everyone hates us—we should do exactly what we want.' Which is far more dangerous.”

Elsewhere, Yorke spoke about the pressure that he's felt from pro-Palestinian supporters—including the the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement—who suggest that Radiohead are complicit in Israel's assault against the Gazan people. “This wakes me up at night,” he said. “They're telling me what it is that I've done with my life, and what I should do next, and that what I think is meaningless. People want to take what I've done that means so much to millions of people and wipe me out. But this is not theirs to take from me—and I don't consider I'm a bad person.”

Yorke, who was heckled onstage last year by a pro-Palestinian protestor, added, “A few times recently I've had ‘Free Palestine!' shouted at me on the street. I talked to a guy. His shtick was, ‘You have a platform, a duty and must distance yourself from Jonny.' But I said, ‘You and me, standing on the street in London, shouting at each other? Well, the true criminals, who should be in front of the ICC [International Criminal Court], are laughing at us squabbling among ourselves in the public realm and on social media—while they just carry on with impunity, murdering people.' It's an expression of impotency. It's a purity test, low-level Arthur Miller witch-hunt. I utterly respect the dismay but it's very odd to be on the receiving end.”

Greenwood, who's faced particular scrutiny for performing in Tel Aviv at the height of the war in 2024, said, “It's the embodiment of the left.” He continued, “The left look for traitors, the right for converts and it's depressing that we are the closest they can get.” Greenwood added that he's working on a new album with Israeli and Middle Eastern musicians (something seemingly in the vein of 2023's Jarak Qaribak) and that he feels “frightened to admit that.” But, he said, “that feels progressive to me—booing at a concert does not strike me as brave or progressive.”

Yorke, who was with Greenwood at the time of the interview, responded with a deadpan remark: “But you are whitewashing genocide, mate. And so am I, apparently, by sitting next to you on this sofa.”

Greenwood also spoke about protesting the Israeli government and many citizens' despisal of the country's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. “Look, I have been to antigovernment protests in Israel and you cannot move for all the ‘F*** Ben-Gvir' stickers,'” he said. “I spend a lot of time there with family and cannot just say, ‘I'm not making music with you f***ers because of the government.' It makes no sense to me. I have no loyalty—or respect, obviously—to their government, but I have both for the artists born there.”

Philip Selway and Ed O'Brien also spoke with The Sunday Times about Israel and Palestine. O'Brien said, regarding the band's 2017 Tel Aviv concert, “We should have played Ramallah in the West Bank as well.”

And Selway remarked, “What BDS are asking of us is impossible. They want us to distance ourselves from Jonny, but that would mean the end of the band and Jonny is coming from a very principled place. But it's odd to be ostracised by artists we generally felt quite aligned to.”

Jonny Greenwood's brother and bandmate, Colin Greenwood, did not address the Middle East, but he recalled a show that Radiohead played in Berlin on the night of September 11, 2001. According to the article, some Americans in the crowd shouted at Yorke to “say something,” and the singer eventually asked, “What do you want me to say?”

Radiohead's interview with Jonathan Dean for The Sunday Times comes ahead of the band's first tour since 2018. The tour is scheduled to begin next week, on November 4, in Madrid.

His No. 1 fan?

Sophie Turner fangirled over Chris Martin in a resurfaced clip amid rumors that they once went on a date.

In a 2020 video obtained by the Daily Mail, the “Game of Thrones” alum's then-husband, Joe Jonas, handed his wife a phone as he told her, “I have someone who wants to say ‘happy birthday.'”

As Turner received the phone, her face lit up in excitement as she yelled out, “Chris Martin!”

“This is Chris from Coldplay. I wanted to say on behalf of me and the even more handsome members of our band,” the “Hymn for the Weekend” singer, 48, said in the video.

“I hope you are having the best day. I send you all my love and I hope you're having a great time. Thanks for being awesome. Bye,” Martin continued. 

Before concluding the call, the pop star blew a kiss for the camera.

Turner, 29, then said she was “not going to cry on camera” as she gave the phone back to Jonas, 36, before they high-fived each other.

The resurfaced video comes as rumors surfaced that Turner and Martin recently went on a “secret date.”

The Daily Mail reported that the “Dark Phoenix” actress and the seven-time Grammy winner had a night out together a week after her on-again, off-again relationship with Peregrine Pearson ended in late September.

Turner and the British aristocrat, 30, were first romantically linked in October 2023 when they were caught making out. However, the outlet reported they were seen “bickering and arguing between feverish snogs on the dance floor” after attending a high-society wedding together.

Jonas filed for divorce from Turner in September 2023 after four years of marriage.

Their divorce proceedings immediately turned sour as they battled it out over their two daughters — Willa, 5, and Delphine, 3 — even attending mediation sessions to figure out the details of child custody.

However, the mom of two and the “Cake by the Ocean” singer have since hashed out their co-parenting issues.

Meanwhile, over the summer, Martin broke up with his longtime girlfriend, Dakota Johnson. He and the “Fifty Shades of Grey” star, also 36, dated for nearly eight years.

The “Viva la Vida” crooner shares kids Apple, 21, and Moses, 19, with his ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow.

Britney Spears' family is reportedly extremely scared for her after seeing footage of her swerving dangerously while driving home during a night out with a friend. Shocking video footage shows the pop star leaving the Red-O restaurant in Thousand Oaks, Calif., despite others appearing to urge her not to get behind the wheel. The singer's vehicle went on to make an erratic U-turn, with her tires screeching. Kevin Federline's tell-all memoir has been making headlines all month with bombshell claims about Spears, who called the book “white lies” via social media — and slammed Federline's “constant gaslighting” as “extremely hurtful and exhausting.”

Raye still hasn't figured out the whereabouts of her soulmate, the premise of her latest single “Where Is My Husband,” but at the very least, she now knows where her stolen car containing her prized songwriting books ended up. Last October, the singer and songwriter indefinitely delayed her second studio album after her book of songs slated for the record were taken in a car theft just ahead of her birthday.


	About three months ago, Raye revealed on the EE Official Big Top 40 From Global that she got a call from the police. They found her car — and the songbooks along with it.


	“It was a roller coaster journey, but what I didn't tell everyone is the police called me maybe two or three months ago, and they were like, ‘We found your car,'” Raye said. “Not only did I get it back, not one thing had been taken out of the car. All my songwriting books were there, untouched.”


	When Raye initially announced the theft, she did so in an Instagram post celebrating her 27th birthday. “It's my birthday and my car got stolen with all my song writing books in the boot so no second album any time soon love you bye,” she wrote. She mourned and celebrated with a cake that read “sorry ur car got stolen” in red frosting.

	This weekend, Raye turned 28 and entered her new year with more optimism than she had last year. “I'll be spending it in the studio which is a bit sad isn't it? Or beautiful,” she wrote on Instagram. “Bit of a loner these days but I don't mind it at all. I'm writing a lot. Can't wait to show you this music, just need to finish it all first.”

	Raye's Saturn return has coincided with the return of her stolen songs and her return to the stage. In March, she will embark on her biggest North American tour yet, with headlining shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York and the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. In the meantime, “Where Is My Husband” is on a steady climb up the Billboard Hot 100.


	“Everything ended well,” Raye said on Big Top 40. “Never give up hope.”

The best Neil Diamond songs share a few simple traits: they're catchy enough to unite the largest crowds on the planet, deeply sentimental, and refuse to make even the slightest effort to be cool. They have a real egalitarian streak to them, making the case that everyone has a voice worth using and the world is a better place when we all sing along at the top of our lungs. 

All of the same could be said about Craig Brewer's “Song Sung Blue,” a soapy film about the stranger than fiction story of Mike and Claire Sardina, a couple whose Neil Diamond tribute band Lightning & Thunder propelled them to the apex of the Milwaukee tribute band circuit in the 1980s and '90s. Adapted from Greg Kohs' 2008 documentary of the same name, it treats a middle-aged mechanic and hairdresser who cover “Cracklin' Rosie” in sequined jumpsuits with all the seriousness that you'll find in any “Walk Hard”-esque rock and roll biopic. The stakes might be infinitely lower, but the rise, fall, and rise again are all there.

Mike Sardina (Hugh Jackman) has already lived a few full lives by the time we meet him on the 20th anniversary of his sobriety. A former Marine who battled addiction after coming home from Vietnam, he now plays music in any dive bar and county fair that will have him. Whether he's playing guitar in a Black soul cover band or singing “Eye of the Tiger” under his preferred stage name Lightning, he follows the music wherever it takes him. But he becomes more and more frustrated with the fact that all of his paying gigs seem to require him to impersonate someone else. Everything seems to collapse out from under him when he backs out of playing Don Ho on a tribute act bill organized by a 52-year-old Buddy Holly impersonator (Michael Imperioli), who has been singing “Not Fade Away” for three decades longer than the real Holly ever got a chance to. Mike can't understand why he can't just perform as himself for a change, but a beautiful Patsy Cline impersonator points out that “nostalgia sells.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






That wise woman turns out to be Claire (Kate Hudson), who soon becomes Mike's second wife and first (and only) performing partner. They form a new act called Lightning & Thunder — not a tribute band, they insist, but a Neil Diamond experience. A notable difference from the competition is that Mike never claims to be presenting himself as Diamond (even if his costumes are sparkly enough). They're simply being themselves, offering interpretations of the music without the pressure to be carbon copies. Bolstered by an elite management team that includes Mike's dentist (Fisher Stevens) and a local casino tour bus mogul (Jim Belushi), they soon find their local popularity skyrocketing once Mike reluctantly agrees to start opening with “Sweet Caroline.” 

But every great music story needs a downfall, and “Song Sung Blue” offers plenty of them. At the risk of spoiling a 30-year-old true story, Claire loses a leg in a freak car accident and spirals into depression as she recovers. Mike also battles his own problems, and the pressure of keeping their blended family together while finding a way to pay their bills as working class performers weighs on them. Music brought them together and gave them the happiest years of their lives, but they're forced to decide if it's still enough.

 










Both Jackman and Hudson pour everything they have into their characters, and “Song Sung Blue” is at its most infectious when we're watching this couple bask in the dorky pleasures of singing Neil Diamond songs loudly enough to drown out the painful realities of life. At two hours and 11 minutes, the film often feels overstuffed and too melodramatic for its own good — this movie did not need a single dream sequence, let alone multiple — and it touches on so many sensitive topics that its takes on addiction, teen pregnancy, PTSD, health insurance bureaucracy, and other social ills often feel shoehorned in with insufficient time for exploration. But even with those flaws, it's still hard to look away from the silly sincerity that powers the film.

A dominant theme throughout “Song Sung Blue” is its defense of the kind of life that seems average and unremarkable compared to the other stories you'll find playing at your local multiplex. “Sobriety makes you confront some hard truths,” Mike says at one point. “I know I'm not a star or a songwriter, I just want to entertain people and make a living.” The rest of the film tries to answer the question of whether someone who, by their own admission, does not have any particularly unique talent has any business pursuing such a dream. Its tensest story beats revolve around Milwaukee casino residencies and karaoke hosting gigs at all-you-can-eat Thai buffets. The biggest opportunity that's ever at stake is the chance to play a theater show of Neil Diamond covers on the same night the real Neil Diamond is playing a show across town — even at the height of their powers, Mike and Claire are competing for the chance to be the second best opportunity to hear “Sweet Caroline” in a 25-mile radius.

 










But rather than mock their small-time dealings or direct them to chase brighter lights, “Song Sung Blue” treats Mike and Claire's pursuit of tribute band glory as a sufficient driving force for a meaningful life. This isn't a story about how you're never too old to chase your wildest dreams and play in the big leagues; it's about how there shouldn't be any shame in realizing that you are. There's no real money to be made or legacy to be forged in their line of work, but their love was never stronger than when they were belting out Neil Diamond covers together on stage. The satisfied customers who left the venue smiling each night were just an added bonus. 

If that all sounds too sentimental for your tastes, fair enough — though in that case, it's hard to imagine you were ever particularly moved by a song like “Forever in Blue Jeans,” and thus not the target audience   for “Song Sung Blue.” But if the right Diamond song at the right time can turn you into mush, you're likely to find that Brewer's film is capable of tugging on the same heartstrings. 

At the film's AFI Fest premiere, Jackman told the audience that he had just finished a FaceTime conversation with the real Diamond (who retired from performing in 2018 due to his battle with Parkinson's Disease) before taking the stage, and asked the legendary songwriter if he had a message for the crowd. Jackman said that Diamond's response was simple: “Just keep singing.” Brewer's film embodies that message to its core, and anyone who wishes they had a little more Neil Diamond in their life now has an excuse to sing a little more.

 










“Song Sung Blue” premiered at AFI Fest 2025. Focus Features will release it in theaters on Thursday, December 25.

	The Jonas Brothers have gotten used to being pelted with the expected waves of love and affection during their run of stadiums and arenas this year on their Jonas20: Greetings From Your Hometown tour. But those definitely weren't just gleeful shouts of “Joe!” after the sibling trio took the field on Saturday (Oct. 24) in the middle of game two of the World Series at Toronto's Rogers Centre to perform the song “I Can't Lose” from this year's Greetings From Your Hometown LP.

	In fact, the mid-game performance break at a point when the score was tied 1-1 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays as part of the annual Stand Up To Cancer tribute kind of ticked off a lot of fans who feared it was messing with the game flow and may have actually been thinking “Noooo!!!” 


	“If the Jays lose it's entirely on that weird Jonas Brothers performance in the middle of the game,” one incensed fan wrote on X, with another adding, “I'm trying to watch the World Series and they doing a damn Jonas Brothers concert after the 5th inning.”


	Joe Jonas heard you and the singer had the perfect response to the chorus of concern in the comments on a Major League Baseball post featuring a still pic and a video of the siblings posing on the field with the caption, “SPEECHLESS, OVER THE EDGE, JUST BREATHLESS.” Joe seemed to humorously sympathize with the confusion, commenting, “Why these guys?”

	











	Self-deprecation aside, there were plenty of fans there to support him, with a number commenting on his comment, with one writing, “@joejonas Because they are the boys with the most beautiful soul in the world” and another adding, “@joejonas cause they're awesome.”


MLB has been hosting the Stand Up to Cancer tribute since 2009 in which people in attendance at games hold up placards honoring those who've been impacted by cancer. The JoBros dedicated “I Can't Lose” — which was the official anthem of ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball coverage, with a video in support of the charity airing during July's MLB All-Star game — to “everyone standing up to cancer.” Joe also kicked off the performance by holding up a placard for their dad, Kevin Jonas Sr., who was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2017.


	The band's 20th anniversary tour continues on Monday night with the second of two shows at Orlando's Kia Center.

	The Boss is very much back.


	Just days after walking the red carpet (and delivering a typical powerhouse performance) for Disney's biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, Bruce Springsteen made another surprise appearance, this time for Steven Van Zandt's Party at the Pony.


	Per Rolling Stone, Springsteen joined his decades-long bandmate on stage Sunday, Oct. 26 at Asbury Park, New Jersey, for several performances, including “I Don't Want to Go Home,” the opener and title track to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes' first album from 1976, which was produced and arranged by Van Zandt and includes contributions from Springsteen.

A post shared by Stevie Van Zandt (@stevievanzandt)


	Springsteen has been front and center in recent days, thanks to the theatrical release of the biographical drama, Deliver Me from Nowhere, and the well-timed arrival of Nebraska 82': Extended Edition.


	According to The Hollywood Reporter, Deliver Me had to settle for fourth place in its debut after coming in behind expectations with $9.1 million domestically and $7 million internationally from 28 markets for a global start of $16.1 million, though it has yet screen in a number of major markets. The film which had been on track for an open in the $10 million-$12 million range domestically and $20 million globally.


	Springsteen doesn't have any concerts on the slate. But he has hinted at another tour Down Under. Speaking with Rolling Stone earlier this year, the Rock Hall-inducted legend admitted he was long-overdue a long haul to Australia. “I'm doing my best as we speak to get down there, hopefully next year sometime. And I feel bad,” he remarked. “I apologize to my Australian fans for not getting down on this stretch, but I want them to know that we are planning to get down there as soon as feasible, probably in the next year sometime.”

The prolific 'Yellowstone' creator has inked a film deal that will kick in next year, with a TV agreement set to follow in 2028.

	Taylor Sheridan is getting ready to hang up his spurs at Paramount, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.


	The prolific Yellowstone and Tulsa King writer and director is expected to jump to NBCUniversal, beginning with a film deal that will go into effect next year. The ink on that one is already dry. Sheridan's TV deal with Paramount is not up until the end of 2028, but he is expected to bring that over to NBCUniversal when it ends.




	Puck first reported Sheridan's move. A spokesperson for NBCU declined to comment.

	Sheridan is one of the industry's biggest talents, creating the Yellowstone franchise (along with its multitude of spinoffs like 1923 and 1883), the Sylvester Stallone-led franchise Tulsa King and other programming for Paramount, like Special Ops: Lioness and Mayor of Kingstown. And his work has proven appealing to A-listers, with Kevin Costner, the original star of Yellowstone (a falling-out over the last season perhaps putting a damper on that show), and Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Sam Elliott and Jeremy Renner among the stars to sign on for some of his other shows.

	Sheridan's next film, however, an action-thriller called F.A.S.T., is set up at Warner Bros.


	His NBCUniversal deal is expected to be a rich one (no surprise there), though he will have to create wholly new IP when he does make that jump in a few years' time. As is typical in these deals, Paramount owns Yellowstone and the other franchises he has created for that company. Still, his programming has become a dramatic backbone of the Paramount+ streaming platform, and will likely continue to be for years to come given how many active projects he has, and the long time frame before he joins NBCU for TV projects.

	











	“I spent the first 37 years of my life compromising,” Sheridan told The Hollywood Reporter in a 2023 profile. “When I quit acting, I decided that I am going to tell my stories my way, period. If you don't want me to tell them, fine. Give them back and I'll find someone who does — or I won't, and then I'll read them in some freaking dinner theater. But I won't compromise. There is no compromising.”


	Paramount, now under CEO David Ellison, has made appealing to top talent a priority, inking a long-term deals with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, inking a new film and TV deal with the Duffer brothers, and locking in other key talent and IP. Daily Show host Jon Stewart said Sunday that he is talking to Paramount about extending his time in the host chair for the Comedy Central late night show.


	But NBCU, whose entertainment efforts are led by Donna Langley, has also forged a reputation as being talent-friendly, poaching talent like Christopher Nolan and Seth Rogen, and inking deals with multihyphenates like Snoop Dogg.


	Sheridan and his 101 Studios famously shoots in Texas and Montana, and his company in fact partnered with Paramount to expand their footprint in Texas earlier this year in a bid to boost production in the state,

There are two things that any adaptation, prequel, sequel, or imaginary story that's rooted itself in the power of Stephen King's IT has got to manage. It's got to be nightmarish—not just scary or shocking because scares and shocks are cheap coin that spends easy in the realm of horror, but nightmarish, dream logic in the worst, most creeping of ways, as that's how “this spooky clown wants to kill you” goes from goofball comedy to shit that sticks in a reader's brain for life. And you've got to get the kids right, which is probably even harder, if IT director Andy Muschietti's new TV prequel to his own blockbuster duology, Welcome To Derry, is anything to go by. 

We open in early 1962, and in fairly fine form, as a young kid named Matty Clements (Miles Ekhardt) attempts to steal a little happiness from an unkind world. As we know from overheard chatter—one thing we'll learn early, and often, in Derry is that its residents love speaking in expository shorthand—Matty comes from a crappy home, so why not sneak into a theater to enjoy a few minutes of the Robert Preston version of The Music Man? After a brief altercation with an overly dogmatic usher (and a save from the projectionist's daughter), Matty decides to bid Derry farewell forever, sticking out his thumb and having the apparent good luck to hitch a ride with a family exuding an aura of nuclear good cheer.

What follows is the Welcome To Derry pilot's one truly affecting scene, as Muschietti—who directs here, working from a script by Argylle's Jason Fuchs—keeps a steady hand on the tension knob until just long enough for it to be time to rip the fucker off. The family is a little weird initially, sure, but so is Matty, who self-soothes by sucking noisily on a pacifier and can only answer questions about where he wants to go with “anywhere but Derry.” It's not until the daughter starts casually toying with a home-packed tub of “LIVER” that alarm bells start going off, as she threatens to smear their passenger/prisoner with blood. By then, you start to notice the increasingly manic gleam in each character's eyes, the too-chipper tone, the rising cacophony of spelling words and ugly recriminations—and that's before Mother begins giving instant, screaming, exultant birth. With the doors locked and the cheerful screaming only rising in tone, Matty—who has unwittingly found himself the central figure of what would in other circumstances be a great little horror short—has no choice but to close his eyes, block his ears, and pray the nightmare sufferer's last resort: Please let this not be real. 

No such luck, as we jump simultaneously through the show's opening titles and four months of time, as Derry has very quickly gotten over the disappearance of one whole entire boy. The only exceptions to the “move on and forget about it” crowd are those kids who were closest to Matty Clements, and even that's a relative distinction. “Loony” Lilly Bainbridge (Clara Stack) seems to have had some genuine affection for the kid, if a later flashback to New Year's Eve is anything to go off. But young comic nerd Teddy Uris (Mikkal Karim-Fidler) and his conspiracy-theory buddy Phil (Jack Molloy Legault) are wrestling, in part, with the fact that they didn't know Matty all that well and only hung out with him out of a blend of pity and treat-based bribery. Nevertheless, they find themselves steadily drawn into the investigation into his death—not least of which because it's been 27 years since the last time something targeted Derry's children, and IT's got them in its sights.

But it's here, unfortunately, where we're going to have to address the single biggest problem that's dragging Welcome To Derry down in its initial offering: Its total inability to make these kids feel authentic, either as horror protagonists, 1960s residents, or even just living, speaking beings. Muschietti had some decent success with this kind of thing in the IT movies, but he was working with both a better caliber of script and a blockbuster movie-level of casting power: Stack, Karim-Fidler, Legault, and Amanda Christine (who has less to do here as the aforementioned projectionist's daughter, Ronnie, eventually roped into the situation as one of the last people to see Matty alive) all have decent enough stage presence. But they wrestle with a script that has no grasp of how to make these characters sound like human beings,and staging that often feels more akin to sitcom work than drama or horror. Mock some of King's folksy affectations (and stranger plotting choices) if you like, but the man is one of the most razor-sharp writers of dialogue to ever publish. His version of the Losers Club felt real, to a kid, allowing horror to anchor in the audience's affection for them. Fuchs' script can't even come close to matching it, instead sounding, well, the way a screenwriter might imagine kids talking to each other: quippy, weightless, and written in the cadences of punchlines and clichés, rather than human feeling. The effort to launder such weak material strands the show's young cast in the weeds for huge chunks of “The Pilot.”

Some of that looseness of characterization might also be a consequence of the episode's nastiest structural trick: the way it races to build up this bargain-bin version of the Loser's Club just so it can tear through them at the episode's climax. It's a bold decision, even if having Phil and Teddy get apparently slaughtered by the mutant baby from the hour's opening, just one episode into their tenure as “main characters,” can't match the somnambulistic horror of that earlier sequence. (It's possible I've watched Dead Alive one too many times to find a grotesque murder baby anything but amusing, even as it's ripping off little kids' arms.) Burning through characters it spent a huge amount of its running time developing does give Welcome To Derry's first episode a sense of genuine unpredictability that's valuable. At the same time, it makes it even easier to dismiss these characters as lightly sketched-in stereotypes of King-type (or, if I'm being less charitable, Stranger Things-type) child heroes. 

It also feeds into the episode's other big oddity, one that's been reflected in the structure of this review itself: the whole other, completely disconnected plotline happening during its run, focused on its apparent adult lead, Air Force Major Leroy Hanlon. (portrayed by Jovan Adepo, playing a character tackled by Steven Williams in IT.) Besides young plane-watcher Phil being obsessed with the goings-on at the local air base, Leroy exists in what is functionally a whole other TV show than the one focused on the kids, facing off against a racist flight crew member, getting wooed by military official James Remar, and ultimately being the subject of a bizarre night-time attack by gas-mask wearing thugs who want him to reveal secrets about the military plane he's been brought to Derry to test. Adepo imposes a quiet confidence on Leroy—despite being forced to share scenes with Rudy Mancuso, who's basically playing a cartoon—but his adventures on the base have no apparent connection to the shaggy-dog story the show is telling with the kids. Muschietti and Fuchs seem completely disinterested in even having these two plotlines rhyme, and it contributes to a messy sense of walking into a show while the table's still being set.

Along with the aforementioned woes of its child actors, it's that lack of cohesion that hurts Welcome To Derry the most in this initial outing. There are dollops of themes being tossed around here—most notably the pervading threat of nuclear war, with the series taking place just six months before the outbreak of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But these arrive more as name-checks than ideas, with an antagonist content to amuse itself with gory monster babies than anything more evocative of genuine horror. (See also the show's early fumblings toward addressing Leroy's difficulties as a Black man in the 1960s military, which show up here as pretty much just one asshole mechanic and some ominous looks from Perry Mason star Chris Chalk. Viewers hoping the show would dive in more deeply to King's ideas about how IT uses the prejudices, hatred, and indifferent blind eyes of its flock to empower itself—exemplified in the book's description of the burning of the Black Spot nightclub in the 1930s—won't be getting it in this specific episode, at least.) If Welcome To Derry is going to be something more than “IT in eight episodes instead of two movies”—and there is some suggestion, with that ruthless ending, that that's the intended goal—it's going to need a level of focus that's lacking here. As is, we've got some effective scares, but acting, and especially writing, that can't live up to the series' pedigree.

The comedian's one-year deal to helm the Comedy Central late night show Mondays is up in December.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


Jon Stewart has said he's not going anywhere, and he's trying to put that in writing.


	The comedian, whose contract to host The Daily Show is up in December, said “we're working on staying” during a conversation with New Yorker editor David Remnick at Sunday's New Yorker Festival, when Remnick asked if the Comedy Central host was going to “sign another” contract.




	Beyond that, when asked by Remnick if he does indeed want to stay at the helm of the Comedy Central late night show he left in 2015 and returned to in early 2024, hosting on Mondays, Stewart agreed. If it's up to him, he wants to stay.

					Jimmy Kimmel Thinks ABC Should've Hired Jon Stewart for His Late Night Slot: "That Was a Mistake"		
			









	It was roughly a year ago when Stewart announced he was staying on at The Daily Show through December 2025, but since then Donald Trump has returned to the White House and Paramount has merged with David Ellison's Skydance.


	Stewart even referred to Paramount Skydance CEO Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as his “new boss.”


	In recent months, Stewart's Paramount colleague and former Daily Show co-worker Stephen Colbert announced that CBS' The Late Show would be ending, and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel had his show suspended. CBS, which like Comedy Central is owned by Paramount, announced in July that Colbert's The Late Show would come to an end in May 2026. Though the network claimed it was “purely a financial decision,” the move came just days after Colbert criticized Paramount for a $16 million settlement with Trump in a lawsuit he had filed over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 Democratic challenger Kamala Harris. ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended for less than a week after comments Kimmel made in a monologue about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassin went viral, FCC commissioner Brendan Carr threatened ABC's affiliate licenses over the host's remarks and at least two affiliate groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, planned to preempt Kimmel's show.

	











	Stewart, too, has criticized the 60 Minutes settlement and suggested that the Late Show cancellation was connected to Colbert's critical comments about the lawsuit and President Trump. And he skewered the Kimmel suspension with a satirical, “administration-compliant” edition of The Daily Show.


	“The fact that CBS didn't try to save their No. 1 rated late night franchise that's been on the air for over three decades is part of what's making everybody wonder: Was this ‘purely financial'? Or maybe it's the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger to kill a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president who's so insecure that he's suffering terribly from a case of chronic penis insufficiency,” Stewart said on The Daily Show days after news broke of The Late Show cancellation.


	He added, “If you're trying to figure out why Stephen's show is ending, I don't think the answer can be found in some smoking gun email or phone call from Trump to CBS executives or in CBS QuickBooks spreadsheets on the financial health of late night. I think the answer is in the fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America's institutions at this very moment, institutions that have chosen not to fight the vengeful and vindictive actions of our…commander-in-chief. To those corporations and advertisers and universities and law firms, all of them, if you still think that bending the knee to Trump will save you, I have one thing to say [breaking into song]: I know you're scared, I know you're weary, I know your plans don't include me, but these are troubled times, so sack the fuck up!”

	











	And he said at the time of his own late night future: “I'm not going anywhere. I think.”


	Paramount Skydance has also made changes at CBS News. The conglomerate has hired the former CEO of the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute, Kenneth Weinstein, as CBS News' ombudsman and contrarian journalist Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News, with Paramount acquiring her The Free Press.


	When Remnick asked specifically about the “I think” comment Sunday, Stewart merely quipped, “I'm neurotic,” but he indicated throughout the conversation — which covered Trump's second term, Stewart's issues with the Democratic party and the dangers of social media algorithms — that he plans to keep fighting and urges others to do the same.


	“You don't compromise on what you do, and you do it until they tell you to leave,” he said


	Stewart also spoke about his satirical approach to Kimmel's suspension.


	“I think it rattled everyone to some extent, but it also presented great opportunity, and so I don't know that we've had as much fun as we did that Thursday morning, coming up with all the stupid little shit that you see, including, like, gold pictures and red ties. You know, it gave us some purpose.”


	That said, Stewart argued that comedians aren't “the victims of this administration.”


	“We are a visible manifestation of certain things, but the victims are the people that are struggling to have any voice and are being forcibly removed from streets by hooded agents — those are the victims of this administration,” he said.

	











	Stewart also spoke about the recent controversy over a number of comedians performing in Saudi Arabia, yet he took a more nuanced approach and seemed reluctant to attack those who performed at the Riyadh Comedy Festival.


	“I don't touch other people's money,” he said, “It's hard, man.”


	“I thought the only person who should've done it was Pete Davidson, because they owe him money,” he quipped, alluding to how Davidson's firefighter father famously died responding to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.


	He added, “I want to fix my house. I want to operate with integrity, but I don't want to gatekeep.… I think a lot of comics who came out and really shit on those guys, I know a couple of them, and I know them actually to be. like, garbage humans, so it's hard for me to watch that sort of thing. I would prefer if they would have just come out and said, it's money, and not, like, it's a way to start a conversation. Like, would you have started the conversation for $2,500? That's the difference.… We all have our lines that we are willing to cross.… We get into a problem when we're unforgiving in any way, when we offer no grace. And that doesn't mean that I don't have lines that I draw…but I do try to not be so rigid in the way that I think society has become.”


	As for Trump, Stewart pointed to his ability to tap into a dissatisfaction with the government and “harness the anger and catastrophizing” of social media as explanations for his electoral victory.


	“There's a reason Donald Trump came to power, and that is that in the general populace's mind, government no longer serves the interests of the people it purports to represent,” he said. “That's a broad-based, deep feeling, and that helps when someone comes along and goes, the system is rigged, and people go, yeah, it is.”

	











	Stewart was unsparing, though, in his critique of the Democratic party, condemning the party's “passivity…to stick with the status quo that most people felt was not working for their needs.”


	And though he praised Zohran Mamdani's candidacy for New York City mayor, comments that earned cheers and applause in Manhattan's Webster Hall, Stewart struggled to name a national leader for the Democratic party.


	After pausing when he was asked, audience members suggested that Stewart himself could be that leader, which he saw as a sign of desperation and frustration.


	“Have we really gotten to that point?… That's also a function of frustration, a cry of desperation. I'm other; I'm none of the above,” he said, before later adding, “The Democratic party is ripe for what happened to the Republican party in 2016. But hopefully it will be somebody who uses that power for good and not for self-aggrandizing and not for their own gratification.”


	Still, he did offer some indication of hope, pointing to the large attendance at the No Kings rallies last weekend.


	“When 7 million people show up in America on a weekend for anything, I mean, honestly, anything,” he said. “We're not Russia, and their history of autocracy or dictatorship…is an alien culture to us, and it is uncomfortable, and that discomfort may be our saving grace. And don't think we're going to wear that well. That doesn't mean we're not going to be in some kind of soft autocracy where news is controlled, but we have a lot of different avenues, and suppression creates opportunity and a populace that is thirsty for inspiration and leadership and morality and integrity…that's fertile ground for that opportunity.”

Filmmakers Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti on that surprising movie theater scene, and what really happened during the show's opening sequence: "Nobody has ever asked me that question and it really made me think." 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


The following contains spoilers for the first episode of HBO‘s It: Welcome to Derry. 


	Oh my God, they killed Teddy! 




	And Phil! 


	And Susie! 


	The season premiere of It: Welcome to Derry introduced a new young Losers Club that was seemingly going to be the focal point of the season moving forward and then promptly seemingly murdered several of them in a chaotic climactic scene that was set in a movie theater.

					'IT: Welcome to Derry' Creators Clear Up the Big "Misconception" About Pennywise		
			









	The surprise slaughter followed an opening sequence in which yet another young character — Matty — was killed off, which perhaps lulled the audience into thinking something along the lines of: OK, that was similar to what happened in the first It movie, where Pennywise killed one child in the opening, now the rest of the kids are going to be safe. But they weren't. Instead, the show's creators pulled a bunch of Barbs.

	











	Filmmakers Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the opening scene and that movie theater sequence.


	“Yeah, it's exactly as you said, you want to create an event that gives the audience a sense that if these kids were smoked at the end of the first episode, nothing is sacred,” Andy Muschietti said. “In this world, no one will be safe. So, technically, that was the intention.”


	“Also, it responds to the idea of subverting certain aspects,” he continued. “We did two movies already. One thing that we didn't want was to — given that we're using the same tone and the style as the movies — is get people too familiar [with the story mechanics]. We really wanted to create a subversion to get people excited. It has to do also with raising the volume a little in terms of intensity and spectacle.” 

	











	As for whether the kids are truly dead, that's supposed to be slightly unclear moving forward. But the answer for now is: Seemingly, yes (one is, at the very least, short an arm). 


	We also asked the duo a somewhat philosophical question about the opening sequence with Matty trapped in the car, being carried off to his doom: What is happening in reality during this? Pennywise can take on various forms and create illusions. But he doesn't, presumably, have a car. So if you're an observer standing on the side of that road, what are you seeing happen to Matty when he's going through this? 


	“Answering that question would somehow kill the magic,” Andy Muschietti said. “Because there's always the lingering concept that we believe in that It exists because the kids believe what they see. So it's a feedback between believing in something that you see and creating something that you believe. It's an abstraction, but that's really one of the strong themes in the book. There's a point where the Losers Club in [the book wonder], ‘Does this exist because it's real or because we believe in it?' So that's a question that I can't answer as an external viewer. Would you see Matty flying in an invisible car? Or it was all in his head? Or was there actually a manifestation of the car? That's a big question and I'm not brave enough to answer it because it is one of the great enigmas in the book that has to be unsolved.”


	He then added, “Nobody has ever asked me that question, and it really made me think.”

	











	Also, in case you're wondering where Pennywise was during this episode, the filmmakers are intentionally holding the killer clown back a bit. As Andy Muschietti explained during our previous chat, “We did ‘less is more' for half the show, but then we did ‘more is more.' The idea behind the delayed appearance is the buildup of expectation. The audience doesn't know that they want it, but I think it creates a very special feeling. When and where the clown is going to appear was a game that I wanted to play with the audience.”


It: Welcome to Derry airs Sundays on HBO.

Tired of the AI-generated slop clogging up your timelines? Of course you are! Thankfully, the world of stop-motion animation is enjoying a revival. On the heels of Guillermo del Toro getting Netflix to help fund a stop-motion animation school and Paranorman returning to the box office, Laika has released a behind-the-scenes first-look featurette on their next film, Wildwood. The clip, which runs less than three minutes, emphasizes the handcrafted puppets developed to make its main bird, The General (a golden giant eagle voiced by Angela Bassett), fly. Nine thousand feathers later, Wildwood is about ready for take off.



Adapted from the book by Decemberists frontman Colin Meloy and illustrated by Carson Ellis, Wildwood is the second stop-motion movie from Travis Knight, Laika's lead animator, CEO, and the director of Kubo And The Two Strings. The movie has been in development since the book's 2011 publication and was initially expected in theaters by 2014. Laika even produced a trailer for the book, but this kind of thing takes time. Since then, Meloy published two more Wildwood books, turning the book into a trilogy that he and Ellis completed in 2014.



Wildwood follows Prue McKeel (Peyton Elizabeth Lee) and her friend Curtis Mehlberg (Jacob Tremblay) into a magical world “just beyond the edge of Portland” as they quest for her baby brother, Mac, who was kidnapped by a murder of crows. She teams with The General, a majestic golden eagle who watches over the creatures of Wildwood, to find her lost brother. However, there's also the problem of Maxim, the “terrifying” antagonist played by Tom Waits, to contend with. The film co-stars Bassett, Waits, Carey Mulligan, Mahershala Ali, Jemaine Clement, Jake Johnson, Charlie Day, Amandla Stenberg, Maya Erskine, Tantoo Cardinal, and Richard E. Grant.

No release date has been set, but Wildwood is expected to land in theaters next year.

Rita Wilson celebrated her 69th birthday on October 26, and her proud husband, Tom Hanks, shared a sweet post on Instagram to mark the occasion. 

A post shared by Tom Hanks (@tomhanks)

Hanks shared a photo on Instagram of Wilson wearing a black swimsuit. The image is cropped to show only the musician's top half. You can see she has been swimming, and there is water in the background. She looks terrific as she smiles for the camera. 

The “A Man Called Otto” actor wrote a sweet message in the caption. “This beautiful woman celebrates her birthday TODAY.  She is beloved by her husband. Happy Birthday, @ritawilson!” he wrote. He disabled the comments on the picture, but it has been liked over 66,000 times in support from fans.

Wilson and Hanks have one of the most beautiful love stories, and their marriage has withstood the test of time. The pair have been married since 1988 and share two sons, Chester “Chet” Hanks and Truman Hanks. The couple first met on the set of the sitcom “Bosom Buddies” in 1981. At the time, they were just friends, and the actor was married to his first wife, Samantha Lewes. 

The pair would reunite on the set of “Volunteers” in 1985, where they played love interests. “Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that,” Hanks told GQ, People reports. “I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied.”

In 1986, Wilson and Hanks made their relationship debut at the premiere of “Three Amigos,” People reports.

Over the years, the couple has given a glimpse into their almost 40-year marriage and what it means to each of them. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Hanks was asked about the “magic” he shares with Wilson, and he gave an honest and beautiful reply. 

“I view my wife as my lover, and we have a bond that goes beyond words like wife or girlfriend or mother,” he told Winfrey. “For example, I was able to construct a number of things in ‘Philadelphia' because of my relationship with Rita. The way my character felt about his lover is the way I feel about mine. The same was true when I played Forrest Gump, who loved Jenny. Without my connection with Rita, I don't know how I would've been able to connect with what Forrest was going through.”

Beautiful story! To be that lucky,to me, would be like winning 100 lotterys. I'm 62 and have resigned myself to the fact of never having love in my life again.

Normally, a canceled Star Wars movie would not cause a disturbance in the Force, but not all canceled Star Wars movies are The Hunt For Ben Solo. Revealed earlier this week by Adam Driver, The Hunt For Ben Solo would've portrayed the continued adventures of his character, Ben Solo, after the events of Rise Of Skywalker. Described by the actor as “one of the coolest fucking scripts I had ever been a part of,” Driver enlisted Stephen Soderbergh to direct, and the pair submitted a script by Scott Z. Burns, who wrote Bourne Ultimatum and The Informant!, as well as some uncredited work on Rogue One. Though it was greenlit, it wasn't meant to be. Disney CEO Bob Iger put the kibosh on The Hunt because he didn't understand how Solo could've survived The Rise Of Skywalker. “No one's ever really gone” except for Ben Solo, apparently.

Emboldened by the successful attempts to save the Snyder Cut in 2020, which resulted in $70 million being poured into finishing Zach Snyder's Justice League, Star Wars fans have begun bullying Disney into giving them the canceled Star Wars movie they've been dreaming of all week. A mere three days after Driver broke the news that there's another canceled Star Wars movie that we didn't even know about, fans rented a plane to fly a banner over Disney headquarters that reads, “Save #TheHuntForBenSolo.” Today, Collider reports, a fan named B.D. Neagle paid for a Times Square billboard encouraging Disney to make the movie. Against a starry background and in blue Star Wars font (which looks more Trek than Wars, but we're going to let it go), the sign reads, “For Adam. No one's ever really gone. Hope lives. Ben is alive! #THBS.” The billboard is above Carlos Bakery at 1500 Broadway in New York City and can be viewed as you're walking over there.

“The intent was to show Disney this is what fans actually want. ‘No one's ever really gone,' I believe, says it all,” Neagle told Collider. “If they could bring back Palpatine with one line, there are plenty of ways Ben could return that already fit into Star Wars lore. What makes this fight for Ben Solo different is that we know a finished script exists. There was a director attached, and Adam Driver himself had been looking for a way to tell Ben's story. It's no longer simply wanting a character to return. It's about fighting for a story that was ready to be told. We know it's out there, and because of that, we're not giving up. We want Disney to know they made a mistake. It's not often the Star Wars fandom agrees and that alone should tell them something.”

Neagle is right about that. It isn't every day that Star Wars fans agree, and this is the first canceled Star Wars project in recent memory that fans have gone out of their way to support. This reminds us, whatever happened to that Rey movie?

TOPICS:

Dakota Fanning is single, but not for long according to a psychic.



Her younger sister, Elle, apparently went for a supernatural session and filled her in on what the future supposedly holds for her.

"My sister spoke to a psychic who said, 'Your sister is not going to meet the person she is going to marry until she's 32,'” the actress said. "She told me that a few years ago and I was, like, 32? I don't have time for that."

The currently 31-year-old did reveal her dream future with a fella includes settling down on a farm and having three kids.



But the “Equalizer” star is over the dating apps.

"Oh my God, ask your single girlfriends! Every man is like: 'Must love mountain biking, and want to go on a hike, and want to be really adventurous and outdoorsy, must love dogs and want to go to the summit of Everest,'” she joked. "I'm like, no, I don't want to do any of that and if I do I'll do it when I want to ... It's every guy. Then it's a shirtless picture of them on a mountain.

She added, "You're like, dude, save it please."

Unfortunately blind dates set up by friends haven't been successful yet either.



"You're like, is this what you think of me? Then you question the friendship with that person ... I know what I have to give and I know what I deserve in return. I'm super-happy to wait for that,” she said.

Her big dream is to start a family. “Being a mother is the pinnacle to me. It's the thing I can't wait for most in my life,” she told the outlet. "I can't remember a time when I didn't want kids. For whatever reason it is something in me."

There's no denying that Supernatural never branded itself as a show that promised happy endings. In fact, if anything, we know that nothing ever goes quite right for Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles). These two lost more family members, friends, and flames than we could count, with Alona Tal's Jo Harville being one of the biggest losses of them all. But what was already a major loss for the show could have been much worse if Dean and Jo had become more of an item than they appeared to be. Yes, contrary to what some fans were hoping for, it was probably a good thing that these two never got together.

From the moment that Jo was first introduced in Season 2, aiming a shotgun right at Dean's midsection in the middle of the Harvelle's Roadhouse, we knew there was something bubbling between them. The will-they/won't-they question brewed throughout the first half of the season, itching at viewers with unceasing irritation. For some, the idea that Dean would settle down with anyone was kind of preposterous, but for others, there wasn't a more perfect young woman for the elder Winchester to attach himself to. Even after going on a hunt with the brothers, which nearly killed her, Jo didn't back down. But Supernatural failed to commit to the romance, sweeping it under the rug as quickly as it did the character herself. Ultimately, the show thought it would be best to keep these two apart, instead introducing other love interests for Dean as early as the next season.

Jo and her mother Ellen (Samantha Ferris) were written off Supernatural as quickly as they arrived, but (anticipating its end after the fifth season's Apocalypse arc), eventually this mother-daughter pair returned. But when they did, the show was careful not to push Dean and Jo together, even though it had no trouble teasing us with it. In her final episode in the land of the living (Season 5's “Abandon All Hope”), Jo chooses “self-respect” over spending her “last night on Earth” with the elder Winchester. While it was definitely a bummer at the time, knowing how much worse it would have been for Dean in the long run makes us grateful that Supernatural never forced the pair into becoming an official item. After all, the next time Dean tried to settle down and have a family, it ended with him having to wipe their minds to keep them from harm's way.

Considering that Dean had lost nearly everyone he ever cared about, the death of Jo could've been so much worse had they actually committed to each other in the end. Sure, they shared a tender kiss before her death, but it was more of a reminder of what they might have had rather than what they actually allowed themselves. Admittedly, not every character on Supernatural has that sort of self-awareness, but at that moment, the two knew it was now or never; this was it. And, frankly, it was good that it ended there. Had Jo survived and started something more official with Dean, it would've changed the whole landscape of the show — and sullied that perfect ending for the character set up in Season 5's "Swan Song."

 For Jo, being a hunter was always more important than settling down. Her father died on a hunt, and in her view, the best way to honor his legacy was to follow in his footsteps, much to her mother's chagrin. But eventually, Ellen got over it, and the pair ended up hunting together for several years before their untimely death, taking out a few hellhounds to give Sam and Dean an edge on the Devil (Mark Pellegrino). As for Dean, well, he never had any luck with love — to the point where he mostly gives up altogether by the show's end. Given how long Supernatural lasted on television, these two would've been doomed from the start, so playing it safe, forcing the audience to imagine their potential, was the wisest move.

But arguably the biggest reason that Supernatural was wise to pivot from a true-blue Dean and Jo romance was that it would have too drastically changed the show itself. What made Supernatural great in the beginning was that Sam and Dean were somewhat akin to classical Western heroes. They rode into town for a job, and left as quickly as they came. The hunt came first, and while they were always risking life and limb for one another, adding a romantic component would've made it all the messier. It would have added an extra level of stress and drama to an already perfect weekly dynamic. The show even makes this point itself in the Season 3 opener, "The Magnificent Seven," where married hunter couple Isaac (Peter Macon) and Tamara (Caroline Chikezie) are broken apart in the middle of a hunt when the former is killed by the Seven Deadly Sins. Tamara is so shaken, she never returns to the show.

Jo's death is already hard enough to watch with her and Dean not being together, especially since Season 7's "Defending Your Life" reveals how the elder Winchester blames himself for it. How much more so would this have affected Dean had they been an item? This isn't to say that Dean cared about Jo any less when she undertook the big sleep, just that if he had allowed himself to picture a life with her, it would have weighed as heavily on him as Jessica Moore's (Adrianne Palicki) did on Sam throughout the series. Dean had already carried enough pain, grief, and guilt throughout the show; there was no need to add anymore — especially since Supernatural would've never committed to Jo full-time.

It's not exactly a secret that whenever Supernatural introduced a new love interest, things never turned out well for them. Even those who stuck through to the end (such as Shoshannah Stern's Eileen Lehay) were often pushed to the wayside in favor of the bond between Sam and Dean themselves. There's no doubt that we're disappointed that Dean and Jo could never make things work. After her death, Dean moved on to his aforementioned old flame Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson), who likewise was written out before long. And that's not to mention his Season 1 love interest, Cassie Robinson (Megalyn Echikunwoke), who was the only one of these ladies to make it out unscathed — only for the show to ignore her completely for the rest of its run. But not letting Jo cave in to Dean's pursuits and clever one-liners was the best thing for him in the long run. It's one thing to lose a friend and loved one, it's another to lose someone who you allowed yourself to love despite knowing how things might turn out.

Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

Vladimir Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing, while FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich says he warned the former world champion about his actions

Many chess players, led by world number one Magnus Carlsen, have linked the sudden death of U.S. grandmaster and commentator Daniel Naroditsky last Monday at age 29 to the attacks from Russian former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, who had been accusing Naroditsky of cheating since 2024. 

Kramnik, however, has denied the allegations he was in any way responsible for Naroditsky's death. ″This tragic event has become an opportunity for some to exploit it for their own interests and to launch an unprecedentedly cynical and unlawful campaign of harassment against me and my family," he wrote in a statement released Saturday. 

The statement comes after Carlsen strongly criticized Kramnik's treatment of Naroditsky. “[Kramnik] started going after Naroditsky so hard — first of all, I don't think anybody thought Naroditsky was cheating… I personally in private expressed that I was sorry for what he was going through and supported him. Probably should have done that publicly as well. The way he was going after Naroditsky was horrible," said Carlsen, who has yet to publicly apologize for his 2022 cheating accusations against another U.S. player, Hans Niemann, which ended in an out-of-court settlement. 

Following Naroditsky's death, Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE, which has 201 member countries), said he had warned Kramnik about his actions. “Other people and I tried to convince Vlad [Kramnik] to change the tone and approach [of his accusations against Naroditsky],” he told EL PAÍS. 

Last Wednesday, Dvorkovich also released an official statement on the case: “Human life and dignity are fundamental values shared by all of us. […]. In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people's reputation but their very well-being."

“The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable,” the statement continued. “The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”

Dvorkovich concluded: “Therefore, I, along with the FIDE Management Board, will formally refer all relevant public statements made by GM Vladimir Kramnik — both before and after the tragic death of GM Daniel Naroditsky — to the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for independent consideration.”

Far from admitting any responsibility, Kramnik argued he had “never made any personal attack or insult towards Daniel Naroditsky.” In his statement, the Russian player said: “Despite the tensions in our relationship, I was the only person in the chess community who, noticing on video Daniel's obvious health issues a day before his death, publicly called for him to receive help.”

“The subsequent attempts, immediately following his passing, to directly link this tragic event to my name-especially in light of this fact-cross all boundaries of basic human morality, in my view,” he added. 

Last week, Kramnik also denied any wrongdoing on X, and suggested a conspiracy may be behind Naroditsky's death. “Without a doubt, this recent tradegy should be investigated by police, there are too many huge financial interests involved to be sure about it being just an incident. I am ready to provide all information required,” he posted last Wednesday. 

That same day, he also shared: “Once I started to reveal in public information about the ‘dark side' of modern chess, I became a subject of the dirtiest possible orchestrated PR campaign, including several documented murder threats, in addition to continues defamation. I have collected extensive material.”

And on Thursday, he stated that he had contacted the Charlotte police (where Naroditsky lived and died) to request an investigation.

For over a year, Naroditsky engaged with Kramnik's claims and provided any evidence he could think of — for example, scanning every detail of the room where he played online games to show that he was not cheating — in an attempt to prove his innocence. On Saturday, October 18, in his final Twitch video (now deleted), he repeatedly spoke about Kramnik while clearly showing over two and a half hours that he was not feeling well.

Among the many signs that Naroditsky was deeply affected by Kramnik's accusations is a YouTube interview on October 27, 2024 (C-Squared channel), conducted by grandmasters Fabiano Caruana and Cristian Chirila, in which Naroditsky said:

“This is a sustained and evil and absolutely unhinged attempt to destroy my life. I'm tired of mincing words at this point. He's trying to ruin my life. He's trying to inflict emotional harm, physical harm on me. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is one of the most wicked people that I've ever dealt with.”

Leontxo García, in addition to being a contributor to EL PAÍS since 1985, is also an advisor to FIDE on educational chess.

Wemby is the definition of different.

While most Americans were glued to NFL action on Sunday afternoon, Victor Wembanyama was putting together one of the best and downright ridiculous performances we could see this NBA season. 

Wembanyama, who doesn't turn 22 until January, is oftentimes called an "alien" given his freakishly long build and playing style that doesn't exactly mirror any of us humans. Those extraterrestrial abilities were on full display Sunday as his San Antonio Spurs played host to the Brooklyn Nets.

While Wembanyama only went 9-for-21 from the floor, he still finished the contest with 31 points, 14 rebounds and six blocks to go along with three steals as well in the Spurs' 118-107 win.

San Antonio was dominant during the first half, and just before the break, Wembanyama strung together a sequence on both sides of the court that is legitimately hard to put into words. 

Two back-to-back blocks at the rim, followed up by taking the ball up the court and pulling up for a deep three-pointer. Guys who are 7-foot-4 are not supposed to do these types of things.

Unstoppable, unguardable, not human, and league MVP if he stays healthy are things that come to mind after seeing that sequence.

It's still incredibly early into the new NBA season, with the Spurs having only played three games, but what we're seeing out of Wemby thus far is utterly insane. 

The Frenchman is averaging 33 points, 13 rebounds, and six blocks per game. He scored 40 points in the Spurs' season-opening win against the Dallas Mavericks in just 30 minutes of action and followed that up with a nine-block performance against the New Orleans Pelicans two nights later.

It's mindboggling to think that Wembanyama is doing these things while still very much developing and filling out his frame as a 21-year-old. Expectations were sky-high for him heading into year three in the NBA, and based on what we've seen through three games this season, it's easy to see why.

Footage shows the bright green fireball bursting over high-rise buildings

THIS is the shocking moment a mysterious giant green fireball UFO careens over Moscow. 

Hundreds of locals were on their morning commute when they noticed the blaze streak through the sky leaving a trail of sparks.

Footage shows the vivid green ball careering over Russia's capital – shining brightly against a pitch black sky.

The blaze is seen speeding over high-rise buildings, bursting into flames, then disappearing in the clouds.

One awe-struck onlooker shared the moment online, amassing thousands of views.

He described seeing a “very bright” and “slow moving” meteor over the city. 

His video garnered widespread attention with many likening the fireball to the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor.

The rock hurtled into Russia at a staggering 12 miles per second and caused widespread damage and injuries.

Although this fireball is not thought to have caused any harm, the bizarre event has raised a number of safety questions. 

Just last year, a huge meteor exploded in a blazing white fireball as it flew at an incredible 3,500mph over Yakutia, Russia's largest and coldest region.

Meanwhile, in the UK Lucky Brits in Northfields and Ealing, west London, reported seeing a bright blob race through the city's sky on Tuesday night.

Others claimed to have seen the unusual sighting from Wimbledon and Hampstead Heath.

And some even reported catching a glimpse as far afield as Brighton and Grantham.

One onlooker described seeing the “streak” of light dash through the clouds at around 8.10pm to 8.30pm, and initially believed it was fireworks.

 It came just days before another incredible “fireball” was spotted over Kent. 

Jamie McBean managed to capture the spectacle on his home's security camera in Herne Bay at 7:10pm.

A stargazer wrote on Reddit: “I'm used to seeing planes coming and going to Heathrow, and also helicopters coming and going; this was not that.

“My next thought was fireworks but I'm 90 per cent sure it wasn't that, and there was no explosion.

“For reference it was about the same size as the full-ish moon tonight, visible through the clouds, but as a much brighter blue-green color and, again, moving quite fast.

“It was a very odd combination of speed, size and brightness and didn't look like anything I've ever seen in the sky here before.”

The events of 'The Nun' were inspired by the real-life paranormal experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren

Warner Bros/Kobal/Shutterstock

 It all started with a farmhouse in Rhode Island.


 Demonologists and paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren — who also investigated the allegedly possessed Annabelle doll and the home from The Amityville Horror — were asked by Carolyn Perron to come help her family, which she said was besieged by spirits in their home.


 The real events that followed became the basis of The Conjuring and inspired an entire cinematic universe. The Nun, the 2018 movie starring Taissa Farmiga and Bonnie Aarons, is a prequel to The Conjuring 2, and it's the first of the Conjuring-universe movies to not feature Ed and Lorraine (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga).


 Set in Romania in 1952, the film centers on Father Burke (Demián Bichir) and Sister Irene (Taissa), who have been sent to a convent to investigate the deaths of two nuns, aided by a local man nicknamed “Frenchie.”


 One of the nuns was allegedly killed by a demon appearing as a nun, and the other died by suicide to avoid being possessed by the evil force. That nefarious entity is Valak, the same demon that appeared to Ed and Lorraine in The Conjuring 2, which takes place in 1977.


 The hit movie was loosely inspired by a couple of the Warrens' documented experiences with the paranormal. Here's the real history behind The Nun, involving noted paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren.

 Among the most famous of all paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine investigated the real-life cases of alleged hauntings and possessions that inspired The Conjuring, The Amityville Horror and Annabelle, among other films and books based on their case files.


 Ed was a so-called demonologist who studied hauntings and possessions, and Lorraine claimed to be a clairvoyant who used her visions to aid their investigations. Ed died in 2006, and Lorraine died in 2019.


 "Our job is to go in, evaluate what's going on, document it, and then turn it over to church authorities," Lorraine told the Springfield Union-News in 1995.


 When work began on The Conjuring, Lorraine coached the cast on how to handle sensitive paranormal experiences.


 "One of the first things Lorraine said to me is that, from her perspective and her knowledge of the diabolical, all of that negative stuff feeds on fear. That is probably something I've learned to push away year after year," Vera told PEOPLE in 2021. "And that's really, honestly, the trick — how does one do that? I don't necessarily have a recipe for that, other than knowing the knowledge of that."


 Wilson also shared a piece of Lorraine's advice on being in allegedly haunted locations.


 "One thing Lorraine did say to me, when I was talking about a supernatural occurrence — long story, but — about these kids and hearing kids' voices, she just very nonchalantly said, 'It's probably a child's spirit who just wants to play,' ” he told PEOPLE. “It was so off the cuff, and it actually did resonate with me: if there is something otherworldly or supernatural or unexplained, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad."

 Valak first appears in The Conjuring 2, when the Warrens are in England, investigating the Enfield poltergeist — the case of a young girl allegedly experiencing a supernatural force taking over her body. In that movie, Lorraine sees visions of a demon dressed as a nun, which can block her clairvoyance. They don't know it at the time, but that demon is Valak.


 In real life, Ed and Lorraine investigated the Enfield poltergeist at the center of the storyline in The Conjuring 2, but their involvement in the investigation of that case was inflated for the plot of the movie. In reality, there's nothing to suggest that the events of the Enfield case were connected to Valak, whose depiction in The Nun is heavily fictionalized from historical depictions.


 However, there are two elements to The Nun that do have ties to real occurrences in the Warrens' work. In the 1970s, Ed and Lorraine investigated the Borley Rectory, a notoriously haunted place in England that had been a religious residence for centuries. When they visited, Lorraine allegedly said, "I feel the presence of a nun in this church.”


 One of the spirits rumored to haunt the place was the ghost of a nun who was buried alive for having an affair with a priest. They also captured a photograph that they believed depicted a spectral nun praying in the rectory's church.


 While talking to Esquire in 2018, the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, speculated that that case could have inspired The Nun. "Is The Nun based on that experience?" Spera said. "I think Hollywood takes bits and pieces of different stories and puts them together ... They couldn't just come up with [The Nun] out of the blue."


 The other element that could be inspired by real-life experiences is the character of Maurice Theriault.

 The character “Frenchie” in The Nun starts out as a good guy trying to help Father Burke and Sister Irene, but he's eventually possessed by Valak who uses him to commit murders in The Nun II. He's based on a Massachusetts man named Maurice “Frenchie” Theriault, who was a real person allegedly possessed by a demon whom Ed and Lorraine attempted to help.


 "Maurice Theriault would bleed from his eyes. During the exorcism his head split open and we have that on film," Ed told the Springfield Union-News in 1995. "Boil eruptions appeared on his skin, and crosses appeared all over his body."


 Theriault killed his wife and died by suicide in 1992, and his claims of possession have been heavily scrutinized, including by his sister, who believed he was putting on the symptoms.


 "If it was mental illness or a fake, why did tables rise off the floor?,” Ed said in the same interview. “We put him in a hospital for six weeks and the doctors couldn't explain it."

 According to historical fables, yes. Valak appears in The Lesser Key of Solomon, a collection of centuries-old writings about demons, although he's depicted as a winged child sitting on a two-headed dragon creature. He is sometimes described as the “grand president of hell,” but there is no association in historic texts of Valak appearing as a nun.


 In a 2022 Instagram post, The Conjuring 2 director and The Nun producer James Wan explained the creative choice to portray Valak as a demonic nun, rather than in a form more faithful to his mythological depictions.


 “The original VALAK in The Conjuring 2 was going to be this winged demon. A beautifully/hideously sculpted animatronic puppet head and practical body-suit,” he explained.


 “As cool as it was, it felt out of place within the Conjuring world we had built,” he continued. “And so during post production, I reconceived the villain — feeling it needed to be something more grounded, more personal, and creepier. And thus the demonic Nun was born.”

 Short answer: no. Neither Father Burke or Sister Irene realize it at the end of the movie, but Valak evades banishment by possessing Frenchie.


 Valak returns for another showdown with Sister Irene in The Nun 2, set in 1956 France, where a series of murders are being attributed to a demonic entity.

 Valak first appears in the Conjuring universe in 2016's The Conjuring 2, when the Warrens encounter a demon in the form of a nun. Lorraine suggests that the demon appears in a religious form to test her faith. But really, the appearance of the demonic nun is a foreshadowing of The Nun, which would be released two years later.


 Other than Valak appearing in both The Conjuring 2 and The Nun, there's no apparent link between the two movies — but in The Nun's sequel, a plot point emerges that ties the movies together. At the end of The Nun II, a post-credits scene reveals that Sister Irene and Lorraine are both descended from St. Lucy, patron saint of the blind, and their second sight is an inherited trait.


 The connections between The Nun and The Conjuring cross over into real life, too. Vera, who plays Lorraine, and Taissa, who plays Sister Irene, are actually sisters.

CHICO, Calif. - Archie McKinnon disappeared 37 years ago after making a chilling phone call to his mother from a bar in Chico. On July 11, 1988, McKinnon told his mother, Marjorie Puccinelli, that people were "after him," but she never heard from him again.

The Butte County Sheriff's Office reported that McKinnon, who was 39 at the time, contacted his mother from a bar on Park Avenue. He had a habit of calling her every day before he vanished. Despite extensive searches, neither McKinnon nor his remains have been found, and foul play is suspected.

McKinnon was reported missing on April 28, 1989, by Puccinelli, who grew concerned after not hearing from him for several months. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and a tan T-shirt. He stood 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighed 150 pounds, and had grey hair, blue eyes, and a scar from his right chest to his left hip.

The Butte County Sheriff's Office is seeking any information that could help locate McKinnon or assist in the ongoing investigation. Those with information are encouraged to contact the Butte County Sheriff's Office at (530) 538-7434. The case number is 89-13018.

A surprising spike in underwater anomalies along U.S. coastlines has sparked alarm among defence officials after a popular tracking app, Enigma, recorded thousands of sightings of so-called Unidentified Submersible Objects, or USOs.

The app, which describes itself as the world's largest searchable database of UFO and UAP sightings, claims to have logged more than 30,000 unexplained events since its launch in late 2022.

But while unidentified flying objects have long dominated public imagination, Enigma's latest data suggests something far stranger may be happening below the surface. Hundreds of new reports describe mysterious glowing objects rising from the depths or disappearing into the water without leaving a ripple.

The revelations have left both enthusiasts and experts speculating about what lies beneath — from advanced military technology to phenomena science has yet to explain.

According to Marine Technology News, Enigma has recorded over 9,000 mysterious sightings within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines or major bodies of water. More than 150 of these describe objects hovering just above or plunging into the water. The states topping the list are California, with 389 USO reports, and Florida, with 306 — both coastal states with vast maritime zones.

Enigma has also released detailed maps showing clusters of orange dots up and down the east and west coasts. One of the strangest videos submitted to the platform shows eerie green lights moving beneath the ocean's surface, leaving experts and enthusiasts baffled.

While UFO sightings are often dismissed as optical illusions or misidentifications, some experts say underwater versions could be far more serious.

Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who previously served as acting head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, warned that these anomalies could have major implications for national security.

'The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering U.S. water space and the Department of Defense is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows,' Gallaudet said in a 2024 report.

He called the objects' apparent ability to move seamlessly between air and water 'world-changing,' and warned that ignoring the phenomenon could 'jeopardize U.S. maritime security.'

Gallaudet referenced one infamous incident in 2019, when the USS Omaha tracked a spherical object flying over the Pacific near San Diego before it plunged into the ocean and disappeared. Pentagon officials later verified the footage, noting the object left no wake or debris.

Unidentified Submersible Objects, or USOs, refer to any object or phenomenon detected underwater that cannot be identified or explained. They are the aquatic counterparts of UFOs or UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena).

Witnesses, from medieval sailors to modern Navy sonar operators, have described similar encounters - objects that move at extraordinary speeds, change direction instantly, or cross between sea and sky with 'transmedium' capabilities that defy the laws of physics.

Historical accounts stretch back centuries. In the 11th century, witnesses in England described a fiery object that 'revolved, ascended on high, and then descended into the sea.'

In 1825, naturalist Andrew Bloxam reported seeing a red, luminous orb rise from the ocean while sailing aboard HMS Blonde. 'It was the color of a red-hot cannon shot,' he wrote, bright enough that 'a pin might be picked up on deck.'

Reports continue into the present day. Veteran Navy sonar operator Aaron Amick has said that 'fast mover' contacts occasionally appear on sonar, describing them as 'so quick that you can't measure the speed.'

Gallaudet, testifying before the U.S. House Oversight Committee in late 2024, reiterated that such incidents cannot be easily dismissed.

'Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,' he said in his 29-page report for the Sol Foundation.

What makes USOs so confounding is that they blur the line between natural and artificial phenomena. Some experts speculate that secret military drones or advanced underwater vehicles could account for a portion of sightings. Others insist the speeds and maneuvers reported go far beyond current human technology.

As for Enigma's data, it paints a picture of persistent, widespread sightings along U.S. coasts, particularly near naval training zones and busy shipping routes. Whether coincidence or clue, it has renewed calls for deeper investigation.

For now, the ocean remains the least understood domain on Earth. As Gallaudet put it, 'We know more about the surface of Mars than our own deep sea.'

The truth is under there.

A popular UFO-reporting app has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways — phenomena which high-ranking US Navy officials warn could pose a threat to national security.

Enigma, which touts itself as the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” claims it has received reports on over 30,000 Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena since launching in late 2022.

But the sightings haven't been limited to the skies, with reports also coming in about strange objects rising from the depths of the sea, or plunging into the water without so much as a splash.

As of August, Enigma has also logged more than 9,000 mysterious sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines or major bodies of water — 500 of them within 5 miles — with more than 150 of the reports describing objects hovering above or descending into waterways, according to Marine Technology News.

The US states with the most reported USO sightings were California (389) and Florida (306) — both among the top three US states with the most ocean coastline. One of the most bizarre reports includes phone camera video of unexplained green lights traveling beneath the surface of the ocean.

The app has released maps plotting out the reported sightings, represented as clusters of orange dots running up and down the east and west coasts.

UFO sightings are nothing new, and are often dismissed as crackpottery by much of the scientific community or relegated to the stuff of science fiction, but retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet warns UFOs with the ability to go from air to sea without crashing or even creating a splash could have “world-changing” ramifications.

“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” Gallaudet wrote in a March 2024 report.

Alarm bells were raised in July 2019, when the USS Omaha recorded a UFO/UAP that vanished into the ocean without a trace after buzzing a Navy fleet off the coast of San Diego. Video of the incident was verified by the Pentagon, displaying capabilities Gallaudet said “jeopardizes U.S. maritime security, which is already weakened by our relative ignorance about the global ocean.”

In his 29-page report for UFO-focused think tank the Sol Foundation, Gallaudet said there's a documented pattern of similar phenomena being reported.

“Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,” he wrote.

The trailer for Yorgos Lanthimos' film "Bugonia" starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons. In select theaters Oct. 24, wide release Oct. 31. 

Conspiracy theories have become more than a harmless hobby for certain folks. They go down online rabbit holes and choose their own truths versus what's actually reality. To conspiracists, everything presented to them only reinforces what they believe, becoming part of their identity.

"Bugonia" is a reflection of the times we live in.

Yorgos Lanthimos' latest — an English-language remake of the 2003 South Korean flick "Save the Green Planet!" — follows Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons), a paranoid beekeeper and a package scanner for the pharmaceutical giant Auxolith, who plots to kidnap the company's CEO Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), someone who he thinks is an alien hellbent on destroying Earth. 

‘GOOD FORTUNE' REVIEW: A RAGS-TO-RICHES SATIRE WITH WINGS

Fuller is an Elizabeth Holmes-type boss — robotic-sounding to her staff, always wearing the same white blouse and black jacket as seen in several magazine covers and framed photos, obsessed with wellness. 

Teddy is a leader in his own right, too. He's a one-man "human resistance" as he calls himself, two if you count his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), serving as a loyal henchman of sorts. Don expresses his concerns about getting caught, to which Teddy assures him, "No one on Earth gives a single f--- about us." 

Disguising in comical Jennifer Aniston paper masks they find at a store, Teddy and Don carry out the mission and abduct Fuller (who puts up a good fight, briefly) outside her home and take her back to his house in the middle of nowhere. Teddy orders Don to shave an unconscious Fuller's hair. Her hair helps her communicate with her home planet, of course.

As Fuller is chained in the basement, the normally unkempt Teddy and Don dress up in suits as they are in the presence of a high-ranking alien official. Teddy demands Fuller take them to her mothership, accusing her of killing his family, co-workers and the bees.

Fuller humorously maintains her business-like composure, telling Teddy, "I hear where you're coming from, but I respectfully disagree." The high-powered honcho also warns him that the police will track them down, saying her abduction is like that of a governor, "but worse."

The dynamic between Teddy and Don is a compelling one. Teddy presents himself as Don's protector (Don, like Delbis in real life, is autistic). He promises Don people will think he's a hero if they carry out their plan, yet Don is the voice of reason as he expresses quiet skepticism towards Teddy's warped reality. 

"Bugonia" marks Stone's fourth collaboration with Lanthimos — she won her second Oscar for 2023's "Poor Things." Per usual, she is superb in the role of Michelle Fuller, the out-of-touch executive who subtly modifies her strategy in hopes of escaping captivity. 

‘ONE BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER' REVIEW: LEONARDO DICAPRIO GOES FOR LAUGHS IN POLITICALLY CHARGED WILD RIDE

Emma Stone stars as Michelle Fuller in director Yorgos Lanthimos' "Bugonia," a Focus Features release. (Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features.)

However, the film really belongs to her co-star. Despite not being a household name, Jesse Plemons has had a remarkable career. An Oscar nominee himself, Plemons has appeared in more than half a dozen Best Picture nominated-films in the past decade, but audiences may recognize him best from his stint on "Breaking Bad." Here, Plemons gives his greatest performance as a deeply disturbed man in pursuit of what he thinks is a noble mission. 

Lanthimos has become one of my favorite contemporary filmmakers. His unique storytelling combines the bizarre and bleak with intensity and humor (see "The Lobster" (2015), "The Favourite" (2018), "Poor Things," etc.) His films are a breath of fresh air, carving out his own lane that very few can. 

Aiding the Greek director are the striking camerawork of cinematographer Robbie Ryan — twice Oscar-nominated for "The Favourite" and "Poor Things" — and the biting screenplay from Will Tracy. English composer Jerskin Fendrix delivers a score that hits you like a tidal wave when you least expect it.

"Bugonia" is a twisted satire that captures the delusional grip of conspiracy culture in today's discourse. Gritty, thrilling, and darkly funny, Lanthimos' latest may not be his crowning achievement, but it's another strong entry in his filmography — and proof he's one of the most visionary directors working today.

"Bugonia" is rated R for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 1 hour, 58 minutes. In select theaters, wide release October 31, 2025.
