                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz will return to the Nitto ATP Finals to defend their title. One year ago, the Germans made their team debut at Inalpi Arena. From 9-16 November, they will try to lift the trophy once again. Krawietz and Puetz have shown consistency throughout the 2025 season and by doing so became the sixth team to qualify, joining Julian Cash/Lloyd Glasspool, Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic, Marcel Granollers/Horacio Zeballos, Harri Heliovaara/Henry Patten and Joe Salisbury/Neal Skupski in Turin. Krawietz and Puetz also made finals in Adelaide and Munich, as well as semi-finals at the Australian Open, Madrid and Toronto. Krawietz has also competed in the Nitto ATP Finals twice with Andreas Mies and once with Horia Tecau. Puetz has only played in the season finale with Krawietz. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.
