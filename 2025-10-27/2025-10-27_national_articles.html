                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump is moving on to the second leg of his Asia tour, boarding Air Force One for Japan after time in Kuala Lumpur for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. U.S. President Donald Trump arrived Monday in Japan where he'll meet new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for the first time. His focus in Asia has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of “America first.” A trade deal between the U.S. and China is drawing closer, officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday as they reached an initial consensus for Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to aim to finalize during their high-stakes meeting. Trump's trip comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands for health care funds, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. “It's starting to get real,” he said, waiting in line for food. FILE - Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks to reporters following the First Ministers Meeting at the National War Museum March 21, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada. The leader of Canada's most populous province is bragging about the impact of his anti-tariff ad that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada. Ontario's television advertisement criticizes Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The ad upset Trump who said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%. “You know why President Trump is so upset right now? Republicans outnumber Democrats in Indiana's congressional delegation 7-2, limiting possibilities of squeezing out another seat. “I believe that representation should be earned through ideas and service, not political manipulation,” Mrvan said in a statement Monday. Indiana Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder threatened legal action if the Republicans pass any new maps: “This is not democracy.

(AP Photo/Mike Householder) It is leaving beneficiaries, states and food banks scrambling for ways to fill the gaps. But his spokesperson said Monday that the votes are still lacking, casting doubt on whether a special session called by Gov. Some state Republican lawmakers have warned that midcycle redistricting can be costly and could backfire politically. Mike Braun speaks during a Make Indiana Healthy Again initiative event in Indianapolis, April 15, 2025. But on Monday, he said it was the right thing to do: “I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” Braun said. Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, speaks on the House floor during a special legislative session regarding House Bill 1, Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge, La. Julie Emerson, a Republican Louisiana state representative, is running to unseat fellow Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is seeking a third term in 2026. She announced her candidacy in a video posted Monday morning. Landry had spoken to Trump in May about U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow as a potential primary challenger to Cassidy, who is unpopular with a segment of Louisiana's GOP base. Cassidy voted in January 2021 to convict Trump after his second impeachment. Emerson said in August that she would run if Letlow didn't. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said every worker should be back on the job with full pay. His statement comes as more workers miss their first full paycheck. “It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,” Kelley said. Kelley said there is no winning a government shutdown. “It's time for our leaders to start focusing on how to solve problems for the American people, rather than on who is going to get the blame for a shutdown that Americans dislike,” Kelley said in a statement posted on the union's website. Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in a second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Performing Arts Center at LaGuardia Community College in the Queens borough of New York, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. This combination photo shows candidates for governor of New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, left, and Democrat Mikie Sherrill during the final debate in governors race, Oct. 8, 2025, in New Brunswick, N.J. (AP Photos/Heather Khalifa) Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat on the ballot as an independent. The New Jersey governor's race features Republican state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli against Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill. Mamdani appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday, telling a raucous crowd that his campaign is a “movement of the masses” against billionaires and “oligarchs.” As the crowd chanted his name, Mamdani reiterated plans to hire thousands of new teachers, renegotiate city contracts, freeze rent increases for the city's 1 million rent-regulated apartments, build more affordable housing and provide universal child care. Cuomo argued that he's the real Democrat and that Mamdani's democratic socialism would send residents and businesses fleeing: “He wins, book airline tickets for Florida now.” The causes are under investigation, but Trump speculated while en route to Tokyo that “bad fuel” could be to blame for both crashes. The president ruled out foul play and said there was “nothing to hide.” The carrier is on its final deployment before decommissioning. A statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Wang Yi's conversation with Marco Rubio, which took place on Monday, after the economic and trade talks in Kuala Lumpur. “The two sides clarified their positions, enhanced understanding, and reached a framework consensus on reciprocal solutions to current pressing economic and trade issues,” Wang said in the statement, adding that both sides should “resolve conflicts through dialogue and abandon the practice of exerting pressure” to “stabilize the relationship and move forward in bilateral relations.” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a phone call Monday that they both have “world-class leaders.” U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators said they made progress toward a possible trade deal during talks in Malaysia, ahead of the expected meeting between Trump and Xi on Thursday in South Korea. The streets in Japan are famously narrow and congested, but no matter: Japan's government said it may import Ford F-150 trucks for its transport ministry to use while inspecting roads and infrastructure. That would be a win for the Trump administration, which has long complained of American vehicles being shut out of the market that's home to Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Subaru. “We appreciate President Trump's advocating for American made products,” Ford spokesperson Dave Tovar said. Trump bought into the idea while flying to Asia, saying “That's a hot truck.” President Donald Trump, left, and Japan's Emperor Naruhito shake hands during their meeting at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, Oct. 27, 2025. U.S. President Donald Trump waves to Japan's Emperor Naruhito from a car, as he departs after their meeting at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, Japan, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Trump has ramped up pressure on Republican governors to give the party an easier path to maintain control of the House. A spokesperson for a GOP state senate leader said last week that the Indiana Senate lacked the votes to pass a new congressional map, but the White House has held multiple meetings with holdout lawmakers, including a return trip to Indianapolis on Oct. 10 by Vice President JD Vance.—CORRECTION: Last week's statement that the Senate lacked the votes was incorrectly attributed to a spokesperson for Braun. The statement was made by a spokesperson for state Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray. Republicans have offered few answers, saying they won't negotiate until Democrats end the shutdown. Democrats have said tax credits that kept the costs lower should be extended and refused to reopen the government until they are. ▶ Read more about voters confronting GOP lawmakers over rising health care costs When the Trump administration froze foreign assistance overnight, urgent efforts began to figure out how private donors could support critical aid programs. Along with colleagues who had been fired or worked outside of business hours, they identified 80 programs they recommended to private donors, and Project Resource Optimization announced that all had been funded. ▶ Read more about how private donors stepped in when USAID dropped out Former President Joe Biden called these “dark days” as he urged Americans to stay optimistic and to not check out as Trump attacks free speech and asserts expanded executive powers. “We're more powerful than any dictator,” Biden said after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston Sunday night. Biden, 82, ended his first public speech since a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer on an optimistic note, predicting Americans will “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have — stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith.” Chinese markets logged solid gains Monday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.1% to 26,434.69, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.2% to 3,996.94 — reflecting growing hopes that after months of escalating trade disputes, Trump might be right when he said “I think we're going to come away with a deal” with China. Behind the showmanship, Washington and Beijing's top trade lieutenants have quietly mapped out a framework that might, just might, keep the world's two largest economies from tearing up the field again,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to hold their high-stakes meeting on Thursday, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea. Trump, whose powerful handshake was a bit of concern among Japanese officials, seemed gentle when he met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace soon after arriving in Tokyo on Monday. They exchanged greeting in English though their conversation was inaudible. Before leaving, Trump shook hands again with Naruhito, and called him “A great man!” twice while pointing to the Emperor. Asian shares surged Monday while European markets were little changed after Trump said he expected to reach a trade agreement with China. Work on trade deals that might alleviate friction between the U.S., China and other major trading partners has reassured investors, especially in Asia. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 2.5% to 50,512.32, a new closing high following news that the world's two largest economies had reached an initial consensus for Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to finalize during a high-stakes meeting later in the week. Brazilian farmers are increasing soybean production as the U.S. and China engage in a trade fight. China's customs body reported no U.S. soybean imports in September, a first since November 2018. Brazilian soybeans already accounted for over 70% of China's imports last year. Brazil's Agriculture Ministry expects the next soybean harvest to rise by 3.6%. Farmers in the U.S. are worried about losing the Chinese market permanently, even if a trade agreement is reached, and are seeking other markets. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi also posted a message on X, saying: “Welcome to Japan, @realDonaldTrump!” Bessent said a potential agreement, which has been the subject of extensive negotiation, could require more time. “Just a lot of details to work out,” he said. A sticking point has been Washington's push for South Korea to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump has arrived in Japan, where he'll meet new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for the first time. The meeting is an early diplomatic test for Takaichi. She took office only last week and has a tenuous coalition backing her. The details are still unclear, but Bessent said American and Chinese negotiators discussed tariffs, rare earths, fentanyl and “a substantial purchase of U.S. agricultural products.” Specifically, Washington wants Beijing to buy soybeans from U.S. farmers. Trump chimed in by saying “we feel good” about working things out with China. President Donald Trump speaks at the Kennedy Center, Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in Washington. He said exterior columns had been “beautifully painted in a luxuriant white enamel color, replacing the fake looking gold paint that was there for years.” There are also “many major improvements” on the way, including “seating, carpeting, wall coverings, ceilings, chandeliers, stages, heating and A/C, etc.” “Look how beautiful the Oval Office is, now,” he wrote. President Donald Trump announced he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs. Trump is still upset about Ontario's television advertisements criticizing his tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Trump noted that the advertisement was yanked from the air, “but they did it very late” and “they let it play for another two nights.” Trump said he wouldn't meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in South Korea, where they're attending the same summit. “I don't want to meet with him,” he said. “I'm not going to be meeting with him for a while.” President Donald Trump, left, reaches for a document of cost figures as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell watches during a visit to the Federal Reserve, Thursday, July 24, 2025, in Washington. Bessent said they're preparing a slate of candidates for Trump to choose from. And Trump reiterated that Bessent is a possibility for the job himself. President Donald Trump listens to a question from a reporter aboard Air Force One at Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025. But Trump still wants to keep some things under wraps. The political party of Argentine President Javier Milei did well in the country's midterm elections, and Trump called it “a big win.” “He had a lot of help from us,” Trump said. “We're going to get the price of beef down, and I'm going to make sure the cattle ranchers don't get hurt,” Trump said. President Donald Trump, right, speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 30, 2025, in Washington. They reconnected at the funeral for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump suggested their dispute was water under the bridge. Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said, “I haven't really thought about it.” He rejected the possibility of running for vice president as a way to get back to the presidency, saying, “I'd be allowed to do it” but wouldn't because “it's too cute.” Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates. “I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,” he said. The president's overtures to reconnect with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have gone unanswered. “If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,” Trump said. South Korean workers released after days of detention in Georgia arrive at the Incheon International Airport, in Incheon, South Korea, Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. Trump said, “I was opposed to getting them out,” and he said they were working on a new visa system that would make it easier for Korean companies to bring in skilled workers. “We're doing a whole new plan for that,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he disembarks from Air Force One upon his arrival at Kuala Lumpur International Airport to attend the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. “I hear phenomenal things” about the new Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, Trump said. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports — from allies and adversaries alike — in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms. However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. Trump is awaiting a Supreme Court case that could solidify his authority or limit it. Soon after he stepped out of the plane, U.S. President Trump displayed his signature dance moves to Malaysian performers on Sunday. He participated in a ceremonial signing of an expanded ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, which fought earlier this year. The summit is not a guaranteed part of any president's itinerary, but it was an opportunity for Trump to reengage with a critical region for the first time since returning to office. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Malaysia, as he departs for Japan, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Japan's capital saw heightened security ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's arrival on Monday. Tokyo's metropolitan police set up a special taskforce and mobilized some 18,000 officers. At Tokyo's Haneda airport, where Trump will arrive, all lockers and garbage bins were closed or removed. One man was arrested for allegedly carrying knives outside the embassy.</p>

Former chief counsel to House Judiciary Committee Democrats Julian Epstein discusses the Gaza peace deal and more on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' Hamas says it will hand over another body of an Israeli hostage on Monday, as President Donald Trump's 48-hour deadline looms. If the latest body is handed over, Hamas will still have the bodies of 12 Israeli hostages in its custody. Trump acknowledged on social media Saturday that some of the deceased hostages are "hard to reach." Hamas terrorists say they will release the body of another deceased Israeli hostage on Monday night, leaving 12 remaining. "Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. "Perhaps it has to do with their disarming, but when I said, ‘Both sides would be treated fairly,' that only applies if they comply with their obligations. Let's see what they do over the next 48 hours. Hours before Trump's post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee met with the families of Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, two U.S. citizens who were killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. President Donald Trump gave Hamas a 48-hour deadline to release the bodies of hostages on Saturday. Their bodies are among those still being held by Hamas. "We will not rest until their—and all—remains are returned." Authorities believed Chen, a 19-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, was kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, but was later declared dead by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israel credited Trump with securing the release of all living Israeli hostages who remained in Hamas custody this month. Huckabee noted Rubio's visit to Israel was "very productive in moving forward" the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan, adding the plan cannot work until all hostages, living and deceased, are released.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jon Stewart says he wants to stay at “The Daily Show” desk after his current contract expires in December. “We're working on staying,” the Comedy Central host said Sunday when asked about his status on stage at The New Yorker Festival in Manhattan. He started to say the media business is changing, perhaps alluding to the recent ownership changes at Comedy Central's parent, Paramount. A Paramount spokesperson declined to comment on Stewart's remarks. Stewart first hosted “The Daily Show” from 1999 to 2015, returning last year to host its Monday episodes. Remnick had brought up the political context earlier in the conversation: Paramount's ownership shift, Disney's suspension of Kimmel amid Trump administration pressure, and widespread perceptions of media mogul capitulation to President Trump. Stewart, one of the biggest stars on cable, has been outspoken in his opposition to President Trump and equally loud about his support of late-night comedy. Stewart acknowledged the fears about Trump's authoritarian approach — and said the US may wind up in “some kind of soft autocracy where news is controlled” — but also urged Trump's critics to recognize the power they have. “We have a lot of different avenues,” he said. Talking about new media stars like podcaster Joe Rogan, Stewart said, “It's not acceptable to just say, well, ‘I don't like what he does.' Then do it better, beat them at their own game. “There's no one in this world right now that isn't platformed,” he added. “And so if you have a problem with information, then fight like hell to get better information out there.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It was just last week when Penn State fired head coach James Franklin after a third straight loss, leading to a $49 million buyout by the Nittany Lions to let him get out of his contract. At the time, it seemed wild that a university would be willing to shell out that much money, but the potential buyout for former LSU head coach Brian Kelly could rival Franklin's. LSU head coach Brian Kelly stands on the sideline during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Vanderbilt, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, in Nashville, Tennessee. Kelly was in his fourth year of a 10-year, $100 million deal with LSU, which he signed after leaving Notre Dame. Kelly had $95 million in salary on that deal and 90% of it was guaranteed money. Kelly and LSU athletic director Scott Woodward reportedly had a tense meeting on Sunday morning, according to The Athletic. There was also a coaching confrontation, as Woodward reportedly wanted to make changes to Kelly's staff, which included axing offensive coordinator Joe Sloan. However, Kelly allegedly pushed back, saying he would rather make other moves on his staff. LSU head coach Brian Kelly yells to an official during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Vanderbilt, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, in Nashville, Tennessee. This situation has even reached the highest level of state government, as Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry reportedly met with the LSU Board of Supervisors about Kelly's firing on Sunday night. Kelly was asked about that possibility after the loss, which put them at 5-3 on the year and 2-3 in SEC play. "It's impossible for the head coach that's been here for four years and 35 years of doing this, to think anything [but keep coaching]," he said, via the New York Post. "That's not my decision in terms of whether I'm here or not, but that's what I will do." LSU head coach Brian Kelly speaking at Omni Dallas Hotel on July 15, 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mike Braun speaks during a Make Indiana Healthy Again initiative event in Indianapolis, April 15, 2025. The Republican governor of Indiana said Monday he's scheduling a special session to redraw congressional boundaries after weeks of pressure to back President Donald Trump's bid to add more winnable seats with midcycle redistricting. While Republicans in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have moved quickly to enact new districts, Indiana lawmakers have been hesitant. It's unclear whether enough of the GOP majority Senate will back new maps. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Vice President JD Vance first met with Braun and legislative leaders in Indianapolis in August and Trump met privately with state House Speaker Todd Huston and state Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray in the Oval Office weeks later. Vance also spoke to state lawmakers visiting Washington that day. Vance returned to Indianapolis on Oct. 10 to meet with the governor, as well as the Republican state House and Senate members. But Indiana lawmakers have avoided the national spotlight in recent years — especially after a 2022 special session that yielded a strict abortion ban. Braun previously said he did not want to call a special session until he was sure lawmakers would back a new map. Typically, states redraw boundaries of congressional districts every 10 years after the census has concluded. Opponents are expected to challenge any new maps in court. State lawmakers have the sole power to draw maps in Indiana, where Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers. Democrats could not stop a special session by refusing to attend, as their peers in Texas briefly did. A spokesperson for Bray said last week that the Indiana Senate lacked the votes to pass a new congressional map and she said Monday that the votes are still lacking, casting doubt on whether a special session will achieve Braun's goals. Some state Republican lawmakers have warned that midcycle redistricting can be costly and could backfire politically. Republicans who vote against redistricting could to be forced out of office if their colleagues back primary opponents as punishment for not towing the party line. Braun's move to call a special session could force lawmakers who haven't commented publicly to take a stance. Indiana's Republican legislative leaders praised existing boundaries after adopting them four years ago. Indiana Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder decried the special session and threatened legal action over any maps passed by the Legislature. This is desperation,” she said in a statement. Democrats only need to gain three seats to flip control of the U.S. House, and redistricting fights have erupted in multiple states. Some Democratic states have moved to counter Republican gains with new legislative maps. Republicans outnumber Democrats in Indiana's congressional delegation 7-2, limiting possibilities of squeezing out another seat. But many in the party see it as a chance for the GOP to represent all nine seats. The GOP would likely target Indiana's 1st Congressional District, a longtime Democratic stronghold that encompasses Gary and other cities near Chicago in the state's northwest corner. The seat held by third-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan has been seen by Republicans as a possible pickup in recent elections. The new maps were not challenged in court after they were approved in 2021, not even by Democrats and allies who had opposed the changes boosting GOP standing in the suburbs north of Indianapolis. “I believe that representation should be earned through ideas and service, not political manipulation,” Mrvan said in a statement Monday. Republicans could also zero in on Indiana's 7th Congressional District, composed entirely of Marion County and the Democratic stronghold of Indianapolis. But that option would be more controversial, potentially slicing up the state's largest city and diluting Black voters' influence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its outer bands are already lashing Jamaica with wind and rain. • Catastrophic impact:  Up to 40 inches of rain, 13 feet of storm surge and 160 mph sustained winds will cause “extensive infrastructure damage” that will cut off communities, the National Hurricane Center warned. • Jamaica's worst hurricane: Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for vulnerable coastal areas of Jamaica ahead of what will likely be the strongest storm on record to hit the country. • Extreme rapid intensification: Melissa more than doubled in strength over the weekend, increasing its winds by 70 mph in just 24 hours. More tropical systems are rapidly intensifying and wringing out more rain as the atmosphere and ocean warm due to fossil fuel pollution. Jamaica's climate change minister said Monday that the time for preparation is “all but over” as Hurricane Melissa moves toward the island. Samuda encouraged people on the island to use resources sparingly and warned that disruption to the water system could start as soon as tonight. “You will start to see disruption to water systems, we imagine, later this evening going into early morning tomorrow,” he said. “The time for preparation is almost at an end,” Samuda again stressed. It's been 13 years since a hurricane made landfall in Jamaica. However, last year showed it doesn't take a landfall to cause big problems in the island nation. Jamaican government officials are now giving updates about the progress of Hurricane Melissa as it churns toward Jamaica. • Dana Morris Dixon, minister of Education, Skills, Youth & Information • Matthew Samuda, minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change • Robert Morgan, minister without portfolio for the Ministry of Economic, Growth and Job Creation • Evan Thompson, Jamaica's principal director of the Meteorological Service Massive flooding is unavoidable no matter where Hurricane Melissa makes landfall, Jamaica's transport minister said on Monday. “Regardless of where it enters and where it exits there is going to be massive flooding,” said Daryl Vaz, minister of Transport, Telecommunications and Energy. Meanwhile, Minister for Local Government Desmond McKenzie shared his concerns about low uptake in the use of emergency shelters across the country that are available for those in vulnerable areas. Of the 800 shelters that are open, only 76 of the 800 shelters are seeing any activities at all,” McKenzie said at a press conference. “There are four parishes that have no one in the shelters.” McKenzie said the government is anticipating that “close to 50,000 persons will be relocated, either moving to safe grounds or in the shelters.” Residents in low-lying neighborhoods along Jamaica's coastline will be most exposed to heavy rainfall, storm surges, and strong winds, a senior meteorologist warned Monday, hours before Hurricane Melissa was set to make landfall. Tropical storm force winds will cover nearly the entire island, Thompson said. He also warned that landslides are “a very real possibility and likelihood, because as the soil is saturated and the soil is loose.” Hurricane hunters are no stranger to powerful winds and intense turbulence, so what happened Monday morning is remarkable. These teams routinely fly specialized aircraft into the most powerful storms on the planet to collect weather data, which is used to improve track and intensity forecasts. But this flight was “definitely the most turbulent I've ever experienced,” Andy Hazelton, a hurricane expert who confirmed he was on the plane, said on X. Aircraft positioning data shows that the plane — a WP-3D Orion — was able to take at least two passes through Melissa's center, collecting critical weather data before experiencing the dangerous turbulence that sent researchers heading for safety. In Jamaica's capital city, the streets are relatively quiet ahead of Melissa's landfall. Some vehicles are loaded with plywood as residents make final preparations. The government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston. There's been light rain with some gusts of wind. At the hotel where a CNN field crew is staying, exterior doors have been boarded up with sand bags piled in front to help combat the water expected to pour on the city overnight. Kingston's geography is like a bowl and many residents told CNN they fear the island's beautiful mountains will also funnel great amounts of rain into the city. Do not try to traverse gullies that are flooded,” Morgan, minister without portfolio for the Ministry of Economic, Growth and Job Creation, told a press conference. Over the weekend, workers in Jamaica's capital Kingston dredged as much trash and silt as they could from the bottom of Sandy Gully, an approximately 20 km long waterway snaking along the city's western flank. When Melissa brings its months' worth of rain as it passes over Jamaica, the swollen, debris-filled gully could knock out bridges, splitting Kingston in two. “We've had historical evidence of persons in very powerful vehicles seeking to traverse gullies. And they lost the competition,” Morgan said at a press conference while urging the public to report damage to Jamaica's authorities. Melissa may well be the most powerful hurricane to hit Jamaica since 1988, when at least 40 people were killed in the wake of Hurricane Gilbert. Authorities have replenished the electricity grid since then and reinforced housing, according to Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's minister of water, environment and climate change. “But when you speak about 160 mph winds, we've never tested our new infrastructure in that regard.” Gilbert had 135 mph winds when it made landfall on the island. Storm surges — a rise in water level caused by a strong storm's wind pushing water onshore — could peak between nine to 13 feet. “There isn't infrastructure that's built, I think, anywhere in the world to navigate that sort of risk,” added Samuda. Powerful winds whip up along Jamaica's coastline Monday as Hurricane Melissa closes in. A senior government minister in Jamaica has called on people to follow mass evacuation orders, ahead of what could be the most ferocious storm to hit the country in decades. It's a devastating storm,” Samuda told CNN on Monday. Communities on the coasts will be particularly exposed to destructive winds, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storms — and seventy percent of the Jamaican population live within five kilometers of coasts, Samuda said. Go to higher ground because this can take lives,” he said. Melissa's almost perfectly circular, clear eye is an obvious sign of the hurricane's tremendous power. Melissa's eyewall was sparking with lightning this morning, indicating a lot of energetic thunderstorm activity. Hurricane Melissa is still strengthening as it crawls toward Jamaica late Monday morning. Melissa now has sustained winds of 165 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Melissa has been tracking at what's considered a human's slow walking pace of just 2 to 3 mph since late last week. It's moved just 150 miles since Thursday afternoon, or about the distance between New York City and Baltimore. The average forward speed of a hurricane where Melissa is located is about 10 to 11 mph, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division. Melissa's slow movement over warm water that extends deep into the ocean along with improving wind conditions high in the atmosphere allowed it to explode in strength over the weekend and Monday. Warming ocean water from climate change has caused the rapid intensification of hurricanes to become more likely. The sun rose to reveal a terrifying image of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa Monday morning. Tropical storm conditions are already happening in Jamaica as rain bands from Melissa swirl into the island. The most extreme wind and storm surge impacts will arrive this evening into early Tuesday as Melissa turns north. “Extensive infrastructural damage” and “long-lasting power and communication outages” are among the devastating wind impacts the hurricane center has warned about. Storm surge could reach heights of 9 to 13 feet above ground level near and east of where Melissa's center crosses the coast. Large waves will pile onto the surge's destructive potential in low-lying areas. The Jamaican government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston, as Melissa intensifies on its approach to the Caribbean nation. “Do not venture out of your safe shelter,” the National Hurricane Center warned Monday morning. Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities.” Jamaica peak impacts: Wind-whipped bands of rain are spreading across the island so the threat of catastrophic flooding rain and landslides is underway. The most devastating wind and storm surge impacts are expected to develop Monday evening into early Tuesday. After Jamaica: Melissa is still expected to be a major hurricane when it roars over eastern Cuba with damaging winds, storm surge and potentially catastrophic flooding rain Tuesday night into early Wednesday. Bermuda could be hit by a weakening Melissa Thursday night into early Friday. Melissa has joined Erin and Humberto from earlier this season as the third hurricane to hit Category 5 strength. Only the 2005 season has had more Category 5 hurricanes with four.</p>

A man whose son died during a 2017 fraternity hazing ritual at Penn State University warned students and parents of the ills of the practice in an interview with Fox News Digital, saying anyone could become a victim. A New Jersey university's fraternity chapter has been permanently closed after authorities reportedly discovered a student had been critically injured in an alleged hazing incident involving electricity earlier this month. Rutgers University's Alpha Sigma Phi chapter has had its doors permanently shuttered more than a week after a 19-year-old member was hospitalized in critical condition following an alleged hazing incident, according to the school's website. Authorities were initially called to the home in response to a disconnected 911 call, but upon arrival, discovered the injured and unresponsive student. "Based on our investigation, hazing did occur and as a result, the fraternity made the decision to close the chapter," Gordy Heminger, a spokesperson for Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity, Inc, said in a statement to NJ.com. The frat house had a history of code violations, NJ Advance Media reported. Rutgers University's Alpha Sigma Phi chapter has been permanently closed after a 19-year-old student was critically injured after reportedly coming in contact with electricity in an alleged hazing incident in New Brunswick, New Jersey on Oct. 15, 2025. "At some point, water became involved," Heminger said. "This was not students just listening to music in the dark as was claimed by an anonymous parent. We are still trying to determine who and how many people were involved, but we believe it will be double digits when all the facts come out." Heminger also reportedly called on Rutgers to expel any students who were involved in the incident, while vowing that Alpha Sigma Phi will do the same. Alpha Sigma Phi's Rutgers University chapter has been permanently closed following hazing allegations, according to officials. "We hope Rutgers will do the same," Heminger reportedly said. "New Jersey has very strong anti-hazing laws and I hope the prosecutor seeks the maximum penalties allowed for those involved." As of Friday, authorities had not filed any charges stemming from the incident and the injured student was no longer in critical condition, NJ.com reported. The New Brunswick house also possessed a history of building code violations and officials have since declared the building to be an unsafe structure, according to NJ Advance Media. A 19-year-old student was initially in critical condition after being found unresponsive at an Alpha Sigma Phi chapter's off-campus house at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. A July 2025 inspection revealed numerous "life safety" issues – including multiple electrical hazards – at the property, which is owned by the fraternity's national arm and managed by CLVEN, according to NJ.com. In 2021, the state implemented several new and stricter penalties for hazing after 19-year-old Timothy Piazza, a New Jersey resident, died after being forced to drink copious amounts of alcohol while attending Penn State University. Two former college students ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from Piazza's death last year, according to NJ.com. Alpha Sigma Phi's national organization, Rutgers University and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hurricane season can be stressful as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives. Here's a few tips on how to prepare and stay safe. A strengthening Melissa has grown into a Category 4 hurricane and U.S. forecasters say it could reach Category 5 status, unleashing torrential rain and threatening to cause catastrophic flooding in the northern Caribbean, including Haiti and Jamaica. Workers board up shop windows ahead of Hurricane Melissa's forecast arrival in Kingston, Jamaica, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.

HOW TO PREPAREHurricane season can be stressful for anyone near the potential path of a storm. Powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks, and otherwise upend lives. But stress can be reduced when people have a plan, emergency management officials say. KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) — Hurricane Melissa strengthened into a Category 5 storm Monday as it drew closer to Jamaica, where forecasters said it would unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage. It was not expected to affect the United States. Hanna Mcleod, a 23-year-old hotel receptionist in the Jamaican capital of Kingston, said she boarded up the windows at her home, where her husband and brother are staying. “I just told them to keep the door closed,” she said. In an AP interview, National Hurricane Center specialist Larry Kelly says everyone in Jamaica needs to be hunkered down now. Melissa would be the strongest hurricane in recorded history to directly hit the small Caribbean nation, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. A storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 meters) was expected along the coast in Kingston, which Porter said is home to critical infrastructure such as Jamaica's main international airport and power plants. On Monday morning, Melissa was centered about 145 miles (230 kilometers) southwest of Kingston and about 330 miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph) and was moving west at 3 mph (5 kph), the center said. Some areas in eastern Jamaica could see up to 40 inches (1 meter) of rain while western Haiti could get 16 inches (40 centimeters), according to the hurricane center. “Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,” it warned. “I hear what they say, but I am not leaving,” said Noel Francis, a 64-year-old fisherman who lives on the beach in the southern town of Old Harbor Bay, where he was born and grew up. The fisherman said he had already secured his vessel and planned to ride out the storm with his friend. Several towns along Jamaica's southern coast already reported power outages as winds intensified throughout the night. “I don't think the storm will damage my house. My only concern is flooding, because we live near the sea,” said Hyacinth White, 49, who said she had no plans to evacuate to a shelter before the call was disconnected. The slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. “I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. In eastern Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Haiti. Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service, warned that cleanup and damage assessment would be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads. Hurricane Gilbert was a Category 3 storm when it hit the island in 1988. Hurricanes Ivan and Beryl were both Category 4, but they did not make landfall. “Don't make foolish decisions,” warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister. The storm already has dropped heavy rain on the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert. Floodwaters also have cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said. In neighboring Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 15 hectares (37 acres) of maize at a time when at least 5.7 million people, more than half of the country's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger. Melissa was expected to keep dumping heavy rain over parts of Haiti as it moves northeast in the coming days. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above-normal season with 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

Andrew Cuomo slammed Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for claiming he is a "victim" as a Muslim, saying his rival has "been dividing and attacking and offending" different New York groups during his campaign. With just over a week until Election Day, Zohran Mamdani holds a double-digit lead in the raucous race for the nation's most populous city, but former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is narrowing the gap, according to a new public opinion poll. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple scandals and who is running as an Independent candidate in the general election after losing the primary, had 34% support in the survey. The survey was conducted Thursday through Sunday, entirely after incumbent Mayor Eric Adams endorsed Cuomo in a bid to defeat Mamdani. The embattled Democratic mayor had been running for re-election as an independent but dropped out of the race late last month, although his name remains on the ballot.

Mamdani's 10-point advantage over Cuomo is down from his 20-point lead in Suffolk's September poll. Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted that "Cuomo's biggest gains" were among Hispanic voters and independents. Andrew Cuomo, speaks during a mayoral debate, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025, in New York. He's also repeatedly spotlighted Mamdani's Muslim faith and criticized his rival for painting himself as a victim because of his faith. Cuomo has argued that Mamdani has offended Jewish New Yorkers and charged that his rival is antisemitic because of his comments opposing the Israeli government and calling its attacks on Palestinians in Gaza a "genocide." Mamdani, firing back, told reporters recently that "we're speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it's also disgusting." Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa is interviewed by Fox News Digital, in New York City on Aug. 18, 2025 (Paul Steinhauser - Fox News) Among those urging Sliwa to end his bid is billionaire businessman and conservative radio host John Catsimatidis, a top New York City Republican and ally of President Donald Trump. Sliwa voters, when given a second choice, preferred Cuomo over Mamdani by 36%–2%, according to the poll. "There is only one person in New York City whose voters will determine the outcome," Paleologos said. "And that person isn't Mayor Adams, Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, or any New York billionaire. The Ugandan-born Mamdani, if elected, would become the first Muslim and first Millennial mayor in New York City's history. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani speaks during an interview on "The Story with Martha MacCallum" at Fox News on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in New York City. Mamdani surged to the Democratic primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering free childcare for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores. Mamdani has been heavily criticized by his rivals not only for his far-left proposals, but also for his criticism of Israel, his past negative comments regarding the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and his proposal to shift certain responsibilities away from the NYPD and focus on social services and community-based programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The opposition leader Axel Kicillof said it would be a “mistake” for libertarian President Javier Milei to celebrate his decisive victories in the country's midterm elections. (AP video shot by Victor R. Calvano and Cristian Kovadloff) Argentines began voting Sunday in a high-stakes midterm election that could help shape libertarian President Javier Milei's political path — and the future of U.S. financial support for his government.

Supporters of the opposition Peronist party gather at their campaign headquarters in La Plata, Argentina, after polls closed in legislative midterm elections, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in key districts in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration. In the election widely seen as a referendum on Milei's past two years in office, his upstart La Libertad Avanza party scored over 40% of votes compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections. At La Libertad Avanza headquarters late Sunday in downtown Buenos Aires, a beaming Milei hailed the election sweep as a mandate to press forward with his spending cuts and introduce ambitious tax and labor reforms. The results also automatically position him as a candidate for reelection in 2027. “The Argentine people have decided to leave behind 100 years of decadence,” Milei exulted as his supporters cheered, referring to a succession of Peronist governments that brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei has won decisive victories in key districts across the country in midterm elections. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.” Perhaps never has an Argentine legislative election generated so much interest in Washington and Wall Street. Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks on a good showing for Milei in national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory. “If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,” Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month. Those contentious comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms and that the midterm race would be tight. “Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,” Trump wrote. In the closely watched Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold home to nearly 40% of the electorate, La Libertad Avanza eked out a razor-thin victory Sunday. Just last month, the Peronists beat Milei's party there by a whopping 14 percentage points. He warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy. “I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,” he said. Given the limited number of seats up for grabs in this election, it was mathematically impossible for Milei to secure a majority in either house. “This victory is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain control of Congress,” said political consultant Sergio Berensztein. “The government must build a broad and effective coalition with like-minded forces.” Seeking to capitalize quickly on Sunday's results, Milei said he called the country's powerful provincial governors to accelerate agreements on long-term economic reform. Sunday's outcome will also test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although Milei's budget cuts have significantly driven down inflation — from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month — the price increases still outpace salaries and pensions. The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before. In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment. “You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,” she said, describing how her $200 monthly pension has shriveled in value since Milei cut cost-of-living increases. Reflecting widespread public resignation, electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's 1983 return to democracy. “I vote out of obligation, nothing more,” said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) has fallen victim to the latest political plague: White House Ballroom Construction Derangement Syndrome. “Don't even think of seeking the Democratic nomination for president unless you pledge to take a wrecking ball to the Trump Ballroom on DAY ONE,” Swalwell warned on X. Don't even think of seeking the Democratic nomination for president unless you pledge to take a wrecking ball to the Trump Ballroom on DAY ONE. A particularly troubling sign about Swalwell's condition was the time of his post. It did not happen during the work day or after a session in Congress. He posted it on a Saturday night, shortly before 11 p.m., indicating an almost obsessive nature about his thoughts, which are currently dominated by Trump's ballroom. “***Or, as @RubenGallego proposes, rename it the Barack Obama Ballroom,” Swalwell said in his post. As with Democrats' responses from last week, Swalwell's fanatical tantrums are utterly absurd. It doesn't take a medical professional to know this is not normal behavior and should raise red flags. Swalwell, along with scores of liberals, Democrats, and others on the Left, is unwell. Yet Swalwell's WHBCDS offers insights into the political Left's unhinged obsessions. Their ire goes beyond the games and schenanigans associated with politics. They have demonstrated a complete intolerance for anything that challenges their ideologies or beliefs. And they have a sheer disdain for millions of Americans, approximately half of the country's voting population, solely predicated on their support for the president. Presidents from both parties have authorized changes, additions, subtractions, and other construction projects. Never was there the kind of petulant sulking that Democrats exhibited last week. WHBCDS is just the latest example of their mental instability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Joe Biden called these “dark days” as he urged Americans to stay optimistic and not to check out in response to what he says are attacks on free speech and tests on the limits of executive power by President Donald Trump. Biden, 82, was speaking publicly for the first time since completing a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. “Friends, I can't sugarcoat any of this. He predicted the country would “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have — stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith.” Biden listed examples of people who are standing their ground against threats from the current administration, citing federal employees who resign in protest, and universities and comedians that have been targeted by Trump. “The late-night hosts continue to shine a light on free speech knowing their careers are on the line,” he said. Biden also shouted out Republican officials who vote against the Trump administration. “America is not a fairy tale,” he said. He finished the speech by telling people to “get back up.” Biden dropped his bid for reelection after facing pressure following a disastrous debate against Trump and concerns about his age, health and mental fitness. Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump last November. In May, Biden's post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. Prostate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score. The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Biden, who will turn 83 in November, completed a course of radiation therapy earlier this month. It is unclear what the former president's next treatment steps might be. Biden will also headline an event for the Nebraska Democratic Party in Omaha next month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This satellite image provided by NOAA shows Tropical Storm Melissa on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025. Children play in a street flooded by rains caused by Tropical Storm Melissa in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. People walk in a street flooded by rains caused by Tropical Storm Melissa in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Melissa is forecast to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. Scientists said this is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification of its wind speed and power. “That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, in the United Kingdom. Deoras, who has tracked the impact of climate change on weather phenomena for decades, said scientists are seeing storms intensify quickly. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, an independent group of scientists and communicators. A 2023 study had found that Atlantic hurricanes are now more than twice as likely as before to intensify rapidly from minor storms to powerful and catastrophic events. The study looked at 830 Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1971. It found that in the last 20 years, 8.1% of storms powered from a Category 1 minor storm to a major hurricane in just 24 hours. That happened only 3.2% of the time from 1971 to 1990, according to a study in the journal Scientific Reports. The U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned of “ catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides ” from Melissa in Jamaica, where some areas could receive up to 40 inches (1 meter) of rain. Climate scientists have long warned that warming oceans — driven by greenhouse gas emissions — are making such explosive storm development more common. “We're living in a warmer world, and that means hurricanes are more likely to intensify quickly, especially near coastlines,” Deoras said. Storms intensifying faster near land poses greater risks to lives and infrastructure, said Deoras. But if it forms close to the coast, and if it just crosses the coast, as we are going to see in the case of Jamaica and other regions, it's a big problem,” he said. Deoras added that while hurricanes are natural phenomena, climate change is amplifying their impact. “We can't stop hurricanes, but we can reduce the risk by cutting emissions and improving coastal defenses,” he said. Investment is needed in early warning systems, sea walls and other infrastructure to make communities, especially in island countries, more resilient to climate impacts, he said. The world has warmed too much to prevent phenomena like rapid intensification, he said. The impact of climate change is putting lives at risk on islands and in coastal areas, Placky said. “With 90% of our extra heat going into our oceans, we're seeing these oceans warm and they're rising. And that plays out with sea level rise. So even outside of any storm, the water levels are getting higher. A storm like Melissa only compounds these impacts, according to Placky. After a slow start, that's been largely accurate, with 13 storms and four major hurricanes and roughly another month left in the season. “All of our small island developing states know all too well the fear and dread those in the hurricane's path are feeling. This trauma should not be anyone's norm,” said Anne Rasmussen, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States at the United Nations climate talks, the next session of which is scheduled to be held in Brazil next month. Rasmussen said extreme weather events like Hurricane Melissa only make it more urgent for countries to begin acting more decisively on climate change. “We need urgent action that gets us back on track with a 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit increase, so we can avoid even worse impacts to come,” she said.

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy. So why isn't it melting away as midsummer temperatures nudge toward 100 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius, and the heat hangs in the shimmering air? Because this unusual and beautiful wonder, located deep in the sunkissed hills of southwestern Turkey, isn't snow at all. And those visitors milling around its upper reaches aren't going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle — and either paddle or soak in some of the planet's most photogenic pools. Today, Pamukkale's travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink. But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but it's worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground. Enter from the South Gate — tickets cost 30 euros (about $33) — and it's easy to be initially underwhelmed. There's not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey. In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf carts can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). Even if you know what's coming, there's still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed. These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off-limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by. “It is pretty, but there's not as much water as I'd expected,” says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. There's still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. It's a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties. The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way farther down, there's every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves. DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions. Paradise Bay: The new destination for an A-list getaway Much of Hierapolis' status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface. Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath. While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area. He says it puts them off staying longer. Pammukale's UNESCO listing led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon,” Durmuş says. He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground. The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice. Farther away, in Buharkent — its name meaning “steam city” — water at boiling point powers what was Turkey's first geothermal power station. In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, it's always a hot destination.</p>

President Donald Trump slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, saying the leader should be pursuing peace in Ukraine rather than testing missiles. President Donald Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to recent missile tests, reminding him that the U.S. has a nuclear submarine stationed "right off their shores." Trump made the comments during a press gaggle aboard Air Force One Monday morning, telling reporters that the U.S. is "not playing games" with Putin. "Russia said this week that they've tested a new missile that can go more than 8,000 miles. So, I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles, and they're not playing games with us. We're not playing games with them either," Trump responded. President Trump warned his Russian counterpart that the U.S. has a nuclear submarine stationed off Russia's coast. We don't need to go 8,000 miles. And I don't think it's an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way. You ought to get the war ended. A war that should have taken one week is now in its soon fourth year. That's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles," he added. Trump later teased that he may be considering further sanctions against Russia, telling reporters simply, "You'll find out." President Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One regarding Russia's missile tests. Russia announced the successful test of its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile on Sunday, claiming it has a range of over 8,000 miles and can pierce defense shielding. Putin said Russia is moving to deploy the weapon. Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin that the missile traveled 8,700 miles and was in the air for about 15 hours when it was tested on October 21. Trump has been heavily critical of Putin in recent months for his unwillingness to negotiate a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump met face-to-face with the leader in Alaska earlier this year, but no deal has materialized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday again declined to definitively slap down speculation that he would seek a third term in the Oval Office, while pointing to several leading figures in his administration as prime candidates for the 2028 ticket. Trump suggested an “unstoppable” ticket could be comprised of Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, echoing thoughts he has floated in the past. “We have JD, obviously, the vice president, who's great. I'm not sure if anyone would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,” he told reporters on Air Force One en route to Japan. “I would love to do it,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of a 2028 presidential bid. I have my best numbers,” he continued, amid aggregate polling data compiled by the New York Times showing the president's approval rating at 43%. We have some very good people, as you know…But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.” Bannon, who played a key role in galvanizing Trump's first presidential victory in 2016, told the Economist last week that “at the appropriate time we'll lay out what the plan is, but there's a plan and President Trump will be the president in ‘28.” Trump is gonna be president in ‘28 and people ought to just get accommodated with that.” When questioned on the matter on Monday, Trump demurred, making vague comments similar to multiple other statements he's given in recent months. “All I can tell you is that we have a great, a great group of people, which they don't,” he added in reference to the Democratic Party as he went on to slam Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). Speaking with reporters on board Air Force One en route to Japan on Monday, President Trump again refused to rule out a bid for a third presidential term, despite the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to being elected twice.Read more: https://t.co/Ya2ePJ8PGo pic.twitter.com/5yReOrVuWg You give her an IQ test, have her pass the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed, I took, those are very hard,” Trump added. Trump ruled out another theory that has been floated in which he would run for vice president in 2028, have the president resign to circumvent the 22nd Amendment, and then assume the role of president. “I'd be allowed to do that,” Trump said. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some Trump administration officials, including at the White House, have expressed frustration with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in recent weeks as internal wrangling over who will lead NASA spilled into public view, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Duffy, who also currently serves as NASA's acting administrator, has said privately that he would like to not only hold the space chief title permanently, but also fold NASA into the Department of Transportation, one source told CNN. Duffy now has competition as Jared Isaacman – the Elon Musk-associate whose nomination for the position was pulled by Trump earlier this year – has re-emerged as a candidate for the top job at NASA. That frustration only grew when the decision appeared to ignite a bitter and messy monthslong feud between Trump and billionaire Musk that dominated the news cycle for weeks. Isaacman and Trump, however, reopened lines of communication over the summer, and it soon became clear to officials, including Duffy, that Isaacman was back in the mix to lead NASA. Duffy and several of his DOT advisers, interviewed Isaacman on October 13 for the job. Duffy has conducted other interviews as well, however, in the eyes of White House officials, Isaacman has remained the frontrunner. Another source said that the president was praising Duffy privately to advisers while traveling in Asia. ‘We're not going to wait for one company': NASA chief suggests SpaceX may be booted from moon mission “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?” Musk wrote in one social media post on X. “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” he said in another post. It came after Duffy told CNBC last week that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon's surface, is lagging behind schedule. Trump was made aware of the attacks on Duffy during his trip to Asia — only commenting that he didn't like Musk going after the transportation secretary. White House officials said that while the president would eventually name a head of NASA, it wasn't something that he was fixated on, making it unclear when it would ultimately happen. “Secretary Duffy is a valuable member of President Trump's team and he is doing a tremendous job leading the department of transportation, especially during this difficult time when Democrats have shut down the government and forced air traffic controllers to work without pay,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. CNN has reached out to the Department of Transportation for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Justice Department has drawn a red line for Democrats in state and local governments who are threatening to arrest federal immigration officials for enforcing federal law in Democrat-run areas. Prominent Democratic officials, from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), have threatened to pursue legal action over what they say are abuses by federal immigration officers in their states. Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco in Congress since 1987, and Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-CA) said in a joint statement Wednesday that federal immigration officers could be arrested for violating state laws. “It is important to note that California law protects communities and prevents federal agents from taking certain actions here that we have witnessed in other states. While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,” their statement said. “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins added to discourse from Bay Area officials, as reports swirled that President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard to San Francisco, claiming she would prosecute federal agents who violate state law. “If there is excessive use of force, shootings that aren't legally justified, things of that nature, then I have to step in and do my job with respect to them, like I do with anyone else,” she added. California, a hotbed for illegal immigrants, has attempted to push back on Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement operations by passing state laws taking aim at federal officers, including a ban on law enforcement wearing face coverings to conceal their identities. In Illinois, Pritzker signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a state commission to compile information and reports about the Trump administration's federal immigration efforts in Chicago, which could be used for future prosecutions against agents. So far, no Democrat-run states or cities have attempted to arrest federal immigration officers for state law violations at this time, despite the tough talk by some Democratic officials. The threats from Democrats have prompted a sharp response from the Justice Department, which has sent a warning that criminal charges could accompany any Democratic attempt to arrest federal immigration officers. “Numerous federal laws prohibit interfering with and impeding immigration or other law-enforcement operations.” “In the meantime, federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities who have abdicated their duty to protect their constituents.” Blanche later followed up his letter by warning Pritzker of consequences should he or Illinois officials interfere in federal immigration operations. “Just because Nancy Pelosi and Brooke Jenkins don't like the fact that this administration is choosing to enforce federal law, that doesn't mean that they can suddenly violate the Constitution and try to arrest or otherwise impede federal officers doing their duty,” John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both Bush administrations, told the Washington Examiner. “An individual alleged victim of federal officer misbehavior can file a Section 1983 civil rights claim against that officer, and then the court will have to analyze whether the federal officer exceeded his authority and was within his qualified immunity.” While Illinois's collection of information regarding federal immigration operations is not unlawful, any prosecution using that data in the future would have to come from the Justice Department. Any charges brought, presumably under a future Democratic presidential administration, would have to fall within the statute of limitations, which is five years for most federal crimes. “There is nothing that prevents the State of Illinois from compiling their own data and then sending it to a future Justice Department to use for prosecuting federal law enforcement officers, but it is the Justice Department, not Illinois, that decides whether to prosecute and handles the prosecution,” Shu said. In some places, like Los Angeles and Portland, the administration has called in the National Guard to protect federal property and personnel due to unrest around federal immigration operations. The deployments have been slammed by Democratic officials in those states and have been met with lawsuits that are playing in various federal courts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of members of a major drug trafficking organization were apprehended and charged in Philadelphia on Friday in what the FBI is calling a “historic” indictment. The organization's trafficking activities effectively created an “open-air drug market in which illegal narcotics are sold every day and at all hours,” read a release by the Department of Justice. Following a raid on Friday, 24 suspected members of the group were arrested, according to reports. Eight people were already in custody, and another remained at large. “We have permanently removed a drug trafficking organization out of the streets of Philadelphia, and they're going to stop pouring guns, chemicals, and drugs into our communities,” Patel said. “Over 30 people have been charged for their alleged role in drug trafficking and dozens of other offenses. These individuals were charged with distributing fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine on one of the most prolific drug blocks in Philadelphia.” “The vast majority of our actions were concentrated right here in Kensington, where this organization devastated the community, fueled violence, and spread fear among residents for nearly a decade,” Jacobs said. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche warned of the consequences to organizations poisoning communities through drug trafficking. He spoke of holding criminals accountable while collaborating with state and local organizations to make the nation's neighborhoods safer. “Drug traffickers who poison our communities and enforce their territory through violence will face the full force of federal law,” Blanche said. “Working alongside our state and local partners, the Department of Justice will continue to dismantle these criminal networks, hold violent offenders accountable, and restore safety to neighborhoods that have suffered for far too long.” “And like a precision missile, it has been targeted for maximum impact where it needed to go … the heart of the opioid scourge here in Kensington,” Metcalf said. “We are committed to returning these neighborhoods to their residents and reclaiming them from drug dealers who profit from the misery of others.”</p>
