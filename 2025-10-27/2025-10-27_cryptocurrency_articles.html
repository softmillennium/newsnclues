                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto rebounded over the weekend, boosted by trader optimism about macroeconomic conditions amid U.S.-China trade talks and Sunday's short liquidation surge. Gox pushes back its repayment deadline by yet another year, Standard Chartered says bitcoin may never fall below $100,000 again, Strategy buys another $43 million worth of bitcoin, and more. Meanwhile, bitcoin illiquid supply declines as 62,000 BTC moves out of long-term holder wallets, according to Glassnode. CryptoIQ is now available to everyone. Take the test for a chance to win $20,000! Gox has postponed its creditor repayment date by another year to Oct. 31, 2026, marking its third extension since the rehabilitation trustee's original 2023 target and coming just four days ahead of this year's previous deadline. Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick said easing U.S.-China trade tensions have boosted market sentiment, with the bitcoin-gold ratio rebounding after the Oct. 10 tariff-driven selloff. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) bought another 390 BTC for $43.4 million at an average price of $111,117 between Oct. 20 and Oct. 26, raising its total holdings to 640,808 BTC worth around $74 billion. Strategy was outshone on Monday, however, as American Bitcoin Corp., co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., confirmed it added 1,414 BTC worth over $160 million to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 3,865 BTC to rank among the top 25 public treasuries. MegaETH's MEGA token sale, which was scheduled to last up to 72 hours, sold out within minutes on Monday morning, raising the maximum $50 million cap as demand exceeded three times the available supply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier in October, Bitplanet, a South Korean public company with direct involvement from Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich and Sora Ventures, announced it had purchased 93 BTC and launched an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation program aiming for 10,000 BTC under the country's new regulatory framework. We'll explore how Metaplanet's executive leadership in Bitplanet's digital asset push could reshape the company's investment narrative. Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value. Anyone looking at Metaplanet today has to buy into a big-picture thesis: the company is betting heavily on Bitcoin, both as a core treasury asset and as a driver of growth, navigating new businesses in Japan and internationally. The recent news of Bitplanet's regulated Bitcoin accumulation program, with Metaplanet's CEO directly involved, is significant because it signals a maturing, possibly more sustainable approach to digital assets within corporate treasuries. This could sharpen Metaplanet's profile as an innovator, but it also adds a fresh layer of volatility and regulatory uncertainty, especially given the company's still-new management and board. The short-term catalysts, impressive revenue and earnings growth, index inclusions, expansion in Bitcoin infrastructure, could benefit from the validation provided by Bitplanet's move. Overall, while Bitplanet's announcement could provide momentum, it also magnifies existing uncertainties. But significant board turnover and inexperienced leadership raise new questions investors should not ignore. Metaplanet's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? Six members of the Simply Wall St Community set their fair values for Metaplanet anywhere from ¥2 up to a high of ¥1,927, with most clustered below ¥600. Given how much of Metaplanet's future could now hinge on its growing Bitcoin focus, it's clear market participants continue to debate the company's risk profile and upside potential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Enso, a provider of so-called chain shortcuts that allow crypto projects to deploy across different blockchains easily, announced that USD1 is the latest project to utilise its tech stack. This will make “DeFi attractive to major players, including institutions, enabling them to tap into deep liquidity and optimal pricing,” Connor Howe, founder of Enso, said in comments shared with DL News. The sector has grown to over $308 billion, a more than 50% growth this year, amid favourable regulations in the US. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, which legally recognises stablecoins in the US. And the market is expected to continue growing. Analysts at Keyrock, a crypto investment firm, and Bitso, a cryptocurrency exchange, have predicted that stablecoins will account for 12% of global payments by 2030. Enso lists over 250 supported protocols on its website that have settled more than $17 billion in onchain transactions. USD1's almost $3 billion market value makes USD1 the sixth-largest stablecoin in the world, almost 70% of its liquidity is siloed on BNB Chain, a blockchain linked to crypto exchange giant Binance, whose founder, Changpeng Zhao, was pardoned by the president last week. Ethereum accounts for another quarter of Trump's digital dollar liquidity, with the remainder spread across Solana, Tron, and Aptos. Following the Enso partnership, USD1 will be available on protocols like Dolomite, a margin trading protocol, and users will be able to trade, lend, and transfer the stablecoin across different blockchains, the announcement stated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee's BitMine Rises as Ethereum Rebounds, Firm Adds $321 Million in ETH BitMine Immersion Technologies added another $321 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) to its stockpile over the last week, the NYSE American-traded firm said Monday, with its holdings rising in value due to Ethereum's recent rebound. BitMine is the largest Ethereum treasury firm by far, outpacing runner-up SharpLink Gaming (SBET) with its $3.58 billion in ETH holdings. It's the second largest overall crypto treasury behind Strategy, which holds over $73 billion worth of Bitcoin. Lee, the chairman of BitMine and co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, cited improving trade relations between the United States and Canada for why Ethereum is on the rise again after a dramatic crypto market plunge earlier this month. “These are global assets and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging in crypto a few weeks ago. BitMine's stock jumped Monday following both ETH's weekend rise and the purchase announcement, with shares of BMNR recently changing hands for $53.15—up more than 5% so far on the day. Myriad users remain bullish on Ethereum's prospects, currently giving ETH a nearly 80% chance of rising to a price of $4,500 sooner than it can plunge to $3,100.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The People's Bank of China reported that digital yuan payment volumes nearly doubled over the past 14 months, reaching RMB 14.2 trillion ($2 trillion) through September 2025, up from RMB 7.3 trillion in July 2024. The CBDC figures represent a significant acceleration in adoption of the central bank digital currency. The surge in volume comes alongside explosive wallet growth. The number of digital RMB wallets has climbed to 2.25 billion, more than twelve times the 180 million reported in July 2024. With China's population at 1.4 billion, the figures suggest users are opening multiple wallets. However, the average transaction value of RMB 428 ($60) has remained moderately stable since the CBDC pilot first launched. This marks a significant decline from the 2023 peak of RMB 1,895 ($135), which may have indicated a larger proportion of business adoption at that time. The central bank has only periodically released enough data to calculate this metric.

MegaETH, a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain designed for real-time performance with high throughput and low latency, saw its token sale oversubscribed within minutes, raising approximately $50 million at a $1 billion fully diluted valuation.

The project required participants to register on a specific platform with identity checks to ensure fair access. MegaETH prioritized community involvement by capping commitments and focusing on broad participation rather than exclusive investor deals.

Recent blockchain ICOs have highlighted a trend toward English auction structures to manage high demand transparently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. That's according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, one of the prime backers of Plan B, a Bitcoin conference where I hosted a discussion on the growing trend of nation states embracing the original cryptocurrency. The event had an upbeat vibe—not surprising since everyone there worshipped Bitcoin—but it was also clear there was trouble in paradise. It turns out there is a growing schism over Bitcoin's codebase, and whether it should be modified to permit the blockchain to include more non-financial data. The notion of including data unrelated to Bitcoin transactions is hardly new and, indeed, the very first block on the blockchain includes a reference to a newspaper headline about bank bailouts. Now, though, Bitcoin's biggest and most influential group of coders, known as Core, are planning to tweak their software in order to significantly lift the restrictions on how much non-payment information can be included in a block. For the Core crowd, this is a simple and pragmatic way to promote new uses for Bitcoin and, in the process, drum up extra fees for miners at a time when the blockchain's lottery payment is 3.125 Bitcoins, and set to halve again in 2028. A fast-growing rival faction, though, wants nothing to do with the scheme and is promoting a Bitcoin client software of its own called Knots. That faction's software is led by an influential Bitcoin developer, who is a devout Catholic and reportedly named it Knots after the “whip of knots” Jesus used to drive money changers from a temple. According to a lawyer I spoke with on the Knots side, the software is necessary to protect the blockchain from what he decried as spammers and “scam adjacency” projects that promote things like Bitcoin NFTs. That is true of prominent figures from Bitcoin's early days who have been denouncing each other on stage in Lugano and on X. This latest schism (you can read a helpful breakdown here) hearkens back to the Bitcoin block size wars that raged from 2015 to 2017, and ultimately saw the “small blockers”—who favored keeping Bitcoin blocks at 1MB—prevail over rivals who claimed boosting the blocks to 2MB or more would be more commercially viable. Its growing popularity lies not only in Knots' position on expanding the blockchain, but from a perception that the Core crowd has grown arrogant and out-of-touch with Bitcoin's core values. I lack the authority to weigh in on much of this, other than to observe that this latest battle for the soul of Bitcoin reinforces what I've said for years: Bitcoin is a marvelous technology, but also a religion. Bitcoin's factions may be at war but there's no doubt they still worship a common god. If you can't beat ‘em, join ‘em: JPMorgan Chase's CEO continues to soften his longtime anti-crypto stance as his bank announced that it will let borrowers use Bitcoin and Ethereum for loan collateral by the end of year. COIN upgrade: Coinbase's forthcoming crypto token could be worth $12 billion to $34 billion, said a JPM analyst, who cited the token and the slowing growth of DEXes as reasons to upgrade the stock ahead of third-quarter earnings this week. In assessing Coinbase's $375 million acquisition of Echo, which was founded by crypto influencer Cobie and helps token projects raise funds, one journalist speculated it could inaugurate the return of 2016-style initial coin offerings. DAT doesn't add up: Following a Fortune exposé pointing to potential insider trading ahead of public company pivots to digital asset treasuries, a new report provides evidence that insiders tied to some popular DATs are using share sales to circumvent token lockups. Trump picks a CFTC chair: The White House selected longtime lawyer and crypto guy Mike Selig to lead the agency. Critics, pointing to a $2 billion deal involving the Trump family's stablecoin and Binance, blasted the pardon as massively corrupt while many on Crypto Twitter claimed it was fair since CZ—who pleaded guilty—had allegedly been the target of a political prosecution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. The cause was eventually traced to a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution failure affecting a critical application programming interface (API) endpoint for DynamoDB, AWS's popular server-less database service. This DNS issue meant that software trying to connect to DynamoDB couldn't find it; not because the database was offline, but the system responsible for translating human-readable names into machine-usable Internet Protocol (IP) addresses had stopped functioning properly. Application requests failed, retries spiked and global services got disrupted, hitting everything from apps such as Snapchat and Signal to government services. At its core, DNS is the internet's phone book. When you enter a web address like ‘amazon.com,' DNS translates that into a numeric IP address so your browser can locate the correct server. ICANN  is on top of the domain name hierarchy. While it had no direct role in AWS's outage, its position underscores a broader point: the DNS is built on a centralized architecture, and centralization means the risk of a failure cascade, which is what occurred. Its hierarchical nature creates single points of failure. The entire process can collapse if any step in the resolution chain fails due to a mis-configuration, overload or software bug. The AWS outage made these weaknesses painfully visible. It showed how even internal DNS services, which cloud providers like AWS use for communication between their resources, can act as bottlenecks. Even services inside AWS couldn't reach DynamoDB because internal pointers had disappeared. Some technologists see safety in blockchain-based alternatives, often grouped under Web 3.0. These systems aim to decentralize name resolution, side-stepping the control of ICANN. Projects like the Ethereum Name Service, Handshake and Unstoppable Domains use distributed ledgers for domain records. Users can register names on-chain and those records are secured by consensus mechanisms rather than a single registry. A decentralized system would be harder to censor or take down. This could prevent outages like AWS's from spreading if a single node fails. Blockchain-based naming systems are still niche, experimental and largely disconnected from DNS infrastructure. You need plug-ins, gateways or specific blockchain clients to resolve these names. The user experience is fragmented and performance trade-offs—especially for high-speed web traffic—remain significant. Even if these technologies had matured, they wouldn't have prevented the AWS outage. For a blockchain-based name resolution system to help, AWS must redesign its internal service discovery architecture for decentralized use, a massive undertaking. US-East-1 has long been a lynchpin of AWS's infrastructure, hosting customer applications and many internal control services. Reversing this over-concentration offers a path toward resilience. A more robust future might combine both approaches. Traditional DNS could incorporate ideas from decentralized systems, such as cryptographic verification, distributed resolution and independent registries, without abandoning compatibility. Cloud providers like AWS could adopt multi-region service discovery, independent failover paths and redundant name resolution layers that don't depend so heavily on a single region or naming service. The AWS outage reminds us of network vulnerability. When DNS fails, it's like address labels vanishing from every building in a city. The centralized infrastructure we rely on today is efficient, but brittle. Blockchain-based naming may not be the solution yet, but could help make outages like this less catastrophic, as services would no longer hinge on a single address book in a single place. For now, the web will continue to run on DNS, governed by ICANN. The author is co-founder of Siana Capital, a venture fund manager. You are just one step away from creating your watchlist!

As part of its ongoing commitment to providing investors with visibility into shareholder value, American Bitcoin will now provide periodic updates to Satoshis Per Share ("SPS"), a metric that represents the amount of Bitcoin attributable to each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. "We believe one of the most important measures of success for a Bitcoin accumulation platform is how much Bitcoin backs each share," said Eric Trump, Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of American Bitcoin. "As part of that conviction, we are focused on providing transparent updates as we aim to increase our holdings." "By producing Bitcoin directly, we can reduce our average cost per Bitcoin to drive a cost advantage over vehicles that buy exclusively on the open market. That structural advantage allows us to compound Bitcoin value per share more efficiently for our investors."

It's up 11 points from the fearful score of 40 on Saturday, and also up over 20 points since last week, marking a sharp change in tune over the past few days. The shift in sentiment comes amid a recent decline in Bitcoin (BTC) selling pressure, according to Bitcoin analytics platform Glassnode. In an X post on Sunday, Glassnode suggested a trend reversal is in the works, as selling pressure and negative sentiment appear to have already peaked to their extremes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The monopoly of dollar is now facing an unprecedented challenge. India's trade with Russia in Indian rupees has also hurt the dollar. And China is now coming up with something big. For decades, the United States dollar has been more than just a currency — it has been the bedrock of global trade, finance, and power. Washington's ability to weaponize the dollar — from freezing assets to enforcing sanctions and controlling international payment networks — has long cemented its geopolitical leverage. But that monopoly is now facing an unprecedented challenge. India's trade with Russia in Indian rupees has also hurt the dollar. And China is now coming up with something big. In October 2025, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) made a historic announcement: its central bank digital currency — the Digital Renminbi (e-CNY) — would now support cross-border settlements with all 10 ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries. This expansion connects nearly 38% of global trade volume directly to China's blockchain-based financial infrastructure, bypassing the traditional SWIFT system, which has served as the backbone of U.S. dollar–denominated payments for decades. In pilot tests between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi, the PBoC's “Digital Currency Bridge” (mBridge) enabled cross-border settlements in just 7 seconds, compared to SWIFT's 3–5 day window, and slashed transaction fees by up to 98%. The mBridge system — developed jointly with the UAE, Thailand, and Hong Kong — allows central banks to settle directly via distributed ledger technology, eliminating intermediary banks in New York or London. For countries wary of US sanctions or payment blocks, this offers something SWIFT cannot: monetary sovereignty. The Digital RMB merges economic sovereignty, technological innovation, and statecraft. Several ASEAN economies — including Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand — have begun holding RMB in their reserves and using the digital yuan for energy or commodities transactions. Middle Eastern exporters are increasingly open to settling oil and gas trades in RMB, drawn by faster and cheaper settlement options. By creating an alternative financial infrastructure that is faster, cheaper, and sanction-resistant, Beijing directly challenges the three pillars of US dollar dominance: Oil trade, SWIFT intermediaries, and Dollar-denominated reserves. This is more than economic competition — it's the creation of a parallel financial world. * Adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — fast, sovereign, and regulatory-compliant. CBDCs, unlike crypto, offer finality, compliance, and legal clarity, making them attractive for governments seeking both financial inclusion and geopolitical autonomy. China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration. * Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT. * UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access. India envisions its digital rupee not just as a national instrument, but as a neutral reserve option within BRICS+, offering smaller economies a trust-based, transparent alternative to both the US dollar and the tightly controlled RMB. Russia is using the yuan for more than 30% of its trade after being cut off from SWIFT. Brazil and South Africa are experimenting with blockchain-based payment systems. Saudi Arabia, a potential BRICS+ member, has expressed openness to trading oil in non-dollar currencies, including the RMB and INR. Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems. The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks. The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago. De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well.

Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems. The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks. The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago. De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well. In pilot tests between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi, the PBoC's “Digital Currency Bridge” (mBridge) enabled cross-border settlements in just 7 seconds, compared to SWIFT's 3–5 day window, and slashed transaction fees by up to 98%. The mBridge system — developed jointly with the UAE, Thailand, and Hong Kong — allows central banks to settle directly via distributed ledger technology, eliminating intermediary banks in New York or London. For countries wary of US sanctions or payment blocks, this offers something SWIFT cannot: monetary sovereignty. The Digital RMB merges economic sovereignty, technological innovation, and statecraft. Several ASEAN economies — including Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand — have begun holding RMB in their reserves and using the digital yuan for energy or commodities transactions. By creating an alternative financial infrastructure that is faster, cheaper, and sanction-resistant, Beijing directly challenges the three pillars of US dollar dominance: Oil trade, SWIFT intermediaries, and Dollar-denominated reserves. This is more than economic competition — it's the creation of a parallel financial world. * Adopt Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — fast, sovereign, and regulatory-compliant. CBDCs, unlike crypto, offer finality, compliance, and legal clarity, making them attractive for governments seeking both financial inclusion and geopolitical autonomy. China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration. * Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT. * UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access. India envisions its digital rupee not just as a national instrument, but as a neutral reserve option within BRICS+, offering smaller economies a trust-based, transparent alternative to both the US dollar and the tightly controlled RMB.

Saudi Arabia, a potential BRICS+ member, has expressed openness to trading oil in non-dollar currencies, including the RMB and INR. Together, BRICS nations now account for over 36% of global GDP (PPP) and more than 40% of global oil production — a scale large enough to sustain alternative settlement ecosystems. The next phase, experts say, will involve inter-CBDC interoperability — the ability for India's e?, China's e-CNY, and other BRICS digital currencies to transact seamlessly through standardized, regulated frameworks. The US dollar remains the world's leading reserve currency — accounting for about 58% of global reserves as of mid-2025 — but that share has been steadily declining from 71% two decades ago. De-dollarisation is unlikely to be abrupt; instead, it will evolve as a multi-currency ecosystem, where CBDCs, digital corridors, and local settlement systems gradually erode US dominance. However, the US is also not likely to see this happening quietly. This might create a geopolitical tension, instability and competition as well. China's digital yuan has proved that CBDC rails can function at scale — secure, instantaneous, and state-backed. This has quietly triggered interest from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, where nations view CBDCs as low-risk, high-efficiency alternatives to the dollar system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been developing the digital rupee (eRs) — a blockchain-based CBDC designed not to replicate China's system, but to offer a more open, inclusive, and multipolar model. Rather than joining the RMB rails, New Delhi aims to build parallel digital corridors that reinforce its monetary sovereignty while enabling South–South trade integration. * Pilot corridors with UAE, Singapore, and Central Asian nations, enabling near-instant rupee settlements independent of SWIFT. * UPI integration for cross-border payments, leveraging India's fintech leadership to democratize global access.
