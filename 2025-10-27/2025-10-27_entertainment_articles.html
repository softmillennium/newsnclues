                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dean's "Man I Need" bounds 17-8 and Thomas' "Mutt" jumps 18-10. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, following its modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million equivalent album units two weeks earlier. It marked the record seventh time that she earned the honor (which she inaugurated in August 2020 with Folklore and “Cardigan”). In only two of the first 16 such double debuts, an album and song tallied a second consecutive week atop the charts — both by Swift, via Midnights and “Anti-Hero” in 2022 and The Tortured Poets Department and “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, in 2024. Meanwhile, two acts earn their first Hot 100 top 10s: Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” bounds 17-8 and Leon Thomas' “Mutt” charges 18-10. Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.

In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift's 13th career Hot 100 No. 1, drew 33.6 million official streams (down 31%) and 49.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 17%) and sold 6,000 (down 42%) in the United States Oct. 17-23. The single secures a third week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart and a second week atop Digital Song Sales and holds at its No. Swift achieves her record-breaking seventh career week with at least four of the Hot 100's top 10 (all since 2022), one-upping Drake (six, 2018-23). Kendrick Lamar (2022-25) and The Beatles (1964) follow with five such weeks each. Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” surges 17-8 on the Hot 100 (besting its prior No. Leon Thomas' “Mutt” sprints 18-10 on the Hot 100 (after reaching a previous No. The only hits to complete longer journeys: Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” (42 weeks, 2021) and Bailey Zimmerman's “Rock and a Hard Place” (41 weeks, 2022-23). While Thomas earns his first Hot 100 top 10 as a recording artist, “Mutt” is his fourth as a writer and producer. He earned his first three top 10s in the latter two fields via Drake's “In the Bible,” featuring Lil Durk and Givēon (No. “Mutt” rules the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for an 11th week and Hot R&B Songs for a 28th week. Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, rises 3-2, following eight weeks at No. Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which led the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, pushes 4-3, while topping Radio Songs for a 19th week, up 1% to 79 million in audience — a new weekly best for the track. Plus, Justin Bieber's “Daisies” jumps 15-7 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 2, and Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” climbs 16-9, after reaching No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At this point, Hailey Bieber is used to seeing insults about her online, but in a new interview, she pointed out there's one particular brand of disparaging comment that she just doesn't understand. Appearing on Owen Thiele's In Your Dreams podcast on Friday (Oct. 24), Bieber began talking about rude comments shared about her online, saying that one particular type of comment never made much sense to her. “When people are trying to be mean, they're like, ‘She looks trans.' The beauty guru continued, pointing out that those transphobic lines of “attack” only make her feel better about herself when she reads them. So I just don't take that offensively at all.” Bieber is just one of a number of celebrities who have been exposed to “transvestigation,” an online trend in which users create conspiracy theories that cisgender public figures are secretly trans, presenting pseudo-scientific “evidence” based on their physical appearance in photographs. LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD has classified “transvestigation” as a hate term, pointing out examples including campaigns against Olympic boxer Imane Khelif and French first lady Brigitte Macron that have resulted in real-life consequences. Elsewhere on the podcast, Hailey also chatted with Thiele about whether or not she and her husband, Justin Bieber, were talking about having more kids since the birth of their son, Jack Blues, in August 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long before Ben Stiller became a key figure in the screen-comedy boom of the 1990s, a top-notch director, an Emmy-winning TV producer, and the man who convinced Tom Cruise to yell “take a step back and literally fuck your own face” while wearing a fat-suit, he was Jerry and Anne's kid. And there's Ben's mother Anne Meara, who wrote plays, acted in everything from TV sitcoms to Shakespeare in the Park productions, and always preferred her son's more serious work to his broader, big-budget laugh riots. Because Meara never wanted to become one half of a world-famous duo that would play The Ed Sullivan Show close to 40 times and helped revolutionize how gender dynamics worked in mid-20th century comedy acts. But then this tall “Irish princess from Long Island” met Jerry Stiller, a short Polish-American Jew from the Lower East Side, and he immediately realized that, in addition to being gorgeous and strong-willed, his future wife was also hilarious. Including Ben and Amy, who found they were vying with millions of Stiller & Meara fans for their parents' attention. Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost (now streaming on Apple TV) starts out as something like a memorial, with Ben and his sister returning to the Manhattan apartment on 84th and Riverside that they grew up in. This was where they were raised, where the future Reality Bites director would goof around with the other kids in their building and shoot their escapades with a Super 8 Canon his dad bought him. You can never truly go home again, but you can sit on the couch where you once watched your parents' performances on television and sift through a lifetime's worth of photos, old letters, scripts and scrapbooks. Ben, however, decided to bring cameras along to capture everything — “it was my first instinct,” he admits, “because that's what my dad always did.” The elder Stiller was an amateur auteur with a bit of a hoarder's mentality when it came to documentation, constantly filming home movies of his kids. He also incessantly taped private conversations and professional improvisations with his wife-slash-comedic partner, both of which would figure in their bits. It was more like: What do you mean by “line?” This was the old normal for Ben, a comfortable innie-outie melding of creative and family lives, until it wasn't — and isn't. Stiller could have kept this at the level of a fond look back, with him and Amy reminiscing about their late, great folks, and honoring the groundbreaking work they did. There are more polyester outfits per capita than any other celebrity-directed doc this year. Ben Stiller Donates Parents' Career Archive to National Comedy Center Billie Eilish, Gracie Abrams, Pedro Pascal, Spike Lee Team With Jane Fonda in Free Speech Fight Ben Stiller, Conan O'Brien Praise 'Spinal Tap' Legacy in New Mini-Doc: It 'Rocked My World' Then those cameras get turned on the person behind them, and we see how maybe growing up in a family in which Mom and Dad were famous, and constantly having intense arguments behind closed office doors that might be real or merely rehearsals, had its share of setbacks. (“I was a good actress before I met you,” Meara says at one point to her spouse, and that's maybe only the seventh most brutal exchange you hear in the film.) How Activists Are Fighting Trump's Immigration Crackdown in Chicago Radiohead Talk European Tour and Why They Took Break in New Interview: ‘The Wheels Came Off a Bit' Congress Enjoys Ultraluxe Health Care as It Fights to Gut Yours But when Ben starts hearing from his own kids about how he wasn't around as much as they wished, and how fatherhood may have taken second place to his career, you start to see how the complaints he had about his parents are now being echoed back to him. Stiller and his wife Christine Taylor had separated from each other in 2017, before getting back together several years later (thank you for at least one thing, Covid!). How much the conversations we see between them about his need to succeed, and the mindset he replicated from Mom and Dad after they view old footage together, contributed to the marital healing process is purely speculative. But you can guess the percentage is larger than zero. Nothing Is Lost takes its subtitle from Jerry, who's talking to his father on tape and waxing poetic about why he pathologically tries to capture even the most mundane parts of life in media amber. What starts off as a tribute turns into an autopsy of a long marriage as seen by the kids who witnessed the best and worst of it, done with humor, anger, hindsight, and empathy. Then it makes a hard left and examines the way that legacies, even ones with the best intentions, have a way of shaping us and sometimes setting us back and always, always leaving us with lessons to repeat or refute. What's more important is that when it comes to family, all — or at least as close to all as possible — is eventually forgiven. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After teasing her first new song in two years with sheet music and a clip of a black-clothed orchestra following her down a street, Rosalía has finally shared “Berghain”—the lead single for her upcoming new album, Lux. The song features Björk and Yves Tumor and comes with a music video directed by Nicolas Méndez in which the orchestra follows Rosalía as she goes about her day. Lux is out November 7 via Columbia. Rosalía recorded her fourth studio album with the London Symphony Orchestra, as conducted by Daníel Bjarnason, and executive-produced it herself. Lux is split into four movements, and joining Rosalía for select contributions are Björk, Yves Tumor, Portuguese fado singer Carminho, Spanish flamenco artist Estrella Morente, Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz, Washington-based trio Yahritza, and the boys choir Escolania de Montserrat i Cor Cambra Palau de la Música Catalana. Motomami, Rosalía's third studio LP, came out back in 2022. In the years since, Rosalía has shared “LLYLM,” “Tuya,” “Beso,” “Oral,” “New Woman,” and “Omega.” Read about Rosalía's Motomami at No. Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

In the first teaser for “Man on the Run,” which IndieWire shares exclusively, we hear from McCartney in late 1969 as he begins to wonder what in the world he will do now, and how he can ever live up to anything as good as The Beatles ever again. “Wings was part of it, but it's really the story of this person who has been on this ride to outer space with The Beatles. He's never known anything else in his adult life, and he has to figure out everything from scratch,” Neville told IndieWire in one of his first interviews discussing the film. Related Stories ‘Song Sung Blue' Review: Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson Form a Neil Diamond Tribute Act in a Film as Sentimental as His Music Who Is ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere' Actually for? Neville also revealed exclusively to IndieWire that alongside the film's release will be a new soundtrack for the documentary of Paul McCartney and Wings music. It charts his years-long legal battle with American record producer Allen Klein over The Beatles' music and fortune, how he navigated the perception that he was the one who broke up the band and rumors that he was actually dead, and how he managed to mature from a Liverpool lad into a family man building a life with his first wife, Linda McCartney. Neville takes us on a journey through how McCartney recorded his intimate, stripped-down solo records like “McCartney” and “Ram,” which were panned by critics in their day, and eventually made it back to the top of the pop charts with Wings for records like “Band on the Run.” “We talk about how Paul himself has been coming to terms with what this music means over time, because at the time, a lot of this stuff was very painful for him,” Neville said. There's a lot of stuff happening where it's not working for him. I think Paul now is still processing and still figuring out how he feels about all this, trying to separate what was often painful at the time from how this music has endured. Having just spent years doing a deep dive through this catalog, it's amazing the amount of incredible work he did through this decade.” Neville said that part of what makes McCartney such a creative genius is that he's a “deeply instinctual creator,” one who embraces whatever he's feeling when something sparks. Sometimes that produces “Maybe I'm Amazed” or inspires him to travel to Africa to record “Band on the Run,” and other times, it has him recording a rendition of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” or an Old Hollywood-style musical special alongside a cartoon mouse. “He just makes stuff, and some of it is fantastic and some isn't, but I don't think he's there to judge himself,” Neville said. “I think he's there to make stuff, and I actually find that really inspiring as a creative person, just that ability to not worry about the judgment too much.” Neville began conducting interviews with McCartney and other members of Wings and his family around four years ago, and the resulting film is as remarkably edited and comprehensive as any of Neville's recent biographical docs, including the two-part Steve Martin documentary, the Mister Rogers film “Won't You Be My Neighbor?,” and his Anthony Bourdain doc “Roadrunner.” But if “Man on the Run” is still not enough McCartney content for fans, there's a book about Wings arriving soon that draws from some of Neville's interviews. Neville manages to squeeze some truly intimate anecdotes out of McCartney, who is as widely documented and interviewed as any public figure alive. In “Man on the Run,” McCartney reveals his inner thoughts from when he was in jail in Japan for marijuana possession, potentially facing up to seven years of hard labor, and a story of how he nearly drowned after swimming at a treacherous cliffside resort. “What you get from being audio-only is [that] it becomes a present-tense story. “One thing Paul said when we discussed it, he said, ‘I don't really want to be an old person in a young person's story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chip and Joanna Gaines are easily HGTV's biggest success story, going from the 2013 airing of a pilot for what would become their hit show, “Fixer Upper,” to overseeing their own empire a dozen years later. But the couple experienced some incredibly lean years, they shared during an October 2025 appearance on the “How I Built This Podcast” with Guy Raz, revealing that they flirted with filing for bankruptcy as they struggled to make their home flipping business profitable. Chip was doing his best to get his home renovation business off the ground while Joanna ran a little gift and decor shop called Magnolia in Waco, Texas. She shared on Raz's “How I Built This” podcast that after doing the math, her goal at the shop was to make $250 a day to make ends meet for their family. But by 2006, already parents to two of their five kids, she closed up the shop to focus on being a mom and helping Chip design homes. By letting go of Magnolia — which would eventually become their multimillion-dollar brand — and helping design the homes that Chip was flipping, Joanna said they realized they made a great team. “For us (working) together, that's where the magic hit,” Joanna told Raz, but that didn't mean their house flipping business took off right away. With four kids under four and the housing market spiraling, Chip recalled, “We were in trouble … but because of our naivety, we didn't even know you could file bankruptcies, so that wasn't really on the table because we didn't know anything about it.” “Everybody was being super gracious because we weren't the only people going through this,” he continued. “It was years of just doing this virtual bankruptcy,” Chip added. By 2012, the Gaines felt like their business had finally stabilized and they'd developed a local following of people who loved to see the homes and interior design they were creating. At the time, they didn't even own a TV, Joanna said. Chip said he had a “phobia” of the cameras and would clam up, but they eventually found their way, and the show took off like a rocket ship in 2014. All these years later — with an empire that includes their own Magnolia cable network, a successful magazine, a tourist destination in Waco, and a thriving product line at Target — the Gaines will star in “Fixer Upper: Mountain House,” premiering on December 9 on both Magnolia and HGTV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman is leaning into her work right now, and she's doing it with striking, effortless glamour. Kidman made a dramatic entrance at Vogue World: Hollywood, capturing attention as she walked the runway at Paramount Studios. She wore a bold red lip, smoky eye, and soft blonde curls parted to the side, creating a polished Old Hollywood aesthetic. Kidman's appearance comes after she filed for divorce from Keith Urban on September 30 after 19 years of marriage, as reported by TMZ. Despite the shift in her personal life, Kidman remains busy and grounded. The star has several upcoming television projects, including a return to “Big Little Lies” and a reprisal of her role in the “Practical Magic” sequel. The estranged couple were most recently seen together on June 20, when they attended a FIFA Club World Cup match for Kidman's 58th birthday. The “Practical Magic” star looked elegant in a white floral dress with a boatneck silhouette and full skirt as they watched Los Angeles Football Club take on Esperance de Tunis. Vogue World: Hollywood blended fashion, music, and film history, highlighting both original costume design and new interpretations of classic movie looks. Designers such as Colleen Atwood and Ruth E. Carter contributed pieces, while Doja Cat and Gracie Abrams were among the performers. Kidman's striking runway appearance not only delivered pure glamour, but also reaffirmed her steady presence, confidence, and artistic focus as she moves ahead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau made their romance public as they held hands while celebrating the singer's 41st birthday in Paris. In photos obtained by Page Six, Trudeau, 53, carefully helped his date out of the car before they walked into the venue. The pair then got into a black SUV and headed to their next destination. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Perry stunned in a body-hugging, red gown and black pumps. She wore her dark hair in a slicked-back low bun. The date night came weeks after Page Six exclusively reported that Trudeau's new romance was a “midlife crisis” following his divorce from his wife of 18 years, Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau. The “Dark Horse” singer and the politician first sparked romance rumors in July when they were seen taking a stroll and later grabbing a bite to eat in Montreal. A few days later, Trudeau was seen watching Perry perform at her “Lifetimes” tour stop in Montreal's Bell Centre. Things got hot and heavy for the couple earlier this month when they were spotted making out while spending time together on a yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. Perry's new romance comes on the heels of her split from Orlando Bloom. The exes share 5-year-old daughter Daisy Dove, whom they welcomed in August 2020. In 2023, Trudeau and his estranged wife, Sophie, announced their separation. They share three children: Xavier, 18, Ella-Grace, 16, and Hadrien, 11.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footage of the singer dangerously swerving into other lanes after leaving the Red-O restaurant in Thousand Oaks, Calif., went viral late Thursday. Spears did not specifically reference the video in her social media upload, which featured a graphic of Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck hugging. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. In a subsequent post, the pop star wrote that she doesn't “feel respected at all by the most unbelievably horrible things being said about me.” Spears explained that she didn't feel “inspired or motivated AT ALL to show new art” — but did share a throwback video of herself painting. The “Crossroads” star, who has comments turned off on her Instagram account, also modeled a pink bathing suit in an additional post. The Daily Mail reports that the songwriter's family members fear she is “losing control” as her ex-husband Kevin Federline promotes his bombshell memoir, “You Thought You Knew,” about their time together. “There's a lot of talk about what to do, if anything. The insider claimed that Spears' loved ones are in crisis talks. Spears has hit back at Federline's allegations, which range from cheating on him to doing cocaine while breastfeeding their sons, via X. “The constant gaslighting from [my] ex-husband is extremely hurtful and exhausting” she wrote. “Those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I am the only one who genuinely gets hurt here.” Her spokesperson, meanwhile, called the former backup dancer's book a means of “profiting off” his ex-wife's story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anne Hathaway made the trek all the way from Genovia to see Sabrina Carpenter kick off her five-night run at Madison Square Garden in New York. It's unclear how international law works for fictional countries, but the actress must have been in violation of some rule — so it's only fitting that Carpenter arrested her during “Juno.” I just don't know what to do when I see a face like this,” Carpenter said from onstage at the Oct. 26 show. When Hathaway told the singer she's from Genovia, she responded, “Has anyone ever told you you look like a princess? Carpenter handed Hathaway her fuzzy pink handcuffs and announced, “This one's for Anne, everybody.” She joins recent arrestees Gigi Hadid, Joe Keery, and Olivia Dean, who were all arrested at past shows. The extended edition of the Short n' Sweet tour will continue on Tuesday, Oct. 28 with another show at Madison Square Garden.

Earlier this year, Hathaway went into the studio with the singer's close collaborator, Jack Antonoff, to cut songs for David Lowery's upcoming film Mother Mary. “I had to submit to being a beginner,” Hathaway told Vogue about finding her singing voice for the titular role. “The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Dickerson, co-anchor of CBS Evening News who has been with the network since 2009, said that he is exiting at the end of this year. “I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me — the work, the audience's attention and the honor of being a part of the network's history — and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who've made me a better journalist and a better human. Along with Maurice DuBois, Dickerson has anchored CBS Evening News since January. Weiss reports to David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount. Dickerson has multiple high-profile roles across the network: moderating debates, co-hosting CBS This Morning, correspondent for 60 Minutes and political director and chief Washington correspondent. He also is a contributor to The Atlantic and podcaster for Slate's Political Gabfest. In his Instagram post, Dickerson cited his work as moderator of Face the Nation, a role he held from 2015 to 2018. His exits comes amid concerns over Weiss' plans for the news division, and whether she will force a shift rightward. A center-right opinion writer who launched the site Free Press, Weiss was tapped for the role overseeing CBS News following Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global. As part of the FCC approval of the transaction, Skydance committed to hiring an ombudsman to take viewer complaints, but that person, Kenneth R. Weinstein, was hardly a neutral figure: He once ran the conservative Hudson Institute. As CBS Evening News co-anchor, Dickerson asked critical questions of the network's decision to settle Donald Trump's lawsuit for $16 million, even though company attorneys had previously labeled the litigation baseless. Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Our job is to show up, to honor what we witness on behalf of the people we witness it for.” Dickerson did not say what his future plans are. Paramount is expected to implement widespread and significant layoffs soon, perhaps this week. Tom Cibrowski, president and executive editor of CBS News, said in a memo to employees that Dickerson “epitomizes the very best of journalism.” He said that he will remain co-anchor of CBS Evening News until the holidays. Since Weiss was named to her role atop the news division earlier this month, it's put an extra level of scrutiny on the news division. On Thursday's CBS Evening News, there was no mention of Donald Trump's pardon of money-laundering cryptocurrency billionaire Changpeng Zhao, even though it was a top story on other outlets. On Sunday, Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan's questioning of House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries went viral, as she challenged his use of the term “rigged” elections to warn of next year's midterms to Donald Trump's claims that he won the 2020 presidential race. “I have been using that term in the context of Donald Trump's unprecedented effort to gerrymader congressional maps in a partisan fashion all across the country,” Jeffries said. “You know Democrats are also going through gerrymandering and redistricting,” Brennan said. “Democrats are going to push back aggressively to make sure we have fair maps across the country, not partisan gerrymandering, which Republicans have initiated in state after state after state,” Jeffries said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. As such, we've polled the IndieWire staff to pull together a list of potential costumes — including notes on what to source, where you should be shopping, and even who you might partake in this bit of sartorial fun with — that all honor some of the best films and series of the year 2025. We've got some obvious picks (“One Battle After Another” outfits that mix and match quite well, Aunt Gladys from “Weapons”), some out of the box ideas (you will never see our “Kpop Demon Hunters” idea coming, we promise), and plenty for couples and groups (yes, that “Long Walk” photo up top is a big hint). And when you're done, why not share a picture with the IndieWire team or our socials, so that we can also enjoy the fruits of our mental labors? Wilson Chapman, David Ehrlich, Alison Foreman, Jim Hemphill, Marcus Jones, Sarah Shachat, Ben Travers, Brian Welk, and Christian Zilko also contributed to this list. Halloween 2024 was dominated by “The Substance,” with cinephiles, horror fans, and members of the LGBTQ+ community alike caking themselves in makeup to dress as the iconic Monstro Elisasue from Coralie Fargeat's popular body horror comedy. This year, that particular niche seems destined to be occupied by Aunt Gladys, the instantly hateable main villain of Zach Cregger's “Weapons,” played with a menacing smile by the delightful Amy Madigan. Yes, you'll probably see 50 Aunt Gladys out and about if you live in Los Angeles or New York, but that doesn't make the costume any less fun. It helps that, unlike other horror villains to catch on as of late, Aunt Gladys isn't a particularly demanding character to dress as (tons of drag queens are already doing it!). Just a red bobbed wig, a pair of chunky glasses (ideally green), and some red lipstick haphazardly smeared on the lips is enough to get the point across. To really complete the ensemble and get extra brownie points in your local costume contest? If you (correctly) believe Zach Cregger's “Weapons” is the best horror movie of the year and want to stick out among all the Aunt Gladys costumes, Alden Ehrenreich's Officer Paul Morgan is an easy alternative. And given that the look was blatantly inspired by John C. Reilly's character in “Magnolia,” you can easily adjust your description of the outfit and say you're Jim Kurring if you somehow end up at a Halloween party devoid of horror fans. This one is for all the cat ladies out there (myself included). Don't want to part with your fluffy little guys and gals for the evening? Eva Victor's luminous debut feature is all about different paths of healing. For Victor's character Agnes, an early toe-dip into feeling better about a horrible event that has befallen her comes at the hands (paws?) of a tiny new pal she meets during an otherwise everyday trip to the store. This one's easy: you'll need a kitten (stuffed will do, especially if you're leaving your house for the evening, everyone knows cats are homebodies), a blue jacket, comfy sweats, work boots, and cans and cans of cat food. For many of us (again, me), this is an outfit that can come together without any new purchases, culled entirely from our own closets and couches. My favorite way to do Halloween is being able to cobble together something creative with what I can find from Goodwill. No need to go to a Spirit Halloween and, in fact, if you ask “One Battle After Another” costume designer Colleen Atwood, even she will tell you that a trip to “a nice Goodwill shop will do the job” if you want to dress as Leonardo DiCaprio's Bob this year. You're looking for a faded plaid robe, a slightly different design than the Big Lebowski robe you have lying around from one of your old slacker costumes. That's the biggest facet of this costume if you want to get Bob right, and if your local Goodwill really doesn't have something acceptable, this new LL Bean one might get some use beyond October 31 if you really want to go that route. Tie it together with a black beanie, some thick dark sunglasses you can find at a Walgreens, a gray T-shirt, and dark sweats, and you're good to go, though it'll help if you grow that goatee too. Add in a duffel bag or a fake gun if you really want to accessorize, and above all, don't forget to take a few long drags even after you've found out you're already late. Paul Thomas Anderson's VistaVision extravaganza “One Battle After Another” is filled with iconic looks and characters, from Leonardo DiCaprio's Bob in his sunglasses and Lebowski-esque robe to Sean Penn's creepy and hilarious riff on Michael Flynn (complete with off-putting hair that Penn slurps into place with his saliva-drenched comb). Yet perhaps the most memorable single image is that of Teyana Taylor as a pregnant Perdidia Beverly Hills firing off a machine gun with rage and delight. But if you can nail that — along with an appropriately excessive mock gun and a perpetual revolutionary howl — you've got a Halloween costume that pays perfect homage to one of the best films of 2025. Fielder's HBO series was designed to help people overcome their social anxieties, so it's only fitting that the second season inspired multiple costume options for Halloween party-goers to choose from — whichever makes them feel most comfortable. First off is Fielder Classic: Grab a pair of New Balance sneakers, dark jeans, and a light sweatshirt or pullover (perhaps from Summit Ice?). The only slightly impractical expenditure would be a mobile laptop harness, but who knows? If you're feeling a touch more ambitious, try Captain Fielder. Or you could take it one step further and become Nathan Fielder as Sully Sullenberger. There's a few ways to realize this version, including as a couple's costume where one of you walks around on stilts (as Sully's dad) and the other wears a little boy's green suit, complete with white dress shoes, white dress socks, and a white button-down shirt with the collar spread on top of the jacket. But you can also fly solo with a gray wig, gray mustache, and blue pilot's shirt (including the striped epaulets and metal wings pin). For the final touch, wear a pair of corded headphones and have your iPod cued to the “Evanescence” song “Bring Me to Life.” Speaking of bringing people to life, why not honor this year's breakout animated show by embodying “Common Side Effects” lead Marshall Cuso? Oh, and if you want to indulge in a few earthbound hallucinogens, that's just part of the character. It might save you (“from the nothing I've becoooooooome”)! For a different take on a unicorn costume, try emulating Pedro Pascal's too-good-to-be-true financier who tries to sweep Dakota Johnson off her feet in Celine Song's latest romantic dramedy. If you are the type to frequent as many weddings as say, a matchmaker, all you would need to do to achieve the top half of this look is break out your summer tuxedo jacket, shirt, and bowtie. The bottom half, however, comes with a spoiler alert. Rather than jet off to the best plastic surgeons in the business to break your legs on behalf of a breaking six feet in height, simply hem your black pants up an exaggerated amount — maximum six inches, giving off capri vibes — to convey how often the perfect man is not all that he seems to be. On an actually serious note, the costumes that Malgosia Turzanska designed for Chloé Zhao's film adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel — which already become a book club staple — are as visually stunning as they are relatively simple to imitate. For Will, just pull out anything denim, linen, chambray, etc., for another monochromatic vest over shirt look, in more of a muted blue. Still, a chic couples costume with complementary warm and cool tones is sure to get a pair on the best dressed list of any Halloween party. OK, so we may not be the first people to think of dressing as the characters from “KPop Demon Hunters” this year. Indeed, word on the street is that even the dumbest of the Saja Boys — Romance Saja, obviously — is shaping up to be a more popular costume than Halloween staples like Spider-Man, Miles Morales, and perennial Ricky's favorite: Generic Blue and Red Jumpsuit with Non-Proprietary Web Pattern. But what if you don't have a friend who's willing to draw movie-accurate purple demon patterns over her entire body? What if your bird keeps flying away from you every time you try to superglue four extra eyes onto its head? What if you forgot to buy a costume and wish you could just spend the whole night hiding inside a fluffy cocoon of goose down and polyester? Mira might be the only person who could wear a sleeping bag to the Met Gala, but she isn't the only person who could wear a sleeping bag to your local Halloween party! Nothing says, “Don't drink and drive!” like a low-lift group costume that's significantly funnier when you choose to walk everywhere. Adapted from the first book Stephen King ever wrote, “The Long Walk” was originally published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and finally arrived on screen this year as a major horror event thanks to Lionsgate. Director Francis Lawrence (“The Hunger Games”) and screenwriter JT Mollner (“Strange Darling”) screwed the terror of King's brilliant dystopian nightmare even tighter to make nightmare fuel that's an ideal fit for the movie format. “The Long Walk” also cast the perfect actors for a lean-mean ensemble effort, giving Halloween-ers like you the chance to dress up as a revolutionary Cooper Hoffman, fascist Mark Hamill, devastated Judy Greer, and more memorable characters. You'll need lots of beige, olive green, and khaki clothing to go with your ratty shoes, dirty wristwatches, dystopian dog tags (with your walkers' numbers on them! ), and a big banner with orange lettering to announce your murder-themed marathon. Finally, when the night's ready to conclude, throw your heads back and as a group scream, “FUCK THE LONG WALK.” Then, maybe call that Uber. The advantage of going with “Severance” as an inspiration is that it should be fairly easy to acquire some blue lanyards to help you move from “Outie” to “Innie,” and you may already have Lumon-approved workware that is roughly the same colors and shapes as Helly's blue sweater/skirt combo and Mark's slightly disheveled suit in their finale hallway sprint. It should be fairly easy to coordinate a couple's costume from the final shot of “Severance's” Season 2 cliffhanger — or indeed a throuple's costume, if you have someone down to dress as Gemma, stuck on the other side of the door. Frank Drebin Jr.'s have what look like strawberries on them, and we imagine that's not going to be easy to track down, but we give you permission to get creative with your own colorful pair of briefs. Anyone who does actually do this for Halloween, be sure to send a pic to “The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast” (Quaid Army!) to see if you get a much-deserved shout out from director Akiva Schaffer. America's new favorite (fictional) doctor is an excellent Halloween costume for a few reasons: “The Pitt” is a very popular show, his outfit can be assembled in a day or two, and it provides a built-in level of warmth and comfort without running the risk of getting too hot. Nab yourself a prop stethoscope to wear around the neck, and you can head out for Halloween in your fave pair of beat-up jeans. No, few people look as good in scrubs as Noah Wyle, but for the dads and middle-aged men with plans on October 31, there's no easier costume to pull off this holiday. Are you an identical twin who's too white to go as Smoke and Stack from “Sinners,” too scrawny to go as Chad and Alex Wagner from Jean-Claude Van Damme's “Double Impact,” and/or too LAME to go as renowned gynecologist duo Beverly and Elliot Mantle (of “Dead Ringers” fame)? Well, have I got some good news for that presumably very small portion of IndieWire's readership: You and your siblings are just some gray pajamas and a pair of bad haircuts away from transforming into both of Robert Pattinson's most beloved* roles as the Expendable Mickey 17 and the clone he was never supposed to meet. You could flesh the costume out even further with some numbered bibs, those flappy-earned hats, or even a life-sized Steven Yeun (this is one of those situations where it would come in really handy to be close personal friends with renowned actor Steven Yeun), but either way everyone you see will be delighted by your clever take on the characters from the “doesn't it feel like that came out forever ago?” sci-fi satire of the year. But the tradition of Halloween is rooted in real death, and you won't get a more theatrical chance to honor the late surrealist in his final earthside year. A fearless explorer of different artistic mediums, Lynch bounced from 35mm to 16mm to digital and back again, creating scads of bizarre paintings, statues, viral videos, mixed-media experiments, furniture pieces, and more along the way. But you just know Lynch would give it a twist, so take time to seriously meditate on the matter and make this tribute your own. Here are just a few ideas to get you started: (1) “Mullholland Drive” couples costume — only using materials you find on a real road! (2) Vladimir Putin post-Ice Bucket Challenge — a stunt Lynch really requested in 2014! We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All five members of Radiohead spoke with Jonathan Dean for a new wide-ranging interview in The Sunday Times. At one point, Thom Yorke reflected on the band's decision to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2017, and the backlash that ensued. It horrified me, truly, that the gig was being hijacked. At the time I thought the gig made sense, but as soon as I got there and that guy came up? Dean followed up by asking Yorke if he would perform again in Israel, noting that the interview took place before the latest cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas. “I wouldn't want to be 5,000 miles anywhere near the Netanyahu regime but Jonny has roots there. So I get it.” (Yorke is a longtime critic of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government.) Jonny Greenwood, who is married to the Israeli artist Sharona Katan and has collaborated with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa, disagreed with his bandmate. “I would also politely disagree with Thom,” Greenwood said. “I would argue that the government is more likely to use a boycott and say, ‘Everyone hates us—we should do exactly what we want.' “This wakes me up at night,” he said. Yorke, who was heckled onstage last year by a pro-Palestinian protestor, added, “A few times recently I've had ‘Free Palestine!' But I said, ‘You and me, standing on the street in London, shouting at each other? Well, the true criminals, who should be in front of the ICC [International Criminal Court], are laughing at us squabbling among ourselves in the public realm and on social media—while they just carry on with impunity, murdering people.' Yorke, who was with Greenwood at the time of the interview, responded with a deadpan remark: “But you are whitewashing genocide, mate. And so am I, apparently, by sitting next to you on this sofa.” Greenwood also spoke about protesting the Israeli government and many citizens' despisal of the country's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. “Look, I have been to antigovernment protests in Israel and you cannot move for all the ‘F*** Ben-Gvir' stickers,'” he said. “I spend a lot of time there with family and cannot just say, ‘I'm not making music with you f***ers because of the government.' And Selway remarked, “What BDS are asking of us is impossible. They want us to distance ourselves from Jonny, but that would mean the end of the band and Jonny is coming from a very principled place. Jonny Greenwood's brother and bandmate, Colin Greenwood, did not address the Middle East, but he recalled a show that Radiohead played in Berlin on the night of September 11, 2001. The tour is scheduled to begin next week, on November 4, in Madrid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Sheridan is getting ready to hang up his spurs at Paramount, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. The prolific Yellowstone and Tulsa King writer and director is expected to jump to NBCUniversal, beginning with a film deal that will go into effect next year. Sheridan's TV deal with Paramount is not up until the end of 2028, but he is expected to bring that over to NBCUniversal when it ends. Johnny Depp Returning to Big Studio Movies With New 'Christmas Carol' for Paramount Sheridan is one of the industry's biggest talents, creating the Yellowstone franchise (along with its multitude of spinoffs like 1923 and 1883), the Sylvester Stallone-led franchise Tulsa King and other programming for Paramount, like Special Ops: Lioness and Mayor of Kingstown. And his work has proven appealing to A-listers, with Kevin Costner, the original star of Yellowstone (a falling-out over the last season perhaps putting a damper on that show), and Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Sam Elliott and Jeremy Renner among the stars to sign on for some of his other shows. Sheridan's next film, however, an action-thriller called F.A.S.T., is set up at Warner Bros. His NBCUniversal deal is expected to be a rich one (no surprise there), though he will have to create wholly new IP when he does make that jump in a few years' time. As is typical in these deals, Paramount owns Yellowstone and the other franchises he has created for that company. Still, his programming has become a dramatic backbone of the Paramount+ streaming platform, and will likely continue to be for years to come given how many active projects he has, and the long time frame before he joins NBCU for TV projects. Daily Show host Jon Stewart said Sunday that he is talking to Paramount about extending his time in the host chair for the Comedy Central late night show. But NBCU, whose entertainment efforts are led by Donna Langley, has also forged a reputation as being talent-friendly, poaching talent like Christopher Nolan and Seth Rogen, and inking deals with multihyphenates like Snoop Dogg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's got to be nightmarish—not just scary or shocking because scares and shocks are cheap coin that spends easy in the realm of horror, but nightmarish, dream logic in the worst, most creeping of ways, as that's how “this spooky clown wants to kill you” goes from goofball comedy to shit that sticks in a reader's brain for life. We open in early 1962, and in fairly fine form, as a young kid named Matty Clements (Miles Ekhardt) attempts to steal a little happiness from an unkind world. As we know from overheard chatter—one thing we'll learn early, and often, in Derry is that its residents love speaking in expository shorthand—Matty comes from a crappy home, so why not sneak into a theater to enjoy a few minutes of the Robert Preston version of The Music Man? What follows is the Welcome To Derry pilot's one truly affecting scene, as Muschietti—who directs here, working from a script by Argylle's Jason Fuchs—keeps a steady hand on the tension knob until just long enough for it to be time to rip the fucker off. The family is a little weird initially, sure, but so is Matty, who self-soothes by sucking noisily on a pacifier and can only answer questions about where he wants to go with “anywhere but Derry.” It's not until the daughter starts casually toying with a home-packed tub of “LIVER” that alarm bells start going off, as she threatens to smear their passenger/prisoner with blood. No such luck, as we jump simultaneously through the show's opening titles and four months of time, as Derry has very quickly gotten over the disappearance of one whole entire boy. The only exceptions to the “move on and forget about it” crowd are those kids who were closest to Matty Clements, and even that's a relative distinction. But young comic nerd Teddy Uris (Mikkal Karim-Fidler) and his conspiracy-theory buddy Phil (Jack Molloy Legault) are wrestling, in part, with the fact that they didn't know Matty all that well and only hung out with him out of a blend of pity and treat-based bribery. Nevertheless, they find themselves steadily drawn into the investigation into his death—not least of which because it's been 27 years since the last time something targeted Derry's children, and IT's got them in its sights. Muschietti had some decent success with this kind of thing in the IT movies, but he was working with both a better caliber of script and a blockbuster movie-level of casting power: Stack, Karim-Fidler, Legault, and Amanda Christine (who has less to do here as the aforementioned projectionist's daughter, Ronnie, eventually roped into the situation as one of the last people to see Matty alive) all have decent enough stage presence. But they wrestle with a script that has no grasp of how to make these characters sound like human beings,and staging that often feels more akin to sitcom work than drama or horror. Fuchs' script can't even come close to matching it, instead sounding, well, the way a screenwriter might imagine kids talking to each other: quippy, weightless, and written in the cadences of punchlines and clichés, rather than human feeling. (It's possible I've watched Dead Alive one too many times to find a grotesque murder baby anything but amusing, even as it's ripping off little kids' arms.) Burning through characters it spent a huge amount of its running time developing does give Welcome To Derry's first episode a sense of genuine unpredictability that's valuable. At the same time, it makes it even easier to dismiss these characters as lightly sketched-in stereotypes of King-type (or, if I'm being less charitable, Stranger Things-type) child heroes. Muschietti and Fuchs seem completely disinterested in even having these two plotlines rhyme, and it contributes to a messy sense of walking into a show while the table's still being set. Along with the aforementioned woes of its child actors, it's that lack of cohesion that hurts Welcome To Derry the most in this initial outing. But these arrive more as name-checks than ideas, with an antagonist content to amuse itself with gory monster babies than anything more evocative of genuine horror. (See also the show's early fumblings toward addressing Leroy's difficulties as a Black man in the 1960s military, which show up here as pretty much just one asshole mechanic and some ominous looks from Perry Mason star Chris Chalk. As is, we've got some effective scares, but acting, and especially writing, that can't live up to the series' pedigree.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the heels of Guillermo del Toro getting Netflix to help fund a stop-motion animation school and Paranorman returning to the box office, Laika has released a behind-the-scenes first-look featurette on their next film, Wildwood. Nine thousand feathers later, Wildwood is about ready for take off. Laika even produced a trailer for the book, but this kind of thing takes time. Since then, Meloy published two more Wildwood books, turning the book into a trilogy that he and Ellis completed in 2014. Wildwood follows Prue McKeel (Peyton Elizabeth Lee) and her friend Curtis Mehlberg (Jacob Tremblay) into a magical world “just beyond the edge of Portland” as they quest for her baby brother, Mac, who was kidnapped by a murder of crows. The film co-stars Bassett, Waits, Carey Mulligan, Mahershala Ali, Jemaine Clement, Jake Johnson, Charlie Day, Amandla Stenberg, Maya Erskine, Tantoo Cardinal, and Richard E. Grant. No release date has been set, but Wildwood is expected to land in theaters next year. Why do Return Of The King adaptations flinch away from its most crucial chapter?
