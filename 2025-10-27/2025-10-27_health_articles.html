                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new study, researchers found high levels of ultrashort-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in blood samples taken from Wilmington, N.C. residents between 2010-2016. Two ultrashort-chain PFAS - perfluoromethoxyacetic acid (PFMOAA) and trifluoracetic acid (TFA) - were detected at high levels in almost every sample. Ultrashort-chain PFAS such as PFMOAA and TFA have not been well-studied in people for two reasons: they were not thought to bioaccumulate due to their chemical structure, and until recently there were no analytical methods that allowed scientists to reliably detect them in blood. With the development of analytical methods targeting ultrashort-chain PFAS, researchers have found these compounds to be the dominant PFAS in environmental matrices including water and human blood. Given the long history of PFAS exposure in Wilmington, we wanted to look for these compounds in historical water and blood samples of residents." Detlef Knappe, professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at NC State and co-corresponding author of the study In 2016, NC State and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency researchers published findings highlighting high concentrations of several PFAS, including GenX, in Wilmington residents' drinking water. For the current study, the researchers looked for 56 different PFAS in water samples from the Cape Fear River taken in 2017 as well as in 119 adult blood serum samples from a UNC biobank that were collected between 2010-2016. The serum samples were anonymized, but all were taken from residents in and around the Wilmington area. PFMOAA had the highest median concentration at 42 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), comprising 42% of the summed total, followed by TFA (17 ng/mL), PFOS (14 ng/mL), PFOA (6.2 ng/mL), and PFPrA (5.4 ng/mL). Additionally, they found that TFA comprised 70% of the total PFAS in the 2017 water sample, with a concentration of 110,000 nanograms per liter (ng/L). While TFA has a variety of sources, including fluorinated refrigerants, the publication highlights that Fayetteville Works was the dominant source of both TFA and PFMOAA in the lower Cape Fear River. "Our sample contained over 50 times that concentration." "These data gave us a 'timestamp' of exposure before people knew their drinking water was contaminated," says Jane Hoppin, professor of biological sciences, principal investigator of the GenX Exposure Study, member of NC State's Center for Human Health and the Environment (CHHE), and co-corresponding author of the paper describing the work. "The conventional wisdom is that short-chain PFAS are of lesser concern because they don't bioaccumulate, but what we're seeing is that they can occur at high levels in people," Hoppin adds. "These results point out the need to start thinking about how to study the human health effects of these PFAS, particularly TFA and PFMOAA. Next steps include analyzing samples from the GenX Exposure Study for TFA and PFMOAA levels. "Seeing what the levels are now will help us determine how these chemicals accumulate in the body and what their health effects might be." The study appears in Environmental Science and Technology and was supported by research funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (1R21ES029353, P42ES0310095), Center for Human Health and the Environment (CHHE) at NC State University (P30ES025128), and the North Carolina Collaboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with funding appropriated by the North Carolina General Assembly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They usually have a system that helps them get the right level of care for patients, called triage. Triage systems help doctors determine when a patient is facing a true medical emergency and need treatment immediately, or when it is probably safe to delay treatment. Still, mistakes can happen, and sometimes patients don't get the help they need." There is no universal triage system, and it can be difficult to evaluate how well different systems function. The collaboration sprung out of a "Datathon" at Eitri Medical Incubator, Bergen in 2022, supervised by Dr. Christopher Sauer, an oncologist from the Institute for AI in Medicine from Essen, Germany. This project eventually led to a publication in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. First author, Dr. Sage Wyatt, defends the value of using machine learning to analyze medical data: "In this setting, machine learning methods allowed us to consider the importance of many complex factors that impact triage classification simultaneously, providing more nuanced results than conventional methods", she says. The data scientists in Wyatt's team wanted to find out what kinds of patients were failed by the triage system, such as patients who were given low priority but who later died or got transferred to the intensive care unit (undertriage) or patients who were given high priority unnecessarily (overtriage). Luckily, incorrect triage was very rare, affecting less than one percent of the patients. The data science team members with industry training used machine learning models to determine the importance of many different patient characteristics simultaneously, a novel method that has not been used in this setting before. When they applied these methods to emergency department data, the results were surprising: "A previous study using conventional methods in Bergen showed that overtriage was most prevalent in patients younger than 18 years, implying that age is one of the most important variables contributing to overtriage" Wyatt says Wyatt says that it might have downsides to base a study on expert opinion alone: "While it's valuable to hear opinions from people who know the triage systems best, this information can also be based on attitudes and assumptions unrelated to the tool itself", says Wyatt, and continues: "With a lot of focus in society on gender equality, which is an important topic to discuss, doctors and patients might assume that incorrect triage could also be due to gender bias", she says. The earlier study found that patient gender was an important factor, however, as Dr. Wyatt explains: "Instead, with machine learning methods, we identified that the clinical referral department and diagnostic codes are more important factors associated with overtriage in the Bergen dataset." "For optimal usage, appropriate methods must be tailored to the specific research context, and common pitfalls need to be avoided," she says, and concludes: Leveraging machine learning to identify subgroups of misclassified patients in the emergency department: a multi-center proof-of-concept study (Preprint).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an effort to stem the death toll from opioid overdose, United States public health officials have promoted the prescription and use of medications like buprenorphine that blunt the effects of illicit opioids such as fentanyl. However, what happens when patients on these medications require surgery and anesthesia? Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians handle this patient population. To fill in knowledge gaps, Mark Bicket, M.D., Ph.D., and his team examined trends in use of medications for opioid use disorder among surgical patients. Looking at 2016-2022 claims data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, the team focused on surgeries amongst adults 18-64 who had a claim for buprenorphine, methadone or extended-release naltrexone (together categorized as MOUD, medications for opioid use disorder) between 1 and 180 days before their procedure. They found that rates of MOUD use went up from 154 per 100,000 procedures in 2016 to 240 per 100,000 procedures in 2022, mostly resulting from increases in the use of buprenorphine. As for types of surgeries undergone by these patients, debridement and orthopedic procedures, such as shoulder arthroplasty, lower extremity amputation and hip or pelvis fracture open repair had the highest prevalence of MOUD use. The findings highlight a need to establish clinical practice guidelines for patients receiving MOUDs, especially around orthopedic surgery, to coordinate care and pain management and mitigate risk of harm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stillbirths occur at a higher rate in the U.S. than previously reported, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Mass General Brigham. The researchers also found that, while most stillbirths had at least one identified clinical risk factor, a substantial share had none, particularly those occurring at 40+ weeks gestation. Stillbirths impact nearly 21,000 families each year in the U.S., and nearly half of those occurring at 37+ weeks are thought to be preventable. Yet there is very little research in this area. Our study highlights the pressing need to improve stillbirth risk prediction and prevention." Jessica Cohen, professor of health economics, co-senior author The study will be published Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in JAMA. According to the researchers, it's one of the largest, most data-rich studies of stillbirth burden to date. They also considered a variety of socioeconomic factors, including rurality and area-level measures of income, race, and access to obstetric care. The researchers also observed that the stillbirth rate was 1 in every 95 births in areas with higher proportions of Black families compared to White families. The study also found that while 72.3% of stillbirths had at least one clinical risk factor, a sizable portion of stillbirths occurred with no identified clinical risk factor. Later gestational ages showed the highest rates of having no clinical risk factor: Among stillbirths that occurred at 38 weeks gestation, 24.1% had no risk factor; at 39 weeks, 34.2%; and at 40+ weeks, 40.7%. Stillbirth rates were highest among pregnancies with low amniotic fluid levels, fetal anomalies, and chronic hypertension. "Although momentum toward improving stillbirth research and prevention efforts has increased in recent years, rates in the U.S. remain much higher than in peer countries," said co-senior author Mark Clapp, maternal-fetal medicine provider in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital. "I hope this study will inform policy, practice changes, and future research to ensure no person or family has to experience this outcome." The researchers also noted that the study's findings indicate the need for further research into what's driving socioeconomic variances of stillbirth rates-whether that be social factors, health systems factors, and/or clinical risk factors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research shows that eosinophils, immune cells usually linked to allergies, also play a protective role against Candida infections by using the CD48 receptor to recognize the fungus and release proteins that stop its growth. This discovery is important because it reshapes how we understand the immune system and opens the door to new therapies that could strengthen natural defenses against life-threatening fungal infections, a growing challenge in hospitals worldwide. A new study, conducted under the guidance of Prof. Francesca Levi-Schaffer from the School of Pharmacy at the Hebrew University and led by PhD candidates Ilan Zaffran, Prince Ofori, and postdoctoral fellow Pratibha Gaur, uncovers how a surprising player in the immune system, eosinophils, best known for their role in allergies and asthma, also helps protect the body against Candida albicans, one of the most common and dangerous fungal infections in humans.Eosinophils are white blood cells typically associated with allergy, asthma, and inflammation. But their role in fighting infections has been less clear. The new research shows that these cells are not just bystanders: they can recognize and attack Candida albicans, a fungus that can cause life-threatening infections in people with weakened immune systems. The study identifies CD48, a key receptor on eosinophils, as central to this defense. This interaction triggers the release of powerful proteins, including major basic protein 1 (MBP-1), that limit fungal growth and survival.Invasive Candida infections are notoriously difficult to treat and remain a serious threat in hospitals worldwide. By showing that eosinophils, cells once thought to act mainly in allergies, also play a protective role, this research opens the door to new therapeutic strategies that could strengthen the body's natural defenses. "By defining a new CD48-Als6 pathway, the study points to future possibilities for therapies that boost natural immunity. Harnessing the protective potential of eosinophils could one day improve treatment for patients vulnerable to invasive Candida disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A groundbreaking study published in the peer-reviewed journal Music and Medicine demonstrates that intraoperative music therapy significantly reduces the amount of propofol and fentanyl required during laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed under general anesthesia. Patients exposed to therapeutic music also experienced smoother awakenings and lower physiological stress, as measured by decreased perioperative cortisol levels. "These findings show that this is more than just simple background music, rather an integration of a novel intervention into anesthetic practice," said Dr. Tanvi Goel, principal investigator and anesthesiologist at Lok Nayak Hospital and Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi, India. "The auditory environment under anesthesia is often neglected, but sound-when delivered with therapeutic intent-may accelerate healing, reduce stress, and improve recovery in ways we are only beginning to quantify," noted Dr. Sonia Wadhawan, Director Professor of Anesthesia and Intensive Care at Maulana Azad Medical College. "This study adds to the growing empirical evidence that the neural effects of patient-preferred music translate to behavioral benefits," said Wendy L. Magee, PhD, Professor of Music Therapy at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance. "For people with disorders of consciousness following brain injury, patient-preferred music improves arousal and cognition. "This study shows the real potential of music to improve anesthetic care, but we must go further," said Joseph J. Schlesinger, MD, FCCM, Professor of Anesthesiology, Critical Care Medicine, Hearing & Speech Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "To truly understand how music affects the brain during surgery, we need multimodal EEG and a broader view of the perioperative sound environment that includes both patient outcomes and provider safety." These findings open the door for future studies to expand sample sizes, explore music therapy across general anesthesia for different types of surgery, and develop standardized music protocols that could be implemented in hospitals worldwide."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Youth opioid use is increasing in Canada, as are related emergency department visits and deaths, yet governments are not providing adequate support to address this public health crisis, argue the authors of a CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) editorial https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251682. "If this crisis is not properly addressed now, Canada's health systems will play a part in perpetuating the opioid crisis for decades to come," write Dr. Shannon Charlebois, medical editor, CMAJ, and Dr. Shawn Kelly, a pediatrician and addictions medicine specialist, CHEO and the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario. Paradoxically, youth struggle to access opioid agonist therapy, with evidence showing that fewer prescriptions are written even as the need increases. Other effective treatments, such psychological therapy and substance use disorder programs, are sparse, have long wait-lists, and are often privately funded, making them inaccessible to those most at risk. "Health systems' inaction and lack of investment to provide evidence-based addictions services for youth is inexcusable, as the opioid crisis involves this population. Physicians who treat youth need support to be able to care for their patients with OUD [opioid use disorder]. Anything less represents complicity in the next decade of preventable deaths," they conclude. Canada's youth are part of the opioid crisis and need treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Efforts to promote safer opioid prescribing in Canada appear to be having an effect, as new research in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250670 shows a decrease in opioid dispensing between 2018 and 2022. The availability of more opioid products, coupled with aggressive marketing of these drugs, contributed to these early increases in Canada and in other countries. Many initiatives have been introduced with the goal of reducing these harms throughout the country, including policy changes, a focus on continuing medical education for evidence-based prescribing, and a national Canadian guideline for opioid prescribing published in 2017. With these changes, a need has emerged for national information on prescription opioid use in Canada and how this varies in different parts of the population. Researchers aimed to help fill this gap with a study of opioid prescribing in 6 Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec) between 2018 and 2022. In 2022, across Canada, approximately 1.8 million people started an opioid to manage pain for the first time. However, the rate of opioid prescribing varied among provinces, ranging from 55 new opioid starts per 1000 people in Ontario to 63 per 1000 people in Alberta. "The interprovincial variations in our findings may indicate differences in the implementation of prescribing guidelines, underscoring the need for coordinated national strategies and ongoing evaluation of their effects on patient outcomes," writes Dr. Tara Gomes, a researcher in the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network at St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, with coauthors. Codeine was most usually prescribed in most provinces, with the exception of Quebec, where people were more commonly dispensed morphine and hydromorphone. The authors caution that although lower rates of opioid prescribing may reflect doctors' efforts to ensure safe and appropriate prescribing, a balance is needed to ensure that people are not left without pain relief or cut off from medications without appropriate supports and coordination of care. In some cases, these changes have led to patients seeking access to opioids from the unregulated drug supply, which are inherently more harmful," write the authors. The researchers suggest that clinicians engage in conversations with patients to ensure shared decision-making, and assess pain levels and ability to function. "The truth is … that opioids are less effective and less safe than many care to admit," writes Dr. David Juurlink, an internist and researcher at Sunnybrook Research Institute and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, in a related commentary https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.251666 praising the continued decline in opioid prescribing. Opioids can be effective when carefully prescribed, particularly for short periods. "Most clinicians have seen how well opioids can work when first given," writes Dr. Juurlink. "But they are at their pharmacologic best in the initial days of treatment. Continue them for weeks, months, or years and the calculus becomes progressively less favorable." Juurlink urges thoughtful prescribing, which "begins with recognizing that all patients in pain fall into 1 of 3 mutually exclusive groups: those not yet on opioids, those taking opioids chronically (sometimes called 'legacy patients'), and those with established addiction. The latter 2 groups overlap and are easily harmed by rapid dose reduction, but they can also be harmed by dose escalation. For such patients, when pain intensifies, nonopioid strategies are preferred.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team led by the UAB Institut de Neurociències (INc-UAB) has for the first time identified the mechanism behind a potentially fatal type of epilepsy, a symptom of mitochondrial diseases. The discovery, based on mouse models, challenges the traditional idea that these disorders are caused by a generalized energy deficiency and instead reveals a precise disfunction in specific brain circuits. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of very severe disorders caused by defects in the mitochondria, the machinery in charge of producing cell energy. They affect approximately one out of every 4,300 births. Due to this low incidence, they are considered rare diseases, and therefore few resources are set aside for their research.Not all cells in the body are equally vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction: those with higher energetic needs tend to degenerate faster. In this sense, one of the most common and particularly severe symptoms is a form of epilepsy that does not respond to conventional treatments. Now, in a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI), a research team led by the Institut de Neurociències of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona was able to further investigate this type of epilepsy. By using mice models of Leigh syndrome, one of the most frequent mitochondrial diseases, researchers were able to investigate specific brain circuits and the neural alterations causing it.Since epileptic crises involve excessive neural activation, the team worked on inhibitory neurons, known as GABAergic neurons (which release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA), with the hypothesis that perhaps these neurons were not functioning properly. The mice lived longer and showed a notable improvement in neurological functions.“We were surprised to see how the loss of only one inhibitory neuron population could spread through the network and trigger epileptic crises”, Laura Sánchez-Benito explains. Our study demonstrates that it is not the whole brain that is propelling the crisis, but rather that restoring the function of these specific neurons is enough to drastically suppress this fatal form of epilepsy.” “Moreover, since the inactivation of STN with deep brain stimulation is already a therapy being used, this option could be considered for patients with Leigh syndrome”, he concludes.The study, conducted in collaboration with researchers from the Institut de Neurociències d'Alacant, the Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), and the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, opens up new horizons for patients with mitochondrial diseases who currently have no therapeutic options when it comes to treating their crises. Dysfunctional LHX6 pallido-subthalamic projections mediate epileptic events in a mouse model of Leigh Syndrome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study demonstrated that the Vascul8 model provides accurate, automated insights into response to surgery for patients treated for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) surgery is often carried out to remove the clots; however, patients can be left with residual pulmonary hypertension (PH) and require further intervention or treatment. The current approach to stratify patients at risk of pulmonary hypertension involves right heart catheterization (RHC), an invasive and resource intensive procedure, to measure pressure and blood flow in pulmonary circulation. The findings reported in this paper show we can effectively screen patients for residual PH, and therefore perform right heart catheterization only on those with high risk for residual PH, reducing the number of invasive, costly procedures. Qureight's AI-powered imaging and clinical data curation platform and deep learning models identify key structural changes in the lung to assess disease progression. Analysis with Vascul8 enabled precise vascular segmentation, including differentiating between arterial and venous blood volume, providing an objective, automated approach to identifying changes in vessel volume and predicting which patients are most at risk of residual pulmonary hypertension. This study demonstrates how Qureight's deep learning technology offers a more personalized, accurate and non-invasive approach to CTEPH treatment management, providing physicians with deeper insights into a patient's severity of disease and need for further intervention. Joanna Pepke-Zaba, Consultant Physician, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Associate Professor, University of Cambridge, and lead author of the paper, said: "CTEPH has for a long time had a complex disease management pathway, requiring the subjective expertise of multidisciplinary teams. We are excited to have worked on this study where we show an alternative approach to imaging CTEPH and patient management, employing Qureight's imaging analysis model, Vascul8. Hakim Ghani, Research Fellow, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and first author of the paper, added: "Powered by Vascul8, automated quantification of lung blood volumes from CT scans can help identify patients with chronic blood clots who remain at risk of residual pulmonary hypertension after surgery. This AI-driven imaging approach could guide better treatment decisions, support more personalized care, reduce the need for invasive tests, and enable new endpoints in clinical trials - overall offering huge potential for patient benefit." This study shows the promise of our deep-learning vascular biomarkers and demonstrates that our imaging platform can be used beyond fibrotic lung disease, in pulmonary vascular disorders such as CTEPH. This breakthrough establishes the foundation for future biopharma partnerships in pulmonary vascular disease, reinforcing our leadership position in regulatory-grade, disease-agnostic imaging biomarkers built for clinical and translational research, to accelerate drug development, enable smarter patient selection, and support precision medicine."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawsonia inermis is best known for making henna, a versatile dye that is used to change the color of skin and clothes. Now, researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University have found another use for the pigments extracted from the dye: treating liver disease. Specifically, they could treat liver fibrosis, a disease that causes excess fibrous scar tissue to build up in the liver as a result of chronic liver injury caused by lifestyle choices such as excessive drinking. Usually, these cells maintain balance in the liver; however, when too many are activated, such as during liver injury, they produce excessive fibrous tissue and collagen, disrupting normal liver function.A research group led by Associate Professor Tsutomu Matsubara and Dr. Atsuko Daikoku at the Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University, developed a chemical screening system that identifies substances that directly act on activated HSCs. They also found upregulated cytoglobin, a marker associated with antioxidant functions in HSCs, suggesting that the HSCs were reverting back toward the non-fibrotic, quiescent type.The professors believe that by making drugs based on Lawsone, they could create the first treatment that controls and even improves fibrosis. We are currently developing a drug delivery system capable of transporting drugs to activated HSCs and ultimately hope to make it available for patients with liver fibrosis. By controlling fibroblast activity, including HSCs, we could potentially limit or even reverse the effects of fibrosis." Dr. Atsuko Daikoku, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University The study was published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy. Lawsone can suppress liver fibrosis by inhibition of YAP signaling and induction of CYGB expression in hepatic stellate cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While multimodal therapies have improved outcomes for low- and intermediate-risk patients, high-risk or metastatic cases still suffer poor survival rates below 30%. Existing treatments are often toxic and limited by drug resistance. Thiostrepton (TST), first isolated in the 1950s from Streptomyces azureus, has recently emerged as a promising anticancer agent due to its unique ability to inhibit tumor-related transcription factors and signaling pathways. Based on these challenges, it is necessary to explore thiostrepton's therapeutic mechanisms in rhabdomyosarcoma through comprehensive experimental research. A research team from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China, reported (DOI: 10.1002/pdi3.70014) on June 29, 2025, in Pediatric Discovery that thiostrepton can significantly suppress rhabdomyosarcoma progression by targeting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Using bioinformatics screening of GEO datasets and connectivity mapping, they identified thiostrepton as a top candidate for reversing tumor-associated gene expression. Laboratory experiments confirmed its ability to curb tumor growth both in cultured cells and animal models, providing compelling preclinical evidence for repurposing thiostrepton as an anti-rhabdomyosarcoma drug. The study combined transcriptome analysis and pharmacological validation to uncover thiostrepton's antitumor mechanisms. In a xenograft mouse model, thiostrepton treatment (3.4 mg/mL for four weeks) substantially reduced tumor volume without damaging vital organs. RNA sequencing revealed that thiostrepton downregulated multiple oncogenic regulators, including AKT, JAK, and CDKs, while suppressing the PI3K-AKT pathway. Adding a PI3K activator partially reversed these effects, confirming the pathway's central role. These findings position thiostrepton as a multi-mechanistic inhibitor that disrupts cancer cell survival, signaling, and proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that thiostrepton exerts broad-spectrum antitumor effects through a dual mechanism—directly impairing ribosomal protein synthesis and suppressing the PI3K-AKT signaling axis. This approach not only halts cancer cell growth and invasion but also minimizes toxicity, which is crucial for pediatric therapy. Given its well-characterized safety profile as a veterinary antibiotic, thiostrepton could be rapidly advanced through preclinical testing and adapted for combination therapies in childhood rhabdomyosarcoma." The discovery of thiostrepton's efficacy opens new avenues for drug repurposing in pediatric oncology. By targeting the PI3K-AKT signaling network—a pathway commonly associated with tumor resistance—thiostrepton offers a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of existing treatments while reducing side effects. Future research will focus on evaluating synergistic combinations with mTOR or immune checkpoint inhibitors to overcome therapeutic resistance. If validated in clinical studies, thiostrepton-based regimens could become an affordable and safe alternative for managing aggressive forms of rhabdomyosarcoma, improving survival prospects for young patients worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Physical fitness, physical activity and screen time are associated with brain mechanisms underlying mental health and learning, according to two recent studies from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital. Research into the effects of lifestyle and physical fitness on adolescent brain function remains limited to date. Our new findings highlight the importance of an active lifestyle, good physical fitness and moderate screen time for brain development in adolescence." In the first study, participants' physical fitness and lifestyle habits were monitored from childhood. The researchers found that better physical fitness was associated with increased excitability and stronger inhibition of the motor cortex in adolescence - with excitability and inhibition regulating brain development and learning processes. "Passive engagement with digital devices, such as scrolling on the phone or watching TV and videos, weakened adolescents' cortical inhibition, that is, the so-called 'braking system' of the brain," Skog says. Conversely, active engagement with digital devices was associated with increased cortical excitability, as was participation in organised sports in sports clubs. Screen time should be kept within reasonable limits, and it should preferably involve digital media that stimulates activity and movement." The studies, conducted as part of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study (PANIC) and the FitBrain study, involved 45 healthy Finnish adolescents aged 16-19, including 25 girls and 20 boys. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed via a direct maximal cycle ergometer test, muscular strength via a standing long jump test, speed and agility via a 10 x 50 metre shuttle run test, and upper limb coordination via a box and block test. Questionnaires were used to evaluate screen time and participation in organised sports, supervised exercise other than sports, and unsupervised physical activity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, was used to measure, e.g., the brain's response to stimuli induced by a magnetic pulse, and the brain's ability to inhibit or suppress activity as needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treating chronic neuropathic pain with spinal cord stimulation may help prevent excess mortality associated with chronic pain, a new study from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital shows. Chronic neuropathic pain is a difficult-to-treat condition affecting up to one in ten people. Most individuals living with chronic pain will have a good and durable response to treatment in the case of, e.g., neuropathic pain medications, or pain-targeting physical and occupational therapy. However, some patients end up on long-term opioid therapy, which is known to be addictive and associated with increased overall mortality. Moreover, chronic pain itself has also been shown to be independently associated with elevated mortality rates. The study found that patients who did not respond to spinal cord stimulation had a higher mortality rate than the control cohort. A similar increase in mortality was observed among patients whose treatment was discontinued during the follow-up period. However, there were no differences in either group's causes of death, compared to the control cohort. This finding suggests that excess mortality associated with chronic pain can be avoided through successful pain management. As a pain management strategy, spinal cord stimulation differs significantly from long-term opioid therapy, which is addictive and increases mortality." Antti J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have discovered that people exposed to brighter light at night face up to 50% higher risks of heart disease, while daytime light may protect the heart by reinforcing healthy circadian rhythms. Study: Light Exposure at Night and Cardiovascular Disease Incidence. In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers explored whether being exposed to light at nighttime is associated with a higher risk of developing heart disease, particularly for those of a specific age, sex, or genetic makeup. Their findings indicate that people over 40 exposed to bright lights at night face higher risks of heart disease, including stroke and heart failure. Associations were larger in females for heart failure and coronary artery disease, and in younger participants for heart failure and atrial fibrillation, with no clear modification for myocardial infarction or stroke. Healthy cardiovascular function relies on well-regulated circadian rhythms, which in turn influence vascular function, glucose tolerance, hormone levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. Disruption of these rhythms, through exposure to light or irregular sleep patterns, can elevate blood pressure and heart rate, increase inflammation, and reduce heart rate variability. Animal studies show that prolonged circadian disruption can cause structural heart changes, such as hypertrophy and fibrosis. Epidemiological evidence also links shift work, which disturbs these rhythms, to greater cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Light exposure at night is a key source of circadian disruption and has been linked to higher rates of coronary artery disease and stroke, as well as conditions like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, which are known cardiovascular risk factors. Using wrist-worn light sensors from about 89,000 UK Biobank participants, earlier research found that brighter nights were associated with higher cardiometabolic mortality and type 2 diabetes. Building on this, the present study examined whether individual day and night light exposures predict incident cardiovascular diseases over 9.5 years of follow-up. This large-scale cohort study used data from UK Biobank participants who wore wrist-worn light sensors for one week between 2013 and 2016. Participants' light exposure was recorded continuously, processed to remove invalid data, and averaged into 24-hour profiles. Factor analysis identified two main exposure periods: daytime (7:30 AM–8:30 PM) and nighttime (12:30 AM–6:00 AM). Cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease, were identified using hospital, primary-care, and death-registry records. Individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) were excluded. Additional models were tested for potential interactions with genetic risk scores, age, and sex. Researchers analyzed data from 88,905 UK Biobank participants, with an average age of 62.4 years and 57% female, over an average follow-up of 7.9 years. Participants were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Nighttime light exposure showed a clear, dose-dependent association with a higher risk of heart disease, while daytime light exposure was linked to lower risks in minimally and socioeconomically adjusted models, but these associations were not significant after full lifestyle adjustment. When physical activity was excluded from the full model, inverse associations re-emerged for heart failure and stroke. Compared with those in the darkest-night environment, participants with the brightest night exposure had significantly greater risks of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke after adjusting for lifestyle, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. In contrast, an increase in night-light exposure by one standard deviation raised the risk of all five cardiovascular outcomes by about 5–8%. The associations were consistent across models and remained robust after adjustments. Associations also remained after accounting for polygenic risk, suggesting gene–environment correlation is unlikely to explain the results. This large prospective study demonstrates strong associations of higher nighttime light exposure with elevated cardiovascular risk, though causality cannot be inferred. Reduced melatonin secretion was not directly examined in this study. In contrast, greater daytime light exposure may support cardiovascular health by reinforcing circadian rhythms. However, limitations include potential residual confounding, limited ethnic diversity (primarily White participants), lack of information on light sources, and the inability to infer causality. Sleep duration and efficiency were objectively measured and included in sensitivity analyses; short sleep partially attenuated some associations. Source information was unavailable, limiting the ability to adjust for behaviors correlated with light exposure. Overall, these findings highlight artificial nighttime lighting as a potentially modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiovascular disease, underscoring the importance of maintaining dark nights and adequate daylight exposure in urban health strategies.
