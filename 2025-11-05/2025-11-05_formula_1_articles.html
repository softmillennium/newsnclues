                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two brands are set to extend their near decade-long collaboration. Formula 1 has today announced the extension and expansion of its Global Partnership with Heineken following nearly 10 years of collaboration between the two brands to bring fans together both at and beyond Grands Prix events. The F1 Fan Zone, elevated to be presented by Heineken 0.0, will include new in-person installations and vivid branding across each race weekend. Heineken will also launch the ‘Heineken Star Fans' campaign, designed to celebrate the best fans across the season through an online content series, dedicated pages on F1.com, awards, and exclusive competitions. The inaugural holder is Brandon Burgess, who captured the attention of fans and media around the world with his ambitious quest to attend every race in 2025 on a budget while juggling a full-time job. Next year, Heineken will be offering another fan the chance to get their hands on this coveted Season Ticket for them and a friend to experience every twist and turn of every race via F1 Unlocked. The global beer brand will continue to use F1's platform to provide messaging around responsible consumption and promote Heineken 0.0 – a premium zero-alcohol product – while continuing to deliver trackside branding, Paddock Club hospitality and co-branded products across each season. Stefano Domenicali, President & CEO, Formula 1, said: “For nearly a decade Heineken has stood alongside Formula 1 with a shared passion for creating an unrivalled experience and spectacle for our fans. I want to thank the Heineken family, Dolf and his team for their continued support and I am delighted that our partnership will bring even more excitement to spectators both at and away from track for many years to come. “In motorsport, innovation is in our DNA, so I'm thrilled that Heineken continues to push the boundaries of engaging fans and taking them even closer to the action.” Dolf van den Brink, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board at Heineken, added: “After almost a decade of creating unforgettable fan experiences together, I'm thrilled we will be extending and expanding our partnership with Formula 1. “This new chapter of our partnership is about more than sponsorship – it's about connecting with fans, creating unique experiences, and celebrating the global F1 fandom. “We can't wait to deliver more fan-first activations, shared experiences, and showcase the incredible energy that surrounds F1, both on and off the track – all with a cold Heineken (0.0) beer in hand."</p>
