                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elena Rybakina had already secured a spot in the WTA Finals semifinals before taking the court Wednesday, but her final round-robin match still carried weight. Despite entering the match with a losing record against Alexandrova, Rybakina continued her dominant run, winning 6-4, 6-4 in 1 hour and 14 minutes. The victory allowed her to finish with a perfect 3-0 mark in Serena Williams Group play. Rybakina was later joined by Amanda Anisimova, who ousted Iga Swiatek in three sets. “Each win gives you confidence, so I'm really happy with that for now. The last few matches have been great and hopefully I can continue that.” Rybakina had originally been scheduled to face Madison Keys, but tournament officials announced Keys had withdrawn hours before the match due to a viral illness. "Really disappointed to not be feeling my best and ultimately having to withdraw from the tournament,” Keys said in a statement. "Huge accomplishment to make it this far and very proud of myself for doing that and having a great year. She had already been eliminated from semifinal contention. The first alternate Mirra Andreeva declined to play, citing fitness concerns. That opened the door for second alternate Alexandrova to make her WTA Finals debut at age 30. Alexandrova arrived ready to play, winning the first six points and staying level with Rybakina through the first eight games. But Rybakina struck at the most opportune time, seizing her first break opportunity for a 5-4 lead before holding at love to close out the opening set in 35 minutes. That break proved decisive, as Rybakina converted her lone chance while Alexandrova went 0-for-3. In the second set, Alexandrova regrouped, holding serve to open with a 1-0 lead. Serving for the match, she was broken for the first time, then faced two more break points while attempting to serve it out at 5-4. “Ekaterina is always a tough opponent,” Rybakina said. Rybakina finishes group play as the outright winner of the Serena Williams Group, dropping just one set en route to three consecutive top-10 victories. Since 1990, it's the most in a season by any player representing an Asian country, surpassing Li Na's eight in 2011 and 2013.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With her fifth year-end No.1 finish, Katerina Siniakova equals Martina Navratilova's record and extends her reign as one of doubles' most consistent champions. To celebrate Siniakova's incredible 2025 season, she was honored during a special presentation at the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF earlier where she officially received the year-end No.1 trophy. Siniakova previously ended the season in the elite ranking position in 2018 (when co-ranked No.1 with Barbora Krejčíková), 2021, 2022, and 2024, now tied with Martina Navratilova, each recording five seasons for the most No.1 doubles year-end finishes in WTA history. This wasn't her only history-making achievement this season, as the week of November 10, 2025 will mark Siniakova's 169th week holding the No.1 position -- now the third-most weeks in WTA history, behind only Liezel Huber (199) and Navratilova (237). Siniakova's 2025 season has been defined by excellence and versatility across multiple team partnerships. She captured four titles, beginning with the Australian Open and the WTA 1000 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, both alongside Taylor Townsend. She later claimed another WTA 1000 crown at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open with Storm Hunter and added a WTA 500 title at the Korea Open Tennis Championships with long-time partner Barbora Krejcikova. "There's been so many great memories this season and I'm just so grateful I can lift this trophy again." In addition to her titles, Siniakova and Townsend reached the US Open final and are currently competing at the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF, where they have already advanced to the semifinals following two group stage victories. With her fifth year-end No.1 finish, Katerina Siniakova equals Martina Navratilova's record and extends her reign as one of doubles' most consistent champions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sara Sorribes Tormo is to make her return to tennis this month following a six-month hiatus in which the Olympic doubles bronze medalist was diagnosed with depression. 32 plans to play the WTA 125 event in Colina, Chile starting on Nov. 17. The Spaniard has not played since the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers in April, in which she won both her singles and doubles rubbers. "I couldn't even step onto a tennis court," Sorribes Tormo said. I'd step onto the court and want to leave immediately. I'd go to training and not last more than 10 minutes. I'd burst into tears in the middle of training. After I'd been out for a month, I came to play here with my mother and lasted three minutes; I had a panic attack and we had to leave. "It was killing me not to enjoy it, because I've always loved tennis and I've always played to try and improve. I just wanted the hours to pass. It was like coming to clock in. That, combined with a lot of anxiety, made things very difficult." At first, almost completely out of energy, Sorribes Tormo could do little more than sleep all day. For a player who'd made her reputation by tirelessly outlasting opponents on tour -- the 29-year-old's matches habitually passed the three-hour mark -- this was not a situation she was accustomed to. "It was like nothing made sense," Sorribes Tormo told El Mundo. Sorribes Tormo set up a home gym so she could stay fit without leaving the house. She began to discover a love of hiking and headed out to do the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage solo -- an experience she describes as "wonderful."

I know that Sara can live without playing tennis, that I really enjoy life outside of tennis.</p>

"I'm really thrilled to get through tonight," Djokovic said in his on-court interview. "To get through against Tabilo, who I had never won against—we played two times on clay court and he won both matches—I was under more tension and stress before this match than in most matches.

There was little between the two players in the marathon 68-minute first set on Tuesday, with neither budging on serve—Djokovic had double break point in the very first game of the match, but Tabilo saved them both, and they would turn out to be the only break points of the first set.But come crunch time it was all Djokovic, as he jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the tie-break, eventually taking it, 7-3, and then after trading holds in the first two games of the second set he caught fire again, reeling off five games in a row from 1-all for a runaway victory.He finished the match with 27 winners to 21 unforced errors, with some spectacular serving that produced 13 aces to zero double faults.It was his first career win in his new home base. "It feels like home playing in Athens," he told the crowd. So it was amazing to experience great hospitality with Greek people, which Greece is globally famous for. But more than recognition for my tennis achievements, I feel like people approach me in a most humane way. Athens is in my heart, no doubt about it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two players agreed that they bring out the best in each other, but Pegula lamented once again falling just short.ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 05, 2025 copy_link Over the last 18 months, a few points played between Jessica Pegula and Aryna Sabalenka may have changed the court of tennis history foreverIt's not an exaggeration when one considers that Sabalenka, a future Hall of Famer even at this stage of her career, has beaten Pegula on the way to a pair of Grand Slam titles, and two WTA 1000 crowns, since last season began. After the latest installment in their head-to-head at the WTA Finals on Tuesday—a 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 win for Sabalenka in their second meeting at the year-end championships—the two players agreed that they bring out the best in each other.But Pegula lamented once again falling just short: this time, from a break ahead in the final frame.She has now lost nine of 12 matches against Sabalenka all-time, a d the last three have played out in three dramatic sets. "I do think we have really great matches, memorable matches," she said. "I wish I won more of them ... even my coaches were saying, they're like, 'Whenever you guys play each other, it seems like you guys seem to bring out such a high level in each other. But I feel like, if you asked me in 10 years, like I look back and had all these super memorable matches with her.

Jessica Pegula, 2025 WTA Finals RR"I felt like she just got really angry and played really well, which tends to be what she does," Pegula continued. "I feel like when she starts getting really hyped up and yelling, 'Come on,' and screaming ... that's kind of when you've activated another level to her. So I can either go one of two ways, and I felt like it just kind of went against me today, and she played well. "But the difference between this defeat and others against Sabalenka is that Pegula won't have much time to linger on her disappointment. With a 1-1 record, she can still secure a spot in the semifinals if she defeats Jasmine Paolini, eliminated from knockout contention after losing to Coco Gauff in straight sets in the other Stefanie Graf Group match on Tuesday, and her case will be bolstered if Sabalenka defeats Gauff.Read more: Aryna Sabalenka goes "as hard as I can, and heavy as I can” to edge Jessica Pegula in Riyadh "I felt like she just got really angry and played really well, which tends to be what she does," Pegula continued.

"But at the same time, a lot of you know tactical stuff [is important] in order to kind of see what I can do differently from the last time that I played her. "Last time she beat me [at the Billie Jean King Cup in September], so I think there's definitely going to be some things that I'm going to want to change from last time, and I think that'll be really important."
