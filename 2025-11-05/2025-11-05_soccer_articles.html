                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are many ways to explain why so many managers connected to Pep Guardiola are running Europe's elite clubs at the same time. The simple version is that they all speak a common football language built on positional play, pressing triggers, and intense control of the ball and space. That language has forked into distinct dialects under different pupils and former players, yet the grammar remains Pep's. Tactical analysts have tracked how Guardiola's ideas have spread across the Premier League and into Europe, from the box-to-box midfield and inverted full-backs to more recent evolutions around rest defense and control without chaos. The league itself has publicly credited his influence on how English football thinks and trains, a shift that has made the top level faster and smarter. Mikel Arteta worked as Guardiola's assistant for three and a half years before taking Arsenal. Enzo Maresca coached within Manchester City's structure and adopted a possession-first model that mirrors Pep's principles. Two other heads of super clubs actually played under Guardiola and chose to learn at close range in their final years. Xabi Alonso said explicitly that he went to Bayern to learn from Pep, a line that has aged well now that Alonso is making major calls from Real Madrid's bench. Mikel Arteta's Arsenal are not a carbon copy. Arsenal lean into wide overloads, ferocious pressing waves, and an obsession with set-piece gains, a notable divergence from Pep's City this season. Analysts who follow coaching detail have shown how Arteta has expanded the model rather than merely borrowing it, blending positional play with English tempo and muscular duels. As of today, Arsenal sit at the top of the Premier League table after ten matches with an 8-1-1 record and a goal difference of plus 15. This is not nostalgia for last season, it is the present state of the league table on November 5, 2025. City have famously not leaned into heavy set-piece returns this campaign, while Arsenal squeezes value from them whenever the flow stalls, a neat illustration of how pupils adapt the teacher's blueprint to their own squad build. Bayern Munich hired him in 2024 and doubled down by extending his deal through 2029 this autumn. The result is a juggernaut that has recovered its familiar aura without losing a modern feel. Bayern have started the 2025 26 Bundesliga with perfection, and they are top of the table after nine league games with maximum points and a goal difference that looks like a champion's. Reporters described Bayern's 3 0 statement against Bayer Leverkusen last weekend as another mile marker in a record winning run, achieved even while resting stars to manage the Champions League rhythm. They beat PSG 2-1 last night with 10 men to make it 16/16. That blend of ruthless control and smart load management feels very familiar to anyone who watched Guardiola build City's winning machine. He has simplified Bayern's high press into repeatable triggers, asked his center backs to be brave at the line, and kept a vertical threat on at least one wing so the possession never becomes sterile. The big idea is continuity shaped by personality. Kompany absorbed Pep's insistence on field occupation and circulation speed, then fused it with his defender's eye for defensive distances. The outcome is a team that denies counterattacks before they start and still explodes when the opening appears. That is the Guardiola school in a nutshell. Alonso did not coach under Guardiola; he studied under him as a player at Bayern and said he had come to learn. A decade later, he is the head coach at Real Madrid, appointed on a three-year contract in May, and his team is currently leading La Liga after 11 games. The mix is Alonso's own, with Madrid leaning into vertical switches and early releases to the front, yet the positional discipline from those Bayern years remains. Alonso's Madrid look like Madrid should look, with more direct punch and a willingness to race through open doors. Enzo Maresca is the other branch to watch in England. Chelsea hired him on a five-year deal after his Leicester title, betting on a defined identity. His Chelsea have embraced a patient positional game that at times tests the crowd, yet the principles are coherent. Stacked with a Conference League title and the FIFA Club World Cup trophy, his time at London has been a success. It shows how demanding the method is without the cohesion and seniority that City or Madrid enjoys. When the spacing is right and the midfield rotates on time, Chelsea look like a team that can pin opponents and create waves of advantage. When it is off by a beat, the structure can feel slow. The wider picture is impossible to miss. All three are led by coaches who either worked under Guardiola or explicitly studied him up close. There is no need to force a myth. That is what real coaching trees do. They do not just grow, they branch in directions that prove the trunk is alive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not long after the 2026 World Cup draw is held on Dec. 5, teams that have qualified for the tournament will begin looking for a place to stay next summer. Those national soccer teams that have qualified for the World Cup (and we won't know them all in early December), will pick the city where they want to have their base camp. Three potential base-camp sites are in the Kansas City area. FIFA made an online base camp brochure for its member associations that includes “top-notch training site and hotel pairings that could become your home away from home.” This is FIFA's top option for a national team wanting to train at Sporting Kansas City's facilities. FIFA wrote: “Hotel Savoy, a full buyout option, offers stylish accommodations, extensive meeting space, and convenient downtown access, ideal for teams seeking comfort, privacy, and proximity to Kansas City's top attractions. “The nearby Sporting KC Training Centre, home to MLS' Sporting Kansas City, is state-of-the-art with its cutting-edge facilities and services contributing to football development across the USA.” For a team training at the Current site, this is FIFA's preferred hotel choice. Hotel Kansas City is part of the Unbound Collection by Hyatt. “The University of Kansas training facility, a short drive away, includes multiple dressing rooms, medical rooms, polar and thermal recovery baths, two gyms, a cardio room, equipment storage, and dedicated meeting spaces — fully equipped to support elite football preparation.” Get in-depth, sideline coverage of Kansas City area sports - only $1 a month</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But how did the island nation make it here? Cape Verde has recently achieved this milestone, qualifying for its first-ever World Cup. With a population of just under 600,000, Cape Verde becomes the second-smallest country ever to reach the tournament, marking a historic moment that will reshape its national identity overnight. This achievement was made possible in part through the FIFA Forward program, established in 2016 to support the growth and development of soccer worldwide. FIFA Forward stands as the world's most extensive sports development program. Its purpose is straightforward: to distribute FIFA's revenues equitably among all 211 member associations. The initiative is built on three main pillars — increasing investment in global football development, creating targeted, customized projects for greater impact, and emphasizing transparent, accountable management of all funds. Funding is primarily directed toward five key areas — infrastructure, capacity building, competitions, national teams, and operational support — with additional specialized projects tailored to each federation's unique needs. By emphasizing transparency and measurable results, FIFA Forward has reshaped the landscape of football governance. It has empowered federations to focus on long-term sustainability instead of short-term fixes. Support from the FIFA Forward program, which includes financial assistance for national team operations, has been instrumental in driving this progress. The FIFA Forward program has helped to modernize the FCF's operations, improving its infrastructure, working environment, and overall readiness for international competition. With this financial backing, the Cape Verde national team gained the resources needed to manage international travel, training camps, and essential equipment. “It's a victory for the Cape Verdean people, for those who are here and those who are abroad,” said Cape Verde head coach coach Pedro Leitão Brito, commonly known as Bubista, to FIFA.com. Columbus Crew defender Steven Moreira is one of several dual-nationals for the Cape Verde national team. Speaking to Tiago Brandao of Territory MLS, Morreira said: “It's incredible, the most beautiful thing I've achieved in my life, because I moved to another country and made my family proud. My wish is to go as far as possible with the team, make history, and if we can play against France, Brazil, or other great teams, that would be wonderful.” Moreira's words reflect the dual identity many Cape Verdean players share — a balance between global ambition and national loyalty. For Cape Verde, attracting such talent marks a turning point. Another example of Cape Verde's growing influence is Roberto Lopes, who was born in Ireland to a Cabo Verdean father and has spent his entire playing career in the League of Ireland with Bohemians and now Shamrock Rovers. Lopes stated that playing international football had given his career a new dimension. “Being able to test yourself against the best players in the world, bringing back your knowledge to the team, and trying to improve yourself every day – it's made me a better player, it's made me a better person, and I've experienced things I never would have in my life before.” By investing in development and providing access to global competition, FIFA Forward has allowed nations like Cape Verde to broaden their horizons and take meaningful steps toward sustainable football growth. The Cape Verde example demonstrates that FIFA Forward's success is not measured solely by financial figures but by the social, cultural, and developmental outcomes it facilitates. Cape Verde's World Cup qualification serves as a case study in how equitable investment and strategic vision can reshape a small nation's sporting identity. Furthermore, the nation's achievement underscores a growing trend within African football: smaller federations are no longer content to play supporting roles. With enhanced resources and a renewed sense of purpose, they are beginning to challenge traditional powers on the world stage. Since 2020, FIFA has constructed 32 pitches worldwide, with two more set to open in Guinea-Bissau this November. Of these 34 total pitches, 26 are located across Africa, highlighting FIFA's focus on advancing football infrastructure throughout the continent. Cape Verde's first-ever World Cup qualification is more than a sporting success, it's a national milestone born from years of strategic development, investment, and belief. As Cape Verde prepares to take its place among the world's best, it stands as a testament to what can be achieved when vision, opportunity, and unity converge under the shared language of football.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City icon Sergio Agüero can match the Portuguese legend and now a certain Ricardo Pepi has joined the select group. The U.S. men's national team (USMNT) hopeful scored his third decisive stoppage-time goal in club soccer's most prestigious continental tournament on Tuesday evening, snatching a 1–1 draw for PSV Eindhoven in the 93rd-minute of a trip to Olympiacos. Pepi's first-ever Champions League goal was a 92nd-minute winner against Sevilla back in November 2023. The Eindhoven outfit also found themselves 2–0 down to Shakhtar Donetsk in last season's league phase. Fellow U.S. forward Malik Tillman scored twice in the final two minutes of normal time before Pepi popped up with another winner while the clock read 95. In the 33-year history of the Champions League in its modern format, no player can better Pepi's tally of three goals in second-half stoppage time which positively changed the result, per Opta. Ronaldo's total haul of European goals may dwarf Pepi—and every other player—yet only three of his 140 strikes in the competition fit the clutch criteria. Intriguingly, all three of his decisive late goals were scored for Manchester United. During his first spell at Old Trafford, Ronaldo notably sunk the aspirations of his boyhood club Sporting CP with a dagger of a stoppage-time free-kick in 2007. Fourteen years, five titles and two different clubs (Real Madrid and Juventus) arrived before Ronaldo's next late Champions League winner. Back at Old Trafford, but this time under the stewardship of his former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Ronaldo sniffed out a scratchy swipe against Villarreal, peeling away to the corner flag as the Theatre of Dreams erupted into a chorus of “Viva Ronaldo!” which lasted long after the final whistle. “Sometimes it is not about ‘pass there, pass there,' it is the crowd—and they have sucked it in before—and when you have Cristiano on the pitch, you always have a chance. Solskjær, whose entire managerial career seems to be one long exercise in nostalgia, called upon the memory of basketball's greatest clutch player. “We all have our roles and responsibilities,” the manager beamed. I am sure Chicago Bulls didn't mind having Michael Jordan.” Now there's a new U.S. athlete who warrants comparison to Ronaldo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, reports indicated that Inter Miami is interested in signing Pedro Gallese, Orlando City's goalkeeper, in January when his contract with the Lions expires. With the late defeat against Nashville SC last Saturday, Javier Mascherano needs to move his squad and prevent the Herons' elimination in the first round once again. Despite what happened on Saturday, one thing is clear: Las Garzas are already making moves and asking the club about certain players. Inter Miami have shown interest in signing Lautaro Di Lollo to reinforce their defense, and Milton Delgado, both from Boca Juniors, to replace Sergio Busquets once he retires. Oscar Ustari is the only goalkeeper whose contract doesn't end in 2025. This could seem like a coincidence, but I believe it was on purpose. This could be polemic, but the reality behind his deal arrived from the idea of adding depth, and because with GKs, everything is possible. You could have both of your players injured, and if you don't have a third goalkeeper, you have to invent something on the run. The Argentinian footballer arrived from Lanus on a loan until December. Ríos Novo started in goal last Saturday, showing that Javier Mascherano sees him as a viable option to replace Oscar Ustari when his performance dips. Throughout the season, Novo had a decent performance when it was his time to shine. Due to the two veteran goalkeepers, Inter Miami could renew Novo's loan and sign him to become the starting player under the posts for many years. He is practically a kid, and could be both benefited or hurt by the signing of the soon-to-be ex-Orlando City player.

He had been experiencing ankle soreness going into the game but was deemed fit to start before suffering the hamstring issue and being replaced after only 30 minutes. Milan's game against Parma is the final domestic match ahead of November's international window, when the U.S. play friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay. Max Allegri's side return to action later this month against city rivals Inter. Pulisic has enjoyed a good start to this Serie A season, scoring four goals in as many starts in the league and registering two assists. After opting to skip the Gold Cup in the summer to focus on rest and recovery — drawing criticism from U.S. soccer icons such as Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey — Pulisic has featured in all four of the U.S.' most recent games, dissuading fears of a rift between himself and head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Pulisic, who made his senior international debut as a 17-year-old in March 2016, has been capped 82 times and scored 32 goals.

Sam Coffey is a woman of many talents, as we learn in this giggle-filled and thoughtful episode of the U.S. Soccer Podcast.

Straight from October camp with the U.S. Women's National Team, the USWNT and Portland Thorns midfielder talks about the team's preparations heading into next year's qualifying matches for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup in Brazil (0:30) and how she saw this young group come together to earn back-to-back wins against Portugal on Oct. 26 (where Coffey scored a late goal) and New Zealand on Oct. 29. 

Then, host and former Thorns teammate Meghan Klingenberg asks Coffey about her distinctive, on-field style (4:20) which features an iconic scrunchie and tucked-in shirt, and how she defines joy (10:00). Coffey shares the pride she feels being part of a family of artists and creators and how that inspired her many, many hobbies outside of soccer (17:00), including playing piano (36:19). Finally, the two end their conversation on a positive note with reflections on their friendship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England international and Aston Villa star Tyrone Mings suffered an injury against Liverpool that will keep him out of action until 2026. Mings last played for the Three Lions in 2023. Mings had only just returned from an ankle injury, which he suffered during Aston Villa's 3-1 win over Fulham in the Premier League in September. Mings clutched the back of his right leg due to a hamstring problem and left Anfield in discomfort. After the game, Emery confirmed Mings' injury setback and predicted that the defender could be out for four weeks. The Spanish coach said: "It's his hamstring. Yes, normally some weeks he will be out with an injury like that. But tomorrow we will test him and know exactly how much he will stay out of the team." According to The Athletic, Mings underwent scans on Monday and the reports have now shown that it is indeed a hamstring injury and quite a serious one, which keeps him sidelined for up to seven weeks. In August 2023, Mings was sidelined after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament. Since then, his continuous injuries have kept him out of the Three Lions squad. Mings, who has never played under England boss Thomas Tuchel, was hoping to impress the German coach this season to get a chance in England's World Cup squad, however, this latest injury comes as a major blow. With the defender out till 2026, it is unlikely that he will get enough time to attain full match fitness and play regularly in the second half of the season in a bid to catch Tuchel's eye. His absence from the team will surely impact their performance. Villa also have ex-Manchester United star Victor Lindelof and Lamare Bogarde in their ranks, both of whom could fill in when either of Konsa or Torres are suspended or injured.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, adidas unveils the official 2026 home kits for 22 partner federations ahead of FIFA World Cup 26™, including: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Northern Ireland, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Wales* From their rich histories to famous landscapes, traditional architecture and iconic past kit designs, each jersey aims to unite fans around a shared passion for their nation. Throughout, subtle details that nod to the tournament's storied history - including acknowledgements of historic jersey designs, past victories and memorable dates – can be discovered when viewed up close, creating on-going moments of delight for fans past the first viewing. The full range is crafted for performance, built to support world-class players in high-pressure moments to cope with the varying conditions they will experience across three unique host nations. To tackle the more intense warm-weather conditions, body-mapped 3D engineered mechanical stretch fabrics incorporating adidas' latest CLIMACOOL+ materials wick sweat faster, keeping players dryer for longer. Perforated wide 3-stripe tapes enable ultimate breathability, while strategically placed mesh holes on both fabric and trims deliver best-in-class air permeability, ensuring optimal ventilation even in the most demanding climates. As teams step onto the world stage at the biggest World Cup we have ever seen, they carry the hopes of a whole new generation of fans, while representing those that have come before them. A World Cup is about creating moments that transcend the stadium, so we've engineered the designs as an honour to each nation's roots but also to celebrate an era where every fan, everywhere, is part of the story.” Thomas Mace, VP Design, adidas Football said: “Designing our jersey roster for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ has been about honouring each nation's unique identity while pushing the boundaries of innovation and performance. Every jersey tells a story — blending cultural heritage with modern aesthetics — and is built using our most advanced technologies to keep players cool and comfortable on football's biggest stage. All adidas federation home jerseys** will be available to purchase from 6th November via adidas.com and select retail stores. The traditional Argentina vertical stripes in sky blue and white, take on a shapeshifting look, with a unique 3 coloured fading effect, channelling the blue tones from the three previous FIFA World Cup™ winning shirts – 1978, 1986 & 2022. Championing Germany's previous successes in this tournament, the home jersey pays homage to some of the nation's most iconic shirts. Heritage and future come together in the new México home shirt. It celebrates the unwavering support of a nation that lives and breathes football, where every shared moment reflects the heart of México. Spain's home kit for FIFA World Cup 2026™ arrives in a clean, pinstripe finish, with the red base punctuated by repeating yellow vertical lines, that draw visual cues from the national flag and crest. * Nations who are yet to secure qualification for FIFA World Cup 2026 include: Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Northern Ireland, Peru, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Wales ** The Jamaica Home kit will launch as part of a separate collection in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adidas is preparing for the start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup by giving fans a glimpse at the home kits that several countries will wear when they step on the pitch next summer. The kits were revealed on Wednesday with 22 countries featured, including defending champion Argentina, Spain and Germany. Here is the full list of each country receiving a new kit: From that group, 15 countries have yet to secure a spot in the World Cup. Chile, Peru and Venezuela have already been eliminated from qualifying, but they will wear their new home kits for the 2026 international season. Adidas described each kit as being designed with the "best-in class" technology that is "built to support world class players in high pressure moments." Sam Handy, GM football at Adidas, said in Wednesday's press release that a "national kit is the symbol of a nation's togetherness and pride," resulting in a design process that emphasized its roots, along with a connection to the fans. "A World Cup is about creating moments that transcend the stadium, so we've engineered the designs as an honour to each nation's roots but also to celebrate an era where every fan, everywhere, is part of the story," Handy said. A total of 28 teams have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. There are still 20 open spots available, with up to 10 able to be clinched throughout the month of November.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA will present its inaugural “FIFA Peace Prize – Football Unites the World” award during the World Cup draw on Dec. 5 in Washington D.C. The award – which aims to be FIFA's version of a Nobel Peace Prize – will be presented on an annual basis to an individual or group of individuals who have helped unite people in peace through unwavering commitment and special actions. “In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a Wednesday, Nov. 5 statement. Infantino added the award “will recognize the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.” The announcement comes before Infantino will appear at the America Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday, Nov. 5, where U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine World Cup champion Lionel Messi are among speakers at the event. Infantino has attended several events in the past few weeks to promote the World Cup and the sport's ability to provide peace and unity globally. Infantino joined Trump at the Summit for Peace in Egypt on Oct. 13, and attended the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia on Oct. 28. Infantino also accepted an Atlantic Council Global Citizen award in New York on Sept. 24, where he claimed the World Cup will resemble 104 Super Bowls – likening the soccer tournament to the popular NFL championship game for American sports fans not keen on the sport. “We need to have occasions to unite the world, to bring everyone together, to bring people together so that they can meet, they can exchange, they can know each other, and they can all learn from each other. Trump announced the World Cup draw would be held at the Kennedy Center in late August.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heather O'Reilly and Jeff Kassouf react to Trinity Rodman's knee injury ahead of the USWNT camp. That young, inexperienced squad got battle-tested in a surprising 2-1 loss to Portugal on Oct. 23. Hayes learned plenty from that game, and the ensuing victories over Portugal (in a rematch) and New Zealand -- more than she would have in a comfortable victory for the USWNT. For this exercise, players with long-term injuries or absences would not make the squad. Nobody (including this writer) is betting against forwards Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson reclaiming their starting roles after maternity leave, for example, but to borrow a phrase from Hayes, you can only work with who is available right now. The timing of our latest exercise also adds an interesting, real-life wrinkle that Hayes could face in 18 months: Does she bring defender Naomi Girma or forward Trinity Rodman to the World Cup despite lingering injuries because they are that exceptionally talented? Hayes has rotated and experimented heavily this year, and she reiterated recently that even players who are household names might still go play with the under-23s or even the under-20s if eligible. That makes our job harder than ever, with tiers two through four somewhat interchangeable. Clear first-choice players who are contending for a starting role. Not necessarily starters, but substitutes and players on the bench available to go into games. - Kassouf: Why are USWNT players leaving the NWSL for Europe? Outside looking in: Aubrey Kingsbury, Mia Justus, Liz Beardsley, Leah Freeman, Neeku Purcell USWNT goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce speaks about her experience with Man United playing in their first ever UEFA Women's Champions League campaign. For as much uncertainty as there is around who will start and whether they are ready, the trio of keepers who would make the cut right now isn't in question based on Hayes' recent decisions. Fox is a Ballon d'Or shortlisted, UEFA Women's Champions League-winning fullback. Patterson looks like the odds-on favorite to start opposite Fox right now. Reale has been largely impressive in her limited time at the senior level thus far. Thompson still might have the most long-term upside of anyone, but she needs more reps at senior level. I am going with an emphatic "yes," especially given how Hayes glows about her. Bugg is likely her long-term partner in the position, and another defender who Hayes admires. The 19-year-old is pushing for playing time, and a senior World Cup this early in her career would provide invaluable long-term experience. On the bubble: Jaedyn Shaw, Lo'eau LaBonta, Croix Bethune, Sam Meza Outside looking in: Korbin Shrader, Riley Jackson, Taylor Huff, Sarah Schupansky, Abi Brighton, Gia Corley Lianne Sanderson speaks after Lily Yohannes' performance for OL Lyonnes vs. St. Pölten in the Women's Champions League. Yohannes plays beyond her years, Coffey is the ever-reliable soul of the squad, and Lavelle is back to being a "magician," as Hayes recently described her. Hayes' biggest dilemma over the next 18 months is figuring out her best combination in midfield. And yes, that is longtime Germany youth international Gia Corley on the outside looking in. She joined the U.S. U23 camp in October as a quietly intriguing addition. On the bubble: Ally Sentnor, Emma Sears, Michelle Cooper, Olivia Moultrie, Yazmeen Ryan Outside looking in: Mia Fishel, Emeri Adames, Riley Tiernan, Maddie Dahlien, Jameese Joseph, Pietra Tordin The Futbol W crew discuss how Catarina Macario's form last season will play a huge part in nailing down a starting place in Chelsea's midfield. Just like Girma, we ask: Are you bringing Rodman to the World Cup if she has even a shot at playing? The extent of Rodman's sprained MCL is still a mystery, but we've been led to believe she could be available for the NWSL playoffs, which begin this weekend. But in that case, Megan Rapinoe expedited recovery from a torn ACL, and the roster was only 18 players. Rodman is a game changer the USWNT needs -- especially with Wilson and Swanson also absent. Realistically, everyone outside of Macario and Thompson is on the bubble, but we have to make some tough choices. Midfielders: Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, Lily Yohannes, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Jaedyn Shaw Forwards: Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson, Trinity Rodman, Ally Sentnor, Olivia Moultrie, Michelle Cooper Sams helps add versatility, as does McKeown as both an improving center back and a late-game Swiss Army knife if the USWNT is trailing and needs a result. Our decision to include Rodman -- and gamble on Shaw staying in form, as we think Hayes would right now -- also further squeezes the forward group, with Emma Sears and Yazmeen Ryan becoming the two most difficult cuts. Both have been bright in spurts and yes, Sears just scored a hat trick against New Zealand. But Moultrie scored a brace against Portugal, and Hayes has some tough choices to make. Not only will the names on this roster change over time, but so will the balance of positions as some newer players establish themselves and as longtime starters return to fitness. But if Hayes' roster was due at FIFA's desk by the end of today, this is how it might look: inexperienced and experimental but talented and filled with potential.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander-Arnold chose to leave at the end of his Liverpool contract, although Madrid ended up paying a €10 million (£8m/$11m) fee to release him early so he could feature for Los Blancos at the Club World Cup. Alexander-Arnold's Madrid and England team-mate Bellingham addressed the hostile reception from the home crowd on Amazon Prime: "Obviously, it is one of those things in football. The fans booing isn't a reflection of how they feel about him. I think it is more to give their team the edge and throw him off a little bit. I am sure they're appreciative of what he has done for the club. The night turned out to be a disappointing one for Bellingham and Co as Alexis Mac Allister's 61st-minute strike sealed all three points for the hosts, but the English midfielder did make European history as he eclipsed Lionel Messi and Madrid colleague Kylian Mbappe. At just 22 years and 128 days old, the former Birmingham City prodigy smashed Los Blancos icon Iker Casillas's long-standing record as the youngest player in history to reach 50 appearances in Europe's elite club competition. Since moving from Dortmund to Madrid in the summer of 2023, Bellingham has lived up to, and arguably exceeded, the astronomical expectations placed upon him. That early streak made him only the fourth Real Madrid player in the 21st century to score on both his La Liga and Champions League debuts, joining the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Isco, and Marco Asensio. Alexander-Arnold has endured a far tougher start to life in Madrid, however. A hamstring problem also set Alexander-Arnold back, but he is set for a run in the team now as Carvajal has been sidelined until the new year with a serious knee injury. The 27-year-old will hope to start at right-back when Los Blancos take in a trip to Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a big day for U.S. men's national team strikers Ricardo Pepi and Folarin Balogun as they each scored in their respective Champions League matches on Tuesday. Pepi came on as a substitute for PSV Eindhoven to score in stoppage time and earn a 1-1 draw with Olympiakos. With the game deep into stoppage time against the Greek side, Pepi nailed a free kick to help his Dutch club snatch a point. Balogun got the only goal of Monaco's win over Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in their Champions League clash. Balogun has now scored three times in nine total matches for the Ligue 1 side, with four total in 13 appearances across all competitions. Pepi hasn't played for the U.S. in almost a year following knee surgery and still remains limited in his minutes with PSV. Still, he also found the net in each of his USMNT three appearances under Pochettino in 2024, which bodes well if he does return. Nonetheless, Balogun still returns as the incumbent frontrunner for USMNT striker spot after his standout performances in September and October. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?
