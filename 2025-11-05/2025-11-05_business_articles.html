                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traders slashed odds that the Supreme Court will uphold President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs after justices on Wednesday signaled doubts about the legality of the administration's sweeping trade powers. On Kalshi, contracts tied to whether the court would rule in favor of Trump's tariffs slipped to around 30% from nearly 50% before Wednesday's hearing. A similar contract on platform Polymarket dropped to about 30% from more than 40% earlier in the week, reflecting traders' growing belief that the justices may strike down the policy. The moves came after several conservative justices joined their liberal colleagues in expressing unease about the broad authority Trump claimed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on imports. They sharply questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the Trump administration's legal justification of the tariffs, which critics say infringes on the power of Congress to tax. Lower federal courts have ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico. Prediction markets, which allow traders to bet on real-world events, often react swiftly to perceived signals during high-profile court hearings. Wednesday's shift suggested that traders viewed the justices' tone as an indicator of headwinds for the president's trade agenda. It is not clear when the court will release its ruling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on Westinghouse nuclear plants could transform it into an independent, publicly traded company with the U.S. government as a major shareholder. The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S. Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more. The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said. Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said. "Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse." "We're going to keep all options on the table," Isaac said. "This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up." The government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion. The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from "other jurisdictions" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said. "We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process," the executive said. Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it. The nuclear industry needs a big order of reactors to stimulate the market and supply chains, Isaac said. "What the U.S. government has done is committed to step in and be that stimulant if you will, their commitment is to facilitate the financing," he said.

Zohran Mamdani hasn't been New York City's mayoral-elect for 24 hours yet, but his postelection decisions are already likely rattling big business. Former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan — whose regulatory moves angered many corporate leaders — has been named as one of the co-chairs of Mamdani's transition team. "What we saw last night was New Yorkers not just electing a new mayor, but clearly rejecting a politics where outsized corporate power and money too often end up dictating our politics," Khan said in a speech on Wednesday. Her ambitious anti-trust agenda targeted Amazon and Meta, among others. She is described as "the nation's leading antimonopoly champion" on Mamdani's transition website. Business leaders who criticized the democratic socialist less than a day ago have offered to help him run the nation's center of capitalism, including outspoken Mamdani critic Bill Ackman. Khan will lead Mamdani's team alongside former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, nonprofit leader Grace Bonilla, and city budget expert Melanie Hartzog.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have given the country's retailers another cost to manage during a period of persistent inflation. While many are navigating the change with limited price increases, marketplace giant Amazon is hiking more than others. Price increases are common for retailers trying to blunt higher costs from tariffs. Companies including Walmart and Target have said they are employing a portfolio approach to pricing following the tariff hikes, meaning they have raised prices on some items but not others. But the companies rarely detail how much they're increasing prices or on what items. DataWeave reviewed roughly 16,000 items each on Amazon's, Walmart's and Target's websites to conduct its analysis. Its data spans categories, locations and time periods, according to DataWeave's methodology. That jump actually came ahead of the majority of President Donald Trump's tariffs, announced in April, and could be the result of price normalization and a pullback in discounts after the 2024 holiday selling season, DataWeave found. DataWeave's pricing analysis compares each retailer to its own prices over time and not to competitors — and to be sure, lower initial prices could show a higher percentage increase — but there is a common trend. "Together, these trends show a clear hierarchy: Prices rose fastest where consumers shop by choice, not necessity, and most cautiously where they shop by need," Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder and CEO of DataWeave, said in a statement. Indoor and outdoor home goods prices climbed an average of 10.8% across the three retailers. Prices for hardlines, a category that tends to include goods like electronics, furniture and appliances, rose 8.3%. Guru Hariharan, founder and CEO of AI-driven e-commerce data platform CommerceIQ, told CNBC he's not surprised to see larger price increases on the marketplace leader. "Third-party sellers are far more exposed to tariff-driven cost increases," Hariharan said. "They don't have the scale, inventory flexibility or private-label leverage that large retailers like Walmart or Target can use to offset costs." As a result, marketplace sellers often have no choice but to pass higher costs onto the shopper, he said. While Target and Walmart also have online marketplaces, third-party sales make up a much smaller percentage of their revenue than Amazon's, according to executives and earnings reports. "If we consider Amazon as the bellwether for U.S. commodity goods pricing, this trend is obviously expected to have a significant impact to the holiday season and economy in Q4," Hariharan said. Amazon's shoppers don't appear to be fazed by the pricing. Third-party seller services — the revenue Amazon collects on third-party sales, including commission, fulfillment, shipping and advertising fees — increased 12% over that same time. During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said, "We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers." The company's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky added, "Our sharp pricing, broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers." In response to the DataWeave price analysis, an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, "The reality is that we offer competitive, low prices for Amazon customers and, based on our comprehensive analysis of millions of popular products customers are purchasing, we have not seen increases in price outside of normal fluctuations." Investors and shoppers will get their latest insights into how the largest U.S. retailers are handling pricing when Target and Walmart report their third-quarter results in mid-November. Target has said on several occasions this year it would raise prices "as a last resort" as it combats rising costs. The company noted it has permanently lowered prices on 2,000 items since February – as opposed to its temporary cuts known as Rollbacks. In early September, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said tariffs have created cost hikes for the company. "We've seen a steady march up, kind of a gradual increase as it relates to our cost levels in general merchandise, which has created the single-digit inflation that we find ourselves dealing with now," McMillon said at the Goldman Sachs global retailing conference. Excluding tariffs, Powell said core PCE could be in the 2.3% to 2.4% range, rather than the 2.9% that was recorded in August. Direct CPI comparisons for the categories in DataWeave's study are difficult to pinpoint, but prices for household furnishings rose 3.7% from January through September of this year. Personal care items increased 3.5% over the same period, and apparel prices were up 2.1%, according to CPI data. — CNBC's Nick Wells and Jodi Gralnick contributed to this report.

Zohran Mamdani is about to get a massive raise — and some swanky new accommodations. Forbes has estimated that the state assemblyman's net worth is about $200,000. On the one hand, Mamdani's hefty new salary shouldn't be a huge surprise: The demands and responsibilities of managing a city of more than 8 million people are far greater than representing roughly 140,000 people in Queens. Still, it's far more than the $174,000 annual salary earned by most rank-and-file US senators and House members. It's also more than the $223,500 annual salary that House Speaker Mike Johnson earns, or the $246,400 annual salaries of President Donald Trump's cabinet secretaries. Almost every New York City mayor has lived at some point in Gracie Mansion, a two-story home on the Upper East Side overlooking the East River. The one exception: Bloomberg, who opted to live in his own mansion a few blocks away on East 79th Street. The former mayor even said that his successors shouldn't live in the mansion, but that advice apparently went unheeded: Mayor Bill de Blasio moved into the house in 2014, and Mayor Eric Adams also opted to live there. The mayor also receives security protection from the New York City Police Department and has access to benefits available to other city employees, including health insurance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Axon Enterprise's stock plummeted 11% after the Taser maker missed Wall Street's third-quarter profit expectations as it grapples with tariff constraints. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.17 per share adj., falling short of a $1.52 per share forecast from LSEG. Adjusted gross margins fell 50 basis points from a year ago to 62.7%, which Axon attributed to tariff impacts. Axon's connected devices business, which includes its Taser and counter drone equipment, felt the biggest pinch during the first full quarter with tariffs. "As long as tariffs stay in place, I view that as sort of a one-time adjustment," finance chief Brittany Bagley said during the earnings call. "Now that's baked into the gross margins." Bagley expects growth in the company's software business to eventually offset margin losses long-term. Software and services revenues jumped 41% from a year ago to $305 million. Total revenues grew 31% from a year ago to $711 million, topping the $704 million expected by analysts polled by LSEG. The Arizona-based company reported a net loss of $2.2 million, a loss of 3 cents per share, versus net income of $67 million, or 86 cents per share in the year-ago period. FactSet analysts expected $2.72 billion at the midpoint. Along with the results, Axon said it is acquiring Carbyne in a deal that values the emergency communications platform at $625 million. Axon shares have jumped more than 40% over the last year as demand for its security tools accelerates. "We are building an elite business that is still nowhere near its ultimate potential, and we are doing it with a team that is rapidly bought into the mission," said Axon's president Josh Isner on the earnings call.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital assets and infrastructure company Ripple said Wednesday it has raised $500 million in funding, lifting its valuation to $40 billion. Ripple, which is closely linked to the XRP cryptocurrency, said the funding round was led by funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group, affiliates of Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace. "The decision to accept $500 million in new common equity reflects the strategic value of deepening relationships with financial partners whose expertise complements Ripple's expanding global suite of products," Ripple said, adding that it is continuing its "record year of growth." Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that the company did not need to raise any money, but had seen demand from institutional investors who wanted to get a share of the company. "We think it makes good sense to have them as strategic partners, as investors who will have a hand toward building the future" Long said. When Ripple launched in 2012, the company initially focused on using blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. The token XRP was used to move fiat currencies quickly. Since then, Ripple has bolstered its payments business and expanded into new areas through aggressive acquisitions. In just over two years, Ripple said it has completed six acquisitions. Last year, the company launched its own stablecoin, a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets. Stablecoins are seen as a key way to move money quickly around the world as they can operate 24 hours a day. This year, Ripple acquired an enterprise-focused stablecoin platform called Rail. Beyond payments, Ripple has pushed into other lines of business, including custody of crypto assets, prime brokerage and corporate treasury management. Long said the company's acquisition strategy was focused on companies that will complement Ripple's core payments business, or allow it to push into new areas. "We will continue to look at where new opportunities arise in those two things," Long said. While other crypto-focused companies such as Circle have gone public, Long said this is not on the radar for Ripple right now. "We are really pleased to see crypto companies going public, that is great for our overall industry continuing to mature," Long said. "We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supreme Court justices on Wednesday morning expressed skepticism about the legality of aggressive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump against most of the world's nations. Lower federal courts have ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority he cited under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico. Sauer, who is defending the tariff policy as grounded in the power to regulate foreign commerce, said "these are regulatory tariffs. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court's three liberal members, told Sauer, "You say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are." "They're generating money from American citizens, revenue," Sotomayor said. She later noted that no president other than Trump has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs. "What happens when the president simply vetoes legislation to take these powers back?" "So Congress as a practical matter can't get this power back once it's handed it over to the president," Gorsuch said. Other conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and the justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito — also pressed Sauer. The tariffs start at a baseline of 10% on many nations and spike to as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil. Katyal opened his argument by saying, "Tariffs are taxes," picking up the theme that multiple justices had raised with Sauer. "Our founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone." "We don't think IEEPA allows this junking of the world-wide tariff architecture," Katyal later said. When Roberts asked Katyal is tariffs implicated the power of the president to conduct foreign policy for the United States, as Sauer argued, Katyal replied, "We agree that tariffs have foreign policy implications." No other president has ever done something like that, he said. The Supreme Court, which heard more than two-and-a-half hours of arguments, will not issue a decision in the case on Wednesday. It is not clear when the court will release its ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a court filing in September that the U.S. might have to refund $750 billion or more if the Supreme Court ruled the tariffs are illegal and waited until next summer to issue that ruling. The case is seen as a key legal test for Trump, who has won some favorable rulings from the Supreme Court for other policies during his second term in the White House. In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, "Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country." "With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security," Trump wrote in the Truth Social post. "Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us. Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now," he said. "A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them." Critics of tariffs say their financial hit is borne not by foreign manufacturers but by U.S. importers who pay them and then largely pass on the added costs to American consumers. Trump previously said he was considering attending the oral arguments, which would have been an apparent first for a sitting president. On Sunday, he said on Truth SociaI, "I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision. "It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court," he wrote.

The company has been advertising for a "Senior AI Economist" in recent weeks to explore what economics would look like in a world with artificial general intelligence — a term for when machine intelligence can match humans in solving tasks. "You will lead a new area of research, exploring post-AGI economics, the future of scarcity, and the distribution of power and resources in a world fundamentally reshaped by advanced AI," reads a job posting for the role, which requires a strong background in economics. They will also be expected to conduct research on the "long-term economic impacts of AGI, questioning existing assumptions about scarcity, wealth, and distribution." Google did not immediately reply to a Business Insider request for comment. Google isn't the only one thinking about this problem. Anthropic is advertising for a role writing about the impact of AI on labor markets and economic growth. Demis Hassabis has spoken a lot about AI's impact on large economic systems. The Google DeepMind CEO said in August that reaching AGI could usher in an era of "radical abundance," but has warned that it could be harmful to society if not handled correctly. he said at Davos in January, speaking about AGI. Hassabis has repeatedly warned that the impacts of more powerful AI are not yet understood, and has called for the creation of a body of experts to ensure its arrival does not go disastrously wrong. "Ideally, there will be some institution that is around that could meet the moment, and that would be where you would put a wise international council of very diverse and smart people from different backgrounds," he said at Davos, describing his idea for a CERN-type international body that bring in philosophers, social scientists, and writers alongside technologists to help safely guide AI systems out of labs and into society. "But who's building that institute is what I would ask?</p>

Stocks sold off yesterday amid investor concerns about the valuations of artificial intelligence companies. Leading the losses were shares of Palantir, which dropped 8% in the session despite a positive earnings report on Monday. It was a big night for Democrats, whose candidates swept key races in New York, New Jersey and Virginia. Self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani will become the next mayor of New York City, NBC News projects, defeating former New York Gov. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill is projected to become the state's next governor. NBC News also projects Democrat Abigail Spanberger will become the first female governor of Virginia and Democratic nominee Jay Jones will win the state's attorney general race. Unlike Mamdani, Sherril and Spanberger, Jones was not seen as the betting favorite going into yesterday's election. McDonald's missed Wall Street's third-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines this morning. The fast-food giant reported $7.08 billion in revenue during the period — a 3% increase from a year ago, but slightly below analysts' $7.1 billion estimate. Indeed, the report wasn't all bad: McDonald's said same-store sales grew 3.6% globally and 2.4% in the U.S. CEO Chris Kempczinski called the results "a testament to our ability to deliver sustainable growth even in a challenging environment." Meanwhile, shares of Cava sank nearly 8% in overnight trading after the fast-casual chain cut its full-year forecast for the second straight quarter. A wave of layoffs is rattling corporate America. Last week, it was Amazon and Paramount. And while some rush to say the rise of AI is to blame, experts say some companies could be "AI-washing" their cuts, using the new tech as a scapegoat for other issues or run-of-the-mill cost-cutting. A lack of employment data from the government, thanks to the shutdown, makes the picture even murkier, bringing about concerns that the spate of cuts could have more to do with a slowing economy than with AI. Job openings hit their lowest level in more than four years last month, according to data from Indeed. The site's Job Posting Index, which uses February 2020 as a baseline, fell to 101.9 in October — its lowest level since February 2021. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Netflix's "KPop Demon Hunters" has taken pop culture by storm. The film, which in August became Netflix's most popular movie ever, has generated $10 billion for the K-pop music industry, CNBC's Eunice Yoon reports. Shares of HYBE, JYP Entertainment, SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment — the so-called "Big Four" K-pop companies in South Korea — have seen double-digit gains this year. As Yoon notes, the popularity of "KPop Demon Hunters" could also spur increased consumption of Korean cosmetics and foods, and could even have political ramifications in China. After Meta invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI and hired away its founder, the future looked uncertain for the AI startup. But CFO Dennis Cinelli rejected the notion that the deal was an "acquihire" or licensing deal, and insisted Scale's business is still growing. — CNBC's Sean Conlon, Pia Singh, Yun Li, John Melloy, Samantha Subin, Kevin Breuninger, Dan Mangan, Amelia Lucas, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Annie Palmer, Frank Holland, Jeff Cox, Eunice Yoon and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has been elected the Mayor of New York City.

Mamdani, a member of the New York State Assembly for the Astoria district of Queens, beat out former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who ran as an independent after losing the Democratic primary — and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The race was called for Mamdani by the Associated Press around an hour after polls closed on Tuesday night. Mamdani soon addressed supporters at Brooklyn Paramount, a music venue in downtown Brooklyn.

The new German brigade stationed on Russia's doorstep is betting on tanks, even as costly armored vehicles are being damaged and destroyed by cheap off-the-shelf drones in Ukraine. NATO allies worried about Russia are still investing in tanks, and Germany is no exception. Its new 45th Armored Brigade in Lithuania decided what it should bring from watching the war. As the 45th begins Germany's first significant permanent deployment of a brigade abroad since World War II, it's bringing its Leopard 2A8 tank with it. Gen. Christoph Huber, told Business Insider that "this brigade has top priority in Germany" and will see the most modern German military equipment. Huber said that it was "crucial" for the brigade to have heavy armor. "This brigade at the core is a heavy armored commitment." That means bringing the "most modern German main battle tank." The 2A8 is the most advanced Leopard tank produced by KNDS Deutschland, and it features modifications such as drone protection inspired by tank performance in Ukraine. With better protection against drones and other loitering threats, better sensors, modular armor, and an upgrade path, the tank offers a leap in capability, survivability, and lethality that helps to future-proof it. These tanks are now more aligned with modern combat than Leopard tanks built for Cold War-era tank fights, the Leopards Ukraine received. Huber said that tanks enable the brigade to conduct combined maneuver warfare, the kind of fast, coordinated operations needed to seize the initiative but have been hard to execute in Ukraine, where airpower constraints, layered defenses, and the growing drone threats have made major breakthroughs nearly impossible. There's no guarantee a war between NATO and Russia would resemble the war in Ukraine, especially given the range of combat capabilities available to the alliance, so while Germany is studying this conflict, it is focusing on what it might face next. Lithuania is buying tanks for the first time in its history, and other NATO allies have also placed new orders, while Western companies are also developing new tank technology. The best way to do this, he said, is to have "a good mix of capabilities available on the ground." It's backed by the rest of the 10th Armored Division, meaning multiple brigades could mobilize to defend NATO's eastern flank. "The message to Russia is clear," he said. The war in Ukraine has been marked by videos of tanks burning in the wake of attacks by cheap drones, including German Leopard tanks and American Abrams (notably not the most advanced versions of either). Both sides have adapted, adding armor and additional protection while also employing tanks with greater caution. Tanks in Ukraine are often used in concealed positions, further back from the front, regularly as a kind of mobile artillery. Tanks have struggled in Ukraine because neither side has control of the air, leaving armored columns and large-scale mechanized assaults vulnerable to drones buzzing the battlefield for surveillance and strike purposes. With better air assets, such as fifth-generation fighter jets, and larger arsenals of diverse capabilities, NATO might be able to avoid the headaches the armies fighting this war have faced, though the future is uncertain. Huber said the 45th is in Lithuania to deter Russia and shield NATO's eastern edge. Former CIA director David Petraeus said this year that he viewed it as the country most at risk of a Russian invasion. The brigade deployed to Lithuania is a big step for Germany, which has taken a restrained approach since World War II and largely avoided substantial military deployments abroad. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed that calculus, albeit slowly.</p>

Signaling he'll be sticking around for a while, the famed forecaster has updated his profile picture and revised his bio to read: "Cassandra Unchained: Missteps to Mayhem, Coming December 2025, Stay Tuned." Back then, Burry delivered a step-by-step breakdown of how the subprime mortgage bubble inflated, how he predicted and placed bets on its collapse, and how the fallout revealed glaring vulnerabilities in the US financial system. "We must remember that entire societies can and often do follow the wrong path for a very long time, and that there is nothing wrong with breaking from the social norm to ensure good outcomes," Burry said. The first chart showed that growth has slowed sharply in Amazon and Alphabet's cloud-computing divisions, and cooled slightly in Microsoft's rival unit. Burry nodded to the meme again in a follow-up post, writing "Move along" and attaching an image of a stormtrooper. It detailed how the telecoms boom and bust resulted in vast tracts of unused infrastructure, plunging prices, and the downfall of many high-valued companies that wound up scrambling for protection from creditors. Burry's posts underline his skepticism about the AI boom. He appears to see shades of the dot-com bubble in the interwoven deals between tech titans, as they pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building huge amounts of infrastructure that might end up sitting idle if demand falters and valuations come crashing down, as they did 25 years ago. The hedge fund manager backed up his words with two striking bets last quarter that were revealed on Monday. The wagers dominated the firm's US stock portfolio, which had only eight holdings in total, including just four direct positions worth a combined $68 million. Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider that Burry is "clearly backing convictions with what can only be called a highly unconventional portfolio, with sizable short positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, both darlings of the current AI boom, to the tune of around $1 billion." Burry's wagers drew the ire of Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who questioned why he was shorting companies that are "making all the money." Both stocks have soared in price over the past few years; Nvidia became the first company to secure a $5 trillion market value last week, while Palantir was valued at nearly $500 billion at Monday's close — more than Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, or Netflix are worth. The pair's valuations and high growth expectations could leave their stocks vulnerable to sharp declines if they disappoint, especially when investors are increasingly using margin and levered ETFs, Mould said. Burry could win big if Nvidia and Palantir stumble, but the "danger" is that he "gets run over by momentum and liquidity-fueled markets" if they keep impressing investors and the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, Mould added. Daniel Bustamante, the chief investor and founder of asset manager Bustamante Capital Management, told Business Insider that he broadly agrees with Burry's stance on AI stocks. "You basically have all tinder soaked in gas, and all it takes is a lit match at this point to cause some serious issues."</p>

Both stocks have soared in price over the past few years; Nvidia became the first company to secure a $5 trillion market value last week, while Palantir was valued at nearly $500 billion at Monday's close — more than Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, or Netflix are worth. The pair's valuations and high growth expectations could leave their stocks vulnerable to sharp declines if they disappoint, especially when investors are increasingly using margin and levered ETFs, Mould said. Burry could win big if Nvidia and Palantir stumble, but the "danger" is that he "gets run over by momentum and liquidity-fueled markets" if they keep impressing investors and the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, Mould added. Daniel Bustamante, the chief investor and founder of asset manager Bustamante Capital Management, told Business Insider that he broadly agrees with Burry's stance on AI stocks. "You basically have all tinder soaked in gas, and all it takes is a lit match at this point to cause some serious issues."</p>

By the time she turned 40, Suzie Payne had resigned herself to the fact that she would never be able to buy a home. While her friends spent their 30s checking off that prized milestone — often with help from their parents — Payne struggled to save money while raising a daughter on her own. Home prices in Portland, Oregon, where she lived, felt out of reach long before the pandemic hit. When mortgage rates plummeted in the summer of 2020, she was more worried about meeting her basic needs than spending her Saturdays staking out open houses. She could still find an old rowhome in the city for a little more than $200,000, well within her price range. Payne describes her path as "non-conventional," but she represents a sea change in real estate: First-time homebuyers are older than ever. By today's standards, however, Payne is right on track. The median age for all buyers rose to an all-time high of 59, up from 47 in 2019. Things have been headed in this direction for a few years now — older, deep-pocketed buyers are better equipped to handle the double whammy of higher borrowing rates and costlier homes. Gen Xers and baby boomers remain active in the real estate market, while the share of purchases by first-time buyers has dwindled. But never before has the divide appeared so stark. This delayed timeline could have lifelong consequences for today's young people: years of missed wealth-building opportunities, fewer moves, even a reevaluation of what constitutes a "starter home." There was a bit of cope around the sudden jump. Maybe it was just elder millennials — long labeled as laggards since graduating into the Great Recession — finally catching up. Mortgage rates had more than doubled, homes were more expensive, and new construction after the Great Recession had failed to keep pace with the surge of young buyers. I talked to one millennial back then who framed the scenario in bleak terms: "We're royally screwed." "We have a very large young-adult population who are really just seeing the door shut on them for homeownership," Lautz says. Nearly a third of these repeat buyers paid all cash, NAR data shows, giving them a leg up with sellers who often prefer the ease and speed of deals that don't involve a mortgage. Real estate agents tell me they feel the frustration. Peggy Pratt, a broker associate with Century 21 North East in Massachusetts, says it's harder for younger buyers to cobble together a down payment when they're weighed down by student debt and steep rental costs. Pratt specializes in helping people break into the housing market, with about half her business coming from first-time buyers. She says those who are able to gain a foothold often receive help from their parents — there are just fewer of them. Suzy Minken, an agent with Compass who works in both New Jersey and northern Virginia, says her clients are no longer buying up "starter homes" with dreams of moving into a bigger place down the line. NAR data backs this up — sellers last year had lived in their homes for a median of 11 years, an all-time high. All of this contributes to the gridlock Lautz mentioned. First-time homebuyers benefit from churn in the housing market: When people move out of their theoretical starter homes into bigger places, they free up the entry-level homes for those just starting out. But that sort of healthy movement has ground to a halt. Until rates sink further or they're forced to make a move, those owners are not going anywhere. And if people are waiting longer to buy their first house, they may have already checked off the other significant milestones, such as having children, that could prompt another move anyway. There's some upside to purchasing later in life: If you buy your first home at 40 instead of 30, you're likely closing in on your peak earning years. By delaying, you've also missed out on years of potential wealth-building. Given that homes tend to gain about 5% equity on an annual basis, the typical homeowner is foregoing about $150,000 if they buy a decade later than the historical norm, Lautz tells me. That wealth could be used to purchase the next home, fund their child's college education, or make needed upgrades to their existing place. "We're looking at a generational wealth restriction," Lautz says. Suzie Payne's homebuying journey didn't end with that accepted offer. In March, she took another stab at buying and had a second offer accepted. But Trump's looming tariffs made her uneasy about the economy, and an inspection on the house revealed a heap of necessary repairs. When negotiations broke down, Payne backed out of that deal as well. For a deeper dive on America's real estate market, check out "Well Spent," Business Insider's new video podcast about the business, technology, and culture of consumerism. Payne's series of stops and starts effectively captures the current homebuying predicament. Buyers are older, sure, but they're also pulling out of deals more frequently than ever, either because they're spooked by the economy or holding out hope for a better deal down the line. Consumers of all stripes are wary of making big life changes that could leave them in a tough financial situation if things go awry. Until she feels like a home purchase would give her peace of mind rather than more worries, she's prepared to play the waiting game. "It has to be the right conditions," Payne tells me.

The gloom on Wall Street spread across Asia on Wednesday, with key indexes tumbling as a global tech sell-off deepened. The downturn reflected a "gloomy and damp portrayal of risk," wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Australian brokerage Pepperstone, in a Wednesday note. But concerns are mounting that some companies' valuations have outpaced their actual progress — and that they may struggle to deliver on lofty AI ambitions despite pouring billions into the technology. Adding to the selling pressure was Michael Burry, the famed "Big Short" investor, whose hedge fund disclosed short bets against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday. "Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news," wrote veteran analyst Ed Yardeni. On Tuesday, shares of AI-powered data analytics firm Palantir tumbled 8% following its third-quarter earnings report and Burry's disclosure, despite solid results and upbeat guidance. Other major tech names — including AMD, Oracle, and Nvidia — also dropped, dragging the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 down 2.1%. He wrote that while this earnings season has featured companies consistently beating forecasts, investors are showing signs of resistance to high valuations. Despite the selloff, "we can't lose sight that it was only last week that the indexes were at all-time highs, and profit-taking is the normal course of action," Navellier wrote. Palantir's stock remains up 152% year to date, while Nvidia — which closed 4% lower on Tuesday — is still up 48% over the same period. "Simplistically, there aren't many reasons to buy here, and until we move closer to Nvidia's earnings on 19 November, the market lacks a short-term catalyst," wrote Pepperstone's Weston.</p>

It's official: Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of New York City. Andrew Cuomo and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa in the city's closely watched mayoral election. By 10 p.m. local time, an hour after polls closed, Mamdani's lead had held, and he had garnered over a million votes, the first New York mayoral candidate to receive that many votes since 1969. He won despite facing down millions of dollars in political spending from prominent billionaires in both the Democratic primary and the general election. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Bill Ackman, Joe Gebbia, and Barry Diller were among the billionaires who collectively poured millions of dollars into outside groups that backed Cuomo and opposed Mamdani, who, for his part, has said billionaires should not exist. In Mamdani's Tuesday night victory speech, he addressed those who supported his opponents. "The billionaire class has sought to convince those making $30 an hour that their enemies are those earning $20 an hour," he said, adding, "We refuse to let them dictate the rules of the game anymore. "You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. During the speech, Trump wrote on Truth Social, without naming Mamdani: "…AND SO IT BEGINS!" To fund his ambitious platform, Mamdani has proposed raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the income tax on millionaires by two percentage points. The result, some of Mamdani's wealthy antagonists have said, will be an exodus from New York, in terms of both businesses and high earners. That fear has rippled beyond the billionaire class to other sectors, including tech, finance, and real estate. "New York City is built on ambition, innovation, and capitalism," Bryan Rosenblatt, a partner at Craft Ventures, told Business Insider. "Electing a mayor who drives out our most ambitious builders and top contributors to the city's economy is not good for New York or anyone who calls it home." Mamdani reportedly spoke with leaders like Paul Weiss' Brad Karp since winning the primary, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said he will work with Mamdani if he is elected. And business leaders are more sympathetic to some of the Democratic nominee's proposals than others, Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive who's become a bridge between Mamdani and the business elite, previously told Business Insider. "Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work," Salem said. While 80% of higher-earning Wall Street workers — including investment bankers, hedge fund managers, and private equity bigwigs — donated to Cuomo and his affiliated PACs, Mamdani's campaign received almost 90% of the donations given from finance's back-office workers, such as those in operations, human resources, technology, and research. "Even as someone working in finance, rent is crazy," one Mamdani donor previously told Business Insider. "The emphasis on affordability was especially appealing to me."</p>
