                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man, identified only as B.G., told the Bigfoot Research Organization (BFRO) that he and wife were driving on west on Interstate 80 near mile marker 169 around 5:30 p.m. Oct. 4. A BFRO investigator determined the incident occurred about 11.5 miles northeast of Bellefonte. “I immediately thought, ‘What the hell is he doing?! '” the man reported, thinking it was a person. When he got a better view, the man said the figure was “completely dark, all the same color” with a “slender/slim build” and long arms that were not raised as it walked. As it moved across the highway, the man said he was “shook” by the how it almost glided or slid instead of walking like a typical person. His wife was looking out the passenger side window and did not see anything or react until the man yelled, “What the hell was that?” By that time, the figure had disappeared, and she did not see it. “I'm an avid hunter with +50 years in the woods. A BFRO investigator spoke to the witness, who is a retired civil engineer and Air Force veteran. “I found him to be sincere and very credible,” the investigator said. The BFRO did not immediately respond to an email from PennLive seeking additional information. Earlier this year, a Penn State student reported a possible Bigfoot encounter in State Game Lands 333 while raccoon hunting in February. And, just last month a report by Canada Sports Betting ranked Pennsylvania in the top 10 as a “Bigfoot hotspot.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

New observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have shown that our interstellar visitor may have lost a significant amount of mass following its close encounter with the Sun. For those who haven't heard of 3I/ATLAS, on July 1, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object zipping its way through our Solar System at high speeds. Follow-up observations showed that it was on an escape trajectory. Contrary to conspiracy theories going around the Internet, a lot of telescopes are keeping a close eye on it and reporting their results. Take a look at this long list of observations on the Minor Planet Center website if you don't believe us. For a brief time, 3I/ATLAS was briefly obscured from our view by the Sun. During this time, we got a view of it from around Mars, being imaged by the European Space Agency's (ESA) spacecraft Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). But now our interstellar visitor is back from behind the Sun, and observations can resume. Of particular interest to astronomers is how the object has been affected by radiation from the Sun as it made its closest approach, known as perihelion. So far, we have already had some surprises, with the object demonstrating a rare anti-tail, odd and extreme abundance ratios of iron to nickel, and unusual brightening as it approached perihelion. The latest observations, from October 31 to November 4, show that the object has likely lost a significant amount of mass during its encounter with our host star. As explained by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb in a blog post, 3I/ATLAS has undergone a "radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared", as well as a "transverse acceleration relative to the Sun's direction of 3.7x10^{-7} au per day squared". As comets are heated, they lose mass by outgassing, where the volatile ices on their surface vaporize, and conservation of momentum tells us the object undergoes a resulting acceleration. Extrapolating from the latest observations (though we should note that there are always margins of error in observations), it is possible to estimate how much mass has been lost due to outgassing. "The reported non-gravitational acceleration amounts to 94 kilometers per day squared at perihelion. "This ejection speed would be the maximum expected value for a natural comet, thus implying that 3I/ATLAS must have lost more than 13% of its mass near perihelion in the natural scenario." We also need to stress uncertainties in astronomical observations, which are refined with more observations, and the fact that this is only the third interstellar object we have observed. If it has lost this much mass (or close to it), we should see a significant cloud of gas in further observations, as well as a significant brightening. The latest observations show that it has brightened significantly, and by a factor of around 5 in the Green-band, indicating that the object continues to act like a comet, albeit one that can give us clues about another part of our own galaxy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most anticipated UFO/UAP documentaries in years is only weeks away from landing, and Collider can offer an exclusive sneak peek into the information its experts have to share. Premiering on November 21 in select theaters and on Prime Video, The Age of Disclosure explores an 80-year global cover-up, particularly by groups in the U.S., including the CIA, of non-human intelligent life and a race to reverse engineer alien technology. Coming in the wake of September's congressional UAP hearings, it features interviews from 34 current and former U.S. government, military, and intelligence community members with direct knowledge of the situation and concerns about what's at stake. Our sneak peek focuses on two particularly prominent individuals with a dire message about what they believe these unidentified aircraft indicate. Unusual sightings by the military, like the famous "Tic Tac" aircraft video, Puthoff believes, indicate that something is taking a measure of humanity's technological might. Mellon adds that it only makes sense that, as the U.S. and other countries make greater advancements and become closer to rivaling these extraterrestrials, they'd start acting out of self-preservation. Both are convinced that something is watching closely with great concern. Whether you believe in Mellon and Puthoff's assessment or not, The Age of Disclosure promises to highlight a bevy of issues surrounding UAPs and the U.S.'s handling of them, with real testimony from a wide range of government insiders recounting what they saw and experienced. Through figures like Lue Elizondo, who resigned from his government post in 2017 to bring three videos from Navy aircraft pilots and the existence of the AATIP to the media, it seeks to paint a credible picture of how the government has tried to push back against disclosure, even once more information reached the public. The Age of Disclosure brings together officials of all backgrounds willing to share their insight, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Mike Rounds, former Director of National Intelligence General Jim Clapper, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Tim Burchett, Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who testified to Congress about UAPs, Stanford's Dr. Garry Nolan, and Commander Dave Fravor, who chased the "Tic Tac," among many others. They brought a mix of scientific context to explain the bizarre nature of the military sightings, internal knowledge, and concerns ranging from what UAPs mean for humanity, how their technology could be used, and whether other countries were already at work reverse-engineering such tech. At the helm of the ambitious project was first-time filmmaker Dan Farah, who previously served as a producer on Ready Player One, among other projects. He had unprecedented access for his directorial debut, not only getting to work with government officials who've been in the room for UAP hearings and have captured video, but also getting to film around Washington, DC. In an interview with Collider's Steve Weintraub following the film's premiere at SXSW, he expressed his desire to craft "the most credible, non-sensational, serious documentary ever made on this topic," prioritizing landing officials who could lend real credibility to something often not taken seriously. "I found my way to people, high-level officials in the government, military, and intelligence community who have direct knowledge of this topic and made them comfortable opening up in this documentary with what they could lawfully disclose. They felt the weight on their shoulders, and the film presented them with a comfortable and safe opportunity to do so because I was lining up so many interview subjects that there was strength in numbers. They were surrounded by dozens of other high-level people. The Age of Disclosure premieres in select theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. on November 21 and will be available on Prime Video VOD worldwide starting the same day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stone plays Michelle, the CEO of a powerful agribusiness corporation. Smart, wealthy, and commanding, she represents the pinnacle of corporate influence. Plemons stars as Teddy, a humble beekeeper and warehouse worker whose family has been devastated by Michelle's company. Drawn into a web of conspiracy theories about Michelle, her corporation, and the planet's fate, Teddy takes increasingly drastic actions-believing he's saving humanity. Yet Lanthimos also poses an unsettling question: what if some of those theories might be true? Bugonia offers a bleak but insightful reflection on modern life, communication, and power. In one memorable scene, Michelle and Teddy exchange polished corporate phrases like "let's have a dialogue," even as it's clear that no meaningful change will follow. Teddy knows these catch phrases and is not swayed by them. Their interactions capture the frustration and futility that define so much of public discourse today. If you've seen any publicity about this movie you know that Stone went so far as to shave her head for the role-a striking choice that underscores her total commitment. It was funny, scary, and surprising in so many places. I would guess that Stone and Plemons might get Academy nods for their performances but it's still early in the season.

C/2025 K1 reached its closest point to the sun, or perihelion, on Oct. 8, coming within a minimum distance of 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of our home star — around four times closer than 3I/ATLAS managed during its own perihelion on Oct. 29. On Oct. 29, at the same time 3I/ATLAS achieved perihelion, astrophotographer Dan Bartlett snapped a stunning shot of C/2025 K1 from June Lake in California. The image shows the comet with a distinct golden glow and a long tail that looks as if it has been buffeted by the solar wind — similar to Comet Lemmon, which recently had its tail torn to pieces. "This comet was not supposed to survive its Oct. 8th perihelion," Bartlett told Spaceweather.com. For example, several notable comets have turned green in recent years — including Comet Nishimura, the explosive "devil comet" 12P/Pons-Brooks and the aptly named "green comet" C/2022 E3 — due to the presence of either dicarbon or cyanide in their respective comas. Some comets can also turn blue if their comas contain carbon monoxide or ammonia, which may be happening to 3I/ATLAS, according to recent observations. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In a recent blog post, astronomer David Schleicher, who has been studying C/2025 K1 from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, wrote that the comet has a surprising lack of carbon-bearing molecules, such as dicarbon, carbon monoxide and cyanide. Only two other known comets have ever had fewer of these molecules, he wrote. This depletion of carbon-bearing molecules is the most likely cause for the comet's gold coloration, but "we don't know exactly why," Spaceweather.com representatives wrote. But it could also have something to do with its recent solar flyby or its relatively low ratio of gas to dust, they added. —Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could be turning bright green, surprising new photos reveal —'Miracle' photo captures Comet Lemmon and meteor seemingly entwined over Earth —Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS transforms into a giant 'cosmic rainbow' in trippy new telescope image C/2025 K1 now has an apparent magnitude of 9, which is equally as bright as 3I/ATLAS following an unexpected brightening event that occurred during its flyby of the sun. Both objects are too dim to see with the naked eye, but they can be seen with a decent telescope or a pair of stargazing binoculars. If you want to see it for yourself, C/2025 K1 is located between the constellations Virgo and Leo in the eastern sky, and it is most clearly visible shortly before sunrise, according to Spaceweather.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in August, while listening to “The Gateway Tapes”—a set of guided meditations intended to help people reach new planes of consciousness—she says her limbs froze. Sarah, who is in her early thirties and didn't want her real name used due to privacy concerns, says the tapes—which she had been listening to on and off for months—took her on a roller-coaster journey of out-of-body experiences. She recalls a subsequent three-week period of disorienting instability that veered from feelings of intense spiritual connection to fears that she may never again relate with others. Developed by radio broadcasting executive Robert Monroe, the Gateway Process claims to be “a voyage of self-discovery” that can help people go “farther, deeper and faster into different dimensions of consciousness.” Monroe founded the Monroe Institute in 1971 in Faber, Virginia. Dubbed an American “Hogwarts” by one consciousness content creator, the facility claims to help coax people out of their bodies via in-person and virtual retreats, and even Spotify playlists, by way of self-hypnosis style exercises powered by “binaural beats”—sounds attuned to different frequencies which play in each headphone ear. That's a 35 percent increase in participants over the pre-pandemic period of 2016 to 2019. In 2025, there were 80 in-person retreats with 20 participants each, according to the institute. The organization's Expand app has been installed 386,000 times since its July 2021 launch, company data shows. In June, the institute announced it is undertaking what it calls “the world's first higher states of consciousness study” with neurofeedback company Neuphoria, which claims that the research could help people become “among the first humans in history to map, master, and return to altered states—on demand, with data.” Some 333 Gateway Voyage graduates have signed up and will soon spend four weeks tracking their brain state data while listening to the meditations, paying $897 a piece. Then, while testing the techniques, Monroe spontaneously experienced feelings of separation from his body. The remote viewing aspect, which may be familiar to Stranger Things fans, sounds particularly hard to believe, but the idea has obvious military appeal. McDonnell gave the organization and its unusual curriculum his approval in a 1983 report which has since been declassified. “There is a sound and rational basis,” McDonnell writes, “in terms of physical science parameters for considering Gateway to be plausible in terms of its essential objectives.” On manifestation, he adds: “Since our consciousness is the source of all reality, our thoughts have the power to influence the development of reality in time-space … If those thoughts can be projected with adequate intensity.” Since Covid lockdowns led to growing interests in yoga, meditation, and lucid dreaming, there has been a surge of curiosity about the Monroe Institute, often from people who want to meet dead loved ones or who have had near death experiences (NDEs) and wish to understand them better. “Our whole goal is basically what we call the global awakening of human consciousness,” says Citarella. “The core of what we do at Monroe is make it easy for people to access [psychedelic] states without having to use substances.” Sheila Schwartz, a retired weight loss expert, says the Monroe Institute “saved her life.” She says she was on the brink of suicide after a lifetime of being misunderstood due to her ADHD and autism. She is now in the process of completing her 28th Monroe course. “That's usually the frequency that people choose to achieve the out-of-body experiences.” People may experience other psychic phenomena and extraordinary experiences, but they do not always have OBEs, Weiler adds. “But they can, if combined with intention and a lot of practice.” Joe McMoneagle has had a lot of practice; the former US Army chief warrant officer is known as “Remote Viewer No. 1.” In Vietnam he had an NDE and reportedly developed attuned suspicions of when his platoon was about to be ambushed. “My success rate was around 28 percent,” McMoneagle told the Daily Mail. “That may not sound very good, but we were brought in to deal with the hopeless cases. Our information was then cross-checked with any other available intelligence to build up an overall picture. McMoneagle became a speaker and trainer at Monroe, where he did his remote viewing training. (A study at the center last year to investigate how pilots can improve the quality of their sleep with Gateway was sponsored by a Department of Defense contractor, according to one nonmilitary participant.) During OBEs, people often feel like they are looking at their bodies from another perspective—even floating above with a bird's-eye view. On one occasion he felt “shocked and frightened,” but over time the pain gave way to spontaneous OBEs. In addition to floating, he also once “experienced an overwhelmingly strong sexual drive and could think of nothing else. Embarrassed and irritated at myself because of my inability to control this tide of emotion, I returned back into my physical body.” Over time he figured out how to control the process without being subsumed by sexual desires. For people like Sarah, the road to nirvana can be equally disconcerting. Then, “I was paralyzed, I tried to move my arms and legs and couldn't.” Monroe's cheaper at-home programs come without hands-on human supervision, even though they advise people to “ground” in nature and practice integrative exercises, with instructors on Zoom to provide support. Those like Sarah who do the tapes outside of a course are on their own. Citarella acknowledges that playing the tapes alone at home can be particularly challenging. “Sometimes people don't want their worldview changed,” he says. “It's almost like Pandora's box: Once you've opened it, and you have some kind of undeniable experience, you can't close the box again.” He adds that, “It's pretty rare that we see someone who really has become destabilized.” But he is mindful that “if you're already struggling with [your] grip on reality and you're changing your definition of reality, that can be not a good thing.” Sarah cautions against people doing it alone without “a tether to reality.” But she says that after “grounding” in a reiki energy healing session following three weeks of disturbance, she was left with “a deep sense of comfort that life is indeed meaningful.” She began curbing her drinking and binge eating. She also changed careers and left her corporate job. “It really forced me to take a look at all of the things in my life,” she says. “It gave me a better understanding of my purpose.” Big Interview: We spoke to Zohran Mamdani, New York's mayoral front-runner Watch: Following your stolen data through the dark web WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>in Film, Sci Fi |   	November 5th, 2025  Leave a Comment In the whole of Alien, the tit­u­lar enti­ty only appears on screen for about three min­utes. That's one rea­son the movie holds up so well against the oth­er crea­ture fea­tures of its era: in glimpses, you nev­er get a chance to reg­is­ter signs of the alien's being an arti­fi­cial con­struc­tion. That's not to say it was a shod­dy piece of work; quite the con­trary, as explained in the new video above from Cin­e­maTyler. Though it's most thor­ough­ly expressed in the dead­ly crea­ture that stows away aboard the space tug Nos­tro­mo, it also, to one degree or anoth­er, per­vades the whole movie's look and feel. This sur­pris­ing­ly grimy real­ism makes the threat of the alien feel that much more real; hid­den in its many shad­ows, Giger's vision preys that much more effec­tive­ly on our imag­i­na­tion. Not that it was guar­an­teed to suc­ceed in doing so. As Cin­e­maTyler explains, the process of cre­at­ing the alien came up against count­less set­backs, all under increas­ing­ly severe con­straints of both time and bud­get. At times the pro­duc­tion got lucky, as when it hap­pened upon the near­ly sev­en-foot-tall Bola­ji Bade­jo, who end­ed up wear­ing the alien cos­tume (despite Scot­t's insis­tence, ear­ly in the pro­duc­tion, that he did­n't want to make a movie about “a man in a suit”). But it was attempt­ing to cre­ate a being of a kind nev­er seen on screen before, one that had to be devel­oped through tri­al and error, more often the lat­ter than the for­mer. Maybe in space, no one can hear you scream, but one can eas­i­ly imag­ine the cries of frus­tra­tion let out by Scott, Giger, and all their pres­sured col­lab­o­ra­tors down here on Earth. H. R.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The theory was further detailed in the 1966 book, Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, a collection of von Neumann's writings compiled and completed by a colleague after his death. As many theoretical studies have shown, self-replicating probes (released from a single planet) could proliferate and explore the entire galaxy within a few eons. According to new research by Professor Alex Ellery of Carleton University (go Ravens! ), these probes may have already visited the Solar System, and some could be operating here right now. Alex Ellery is an Engineering professor with the Centre for Self-Replication Research (CESER) and the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Carleton University. As a researcher with CESER, Ellery is well-versed in the concept of Von Neumann probes and the technological innovations that will go into creating them. In a previous study, Ellery has detailed how 3D printing, self-replication, and robotics will allow humans to build Von Neumann probes sooner than expected. He also conducted a detailed study on how human engineers could place limits on the number of times each probe could reproduce itself, thus ensuring that they do not run amok (per the Berserker Hypothesis). These searches, he's indicated, should consider the Solar System as a good starting point, which echoes similar recommendations made by Professor Gregory L. Matloff in his paper "Von Neumann probes: rational propulsion interstellar transfer timing." There are 100 million objects in the Kuiper Belt alone, and we have examined only two, one of which was very anomalous in its shape. Similarly, Ellery considers how SETI researchers and future explorers could look for evidence of extraterrestrial probes through a dedicated search. As told Universe Today via email, in all cases, self-replicating probes offer the most efficient and plausible means for ensuring the survival of an advanced civilization: ET probes would be driven by survival of their local environment, be it main-sequence star lifetime, tectonic activity, etc., plus military reconnaissance to assess threats and alliances. What's more, he goes on to demonstrate that such probes would not be hampered by the same restrictions as biological organisms. This is true of propulsion, since advanced probes would be able to withstand acceleration beyond 9.8 m2 (the force of Earth's gravity) and would not require exotic propulsion methods. In addition, interstellar probes would not require supplies, bioregenerative life support systems, or have to worry about waste disposal. This would include extracting resources from star systems (such as asteroid belts and/or smaller rocky-metallic bodies) or from objects found in the interstellar medium, including asteroids, comets, and rogue planets. First, they would target the ubiquitous asteroids and moons in a specific system for their readily accessible raw materials, which are required for universal construction. Second, from these materials, they would build surveying probes to survey the extrasolar system for resources and life-bearing environments comprehensively. Third, they would select and secure resource-rich locations to establish bases for self-replication operations. Fourth, they would begin replicating more copies of themselves, including surveyor probes and sentinels. The sixth and final step would see the probes execute specific task instructions, which could include building O'Neill Cylinders for future settlers while (hopefully) not encroaching on potentially life-bearing planets. Another possible task, and a highly controversial one, would be the seeding of planets with simple or more complex organisms (aka. Based on this breakdown of activities, self-replicating probes would produce technosignatures that future surveys could look for. These efforts, it is hoped, will facilitate the "Great Migration" to space, possibly leading to settlements on other bodies and "Islands in Space" (a la O'Neill Cylinder and Stanford Torii). First, Ellery considered asteroid resources, which are likely to be as abundant in extrasolar solar systems as they are in our own. Beyond the Copernican Principle, which states that Earth and our Solar System are typical of the norm, there is also considerable evidence to support this idea. This includes studies of presolar interplanetary dust particles, which have been observed to contain metal nitrides, carbides, oxides, silicates, and iron-nickel alloys—the building blocks of planets, planetesimals, and asteroids. Furthermore, extrasolar planetesimals observed accreting onto white dwarfs within a 650 light-year (200 parsec) radius of Earth were predominantly composed of oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and iron, with smaller concentrations of volatiles such as carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen—similar to asteroids and moons in our Solar System. In addition to asteroids, self-replicating probes would likely be attracted to the Moon and similar rocky bodies because of their composition (silica, nickel-iron, and other metals), which is partly due to asteroid impacts that occurred over several billion years. *Artist's impression of Artemis astronauts operating on the lunar surface. Ultimately, Ellery concluded that asteroidal processing would be difficult to distinguish from natural processes and that the Moon would be an ideal base for self-replicating probes to center their manufacturing operations. Moreover, he suggests that nuclear reactors would likely power these operations, as they are a highly fuel-efficient power source that provides virtually unlimited energy density. This could include Magnox models, a type of gas-cooled reactor that utilizes natural uranium, graphite, and carbon dioxide gas as the heat exchange coolant. These, he concluded, could be constructed using lunar resources, and that the reactors would have left isotopic ratio signatures of Thorium-232, Neodinium-144, and/or Barium-137. "We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artifacts buried with asteroidal resources on the Moon," he wrote. "Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved." I think measurable technosignatures will be on the Moon - unusual surface Uranium or Thorium isotope ratios and subsurface magnetic anomalies. I think that if we have been visited, a gift in return for mining of our resources may be hidden among those asteroidal metals. The gift could be a universal constructor machine that would be of immediate and future utility to any civilization settling its solar system before interstellar ventures. In the near future, it is predicted that human exploration of the Solar System will give way to commercial development and the establishment of permanent outposts in space, as well as on other planets and celestial bodies. A dedicated technosignature search could reveal something far greater, such as evidence that humanity is not alone in the Universe.
