                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a breakfast with Senate and House Republicans in the State Dining Room of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025, in Washington. Gavin Newsom speaks during a campaign event on Proposition 50, Saturday, Nov. 1, 2025, in Los Angeles. Zohran Mamdani speaks after winning the mayoral election, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York. A day after Democrats dominated the first major Election Day since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the president is in Miami to speak at a forum of business leaders and global athletes about what he sees as his economic achievements. While a debate about the future of the Democratic Party may have only just begun, there are signs that the economy — specifically, Trump's inability to deliver the economic turnaround he promised last fall — may be a real problem for Trump's GOP heading into next year's higher-stakes midterm elections. The Republican president's speech to the America Business Forum will be a broad look at his economic agenda and how investments he has secured abroad help U.S. communities, according to a senior White House official. “South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore because what's happening there is bad,” Trump said at the America Business Forum. He reiterated that he will not attend the annual G20 summit for world leaders, to be held later this month in Johannesburg. Trump has had a contentious relationship with South Africa and had a tense Oval Office meeting with the country's president earlier this year. Trump was ticking through positive economic data, including Walmart's announcing that the price of Thanksgiving dinner staples will be down significantly, when he decided to remark on the presence of Saudi ambassador Reema Bandar al-Saud at his Miami speech. I don't know if they care about that in Saudi Arabia, but here it means a lot,” Trump said of the Walmart Thanksgiving prices. You know, she doesn't have to worry about it.” The Trump administration will present its resolution Wednesday to members of the U.N. Security Council on an international stabilization force in Gaza, according to a U.S. official. The proposal would provide a mandate for the force for at least two years, marking the next step in President Donald Trump's plan to halt two years of war between Israel and Hamas. “We have the greatest economy right now,” Trump said. Trump has been quick to note he wasn't in the ballot, but also said before going to Miami on Wednesday “ we learned a lot.” He promised during the speech to “make America affordable again.” Trump said America “lost a little bit of our sovereignty last night” after Democrats swept key elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, mayor in New York City and a ballot initiative in California to redraw its congressional districts in response by efforts by Republican states to do the same. Wednesday marks the last day for states to apply for federal funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program, created through Trump's summer tax and spending cuts bill as a counterbalance to sweeping Medicaid cuts that are expected to hit rural hospitals hard. The other half will be divided based on a formula developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that examines a state's rural population and the number of low-income people it serves. Several states have already made public their applications for the funding. Hospitals and health industry experts have warned that while the fund throws a lifeline to rural hospitals, it won't save them all. Challengers say Trump is illegally using an emergency law to claim nearly limitless tariff power and American small businesses are paying the price. Fellow Democrats had been urging Padilla, first appointed to the Senate by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, to consider entering a race that lacks a clear leader or star and was left wide open after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced her decision not to run. Many have declared Republican Curtis Sliwa the spoiler in the three-way race between him, Democrat Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo. When asked how they would vote if only Mamdani and Cuomo were in the race, about half of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo. The data indicates that even half of Sliwa's voters on Tuesday would not have been enough to make up the significant lead that Mamdani won by. Sliwa, for his part, won 7.1% percent of the vote. Those figures could change as late-arriving mail ballots are added. Asked about his thoughts on Democrats' resounding victories in Tuesday's election, Pennsylvania's Democratic senator said he didn't think they meant much, saying Democrats were heavy favorites in both New Jersey and Virginia, as was a ballot measure in California. “I wasn't surprised by any of these things,” said Sen. John Fetterman. “If people think that we should keep it closed because of the elections that we already knew we were going to win, it's like then that seems like it's a game,” he added. Democrats expanded their majorities Tuesday in both the New Jersey Assembly and Virginia House and broke a Republican supermajority in the Mississippi Senate. Democrats flipped control of two Mississippi Senate districts that had been redrawn under court order to increase Black voter representation. The reshaped districts played a significant role in Democrats' victories, said Heather Williams, president of the national Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “When there are representative maps -- and there is a process that actually gives voters a choice of who their elected officials are -- we can connect with voters and win,” said Williams, adding: “Mississippi was a prime example of that.” But the future of such districts could be in doubt. The Department of Homeland Security is revoking protections that shielded some South Sudanese living in the United Status from deportation, saying it is now safe for them to return to their chaotic East African nation. The order, which will take effect in early January, affects the small number of South Sudanese who have temporary protected status, which allows people already in the U.S. to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. But the news comes amid fears that the 2018 peace agreement ending that nation's civil war is collapsing, with growing hunger, violence and kidnappings, including of aid workers, and weeks after an international ceasefire monitor warned that all sides in the conflict were recruiting new fighters. The DHS statement acknowledged South Sudan is dealing with “violence linked to border disputes, cross-border violence, cyclical and retaliatory attacks, and ethnic polarization,” but notes that “return to full-scale civil war, to-date, has been avoided.” Krommidas disappeared after a night swim off Long Beach in the spring. A state judge ruled that his name had to remain on the ballot after local Republicans challenged Democrats' attempt to field a replacement. The party announced plans to file a federal lawsuit on Wednesday. While some people last Friday dressed in Halloween costumes or handed out candy to trick-or-treaters, a group of U.S. data scientists published a list of datasets that have been axed, altered or had topics scrubbed since Trump returned to the White House. Officials at the Federation of American Scientists and other data scientists who compiled the list divided the datasets into those that had been killed off, had variables deleted, had tools removed making public access more difficult and had found a second life outside the federal government. Indians lit up social media on Wednesday to celebrate Zohran Mamdani's election win as New York City mayor after he thanked his Indian-born parents, quoted a historic speech by India's first prime minister and turned the victory rally into a Bollywood-style street party. He has done a great job,” Mamdani's maternal uncle Vikram Nair told The Associated Press. Meanwhile in Uganda, where Mamdani was born, the opposition leader in the Ugandan Parliament sees his victory as an inspiring political shift. “It's a big encouragement even to us here in Uganda that it's possible,” said Joel Ssenyonyi, who represents an area of the Ugandan capital of Kampala. Uganda has had the same president for nearly four decades, Yoweri Museveni, despite attempts by multiple opposition leaders to defeat him in elections. ▶ Read more about how Ugandans and Indians are celebrating Mamdani's victory. He and his family lived in South Africa after leaving his country of birth, Uganda, and before emigrating to the United States. Mamdani's father, a political theorist, worked as an academic at the University of Cape Town. “We trust that he will continue to uphold the principles embodied in our school motto, Virtute et Valore — the courage to do what is right,” Mamdani's former school said in a statement sent to the AP. The grammar school also released a photo of Mamdani at 6 or 7 years old. A federal judge on Wednesday ordered prosecutors in the criminal case of former FBI Director James Comey to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, saying he's concerned the Justice Department's position has to been to “indict first and investigate later.” Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of Thursday grand jury materials as well as other evidence that investigators seized. Comey's attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to review materials that were gathered years ago. Progressive organizations are using Tuesday's election victories to warn Democrats against cutting a deal with Republicans to end the government shutdown. “Moderate Senate Democrats who are looking for an offramp right now are completely missing the moment,” said Katie Bethell, political director of MoveOn. “Voters have sent a resounding message: We want leaders who fight for us, and we want solutions that make life more affordable.” ▶ Read more about congressional developments involving the government shutdown Trump sent the social media post as Air Force One was about to take off for Miami, where he's addressing business leaders in the afternoon. On this day, November 5th, one year ago, we had one of the Greatest Presidential Victories in History — Such an Honor to represent our Country. Our Economy is BOOMING, and Costs are coming way down. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said it's time for Trump to meet with them as well as GOP congressional leaders to negotiate an end the shutdown and address the health care issue. Voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, have given Democrat Vi Lyles a fifth term as mayor. Lyles won comfortably Tuesday to remain the city's top leader 2 1/2 months after the death of a young Ukrainian woman on a commuter train. Lyles defeated Republican candidate Terrie Donovan, who had made crime her top issue even before the August stabbing. The suspect in Zarutska's stabbing had been arrested more than a dozen times. The GOP-controlled state legislature tightened suspect release rules in September, and Lycles has promoted additional safety measures on Charlotte's light rail. Democrats swept all those, and it was difficult to point to any major race, anywhere, where Republicans had a key victory. ▶ Read more about how Americans have soured on Trump's management of the economy Mamdani wasted little time as New York City's mayor-elect before making clear that he'll be standing up to the president of the United States, who had threatened not only to defund the city if he won, but also to arrest and deport him. “Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,” he said at his victory party. “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.” “New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” said Mamdani, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Uganda. Trump seemed to be watching: “…AND SO IT BEGINS!” he posted on social media as Mamdani spoke. The Republican speaker insisted he's willing to talk to Democrats about their demands for health care funds, but blames them for the record-breaking shutdown, now in its 36th day. Israel's hardline National Security Minister Itamir Ben-Gvir said Mamdani's election is an “everlasting disgrace — how antisemitism triumphed over common sense.” He called Mamdani “a Hamas supporter, a hater of Israel and an avowed antisemite.” During the campaign, he also denounced “atrocities” committed by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which he called a “horrific war crime.” While supportive of Palestinian rights, he denies being antisemitic and reached out to Jews during his campaign. Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli posted on X encouraging Jews of New York to emigrate to Israel, writing that the city “would never be the same again.” His feed on the social media site Wednesday was a stream of anti-Mamdani graphics, including a photo of the Twin towers being engulfed in flames with the caption “New York already forgot,” a meme criticized as Islamophobic. When asked Wednesday about their combative relationship during the mayoral campaign, Mamdani said he has repeatedly expressed a willingness to help the president fulfill some of the promises Trump made during his 2024 presidential campaign. “I have said time and again that I will work with the president if he wants to work together to deliver on his campaign promises of cheaper groceries or a lower cost of living. But for too long what New Yorkers have seen is a mayor who has been willing to work with the president at the expense of those New Yorkers,” Mamdani said on New York's NY1 news channel. “And I want to make it very clear that if the president looks to come after the people of this city, then I will be there standing up for them every step of the way.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• In the most significant economic case to reach the Supreme Court in years, Trump's authority to issue emergency tariffs faced deep skepticism from key conservatives — including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. • While justices had tough questions for both sides, a majority expressed reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to issue the unchecked tariffs. • As plaintiffs presented their case, Kavanaugh repeatedly noted that courts had previously allowed then-President Richard Nixon to use similar emergency powers to impose tariffs during his administration. • Both sides previously framed the appeal in existential terms, with Trump warning that a ruling against him could have “catastrophic” consequences for the nation's economic health. John Mulaney was among the Supreme Court spectators Wednesday. Mulaney has made several appearances with Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration. Katyal was a guest on the talk show “Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.” And, in 2023, Mulaney was a guest on Katyal's podcast, “Courtside.” Court wrapped shortly before 1 p.m., and in arguments that spanned over two and a half hours, the 6-3 conservative majority asked difficult questions of both sides. The overall cadence suggested that a majority at least had reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to impose sweeping global tariffs with no limit. “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in one key moment. Roberts and other members of the court's conservative wing had tough questions for the small- and medium-sized business that are challenging Trump's tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in particular, seemed concerned about limiting the power of a president to raise tariffs in an emergency. Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told CNN's Dana Bash today the Supreme Court “may finally be willing to put the brakes” on President Donald Trump's expansive use of his executive power after his tariff authority appears to have been met with skepticism by some of the court's conservative justices. “Today's oral argument indicates that the conservative justices may finally be willing to put the brakes on Donald Trump's utterly runaway arguments that he can do whatever he wants under Article II of the Constitution,” Raskin said. A majority of the court expressed reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to issue unchecked tariffs during oral arguments. “If it were just calling balls and strikes, as [Chief Justice John] Roberts once said, it would be a 9-0 humiliating defeat for Donald Trump, here, because they're just finger painting on the Constitution and on the statute. No other president has ever attempted to do this before.” CNN's experts watched and analyzed today's arguments in real time. That is a major question riding on the landmark Supreme Court case. So far, the federal government has collected $90 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged, according to Customs and Border Protection data as of September 23. “We don't deny that it's difficult,” Katyal responded. Justice Samuel Alito teased the attorney representing businesses, noting that he had used an argument touted often by conservatives about Congress and its inability to pass off legislative duties to the president. Katyal continued: “I think Justice Gorsuch nailed it on the head when saying that when you're dealing with a statute that is this open ended – unlike anything we've ever seen – to give the president this kind of power? “If one of our major trading partners, for example China, held a US citizen hostage,” Justice Clarence Thomas asked, could the president impose a tariff “for the purposes of leveraging his position?” Justice Samuel Alito asked whether a president could issue a tariff against an enemy on the precipice of war with the United States. The questions from Thomas and Alito appear to be attempting to steer away from the concurring opinion's broader reasoning, which would broadly limit a president's power. Kavanaugh pointed out that the law, which Trump has been relying on to impose sweeping tariffs over the course of his second term, was enacted shortly after then-President Richard Nixon imposed broad tariffs. Katyal argued that IEEPA should not necessarily be viewed as a response to Nixon's prior tariff actions. By way of example, Katyal pointed to Switzerland, which is being subjected to 39% tariffs: “That is just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in our history,” he said. “It implicates, very directly, the president's foreign affairs power,” said Roberts, who is a key vote to watch in the case. Trump's tariffs, Roberts said, were “quite effective” in achieving the president's particular objective. That position is closely aligned with the administration's position that a president has broad power in the context of foreign affairs. “Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy,” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration. Sauer argued the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump imposed are intentionally broad “because the emergency is so broad.” In enacting those tariffs, Trump has declared a national emergency stemming in part from alleged unfair trade policies practiced abroad. Now Neal Katyal, the lawyer for the businesses challenging President Donald Trump's argument for using emergency authorities to raise tariffs, is making his case. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan appeared to take a jab at President Donald Trump's repeated declarations of emergencies this year as a legal basis to expand the powers of his office and implement his agenda. “You yourself think that the declaration of emergency is unreviewable. And even if it's not unreviewable, it's, of course, the kind of determination that this court would grant considerable deference to the to the president on,” Kagan told Solicitor General D. John Sauer. “And in fact, you know, we've had cases recently which deal with the president's emergency powers. The same argument has been pushed in cases challenging Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations and his deployment of National Guard troops in major US cities. Courts typically give presidents a great deal of deference when it comes to cases involving emergency declarations, though several this year have rejected Trump's argument that, as an initial matter, they lack authority to review those determinations at all. President Donald Trump's attorney faced deep skepticism from several key conservative justices in early arguments at the Supreme Court over his sweeping global tariffs – a potentially troubling sign for the administration. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in particular, pressed the administration hard on several points, including whether the law at issue in the case authorized Trump to impose his emergency tariffs. Barrett, meanwhile, asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether the court had ever viewed the term to “regulate” to include sweeping tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, seemed skeptical of one of the administration's historical arguments: That former President Richard Nixon was permitted by courts to impose tariffs under a precursor to the law at issue in the case. However, Sauer has been asked to confront a number of serious and difficult questions from the conservative wing. Chief Justice John Roberts, who has asked a number of questions skeptical of the administration's arguments, at one point emphasized Congress' “core power” of regulating taxes, rejecting the government's claim that the tariffs aren't taxes. “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Roberts said. The challengers to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have noted that American taxpayers, not foreign companies, ultimately pay for them. It's early in oral arguments at Wednesday's landmark tariff case, but already there's been a key moment: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, questions the administration's novel use of a law to raise tariffs. “Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, ‘to regulate importation' has been used?” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, referring to language in a federal law the Trump administration has relied on to increase tariffs. In a testy back and forth with Solicitor General D. John Sauer, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back strongly on his argument that the emergency law President Donald Trump leaned on to impose his tariffs gave Trump sweeping authority. In a potentially key early moment for the arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts is questioning a key argument made by the Trump administration to justify its tariffs. Roberts pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer on a case called Dames & Moore v. Regan. That case, which the administration relies on heavily, okayed former President Jimmy Carter's decision to use frozen Iranian assets as a “bargaining chip” to win the release of 52 American hostages. “This at issue in Dames & Moore involved a different provision,” he said, “and it certainly did not concern tariffs.” He was a clerk to then-Justice William Rehnquist, who authored the opinion. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the Supreme Court case on his sweeping emergency tariffs represents a “life or death” moment for the country, framing the stakes in stark economic and national security terms. The Supreme Court is meeting today to hear oral arguments over Trump's global emergency tariffs, and will also be deciding the limits of a president's power – an area in which the court's 6-3 conservative majority has repeatedly sided with Trump since he began his second term in January. “Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday. “With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.” The president tied the case to his administration's trade policies, crediting tariffs and new trade deals for what he described as historic economic success. “Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump said.</p>

Former DNC vice chair David Hogg spoke to Fox News Digital at mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's election night party. As Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City, former DNC vice chair David Hogg told Fox News Digital that Democrats heading into the midterms should focus on restoring voters' faith in the American Dream. "No other state is like Virginia or New Jersey. The lesson that will be learned here tonight is not that every policy in New York should be replicated around the country. It's that listening and telling voters what you are actually going to do to lower prices works." The former DNC vice chair, who stirred up a Democratic Party rift earlier this year when he vowed to invest millions to primary older, incumbent Democrats in blue congressional districts, was among those celebrating Mamdani's success in New York City's high-stakes mayoral election Tuesday night. Former DNC vice chair David Hogg, left, celebrated Zohran Mamdani's mayoral win in New York City on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2025. "Having a clear message, asking them what you can do for them and wanting to genuinely serve them and actually delivering on that, does work," Hogg told Fox News Digital. New York City's mayoral race exposed an ideological and generational divide within the Democratic Party. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned from office in 2021 amid multiple controversies, including several sexual harassment allegations which he has denied, was staged to land his political comeback this year. But plan was interrupted when Mamdani shocked the political establishment and won the Democratic primary in June. A self-described democratic socialist, Mamdani will be New York City's youngest mayor in more than a century. His campaign focused on affordability, vowing to deliver fast and free buses, free childcare, rent freezes and city-run grocery stores to New York City.

"The truth is, there's a quiet civil war going on in the Democratic Party right now," Cuomo told Fox News last week. Bernie Sanders, AOC — Mamdani is just the banner carrier for that movement — versus the mainstream moderate Democrats." Hogg, who endorsed Mamdani's campaign ahead of the primary, told Fox News Digital that Mamdani's success signals less about socialism and more about how to run a successful campaign. "I think the lesson you learn here is not about policy, it is about tactics," he said. It's about clearly communicating what you're going to do to actually address voters' main concerns, and in New York City that may be somebody that's a lot more to the left, like Zohran, but in Virginia maybe somebody who is a lot more moderate, like Abigail. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani accepts an endorsement from the United Bodegas of America in the Bronx on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Hogg was ousted as DNC vice chair earlier this year following a procedural challenge to his candidacy, which came on the heels of announcing his outside political action committee, Leaders We Deserve, would invest $20 million into primary challenges against incumbent Democrats he claimed were "asleep at the wheel." "While this vote was based on how the DNC conducted its officers' elections, which I had nothing to do with, it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote," Hogg said in May. Hundreds of supporters celebrated Mamdani's win at the Brooklyn Paramount theater on Tuesday night, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Rep. Jamaal Bowman, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Attorney General Letitia James, actress Cynthia Nixon, anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil and Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza. He made strategic use of social media throughout his campaign, including TikTok, to build a recognizable brand and motivate a swath of low-propensity voters. Like President Donald Trump in 2024, Mamdani centered his mayoral campaign on affordability, vowing to deliver a New York City that voters could actually afford to live in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• In the most significant economic case to reach the Supreme Court in years, the justices are weighing whether President Donald Trump acted lawfully when he imposed sweeping emergency tariffs against most global trading partners. Those actions have been challenged by a group of small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as a dozen states. • Throughout arguments, which spanned more than two and a half hours, Trump's attorney faced deep skepticism from several key conservatives — including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. • As plaintiffs presented their case, Kavanaugh repeatedly noted that courts had previously allowed then-President Richard Nixon to use similar emergency powers to impose tariffs during his administration. • Both sides framed the appeal in existential terms, with Trump warning that a ruling against him could have “catastrophic” consequences for the nation's economic health. Court wrapped shortly before 1 p.m., and in arguments that spanned over two and a half hours, the 6-3 conservative majority asked difficult questions of both sides. The overall cadence suggested that a majority at least had reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to impose sweeping global tariffs with no limit. “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in one key moment. Roberts and other members of the court's conservative wing had tough questions for the small- and medium-sized business that are challenging Trump's tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in particular, seemed concerned about limiting the power of a president to raise tariffs in an emergency. If the court rules against Trump over tariffs it would be the first major break of his second term. CNN's experts watched and analyzed today's arguments in real time. Catch up on all of their insights below. That is a major question riding on the landmark Supreme Court case. So far, the federal government has collected $90 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged, according to United States Customs and Border Control data as of September 23. “We don't deny that it's difficult,” Katyal responded. But, once again, acknowledged refunds would be “complicated.” Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration's use of emergency economic powers to increase tariffs, said President Donald Trump can accomplish his goals by relying on other laws that more explicitly enable him to impose the import taxes. Justice Samuel Alito teased the attorney representing businesses, noting that he had used an argument touted often by conservatives about Congress and its inability to pass off legislative duties to the president. “Heck yes,” Katyal replied quickly as Alito chuckled. Katyal continued: “I think Justice Gorsuch nailed it on the head when saying that when you're dealing with a statute that is this open ended – unlike anything we've ever seen – to give the president this kind of power? Yes, this isn't just delegation running riot.” “If one of our major trading partners, for example China, held a US citizen hostage,” Justice Clarence Thomas asked, could the president impose a tariff “for the purposes of leveraging his position?” Justice Samuel Alito asked whether a president could issue a tariff against an enemy on the precipice of war with the United States. A concurring opinion, and a federal district court in another case, said that the law doesn't allow for tariffs. The questions from Thomas and Alito appear to be attempting to steer away from the concurring opinion's broader reasoning, which would broadly limit a president's power. Kavanaugh pointed out that the law, which Trump has been relying on to impose sweeping tariffs over the course of his second term, was enacted shortly after then-President Richard Nixon imposed broad tariffs. Katyal argued that IEEPA should not necessarily be viewed as a response to Nixon's prior tariff actions. By way of example, Katyal pointed to Switzerland, which is being subjected to 39% tariffs: “That is just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in our history,” he said. “It implicates, very directly, the president's foreign affairs power,” said Roberts, who is a key vote to watch in the case. Trump's tariffs, Roberts said, were “quite effective” in achieving the president's particular objective. That position is closely aligned with the administration's position that a president has broad power in the context of foreign affairs. “Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy,” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration. Sauer argued the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump imposed are intentionally broad “because the emergency is so broad.” In enacting those tariffs, Trump has declared a national emergency stemming in part from alleged unfair trade policies practiced abroad. Now Neal Katyal, the lawyer for the businesses challenging President Donald Trump's argument for using emergency authorities to raise tariffs, is making his case. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan appeared to take a jab at President Donald Trump's repeated declarations of emergencies this year as a legal basis to expand the powers of his office and implement his agenda. “You yourself think that the declaration of emergency is unreviewable. And even if it's not unreviewable, it's, of course, the kind of determination that this court would grant considerable deference to the to the president on,” Kagan told Solicitor General D. John Sauer. “And in fact, you know, we've had cases recently which deal with the president's emergency powers. The same argument has been pushed in cases challenging Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations and his deployment of National Guard troops in major US cities. Courts typically give presidents a great deal of deference when it comes to cases involving emergency declarations, though several this year have rejected Trump's argument that, as an initial matter, they lack authority to review those determinations at all. President Donald Trump's attorney faced deep skepticism from several key conservative justices in early arguments at the Supreme Court over his sweeping global tariffs – a potentially troubling sign for the administration. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in particular, pressed the administration hard on several points, including whether the law at issue in the case authorized Trump to impose his emergency tariffs. Barrett, meanwhile, asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether the court had ever viewed the term to “regulate” to include sweeping tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, seemed skeptical of one of the administration's historical arguments: That former President Richard Nixon was permitted by courts to impose tariffs under a precursor to the law at issue in the case. However, Sauer has been asked to confront a number of serious and difficult questions from the conservative wing. Chief Justice John Roberts, who has asked a number of questions skeptical of the administration's arguments, at one point emphasized Congress' “core power” of regulating taxes, rejecting the government's claim that the tariffs aren't taxes. “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Roberts said. The challengers to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have noted that American taxpayers, not foreign companies, ultimately pay for them. It's early in oral arguments at Wednesday's landmark tariff case, but already there's been a key moment: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, questions the administration's novel use of a law to raise tariffs. “Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, ‘to regulate importation' has been used?” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, referring to language in a federal law the Trump administration has relied on to increase tariffs. In a testy back and forth with Solicitor General D. John Sauer, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back strongly on his argument that the emergency law President Donald Trump leaned on to impose his tariffs gave Trump sweeping authority. In a potentially key early moment for the arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts is questioning a key argument made by the Trump administration to justify its tariffs. Roberts pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer on a case called Dames & Moore v. Regan. That case, which the administration relies on heavily, okayed former President Jimmy Carter's decision to use frozen Iranian assets as a “bargaining chip” to win the release of 52 American hostages. “This at issue in Dames & Moore involved a different provision,” he said, “and it certainly did not concern tariffs.” He was a clerk to then-Justice William Rehnquist, who authored the opinion. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the Supreme Court case on his sweeping emergency tariffs represents a “life or death” moment for the country, framing the stakes in stark economic and national security terms. The Supreme Court is meeting today to hear oral arguments over Trump's global emergency tariffs, and will also be deciding the limits of a president's power – an area in which the court's 6-3 conservative majority has repeatedly sided with Trump since he began his second term in January. “Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday. “With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.” The president tied the case to his administration's trade policies, crediting tariffs and new trade deals for what he described as historic economic success. “Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump said. He's asking why the “major questions doctrine” shouldn't apply in the case, as it has in several past cases involving former President Joe Biden, in which the court shut down that administration's policies. Chief Justice John Roberts announced a few minutes after 10 a.m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that she had pressed charges against a man after being harassed in the street. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum gives a morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. MEXICO CITY (AP) — What should have been a five-minute time-saving walk from Mexico's National Palace to the Education Ministry for President Claudia Sheinbaum has become a stomach-churning viral moment after a video captured a drunk man groping the president. The brief clip has given the daily harassment and assaults that women suffer in Mexico their highest-profile platform. And on Wednesday, Sheinbaum used her daily press briefing to say that she had pressed charges against the man. She also called on states to look at their laws and procedures to make it easier for women to report such assaults and said Mexicans needed to hear a “loud and clear, no, women's personal space must not be violated.” Sheinbaum said she felt a responsibility to press charges, because if not, where would that leave Mexican women? Indeed, if Mexico's president cannot be in the street for five minutes without a man approaching her from behind, putting his hands on her body and leaning in for a kiss, then it's not difficult to imagine what women with hours-long commutes on public transportation are experiencing daily. “I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,” she said. Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada had announced overnight that the man had been arrested. The incident immediately raised questions about the president's security, but Sheinbaum dismissed any suggestion that she would increase her security or change how she interacts with people. She said they could walk it in five minutes, rather than taking a 20-minute car ride. Brugada used some of Sheinbaum's own language about being elected Mexico's first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman – in this case Mexico's most powerful – is an assault on all women.

It will be in effect for the next three congressional election cycles and is expected to add Democratic seats to California's 52-seat delegation, only nine of which are currently held by Republicans. Not all the news is good, though, when it comes to specific issues facing the state or even whether Californians want to see their governor run for president. According to preliminary results from the Fox News Voter Poll, on the redistricting question itself, Golden State voters who backed redrawing the maps overwhelmingly said they did so to counteract changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than because they think it is the best way to draw congressional districts. Most voters said their reason to vote yes on Prop. 50 was to counter GOP map changes taking place across the country. In contrast, the much smaller number who voted "No" said they did so because they do not think it is the best way to draw congressional districts, as opposed to being motivated to stop Democrats from gaining more seats in Congress. Over half of California voters said that Prop. 50 is not the best way to draw district lines. Meanwhile, the vast majority of voters generally think a nonpartisan commission should draw the districts, as opposed to the party in power – which is ironic in that such a commission is exactly what is being preempted by today's vote. Voters overwhelmingly agreed that congressional district lines should be drawn by a nonpartisan commission. When asked how they generally feel about states redrawing their congressional districts in response to how other states have drawn theirs, most California voters oppose the idea – again, unusual seeing as that is exactly what they voted for with Proposition 50. Over half of voters said they oppose redrawing congressional district lines in response to other states that are redrawing their congressional maps. California voters were split on how they viewed Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom's job performance. Yet as to whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, more than half said it's not a good idea. Voters were split on if they wanted to see Governor Gavin Newsom run for president, despite roughly half approving of his job performance as governor. Even so, he outperforms former Vice President Kamala Harris on this measure, as these California special election voters would prefer she sticks to the sidelines – by more than two to one. Just over a quarter of voters said they would like to see former Vice President Kamala Harris run for president again. Was President Donald Trump a factor in Prop 50's success? Roughly half of California voters said that opposition to President Donald Trump was the reason they voted on Prop 50. Meanwhile, California voters reject Trump's immigration enforcement policies, with more than six in 10 saying they've gone too far. A similar number opposes sending the National Guard into U.S. cities. Just over half of voters said they oppose the federal government's move to send National Guard troops to major cities in California. And these voters who oppose Trump and his policies also overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – in some instances by more than nine to one. It might be pointed out, however, that Trump lost California by more than 20 points in 2024, and his disapproval ratings could be exaggerated among voters in this special electorate. Despite all their negative feelings toward Trump, all is not candy and rainbows for how Californians see things at home. The vast majority – close to nine in 10 – also say their family financial situation is either holding steady or falling behind. Only about one in 10 feel they are getting ahead. Just over half of voters said that their family is holding steady financially. Plus, more than eight in 10 lamented California's cost of living as unaffordable. Most voters polled said that the cost of living in their area is unaffordable. Another eight in 10 said crime is a problem. Voters overwhelmingly said that crime in their area is a problem. Almost half of California voters said they were angry about how things are going in the U.S. today. An overwhelming number of voters said that it's important which party controls congress. The Fox News Voter Poll is based on a survey conducted by SSRS with California registered voters. This survey was conducted Oct. 22 to Nov. 4, 2025, concluding at the end of voting on Election Day. Results among all more than 4,000 California voters interviewed have an estimated margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points, including the design effects.

(Brad Harvey via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — First responders were searching for more victims Wednesday after a UPS cargo plane crashed and exploded in a massive fireball at the company's global aviation hub in Kentucky, killing at least nine people, authorities said. Andy Beshear again predicted the death toll in Louisville would grow and said 16 families gathered at a reunification center “have reported loved ones unaccounted for.” The plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. Tuesday as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Video showed flames on the plane's left wing and a trail of smoke. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team of investigators. “Thankfully, a local restaurant that is right there ... was missed and now is helping the search and rescue,” Beshear said during a news conference Wednesday. “Another blessing is this plane could have potentially hit the major Ford factory or the convention center, those are all close by, and did not.” There were “extra smaller explosions” at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling, but it could have been worse, the governor said. University of Louisville Hospital said two people were in critical condition in the burn unit Wednesday and that 13 others had been treated and discharged. People in the immediate area were told not to drink tap water. It wasn't clear if they were being counted among the dead. UPS announced late Tuesday that package sorting at the center was halted, and the company told workers to not show up Wednesday, too. The hub employs thousands of workers, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour. “We all know somebody who works at UPS,” Louisville Metro Council member Betsy Ruhe said. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered.” The governor said The Team Kentucky Emergency Relief Fund, typically used to help people in natural disasters, is accepting donations to help with funeral expenses and other hardships. Eric Richardson stood outside a police training academy, where people gathered waiting for word of their missing loved ones Tuesday night. He said was hoping for information about his girlfriend, who had been at a metal recycling business near the explosion and wasn't answering her phone. Her phone's live location said she was still there. “We don't even want to think about anything but the best,” Whelan said. I mean, it literally looked like a war zone,” he said. Based on videos of the crash, aviation attorney Pablo Rojas said the aircraft appeared to be struggling to gain altitude as a fire blazed on its left side around one of its engines. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team of investigators. “This airplane apparently did undergo heavy maintenance within the past month, and investigators will need to comb through the maintenance records to see exactly what was done,” he said. The airport resumed operations Wednesday morning, with at least one runway open. A public school district in Louisville canceled classes for the day.</p>

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday morning that the ongoing government shutdown was partly to blame for the Republicans elections losses on Election Day. The Nov. 4 off-year elections were a smashing Democratic victory. Gavin Newsom's referendum victory in California will certainly shape the 2026 midterms. Yet, there were some local Republican victories, such as the one for Nassau County executive in New York, which provided the GOP hints of a better future – if Republicans are willing to study and learn from them. President Donald J. Trump suggested that his name not being on the ballot was a major factor in the outcome. This may be true, but it does not solve anything for Republicans. His name is not going to be on the ballot in 2026 or 2028 either. If Republicans do not learn how to connect with, motivate and turn out more Americans, we are in for a huge Democratic comeback in the next election. The deeply flawed and vulnerable Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia won – despite having written about killing the Republican Virginia speaker of the House and hoping his children would die. The larger Democratic wave carried him past his own despicable behavior. Zohran Mamdani, New York City mayoral candidate, campaigns in the Brooklyn borough of New York, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. Republicans would like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to be the future of the Democratic Party. But the outcome of the 2025 election suggests that Govs.-elect Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey are much more likely to lead the party. When you look closely, Spanberger and Sherrill have a surprising amount in common. Both have national security backgrounds (one as a CIA agent, the other as an Annapolis graduate serving in the Navy). Both campaigned as moderates and, when necessary, simply lied about the radical components of their records. Former President Barack Obama perfected campaigning as a commonsense moderate while governing as a liberal, sometimes radical, policymaker. It made perfect sense that Obama did not endorse Mamdani. It would have weakened Obama's image as a likable centrist. There was another characteristic of the Democrats' victories which Republicans historically find hard to learn: the power of message discipline. Republicans tried to raise social issues, such as men in girls' sports. Focusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created enormous incentives for investing in America. If all this works, there should be a Trump Boom by July 2026. If Republicans study and take to heart Tuesday's lessons, the long-term drift toward the GOP will continue. But if Republicans refuse to listen to all the American people (and not only their supporters) – and only focus on what the Democratic winners did wrong (and not what they did right) – the Trump majority could be much shorter and less effective. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill during an election night event in East Brunswick, New Jersey, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. Two years later, Republicans lost 26 House seats and seven governorships. A bad economy and some real communications mistakes (including scaring senior citizens about Social Security) led to a dramatic setback for Reagan. By 1983, former Vice President Walter Mondale was running ahead of Reagan in some polls. However, the Reagan team methodically thought through where the American people were – and what they wanted done. The Republican Party had been demoralized by President George H.W. Bush breaking his "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge. The result was a disappointing off-year election. Republicans lost a Senate seat, and four GOP incumbent governors were defeated. Dissatisfaction with both parties led to two independent governors being elected. The House pickup would have been bigger since the Democrats had a 7.8% popular vote advantage, but the Democrats had a 267 to 167 majority, so it was hard for them to pick up a lot more seats. Focusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission. The difference between 1982 and 1990 was that the Reagan team understood they had to change course to win in 1984. The Bush team simply could not bring themselves to confront how unhappy their base was – and how big the scale of change would have to be to win re-election. As a result, Ross Perot ran as a third-party candidate and helped end the 12-year Republican presidential ascendency. Or are they going to shrug off a bad election and stumble forward with no serious introspection like Bush? Time will tell which one today's GOP takes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrat Zohran Mamdani has been elected New York City's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in generations. Supporters on Tuesday night spoke about feeling hopeful and represented. Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City on Tuesday, capping a stunning ascent for the 34-year-old, far-left state lawmaker, who promised to transform the government to restore power to the working class and fight back against a hostile Trump administration. Mamdani must now navigate the unending demands of America's biggest city and deliver on ambitious — skeptics say unrealistic — campaign promises. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Zohran Mamdani's most prominent backers, said New Yorkers would fight back following mayoral race victory. New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani celebrated the city's immigrant population in his victory speech on Tuesday night, speaking about “Yemeni bodega owners, Mexican abuelas, Senegalese taxi drivers, Uzbek nurses, Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties.” New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, center, speaks in front of the Unisphere alongside his transition team in the Queens borough of New York, Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025.

NEW YORK (AP) — Fresh off winning New York City's mayoral election, Zohran Mamdani announced Wednesday that a team including former city and federal officials — all women — would steer his transition to City Hall, and that he would “work every day to honor the trust that I now hold.” “I and my team will build a City Hall capable of delivering on the promises of this campaign,” the mayor-elect said at a news conference, vowing that his administration would be both compassionate and capable. He named political strategist Elana Leopold as executive director of the transition team. He now faces the task of following through on his ambitious affordability agenda while navigating the bureaucratic challenges of City Hall and a hostile Trump administration. “I'm confident in delivering these same policies that we ran on for the last year,” he said in an interview earlier Wednesday on cable news channel NY1. With roughly 90% of the votes counted, Mamdani held an approximately 9 percentage point lead over Cuomo. Among the campaign's promises are free child care, free city bus service, city-run grocery stores and a new Department of Community Safety that would expand on an existing city initiative that sends mental health care workers, rather than police, to handle certain emergency calls. It is unclear how Mamdani will pay for such initiatives, given Democratic Gov. Mamdani was a fierce critic of the department in 2020, calling for “this rogue agency” to be defunded and slamming it as “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” He has since apologized for those comments and has said he will ask the current NYPD commissioner to stay on the job. Mamdani has already faced scrutiny from national Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who have eagerly cast him as a threat and the face of a more radical Democratic Party that is out of step with mainstream America. ”…AND SO IT BEGINS!” the president posted late Tuesday to his Truth Social site. Mamdani, for his part, said at his news conference that “New Yorkers are facing twin crises in this moment: an authoritarian administration and an affordability crisis,” and that he would tackle both. “I will not mince my words when it comes to President Trump … and I will also always do so while leaving a door open to have that conversation,” Mamdani added. Mamdani also said during his news conference and interviews that he had not heard from Cuomo or the city's outgoing mayor, Eric Adams.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posters at the IBEW Local 6 headquarters ahead of a campaign event in support of Proposition 50 in San Francisco, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. But Republicans are still ahead in the fight. The unusual mid-decade redistricting fray began this summer when President Donald Trump urged Republican-led states to reshape their voting districts to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in next year's election. Texas responded first with a new U.S. House map aimed at helping Republicans win up to five additional seats. Proposition 50, which California voters supported Tuesday, reshapes congressional districts to give Democrats a shot at winning five more seats. People hold up signs opposing Prop 50 during a press conference in Chico, Calif., Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. If the 2026 election goes according to the redistricting projections, Democrats in California and Republicans in Texas could cancel each other's gains. But Republicans could still be ahead by four seats in the redistricting battle. And a new U.S. House map approved last week in Ohio boosts Republicans' chances to win two additional seats. Several Ohio districts are so competitive that Democrats believe they, too, have a chance at winning them. And Missouri's redistricting law faces a referendum petition that, if successful, would suspend the new map until it's put to a statewide vote. Republican legal challenges are likely to continue against California's new districts, which impose boundaries drawn by the Democratic-led Legislature in place of those adopted after the 2020 census by an independent citizens commission. Though Democrats could win up to 48 of California's 52 U.S. House seats, several districts are closely divided between Democratic and Republican voters. “Some of the Democratic districts are probably going to vote blue, but I wouldn't call them locks,” said J. “You could still have some expensive races,” Coleman added. Republicans who control the Legislature chose not to convene a special session on redistricting Monday, after Republican Indiana Gov. But efforts to round up enough votes continue. Lawmakers now are planning to consider redistricting during a rare December regular session. Republicans currently hold seven of Indiana's nine U.S. House seats and could attempt to gain one or two more through redistricting. But some lawmakers remained reluctant, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins ended the effort Tuesday. Redistricting could still come up during Kansas' regular legislative session that begins Jan. 12. Gavin Newsom stands with first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom as he speaks during an election night press conference at a California Democratic Party office Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Sacramento, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said he hopes approval of California's redistricting “sends a chilling effect on Republicans who are trying to do this around the country.” But “if the Republicans continue to do this, we will respond in kind each and every step of the way,” Martin said. Wes Moore announced a commission on congressional redistricting, even though the Democratic Senate president has said his chamber won't move forward with redistricting because of concerns the effort to gain another Democratic seat could backfire. But lawmakers thus far have resisted, citing concerns about the effect on representation for Black residents. Virginia's Democratic-led legislature recently endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment allowing mid-decade redistricting. But it needs another round of legislative approval early next year before going to voters. Democrats currently hold six of Virginia's 11 U.S. House seats and could try to gain two or three more by redistricting, though no specific plan has been released. Over the past 90 years, when the president's party has held a House majority, that party has lost an average of more than 30 seats in midterm elections. Those past swings were so large partly because the president's party often held large House majorities, which meant more competitive seats were at risk. The Republicans' current slim majority is most similar to GOP margins during the 2002 midterm election under President George W. Bush and Democrats' margins during the 2022 midterm under President Joe Biden. Republicans gained eight seats in 2002, when Bush was widely popular after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Democrats lost nine seats in 2022, when Biden's approval rating was well under 50%, as Trump's is today. The Republican State Leadership Committee, which supports GOP candidates in state legislative races, warned in a recent memo that “the redistricting arms race has escalated to an every cycle fight” — no longer centered around each decennial census. Democratic lawmakers in New York are pursuing a proposed constitutional amendment that could allow redistricting ahead of the 2028 election. Several states currently under split partisan control also could pursue congressional redistricting before 2028 if next year's election shifts the balance of power so one party controls both the legislature and governor's office. “It's important to recognize that the fight for 2027 redistricting — and the U.S. House in 2028 — has already started,” RSLC President Edith Jorge-Tuñón wrote.</p>

Gavin Newsom threatened to sue the Trump administration if it sends National Guard troops to San Francisco. FIRST ON FOX: Citing frustrations with persistent crime, a trio of North Carolina lawmakers is urging Democratic Gov. "Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago," the letter states. "According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period." This is the Fraternal Order of Police that had come, saying that they believed this is important and asking the governor and mayor to step up and do it," Harris said, alluding to a similar letter published by Charlotte-Mecklenburg law enforcement earlier this year. Rep. Mark Harris, R-N.C., right, pictured alongside a shot from downtown Charlotte, left. The North Carolina letter comes as President Donald Trump has used the National Guard to bring attention to crime in cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago and others. So far, the administration has deployed the National Guard to six urban areas and floated deployments in another five — even as courts weigh the use of federal troops to address domestic crime. The letter from the North Carolina lawmakers pointed to those deployments as a template for success. "Other cities have deployed the National Guard and seen positive results. In Washington, D.C., when President Trump deployed troops under his lawful authority, the city promptly saw a reduction in crime, including twelve consecutive days without a single homicide," the letter states. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called it a continuation of the administration's work. "Millions of Americans don't feel safe in many once-great cities, and President Trump is working with House Republicans to change that. As we've seen in D.C. and Memphis, President Trump took decisive action, cleaned up our streets, and made those cities safer," Scalise said. "I commend my colleagues from North Carolina for calling out the violent crime in Charlotte and working to make the city safer for residents and visitors, and encourage more leaders to do the same," he added. According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions. He doesn't envision the National Guard deployment as a long-term solution to fighting crime. Instead, Harris believes the increased law enforcement presence could create an opening for the local police force to find their footing. "What I hope comes out of it is that in that time, the police are able to go after whoever these bad guys are, that are threatening this environment of crime. And then, at the end of the day, it's going to create a hope, an outcry from the public that says, ‘We're not going to accept our crime-ridden city anymore.'" When asked what needs to change to make Charlotte's safety a constant, with or without the National Guard, Harris said the city needs to prioritize its policies and resources on keeping violent offenders off the streets. "After the murder of Iryna Zarutska, it brought to light a real issue with not keeping criminals behind bars," Harris said, referring to the 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train. These are things that have a lot of issues to be addressed. Although past efforts to deploy the National Guard have been met with protest from Democratic governors in other states, Harris hopes that Stein will work with the Trump administration as needed if it becomes clear a deployment is needed. Stein's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Leo Briceno is a politics reporter for the congressional team at Fox News Digital.

The city's elections have determined whether New York remains a safe home for more than a million Jews or continues the dangerous slide that began two years ago, when vile pro-Hamas protests took over campuses like CUNY and NYU — and especially Columbia University, which became a symbol and stronghold of Hamas support in the United States, spilling into the streets of Manhattan. It is almost unthinkable that New York — the proud and historic center of Jewish life — could become the American city where Jews no longer feel at home or safe. But with the election of Mamdani as mayor, that unthinkable scenario is now a reality. New York will never be the same — particularly for its Jewish community. Israeli Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli speaks during The Israeli American Council (IAC) 8th Annual National Summit on Jan. 19, 2023 in Austin, Texas. This alliance works to infiltrate political Islamism within the United States under the camouflage of social welfare and human rights. Their goal is to take over America's cultural, academic, and political institutions just as they have done successfully in parts of Western Europe. They say it openly: all that's needed is a willingness to listen. And New York is now one step closer to becoming the next London. They work to infiltrate political Islamism within the United States under the camouflage of social welfare and human rights. Their goal is to take over America's cultural, academic and political institutions just as they have done successfully in parts of Western Europe. They say it openly: all that's needed is a willingness to listen. And New York is just moments away from becoming the next London. This wasn't an election only between Cuomo and Mamdani, but between liberty and the values of the American Republic on one side and political Islam on the other. Zohran Mamdani delivers a victory speech at a mayoral election night watch party, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York City. It must also be recognized that under the leadership of President Donald Trump and his team, this administration has tackled antisemitism like never before — unlike the previous administration, which thought it was a good idea to include CAIR in its strategic plan to combat antisemitism. With decisive action — not empty words — this current administration is making Jewish students safe again throughout America. Yet at the same time, a toxic strain of antisemitism is rising rapidly from within the political right. Influencers, media personalities, think tanks, student organizations and even elected officials are giving platforms and legitimacy to neo-Nazi rhetoric, Holocaust deniers, and the most absurd conspiracy theories — all under the deceptive banner of "free speech." Attendees wave Israel and the United States flags at the Christians United for Israel (CUFI) summit on July 17, 2023 in Arlington, Virginia. GOP presidential hopefuls for 2024 are making their cases before the pro-Israeli group. Three years ago, when I became Israel's minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, I viewed right-wing antisemitism in America as marginal and fringe. Neo-Nazism is being normalized, amplified and excused. And now, as Senator Ted Cruz said so powerfully, the conservative movement in America stands at a dramatic crossroads. This is a moment of moral choosing. The same forces that hate Jews also hate Blacks, Hispanics and anyone who refuses to submit to their ideological purity. As a conservative, I know it is easier to call out antisemitism when it comes from the left. But today, the most dangerous rising wave is coming from within the right, and we must say this clearly: this is not conservatism. Conservatism is incompatible with fanaticism and racism. It is rooted in truth, faith, and human freedom. You cannot call yourself a conservative while admiring Hitler, Stalin, or the theocratic dictator who rules Iran. You cannot call yourself a conservative while admiring Hitler, Stalin or the theocratic dictator who rules Iran. Anti-Israel demonstrators burn a U.S. flag, on the day of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 24, 2024. The foundations of the American –Jewish and Judeo – Christian alliance remain strong, built upon a principle expressed by the Founders themselves: "Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God," Benjamin Franklin's proposed motto for the Great Seal of the United States in 1776, later adopted by Thomas Jefferson for his personal seal. Amichai Chikli has been the Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism in the Israeli government since Dec. 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A motorist rammed into pedestrians and cyclists on the French island of Oléron on Wednesday, injuring nearly a dozen people just off the Atlantic coast. Ten passersby were injured, CNN affiliated BFMTV reported. At least two people were seriously wounded, including a 22-year-old woman, the interior minister added. He was taken into custody, BFMTV added. France's national anti-terror prosecutor's office is also monitoring the case, BFMTV said. “Up until now he's not saying much,” Nuñez said on Wednesday. Some of the survivors will be evacuated by helicopter to Poitiers, a city in mainland France, the mayor of Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, Christophe Sueur, told BFMTV. There were no children among the injured, he added. After hitting several people, the driver stepped out of his car and tried to set it on fire, BFMTV said. He shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the attack, local prosecutors said, adding that they could not yet determine a clear motive. The motorist – a French, Caucasian national in his 30s – is known to local police for common law offenses, including theft and driving under the influence of alcohol, added BFMTV, which also reported that he was not known to French intelligence services. He has family on the island of Oléron – where he lived and started his car journey on Wednesday, Sueur said. “It all happened very quickly,” the mayor told reporters. “I don't associate with him, but he is a person who is known, particularly to the police services,” he added. This story has been updated with additional developments. CNN's Sana Noor Haq reported and wrote from London.</p>

That can add an additional layer of frustration to how civilians have been spoken about and treated as they work side by side with those in uniform keeping the Defense Department running. “Me and my veteran friends are like, do they not know? When you disrespect the civilians who are working in federal service, do they not know that so many of them are actually veterans?” one Navy veteran who is a Defense Department civilian in Hawaii told CNN. “It's a slap in the face,” said another civilian who works in human resources overseas, and who is a military spouse and parent. Hundreds of thousands more – 334,900 according to agency contingency plans – have been furloughed and aren't working nor receiving paychecks while the government lacks spending authority. By contrast, despite a lack of Congressional action to provide funding, the Trump administration has moved money between accounts to pay service members in uniform during the shutdown, though it's unclear where funds will come from for future paychecks. Unpaid civilians have in at least some cases also been the ones processing payment for their military counterparts, the civilian working in HR said. Each of the civilians who spoke to CNN said they find great value and pride in their work for the US military; several described a deep commitment to serving their country as a civilian after leaving their own time in uniform. A person's debt and financial concerns are a key question in the process to get a security clearance, they explained, and many civilians are being forced to take out loans to stay afloat while missing paychecks. In response to an email outlining the concerns civilians voiced in this article, Pentagon press secretary Kinglsey Wilson said the reporting was a “completely off base and partisan story devoid of facts.” “If [Defense Department] civilians are upset about anything, it's the Democrats voting over a dozen times to withhold their pay, making it hard for our federal workers and uniformed servicemembers to pay rent, enjoy Thanksgiving, and buy Christmas presents for their children,” Wilson said. Several civilians who spoke to CNN expressed exhaustion at what has been a year full of hurdles for those who just want to do their jobs. Being in human resources, the civilian working in HR overseas and their coworkers have become counselors at times, they told CNN, as people have been repeatedly pushed to tears navigating the stress of wondering how to pay rent or their child's college tuition back home. While several civilians said they are actively looking to leave federal service to find more stability there is also a sense of anxiety with how their replacements might respond to the current pressures of working for the Pentagon. “I'm nervous about how they will behave when told to do something that maybe they shouldn't do,” a senior Army veteran-turned-civilian said. I don't know if the next person will feel that way.” Wilson said in her statement to CNN that civilians who took the delayed resignation opportunity, a key feature of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency effort that aimed to find massive cost saving across government, “are happy because they got a great deal.” Employees also began receiving instructions to send in five bullet points explaining what they'd done that week, with little to no clarity on where those lists were going, who would be reviewing them, or what it was exactly that they wanted to see. “We had seen how our peers were getting let go from their jobs for seemingly not big deals, it put all of us on notice. The rhetoric in which they were talking about civilian service put all of us on notice – that we were replaceable, our service didn't matter,” the civilian said. “So sure, [the five bullet points] wasn't a big deal, but they had already proven that tasks that were not a big deal were fireable offenses.” Several civilians working outside of the continental US told CNN a deep sense of anxiety and distrust set in after watching counterparts at USAID, for example, get abruptly laid off and left to facilitate and fund their own move back to the US on short notice. CNN reported in February that scores of USAID employees around the globe — some in dangerous areas — were left scrambling and in shock as they were abruptly locked out of secure systems and left to manage the next steps alone. “That really set the tone for a lot of us overseas, in a no-shit panic,” the civilian said, adding that panic has “ebbed and flowed” ever since. Officials scrambled to create lists of workers who should be exempted from the firings because of their crucial roles in intelligence, cyber security operations or other important national security issues. The Pentagon eventually announced its intention to fire 5-8% of its civilian workforce, and thus far the agency has reduced its payrolls by more than 50,000 employees mainly by not backfilling when civilians have retired or otherwise left federal service. The civilians who spoke to CNN described what they see as both a total lack of understanding – and lack of interest in learning – what civilians do for the US military. “You will not have intelligence feeding operations the way it's supposed to, you will not have operations planned so that people are where they need to be at the right time, you will not have products and materiel where it should be in order to engage in a fight,” they added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hudson Institute, Heritage Foundation, and American Enterprise Institute have attracted considerable attention from foreign agents representing countries such as Ukraine, South Africa, Taiwan, Armenia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, South Korea, Somaliland, France, Switzerland, Togo, India, and Serbia. By contrast, well-established left-of-center think tanks like the Brookings Institution have attracted comparatively less attention from foreign influence operations than they did in prior years, falling behind conservative policy shops in Trump's Washington. Taiwan, likely owing to its precarious geopolitical position, was especially active in these regards. On Sept. 12, for instance, Taiwanese Minister of Mainland Affairs Chiu Chui-cheng secured an invitation to speak to the Heritage Foundation about why “a free, secure, and prosperous Taiwan not only contributes to regional stability, but also makes America's position stronger on the world stage.” This rhetoric gels well with a recent well-publicized statement made by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, in which he said that the United States should cooperate with foreign powers like Israel when it aligns with American interests but should be more circumspect in other situations. Taiwanese foreign agents have also worked to arrange a joint training workshop with Heritage staffers, as well as a number of other discussions and meetings this year. Among all the foreign agents that reached the trio of conservative think tanks, those representing South Korea were primarily interested in trade, defense, shipbuilding, and deepened economic collaboration; Ukrainian agents were interested in discussing U.S. energy policy; and Emirati agents sought to discuss defense policy. While Heritage and its conservative peers have received a fair amount of attention from foreign agents in recent months, it does appear that foreign agents have grown less interested in prominent left-of-center think tanks. Since November 2024, however, foreign agents have only reached out to staff at the think tank 30 times. The Center for American Progress and the New America Foundation, two other major left-of-center think tanks, have received only two and one communications from foreign agents, respectively, since November 2024. “CAP has long had the policy to not take direction from outside entities or persons, whether foreign or U.S., and we make our policy clear with everyone that we work with,” a spokeswoman for the think tank told the Washington Examiner. Despite assertions from some prominent online commentators regarding Israel's influence over conservative policymaking, DOJ records show no Israeli foreign agents contacting any of the three conservative think tanks since November 2024. Given Attorney General Pam Bondi's more lax enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, however, it is theoretically possible that Israeli or Qatari did occur but were not reported to the DOJ. Heritage, Hudson, Brookings, and New America did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN DIEGO — California‘s controversial redistricting ballot measure has done wonders to boost Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s (D-CA) early bid for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. Newsom managed to regain much of the popularity he lost and boost himself onto the national stage after publicly taking on President Donald Trump. He has gone on television shows, podcasts, and radio programs framing the Proposition 50 fight as one for the very soul of America. Last week, he acknowledged publicly that he was weighing a 2028 presidential run and, on Tuesday, was able to deliver on a redistricting measure that was not very popular with his own party at the start but one that he was able to get across the finish line in record time, under intense pressure, and with the nation's eyes fixed on him. Newsom, who will be termed out of office next year, said he is proud that the state and the nation came together “to send a powerful message to an historic president.” “And Donald Trump is an historic president,” Newsom said. “He is the most historically unpopular president in modern history. Newsom, a multimillionaire himself, added that the one thing Trump did not count on was California and just how polarizing Trump could be. “Instead of agonizing over the state of our nation, we organized in an unprecedented way, in a 90-day sprint, people from all over the United States of America contributed their voices and their support for this initiative,” Newsom said, “We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness, and tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared with an unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result.” Everything Newsom has said since taking on the redistricting battle has started to sound presidential, San Diego voter Maria Garcia told the Washington Examiner. So, some of the message here is that Newsom is the guy who's going to fight Donald Trump, and no one else will. So, while there's a lot of dislike for Donald Trump, there's also, among Democrats, real frustration and disappointment with both [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer (D-NY) and [House Minority Leader Hakeem] Jeffries (D-NY), who are seen as milquetoast and lackluster, unwilling to fight. “It's an early sign that he isn't just fighting against Trump with memes and bravado — but with tangible, deeply important policy and legislative wins,” he added. “It adds substance to his posture against Trump that some have found lacking.” Newsom and a parade of national Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) pitched the redistricting measure as necessary to counteract Trump. Newsom has also shown up prominently in Democratic Party ads and seems to be, for now, at the top of the ticket. Equally important, Newsom mobilized all the big Democrat heavy hitters for the YES campaign – AOC, Barack Obama and Jasmine Crockett – and then put himself in those ads.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gathered in the common room of an apartment building in Long Island City: city comptroller Brad Lander, Brooklyn borough president Antonio Reynoso and state senator Jessica Ramos. Zellnor Myrie, another state senator who ended up running, was invited but didn't come. In that first meeting and several that followed, the other potential candidates closer to launching kept their plans close to their vests, but Mamdani was eagerly participating, pitching and proposing ideas. Last summer, Mamdani told Archila he was jumping in. He wanted to combine what Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Brooklyn city councilman Chi Ossé had done in breaking down traditional politics with compelling social media and a plan to knock on a million doors, he said. He asked when the WFP would announce which candidate it would rank first on its primary slate and told her, “Give me as much time to get there as possible.” On Tuesday, Mamdani stood on stage before a packed Brooklyn ballroom and a national audience, quoting the socialist Eugene Debs and declaring himself proud of all who he is, as New York City's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in a century. Mamdani's history-making run is reverberating around the world and through Democratic politics. His allies reject criticisms that he isn't truly a Democrat or that his ideas could only work in deep-blue New York City rather than the more politically diverse states Democrats will have to win to regain national power. “I don't think anyone had this on their bingo card,” said public advocate Jumaane Williams, who also attended the secret meetings — not because he was going to run, but because they wanted to prepare if Adams had stepped down and he had become interim mayor. A Mamdani mayoralty will mean enormous changes for New York City and its government. He has promised sweeping action to make public buses free and reduce the cost of living, including by opening government-run grocery stores. How he got here after his primary win and what happens now, according to CNN's conversations with three dozen advisers, politicians, operatives, donors and others involved in Mamdani's campaign and beyond in city politics, was more harried than a run against a disgraced former governor in Andrew Cuomo and a perennially kooky New York character in Curtis Sliwa might have seemed. “We understood this was not going to be the last phase of the fight,” Archila said, thinking back on primary night. “The billionaires didn't spend $30 million to just fold their tent.” The Mamdani campaign's post-primary internal polling surprised them: nothing, positive or negative, seemed to be moving voters in either direction. They gave up trying to win voters over, instead going with funny ads and videos parodying “The Bachelor” and “Survivor” that spread on their own among supporters — “We leaned into the vibes,” said one person involved with campaign strategy. It felt sometimes like the energy that powered him as an underdog had been partly drained. Having embraced an anti-oligarch message and a strategy of answering every question and going to every event, Mamdani took a vacation to celebrate his wedding, then returned to hold a closed-door tour of business and city leadership groups meant to chill them out and maybe even change some minds. According to a person familiar with their conversations, the Vermont senator told his aides to push back on the Mamdani campaign's request that he just join for a town hall back in Sanders' native Brooklyn. They needed to stop the race from consolidating against him, Sanders argued, and he believed his celebrity presence could push that along. Marching in the Labor Day parade, he figured, would become a scene, get all the cameras to take pictures of all the elected officials standing around him and Mamdani, and in turn, force holdout Gov. Kathy Hochul to edge closer as they walked up Fifth Avenue holding a unity banner together. He was walking out of the bathroom before they started recording when an aide held up a phone with the video just posted of Eric Adams at Gracie Mansion, calling Cuomo “a snake and a liar,” throwing the former governor in with Mamdani as “two spoiled brats” he was determined to beat himself. “All right!” the Vermont senator said, pumping his fist. Adams staying in, Sanders said, was going to make getting back  on track easier. Cuomo and his aides watched the same Adams event, trying to convince themselves that it didn't matter much if Adams stayed in, according to one person familiar with the matter. But the former governor had been obsessing about pushing Adams out of the race going back months before even Cuomo launched his primary campaign in February, running on a sense of perceived inevitability. Three weeks later, when Adams did in fact drop out — by then past the window when Sanders and Mamdani advisers felt it mattered — Cuomo's team was struggling to disagree. At most, an adviser told CNN, they now had “a shot.” When Sanders came back to New York for a closing rally at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens on the last Sunday in October, he was feeling better about Mamdani's chances. At one point, Sanders asked former Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan for her ideas on what to do at City Hall. A former mayor himself, Sanders honed in on the first 100 days mark, telling them, “They'll try to crush you,” and urging, “you've got to give people a sense of action.” Learn a little from Trump, Sanders told them: it's not policy or communications – but seeing them as the same and as producing results. And that was before he heard Barack Obama's voice on the line. Mamdani started by thanking Obama for his advice on their last call, over the summer, that he needed to focus on getting governing right. He'd been thinking a lot about it, Mamdani said. I want you to be a successful mayor, Obama reiterated, and that means delivering services and all the important basics. He needs to have more professionals around, Obama has worried in private conversations of his own. It was only the second time they had spoken. But over the 30 minutes, the vibe as described by a person familiar with the call was real — no mention of Mamdani's past tweets calling Obama a liar and “pretty darn evil,” instead more in line with Obama's current mode of meshing his forever fascination with other young charismatic candidates and the new role he's calibrating as party godfather trying to make sense of the left's shifting politics. Mamdani also thanked him for his 2008 race speech, which he said had provided a template for his own Islamophobia speech two weeks ago, unlike an antisemitism speech he had reviewed and decided against giving earlier in the campaign. He caught Obama by using the 2008 speech's formal name: “A More Perfect Union.” That's flattering, Obama told him, but then he turned it back around: “The reason you have been so successful is because you have a deep sense of what you believe,” the former president told him, according to a person familiar with the call. They made a loose plan to get together soon. Behind the scenes, Mamdani was complaining to one friend weeks ago that he didn't know why everyone was on his case to have a transition plan mapped out already. With his closest aides, he was already compiling lists of potential appointments to top positions. Still unresolved is his surprise declaration in the last mayoral debate that he would ask police commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on. Two potential future Mamdani aides told CNN they were aghast at the malpractice they believe it would represent if he actually hadn't gotten a sign from her and what that might signal for governing ahead. One person who is out of the picture for now is Brad Lander, the city comptroller who was at that first Working Families meeting and later allied with Mamdani under the primary's ranked-choice system. Once Lander's own primary hopes began to sputter out in the spring, he essentially rebooted his campaign as a Cuomo takedown machine, with an explicit strategy of doing all the bashing — replacing his ads with an anti-Cuomo spot, building every event and robocall script around negativity, so that, advisers calculated, Mamdani could close out with all positive and hopeful feelings. But over the summer, Mamdani would confide he wasn't much impressed with Lander. Nice enough guy, but he didn't seem particularly effective as comptroller, Mamdani said. The two went weeks without talking, and though Lander would get defensive and blame overlapping post-election vacations, all his talk that he'd be the one really running the city next year had gotten back to Mamdani and not gone over well. “I will say, you know, this is the start of something, not the end of something,” Lander said, “and it's — we got to keep going.” Even before Tuesday night, his opponents were doing their own planning for what comes next. Walking through Hell's Kitchen on Sunday night as part of his final push, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa predicted his own role after a Mamdani win. “I will declare myself mayor in exile, keep a strong eye on what he does as mayor, and every time he crosses that line — which he will — organize the opposition, protest, take all means necessary other than violence, and try to stop his initiatives,” Sliwa told CNN, adding that he expected Cuomo to move back out of town. While several potential members of the Mamdani administration have discounted what will come of Trump's threats to defund or come after the city, others say they believe Mamdani will be able to be a messenger that national Democrats need. John Catsimatidis, the billionaire friend of Trump who tried to boost Cuomo and failed to push out Sliwa, was telling people on a regular basis through the fall that some new development was about to drop against Mamdani “next week” and then “next week” again. Despite all that Mamdani tapped into and the campaign he ran, Catsimatidis says he's still looking for an explanation for what to others is so obvious about the candidate, and what he tapped into. He offered a potentially ominous prediction given the Justice Department's prosecutions of people Trump considers enemies, including New York Attorney General Tish James. US Rep. Ro Khanna of California, the Silicon Valley lawmaker-turned-Sanders acolyte who came to Queens the final weekend to speak as a prominent Hindu politician to a rally geared toward mostly Indian Muslim voters. When Mamdani's SUV pulled up at Major Mark Park, he and Khanna only had a moment together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa on Tuesday night. Now, he'll be a household name in the Democratic Party.The 34-year-old will now have a chance to implement his hallmark campaign promises: freezing the rent, making childcare free, and instituting government-run grocery stores. Republicans and centrist Democrats had gone to great lengths to defeat him, with some Republicans in the waning moments of the race endorsing Cuomo to drum up last-minute support.Mamdani arrived at his victory party in Brooklyn's Paramount Theater to screaming, dancing and bouncing supporters. Some wore Democratic Socialists of America gear, and several “DSA” chants broke out just before Mamdani took the stage.When the self-described socialist spoke, washed in blue and yellow light characteristic of his campaign colors, he was unapologetic for his beliefs. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this,” Mamdani said, adding that “convention has held us back.” His prior scandals, including sexual harassment claims he has denied, proved too much for the former governor to win in the Democratic primary or as an independent in the general election.Mamdani had scathing criticism ready for the former governor, whom he wants to bury in the past.“My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,” he said. “I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life, but let tonight be the final time I utter his name as we turn the page on a politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few.”Sliwa, who had an uphill climb in the deep blue stronghold and was never backed by Trump, drew little support.New York City's choice of a socialist focused on affordability after several years of public safety hawk Mayor Eric Adams signals a leftward shift in the city's politics. But the city's choice of Mamdani could also be a credit to the candidate himself, who tried to moderate his stances after winning the primary and charmed business leaders and reluctant Democratic power players.One of Mamdani's first issues when he is inaugurated as mayor will be President Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut off funding to the city and wants to send the National Guard. Mamdani put himself forward as a leader in the movement against Trump in the closing minutes of his speech. “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” he said, “and if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”“So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,” the socialist declared to a booming crowd. Mamdani said that Trump would have to “get through all of us” in order to mess with New Yorkers.After reiterating his campaign agenda, Mamdani froze his people-powered message into history. This city belongs to you.”2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORKAs the curtains closed on one of the most polarizing New York City mayoral races in history, Mamdani stood with his family on stage and basked in the moment. Less than a year ago, the city hardly knew his name.Now he's led his socialist movement to the pinnacle of New York politics: Gracie Mansion.</p>
