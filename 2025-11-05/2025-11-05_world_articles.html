                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PPG (NYSE: PPG) today announced that it achieved a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the largest simultaneous paint stirring challenge during a customer event at the 2025 SEMA Show in Las Vegas. More than 275 participants stirred paint together to highlight the manual effort still common in collision repair before PPG unveiled its new SEM MIX'N'SHAKE™ automated stirring solution. More than 275 participants simultaneously stirred paint at SEMA 2025 as PPG breaks the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the largest paint stirring challenge as it unveiled the SEM Mix'n'Shake™ automated stirring system. The SEM Mix'n'Shake system produces a fully homogenized car paint mix in less than 60 seconds. By automating this step, body shops can reduce rework and recover up to 6% more productive work hours annually. Afterward, the crowd watched as a SEM Mix'n'Shake system mixed paint hands-free – a clear contrast to the manual effort that preceded it. The paint used during the stirring challenge will be donated to Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah, to support hands-on learning and technical training for students in automotive and collision repair technology. “This was more than a record-setting event – it was a symbolic moment for the industry,” said Rodolfo Ramirez, PPG vice president, Automotive Refinish Coatings, Americas. “By showing how much time and effort shops still spend on mixing, we helped our customers see the value of automation.” The Mix'n'Shake system is part of a broader effort to transform the body shop through automation and digital integration. It connects with the PPG LINQ™ digital ecosystem and complements innovations, including the PPG MOONWALK® automated mixing system, helping shops reduce waste, increase throughput and free technicians to focus on higher-value tasks. At PPG (NYSE:PPG), we work every day to develop and deliver the paints, coatings and specialty products that our customers have trusted for more than 140 years. Through dedication and creativity, we solve our customers' biggest challenges, collaborating closely to find the right path forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This Gen Z walking club has built a loyal following, and a stable of haters, for treks they share on social media. And, depending on whom you ask – most notably the age of the person you're asking and how they're inclined to feel, generally, about Gen Zs and young people these days – The Walkers are either brilliant, or brilliant at wasting time. The group consists of Sebastian Karall, Michaela Purcell, Sophia Franc, Katie Wang and Hayden Chan. They're all in their early 20s, and have been friends for the better part of the last decade, since attending high school together at Garth Webb Secondary School. Together, they've walked from Oakville to Toronto, a 46-kilometre trek that took them 12 hours. They walked over the entirety of Toronto's 26-kilometre Bloor-Danforth subway line. One day, they hope to walk across all of Canada. They're not walking to raise awareness around any specific issue. They're not, typically, raising funds for charity (though they did hold a walk in support of Fort York Food Bank in late October). They post the walks on social media, but they're not influencers, and not earning income off of it. Instead, they walk for the sake of walking. They have many, many online supporters – who write to say “I love whatever that's wrong with y'all” and compliment their “chill vibes.” But there are also critics – those who roll their eyes at Gen Zs for “discovering” walking, and frittering away their time. “I guess walking, the way we do it, is performance art.” The Walkers are Sophia Franc, Katie Wang, Hayden Chan, Sebastian Karall and Michaela Purcell. I met The Walkers at Toronto's Union Station on a Sunday morning. It was just before 9 a.m. and the station, usually packed on weekdays with harried commuters, was all but empty. So it was impossible to miss the five Walkers as they approached in their extremely impractical – extremely Gen Z – walking clothes: flippy skirts and tank tops, baggy T-shirts and even baggier pants. My plan was to tag along on this day's walk. I wanted to see if, by the end of it, I might learn something – yes, about walking, but also about how this group of friends had become a kind of Rorschach test on today's young people. All around us, Gen Zs (those born between 1996 and 2010) have become the new punching bag – the next set of budding adults to sneer at. Across popular culture, they're derided as entitled and difficult to work with, as anxious and antisocial – this, despite the fact that we know so little about them. Unlike their millennial predecessors, they seem, at least for now, less interested in broadcasting their me-ness to the world. What we do know about Gen Z is that they face a mountain of challenges. The youth employment rate is at its lowest in decades. They're more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. But that's only if they ever do become full-fledged adults. Because of the struggling economy, because of the pandemic, because of a long list of reasons The Walkers would spend the next many hours telling me about, they, like many other young people today, are facing a delayed start to adulthood. And that ties back to the walks, too. “I definitely feel more kid-like than adult-like,” said 22-year-old Sebastian. “These walks, I guess, embody the values of kids. If you had to label The Walkers back in high school, you might have called them the theatre kids. The five friends spent most of their time hanging out in Hayden's basement, dreaming up skits and scripts for films they might one day make together. “I don't know which clique you'd call us,” said Hayden. They'd build fires at Bronte Creek park, and go for long, meandering walks designed around spending time together, experiencing new places together. “It was like one last hurrah of childhood,” said Sebastian. Today, all of them have completed undergraduate degrees. Still, all but one continue on as full-time students. There's Sebastian, who's in grad school at the University of Toronto, and Michaela, studying musical production at Seneca College. We set off from Union Station just a few minutes after 9 a.m. It was early October, but felt like late summer. The sun was already beating down on us. I was joining them for the second half of their trip, from Union to Finch. I'd gone to bed early and calculated the grams of protein in my breakfast to give myself maximum energy. Slathered on sunscreen and worn New Balance sneakers with soles so wide and thick they looked like bumper cars. They'd ordered in discount sushi, then crashed on each other's couches. On this day, Michaela had brought her phone and nothing else – not even a water bottle – with her. This past summer, as they began planning their walk from Oakville to the CN Tower, they started an Instagram account called “Meet The Walkers.” They've since gained over 13,000 followers. They were interviewed for their local Oakville newspaper. Part of it, said Katie, might be nostalgia. To their older followers, she theorized, The Walkers are a reminder of a different time, and of what it was like to be young and discovering the city for themselves. “I think our content does well with middle-aged moms,” she told me. “They think we're cute and wholesome,” said Sophia. Another reason, Katie added, might simply be their optimism. And yet, with their goofy, punny singalongs and wide, gummy smiles, The Walkers respond to the world with unfailing cheer. And it's not just an act, she said. She studied ecology as an undergrad, looking at the effects of climate change on our planet. So she understands that there's a lot to be pessimistic about. “I think even though we have had our share of doom, we do still have hope,” she said. At about 10 a.m., after passing the screaming billboards and double-decker buses around Eaton Centre, Hayden said he had another theory to explain their online popularity. He was about to launch into it when something caught his eye at the intersection of Yonge and College. It had become a regular stop on their walks. Mostly just to buy snacks for cheap. Hayden made a beeline towards the yellow storefront. The store was closed and wouldn't open for 15 minutes. He let himself brood for just a moment before carrying on. He remembered his train of thought from earlier, about their popularity. Over and over again, he said, they get the same question in the comments: Can I come? “We're extremely lucky to have friends like this,” he said. But really, I think what they want is friends like us.” A survey from 2023 found that over half of young people in Canada – 51.7 per cent – reported feelings of social isolation. After the pandemic, he said, many of their peers continue to live in largely the same way they did in lockdown: alone, and trapped in their own digital bubbles. So, to many of these young followers, The Walkers might feel aspirational. “What they want is friends to go for walks with,” he said. At about noon, we were making our way through midtown. It was a stretch where the city felt especially unrelenting. My feet were starting to slow down, even as The Walkers continued on at a swift pace. I asked which historical event they felt had shaped Gen Z the most. Most of them responded, as I'd suspected, with the pandemic. There was no prom, and their graduation ceremony consisted of a YouTube video, with teachers sending in self-recorded messages of congratulations. “Every single teacher's video ended with ‘carpe diem,'” she said, shaking her head and giving a sad laugh. The lockdowns happened late enough that they were able to have a mostly normal high school experience. But Hayden had an answer that surprised all of us. He argued that the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has been just as impactful on their young lives. He said Trump's first election in 2016 – which took place when they were 14 – made for a confusing backdrop to adolescence. “Suddenly, you felt pressure to have opinions on everything,” he said. “We were in grade nine, and suddenly we were supposed to have a view on trans rights.” He said it became “cool” for young men among them to espouse alt-right views – to follow online “manosphere” figures like Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan. “It was ‘cool' to make fun of ‘SJWs',” he said, the online shorthand for “Social Justice Warriors.” Sebastian nodded and added that many of their male friends spend much of their time interacting only with other young men. This is one reason The Walkers prefer to keep their walks phone-free. Aside from shooting their videos or using their phones to navigate, the walks are, for the most part, screen-free time. The irony that they're now making online videos isn't lost on them. They're still figuring out how to reconcile it. “Now we're contributing to the scroll,” said Hayden. “We took two years out of peoples' lives,” said Katie, shaking her head. The sidewalk led into a tunnel – an underpass beneath Highway 401 – where the street widened to six lanes of traffic. They'd come across similarly dangerous stretches before, including places where the sidewalk or road would just suddenly end and then they'd have to walk across a highway. These were the moments where Sebastian put on his urban explorer hat. He's taking a course at U of T on psychogeography – the study of the effect that urban environments have on our psychology – and likes to share his learnings with the group. “These walks have really exposed to us that huge parts of the city are not really built for walking,” he said. He hopes their online platform will help spread this message. “We're getting to the part that's not for us anymore,” said Hayden. The CN tower was so small she could pinch it between her thumb and index fingers. I was tired, but doing my best not to show it. Each time The Walkers huddled for a photo, or paused to strategize, I'd find a wall or concrete planter to lean against. The conversation drifted to a familiar subject, one that comes up on just about every walk they go on. But, I asked, aren't you adults now? But the old markers of adulthood – like full-time salaries, homes, families – are milestones they don't expect to reach anytime soon. “No roommates would be a sign of adulthood,” said Sebastian. (He, along with the rest of the group, said he doesn't expect ever to be able to buy a home.) Take coffee, for instance – which he doesn't drink, largely because it costs at least $3 a day. “Maybe once I have a salary that kind of money won't mean anything to me anymore,” he said. They're not sure those traditional markers of adulthood – like a stable income, or a mortgage – are worth giving up this moment of freedom and exploration for. “I want people to know that we're hard workers. “But we think about our parents and their lives, and see that taking the safe route doesn't always mean being fulfilled.” Ultimately, this difference in values is what makes The Walkers divisive. For spending all this time walking when instead they could be studying, or working. A few minutes after 3 p.m., Katie pointed to the next intersection. We had been walking by then for over six hours. There, at long last, was the sign for Finch Station. It was a group of birds – I can't say for sure how many, let's just say five – about to take flight. They watched together as the birds lifted off. And then they put their arms around each other. If walking is too sedate a sport for you, distance running is an increasingly popular way to work out. Last year, The Decibel's running club took stock of the changing sport with Ben Kaplan from iRun Magazine and Allison Hill of Hill Run Club.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 2019 statute signed into law by Trump himself requires furloughed workers to be compensated when shutdowns end. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. A new message to federal workers sent from several government agencies suggests that the Trump administration may not give back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, violating a statute that President Donald Trump himself signed into law six years ago. The message doesn't explicitly state that furloughed employees — those who have been told to stop working during the federal shutdown but will return to work once it ends — will not receive missed paychecks. However, it omits them when discussing how excepted employees (those currently working without pay) will be compensated. “Once an appropriation or continuing resolution is enacted, excepted employees are entitled to receive payment,” a sentence in the message reads. According to federal workers from several agencies who received that message, it did not include the sentence regarding how excepted employees in particular would be paid. As of Tuesday night, the shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history, with no compromise between Democrats and Republicans on a continuing resolution in sight. Failing to pay workers their missed wages would be a violation of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA), which states that furloughed workers “shall be paid” compensation that would have been owed to them had the shutdown not occurred. While the Trump White House is signaling that it may attempt to withhold these payments, it was Trump himself who signed GEFTA into law, in 2019 during the last government shutdown. That legislation was signed into law — and there is nothing this administration can do to change that,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said in reaction to reporting on the draft memo in early October. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KitKat, affectionately known as ‘mayor of 16th Street', was struck and killed by a Waymo in the city's Mission District Now local politicians and community leaders are harnessing momentum to put new limits on the fast-spreading autonomous vehicle industry. In a recent podcast interview, Daniel Zeidan, part of the family that owns Randa's, described KitKat as unequivocally adored. “He would walk down there, stare up at the employees and wait for them to throw chicken at him … He really ran the block.” But on 27 October, KitKat was struck by a Waymo autonomous vehicle, which in recent years has become a ubiquitous sight around the city. “While our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,” a company spokesperson said. Tributes have poured in across social media for KitKat, who could often be found curled up behind the counter at Randa's, or strolling into the nearby Dalva bar to receive a royal reception. Jackie Fielder, a San Francisco city supervisor, said she plans to introduce legislation that would allow counties to decide whether they will permit the operation of autonomous vehicles, and is calling upon the California legislature to consider doing the same. “We are absolutely coming for your bottom dollar,” Fielder said of Waymo in a Tuesday press conference held outside of Randa's Market. Speakers included local politicians, union leaders and transit advocates, who touched on fears of job replacement via AI and the loss of local political control against tech companies. Justin Dolezal, a local bar owner and head of a small business coalition, also spoke about KitKat's role in the community, and in favor of the resolution. KitKat's death is the latest swell in waves of anti-AI sentiment and concerns over autonomous vehicles, although others point to data showing a firm safety record. While Waymo says it operates around 1,500 cars across the US, exact numbers for San Francisco's fleet are unclear. Cruise, another autonomous taxi company, agreed last year to shell out more than $8m in 2024 to a Bay Area woman who was dragged over 20ft of pavement by an autonomous vehicle. Questions have also arisen over how to ticket and discipline autonomous vehicles when they violate traffic laws. “We send our deepest sympathies to the cat's owner and the community who knew and loved him, and we have made a donation to a local animal rights organization in his honor,” the statement said. As politicians push for change, some have taken upon themselves to honor KitKat in distinctly Silicon Valley-style ways. Zeidan has released a memecoin honoring KitKat's legacy, and also said that he was disappointed to see others launch their own imitation tokens in an attempt to profit off KitKat's death.</p>

Before Kimmel's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that Snap benefits would “be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government” and that the benefits “were haphazardly ‘handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP”. “You know, throwing a party at your private golf club where the theme is rich white people hours before millions of Americans are set to lose their food assistance might be the Trumpiest Trump move of all time,” Kimmel said Monday night. Meanwhile, Kimmel's popularity has soared and reportedly surpassed Trump's following a dispute with the administration that led to his show being briefly taken off the air in September, according to a recent survey. Brendan Carr, Federal Communications Commission chair and a Trump ally, allegedly threatened to revoke ABC affiliates' licenses unless the network acted against Kimmel. The decision sparked protests, debates about free speech, and boycotts targeting Disney, ABC's parent company.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A big pattern change is on the way for the United States with a blast of Arctic air set to bring a first taste of winter to millions. It all starts this weekend as a cold front allows December-like air from near the North Pole to start spreading into the northern US. This front will push farther south and east through the weekend, and temperatures could drop 10 to 15 degrees below normal almost everywhere east of the Rockies by Sunday night. Here's how this chilly change-up will play out. Parts of the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest will be first in line for plummeting temperatures starting Saturday. This temperature drop could also be accompanied by a wintry mix for some. Minneapolis will likely have a near-normal high temperature in the mid to upper 40s on Friday, but will barely hit the upper 30s by Saturday. A mix of rain and snow is possible throughout Saturday. The city usually has its first measurable snow — defined as at least 0.1 inches — by November 3, but that has not happened yet and it isn't likely to Saturday. December-like chill will expand into much more of the country on Sunday. Temperatures could end up 15 degrees below average for much of the Plains, Midwest and portions of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The high temperature in Chicago will likely struggle to reach around 40 degrees Sunday, which is 10 degrees colder than normal. St. Louis will also be 10 degrees colder than it should be with a high in the mid-40s. A normal early November high for the city is about 50 degrees. Nashville, Tennessee, will likely have a high in the mid 40s on Monday, after temperatures drop below freezing early in the morning. Monday will also feature a dramatic temperature drop for Atlanta. Sunday's high in the city is expected to be around 70 degrees, but temperatures will struggle to reach 50 degrees on Monday. Temperatures could tumble to near-freezing by Tuesday morning, which could end up being Atlanta's coldest morning since February. Much of the East will remain quite chilly on Tuesday. It's likely to be the coldest day of the stretch for Washington, DC, and New York City. This cold snap won't stick around long though: Temperatures in much of the central US will quickly rebound to near or even above normal on Tuesday and most of the East will follow suit on Wednesday. The blast of Arctic air could set up some places to get their first measurable snow event of the year, but exactly where – and how much – is still coming into focus. Some snow could accumulate in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York through Monday night. It's looking less likely than the chances for lake-effect snow, but still bears watching in the coming days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia and China agree to deepen cooperation in trade and energy; Washington struggles for influence over Kiev and its allies as it tries to steer conflict with Russia to an end; and the United States proposes creating an international security force in Gaza to facilitate demilitarization. In Beijing, Mishustin was also received by Chinese President Xi Jinping. During their meeting, the sides agreed to create conditions to attract investment, provide each other with firm mutual support, and deepen cooperation in high-tech sectors. "Such meetings make it possible to touch base, synchronize positions and discuss the most pressing issues, serving as an additional communication channel between national leaders," Junior Research Fellow at the Sector of Economy and Politics of China of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Andrey Fedotov told Izvestia. Notably, the Russian prime minister's visit took place after negotiations between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. In 2024, China imported approximately 213 mln metric tons of oil and 246 bln cubic meters of natural gas from Russia - 1.8% and 6.2% higher, respectively, than the previous year. During Vladimir Putin's visit to China on September 2, 2025, Russia's Gazprom and China's CNPC signed a legally binding memorandum on the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline through Mongolia. At existing fields alone, Gazprom can produce around 100 bln cubic meters, and additional volumes have become available due to reduced supplies to the EU. On the day when the European "coalition of the willing" convened in Madrid, where discussion was expected to include a 12-point peace plan prepared jointly with Ukraine, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker arrived in Kiev. During his meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, he posited that the only viable scenario for resolving the military conflict with Russia would be one led by US President Donald Trump. Zelensky himself stated the day before that he had not seen a finalized plan from Europe, even though he and European leaders had just recently outlined its key points. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue that Washington may be seeking to ease escalation after Russia's recent strategic weapons tests, but acknowledge that it lacks leverage over both Kiev and its European allies. According to the newspaper, since his inauguration on January 20, Donald Trump has periodically signaled a willingness to take into account the considerations of Russian negotiators regarding the outlines of a peace deal. Russia's position is and always has been that an immediate ceasefire would merely allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to regroup and maneuver, creating the risk of renewed hostilities. However, the US president has subsequently once again declared an immediate ceasefire to be a necessary move. At the same time, on October 22, the US Treasury announced new sanctions against two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Meanwhile, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker stated in an interview in recent days that he had discussed additional options for exerting pressure on Russia during a meeting with CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Commenting on these divergent statements for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts of the Peoples' Friendship University, suggested that Russian President Putin's recent announcement about successful tests of the unlimited-range Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater vehicle likely had an impact on Washington's thinking. Given their characteristics, both developments could pose a direct threat to the United States. Yet, any step toward Moscow would be depicted in Western media as a concession and a sign of personal weakness on Trump's part - an outcome that doesn't mesh with his political agenda. In addition, Semibratov continued, the current US administration may lack sufficient leverage to influence either Western globalist circles as a whole, including the United Kingdom, or Zelensky himself. However, attempts to advance new initiatives that disregard Russia's security conditions will only further accelerate escalation. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that while Washington seeks a multinational force to disarm Hamas, Israel currently has no incentive to accept such a plan, and disarmament remains impossible without progress toward Palestinian statehood, which remains unlikely. It remains unclear which nations will contribute troops to the ISF, Vedomosti writes. Potential participants may include military personnel from Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Turkey under the overall command of Egypt, The Guardian reported. The Israeli news portal Ynet suggested that military personnel from Indonesia, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan may be involved. "Trump is counting on Ankara's assistance to implement his strategy. But Israel has already secured the release of hostages and therefore has no incentive to comply with the American plan. Otherwise, it risks a political crisis for Netanyahu's cabinet. For their part, the Americans have no incentive to pressure their Israeli allies so long as the region remains relatively stable," he said. According to Hasanov, Hamas is interested in the deployment of peacekeepers only insofar as it hampers Israeli occupation of territory. Arab countries are seeking to play a more integral role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Head of the Mission of the League of Arab States (LAS) in Russia Valid Hamid Shiltag told Izvestia. He noted that Arab nations view their interaction with the SCO positively and are already participating in its meetings. Closer engagement would strengthen the organization's potential as one of the key centers of global development and would provide Russia with new avenues for growth. Arab states could play a more visible role in the SCO, Shiltag said. According to him, expanding cooperation with the organization creates new opportunities for the region in international diplomacy and economic development. Some countries are already participating in meetings, and there are states that would also like to become part of these associations," the diplomat emphasized. "Many countries express a desire to take part in order to expand their economic ties, and in this sphere, there are no rigid boundaries between countries. Arab states believe they will fit naturally into the organization's economic mechanisms and complement its existing cooperation formats. Today, the SCO covers about 60% of Eurasian territory, and more than 3.4 bln people live in its member nations - nearly half of the world's population. This scale makes the organization quite attractive for Middle East countries, Izvestia writes. Strengthening ties between the SCO and the Arab world goes beyond symbolic gestures and is developing into a strategic path reflecting a broader trend toward a multipolar world order, Saudi political analyst Mubarak Al-Aati told the newspaper. "An organization that includes a quarter of the global economy and more than half of the world's population provides Middle Eastern states with opportunities to enhance national security, expand economic ties, and make room for foreign-policy maneuver. The new US sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil did not have a substantial impact on the volume of Russian oil exports in October. Month-on-month, seaborne shipments declined by 1.2%, but longer delivery chains and widening discounts were observed. The sanctions could potentially have a greater impact after November 21, when the waivers for transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil expire, Kommersant writes. Seaborne exports of Russian oil in October decreased month-on-month by 1.2% to 470,000 metric tons per day, according to a review by the Center for Price Indices. The share of destinations listed as "unknown" amounted to 5%. Maritime shipments of Russian oil to China declined by 7.5% in October, to 159,000 metric tons per day, with ESPO making up about 98% of volumes and Urals comprising the remainder, the Center for Price Indices noted. Analysts do not view this decline in deliveries as critical, pointing out that in September there were two weeks of record shipments to China - 171,000 metric tons per day. However, according to market participants cited by the Center for Price Indices, Turkish buyers have already begun searching for alternative suppliers due to the expanded list of Russian oil companies subject to US restrictions after Rosneft and Lukoil were added to the SDN List. Kirill Bakhtin, Head of the Russian Equities Center at BCS World of Investments, told Kommersant that companies had sufficient time to prepare and develop alternative supply schemes. He said that purchases of Russian oil continue, but increasingly through intermediaries. The Center for Price Indices expects average Brent crude prices to decline from $69 per barrel in 2025 to $64 per barrel the following year, due to rising production by OPEC+ countries outpacing the growth in global demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘And so it begins,' president says after Zohran Mamdani elected city's first Muslim mayor New York elected its first Muslim mayor, setting up a clash with Donald Trump and giving hope to divided Democrats. In his victory speech, the 34-year-old declared: “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. “And if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. Mr Mamdani was propelled from fringe candidate to frontrunner through a slick social media campaign centred on affordability in one of the world's most expensive cities. He will become the city's youngest mayor in more than a century, having vowed to freeze rents in rent-controlled homes and raise taxes on the city's wealthiest residents. The US president has repeatedly labelled Mr Mamdani a “communist” and threatened to cut off federal funding to New York City in the event of his election. “It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,” Mr Trump said on Sunday. Republicans could view Mr Mamdani's victory as a gift before next year's mid-term elections, as the socialist mayor will probably be portrayed as a caricature of the ultra-progressive Left to scare moderate and undecided voters away from the Democrats. Referring to Mr Cuomo, whose father Mario is also a former New York governor, Mr Mamdani added: “My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty. I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life but let tonight be the final time I utter his name”. “New York will remain a city of immigrants, built by immigrants and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” Mr Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, said. And I refuse to apologise for either,” he added, receiving applause. Concluding his speech, Mr Mamdani was joined on stage by his wife Rama Duwaji, 28, a Syrian-American illustrator who has largely kept her distance from her husband's campaign. Mr Mamdani recognised Israel's right to exist, but not as a Jewish state and previously vowed to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israel prime minister, if he set foot in New York. More than 1,100 rabbis across the country signed a letter accusing Mr Mamdani of exacerbating “hostility towards Judaism and Jews”. During his speech, Mr Mamdani appeared to take a swipe at the personal attacks he had endured. “No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election,” he said. Sir Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, who spoke with the socialist following his primary win in June, congratulated Mr Mamdani on his “historic campaign”. From Jan 1, Mr Mamdani will be responsible for a $115bn (£88bn) budget and 8.5 million people as he takes on one of the most difficult jobs in US politics. When his victory was called, Lex Rountree, a 27-year-old tenant organiser who had volunteered for the campaign since the start, burst into tears. “People are dying for change and the establishment needs to wake up.” While Mr Mamdani received phone calls from Democrats, including Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, despite some of the party's senior figures refraining from endorsing his campaign. Mr Jeffries said: “Democrats are smoking Donald Trump and Republican extremists throughout the country. Mr Trump, who is from New York, made an intervention in the election to try and keep Mr Mamdani out of Gracie Mansion. There were also calls for Mr Sliwa to quit the ballot, but the Republican refused, claiming politicians and billionaires do not choose who becomes mayor. In California, a Democratic plan to redraw congressional districts was voted through, marking a big win for another of Mr Trump's foes, Gavin Newsom, the state's governor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SERGEY VAKULENKO is a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. Why Ukraine's Campaign Against Moscow's Energy Sector Is Working After all, Russia is an oil-rich country whose energy infrastructure is far from the frontlines; for most of the war, it has been Ukraine, not Russia, whose energy grid has been in the line of fire. Yet since August, when Ukraine began a concerted campaign to strike oil refineries deep inside Russia, fuel shortages have come to preoccupy Russians. By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's 38 major refineries at least once. As a result, Russia went from processing about 5.4 million barrels of oil per day in July to processing roughly 5 million barrels per day in September. Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel. By late October, additional strikes, including at refineries in Ryazan and Saratov, further underscored the reach of Ukraine's campaign. With such results, it may be tempting to conclude that Ukraine is on the verge of breaking Russia's oil industry. For the time being, the Russian refining sector still has enough resilience, because of both its substantial surplus capacity as the world's third-largest refining system and its ability to repair damaged units quickly. Although the units used to distill crude oil can be repaired relatively easily after every attack, they erode after the repeated cycles of heating and cooling caused by strikes. And as Russia's oil industry grows more reliant on government interventions for crisis management, the energy sector will become state managed and less efficient. In truth, the real damage caused by Ukraine's campaign is cumulative and institutional, not physical. Even as it strives to preserve short-term stability, Russia is presiding over the acceleration of long-term decline. Russia also exports on average two million barrels per day of oil products. Under ordinary circumstances the system has a fairly large cushion built in, even though fuel supplies can be constrained occasionally during periods of peak seasonal demand. For one thing, the Russian fuel market gets stretched every summer by a combination of high agricultural demand, high rates of driving, and refineries shutting down for annual maintenance. This summer, demand was heightened further because more Russians traveled by car to avoid flight cancellations and train delays that were caused by Ukrainian drone attacks on transport infrastructure. Its main mechanism, known as the “price damper,” is a subsidy that compensates refiners when domestic fuel prices fall below export parity. But as the government has become pressed for funds, it has increasingly shifted the burden of subsidies to manufacturers and retailers, using threats to keep the market supplied, as often happens under rigid price controls. At times of low profitability, the biggest oil companies keep their own gas stations supplied with fuel but sell as little as possible to independent retailers. Independent stations and small retail networks make up almost 70 percent of the Russian retail fuel market but move less than a quarter of the fuel supply. They nevertheless play an important role by bringing fuel to motorists in less affluent and sparsely populated areas. In 2023 and 2024, Ukraine rarely attempted to target energy infrastructure deep inside Russia, and when it did, it did not target the same refinery repeatedly. Throughout this period, only a few refineries within 250 miles of Ukrainian-controlled territory were hit regularly. Now, Ukrainian strikes can reach as far as Tyumen in Siberia—1,360 miles away—and Ukraine has been targeting many refineries across western Russia on a recurring basis. It has been hit no fewer than five times in two months, with the latest attack coming just days after Russian repairs brought it back on line. Although these repeated attacks cannot destroy a refinery, they can keep it constantly in need of repair, stretching spare-parts supply chains that are already constrained by sanctions. Since August, especially, Ukrainian drone attacks have become more successful, thanks, in part, to U.S. intelligence. Ukraine now has both the capacity and the confidence to regularly launch large-scale drone swarms at multiple targets across Russia—successfully overwhelming Russian air defenses. One or two refineries are responsible for serving a large area (usually made up of several oblasts and millions of people); when one is down, shortages ripple quickly across adjacent areas. And if neighboring refineries get hit simultaneously, these problems invariably snowball. As with other aspects of the war, the battle over energy infrastructure can be won only by a carefully calculated war of attrition. No single strike will kill the system, but a sustained, up-tempo campaign increases the likelihood of cascading failures, longer repairs, and compounding losses of capacity. Unless Moscow makes a breakthrough in antidrone defenses, something neither side has achieved since the full-scale war began, Ukraine's efforts will continue to inflict damage. In this sense, the overall outcome will depend on a series of shifting variables. In any given operation, most attacking drones will be shot down. Their purpose is to saturate the air defense system; for a single attack to be effective, dozens, perhaps hundreds, of drones must be launched, each carrying at least 110 pounds of payload. Just as Ukraine has been forced to do in protecting its cities and infrastructure from Russian bombardment, Russia cannot provide enough cover for all refinery targets and must choose which to protect. Meanwhile the attacker can switch targets at will. Refineries are adding improvised overhead netting and shielding, for instance. In 2023 and 2024, Ukraine could barely keep pace repairing the damage as Russia inflicted it. Now, as Russia's offensive capacities have only grown, this has become an unwinnable race. In theory, this could force an informal mutual moratorium on energy strikes, since they come at high cost to both sides. But so far, the result has only been escalation. For Ukraine, attacking refineries is also a particularly effective way to target Russia. Attacks on pipelines, fuel storage facilities, and railroads have had more transient effects: they generally can be returned to operation within days. In recent weeks, Ukraine has augmented its campaign with a more multipronged effort to hamper Russian oil exports. Ukraine now routinely attacks pumping stations on pipelines that lead to export outlets. It has also expanded the scope of its attacks to third parties involved in Russia's energy trade. On November 2, for example, Ukrainian drones attacked Russia's Black Sea port of Tuapse, damaging a Turkish tanker. There have also been several sabotage incidents against non-Russian ships carrying Russian crude, likely caused by limpet mines, although Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for these. Militarily, they aim to impose costs and uncertainty on Russia's export logistics. Strategically, they are meant to dissuade third parties—ship owners, insurers, and traders—from doing business with Russia. But for its part, Russia has also found additional targets. Until 2025, Ukraine transited Russian gas to European buyers, and as an informal part of the deal, Russia refrained from attacking Ukrainian gas production and pipelines. Now this arrangement is off, and in October, Russia launched a series of massive drone and missile strikes that knocked out 60 percent of Ukraine's domestic gas production during a crucial period ahead of the winter. Fuel shortages and retail price spikes have largely been confined to particular regions—mainly southern Russia, the far east of the country, and Crimea. The Kremlin responded by imposing temporary gasoline export bans and partial diesel restrictions. Although they may prevent immediate chaos, these moves are undermining the oil sector's long-term adaptability. Yet it can recover much of the lost revenue by simply exporting the crude that would otherwise have been refined in Russia. For companies, however, the losses from selling low-priced crude instead of refined oil products can reach $10 per barrel or more. Moreover, on October 23, the United States announced new sanctions aimed against key oil companies, including Lukoil and Rosneft; these measures are likely to put temporary pressure on Russian crude exports, compounding the strain on the country's oil sector. Such interventions are costly and keep demand artificially high, but not doing them risks lower approval ratings and eroding public trust in Russia's stability. For now, Russia retains enough redundancy and repair capacity to keep the system afloat. Thus far, Moscow's response to the supply crunch has been remarkably consistent: contain, control, and compensate. Russian refiners must now operate with little market autonomy; many are postponing investment decisions “until after the war.” Refineries are still running, but with deferred maintenance, rushed emergency repairs, and a mounting backlog of safety and efficiency issues. The result is not collapse, but quiet degradation. Three variables will make a difference in the long-term fate of Russia's oil industry. Equally important is Russia's repair capacity, or how quickly damaged units can be restored and whether spare-parts shortages become binding. Finally, the third variable is oil prices and OPEC+ policy: a drop in prices, for example, would test Russia's ability to sustain both subsidies and military spending simultaneously. If its refining capacity is further constrained, Russia can also fall back on lower fuel-quality standards, increasing the supply of naptha-derived gasoline and high-sulfur diesel. Such moves could help alleviate shortages at the expense of air quality and engine longevity. But by forcing Moscow into constant firefighting—whether putting out actual refinery fires or preventing a second-order economic conflagration—these attacks ensure that Russia will have to pay an ever higher cost to maintain stability. What Ukraine's campaign has exposed about Russia is really a deeper vulnerability: an energy superpower whose strength lies in infrastructure built decades ago, maintained through improvisation, and preserved by command rather than innovation. In the end, Russia's refineries are most likely to wear out under the weight of repeated shocks and institutional sclerosis—a quiet but telling metaphor for Russia's war economy itself.

Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, marking a historic win for the left over a high-powered, moneyed coalition of establishment forces that came together in hopes of defeating him. More than 2 million people voted before polls closed on Tuesday night — a level of turnout the city's mayoral election has not seen since 1969. Mamdani, slated to be inaugurated on January 1, is one of just a handful of self-proclaimed socialists to win the mayoral election in New York City. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. He also received the backing of some of the country's most popular politicians, like fellow democratic socialists Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York). In fact, a traditional campaign likely couldn't achieve the things the Mamdani campaign did — like go from polling at 1 percent in February to pulling out a significant win against an established politician, much less scoring such a victory while billionaires, Republicans, and plenty of mainstream Democrats banded against him. Mamdani's platform mobilized a huge number of supporters, with the campaign saying it surpassed 3 million doors knocked by Election Day. All the while, the Mamdani campaign weathered attacks from all angles — including persistent racism and Islamophobia leveraged against him from Democrats and Republicans alike. Major outlets from the New York Post to The New York Times ran hit pieces on subjects like his racial identity and, countless times, his stance on Palestinian and human rights. Democratic leaders — including New York's own Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — broke with party tradition and refused to endorse him. Billionaires and other deep-pocketed donors gave $40 million to pro-Cuomo, anti-Mamdani super PACs. Mamdani confronted these challenges head on, often in ways that subverted typical campaign practices. When Cuomo was endorsed by Trump, his campaign touted it in a tongue-in-cheek post on social media, saying, “Congratulations, @AndrewCuomo. He directly addressed Muslim New Yorkers in the wake of hateful rhetoric from his competitors and current Mayor Eric Adams, noting that he pledged to fight for the safety and security of all New Yorkers. Many Muslims said that these words spoke deeply to the community, which has faced violent hatred, especially after 9/11. “And yet, for too long, we have been told to ask for less than that and to be satisfied with whatever little we receive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UN, November 5. The United States has proposed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution that would lift sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, Reuters news agency, which saw the document, reported. The draft resolution would also lift sanctions on Syria's Interior Minister Anas Khattab. It was not immediately clear when it could be put to a vote. A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the U.S., France or Britain to be adopted. On November 1, the Axios portal reported that al-Sharaa, during a visit to Washington, is expected to sign documents on Syria's entry into the international coalition led by the United States to combat the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia). On May 14, Trump held talks with al-Sharaa in Riyadh and said that Washington will begin lifting sanctions that have been imposed on Damascus for decades. On July 1, he abolished unilateral restrictions against Syria. On October 15, al-Sharaa paid a working visit to Russia, during which he had his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin. During the 2.5 hour-negotiations, the politician talked about the desire of Damascus to "restart" relations with Moscow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian city of Oryol came under attack overnight on Nov. 5, according to local residents, Russian media, and the regional governor. Residents said they heard multiple explosions in Oryol and posted footage of the attack to social media, the Telegram news channel Astra reported. According to locals, it sounded like the city was being attacked by missiles. Footage posted by residents was filmed roughly 1 to 1.5 kilometers from the Oryol thermal plant. In the videos, there are no sounds of an air raid warning, no noise from air defense systems, and no characteristic buzzing of a drone,” Astra's OSINT analyst claimed. Oryol Oblast Governor Andrey Klychkov claimed that Ukrainian drones were targeting the region and that Russian air defense units destroyed the UAVs. Debris from the intercepted drones damaged homes and an outbuilding, he said. Drones also struck energy infrastructure near the city of Vladimir, Astra reported. All essential systems are operating normally," regional Governor Alexander Avdeyev said. Less than a week earlier, the Ukrainian Navy said it struck the Oryol Thermal Power Plant (TPP) with domestically produced Neptune cruise missiles.

While the site was primarily created to demonstrate the transparency of Ukraine's drone units, it also carries a subtle element of gamification. Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on Nov. 2 that the strike would have "long-term consequences" for Russia. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Nov. 5 that Russia should begin immediate preparations to conduct full-scale nuclear tests. Norway will provide Ukraine with $7 billion in 2026 to support its defense sector, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on X on Nov. 5. A transport-loading vehicle for Russia's Iskander ballistic missile system was destroyed on Nov. 4 in the Kursk region, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) confirmed on Nov. 5. It is the first time Brussels Airport has closed due to drone activity. More drones were also spotted near Belgium's Kleine Brogel Air Base, which houses F-16 fighter jets. The suspect demands respect for his "fundamental rights, including the right to adequate food, a healthy environment, dignified detention conditions, and equal treatment with other prisoners regarding family visits and access to information," his lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Lukoil oil refinery in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast was hit by Ukrainian drones overnight on Nov. 4, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. The refinery was reportedly struck while undergoing repairs to a rectification column used for primary oil processing. Lukoil Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez is one of Russia's largest oil refineries, supplying fuel to the Moscow region, which accounts for about 30% of the country's gasoline consumption. The refinery's annual crude processing capacity is around 17 million tons, producing over 50 types of petroleum products, including automotive, aviation, and diesel fuels, as well as bitumen and paraffin. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces also confirmed a reported strike on a petrochemical plant in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan. Explosions were reported overnight at a petrochemical plant in Sterlitamak, Bashkortostan. "All emergency services are currently at the scene. Earlier on Nov. 4, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had downed 85 drones across multiple regions, including Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh, Belgorod, Kursk, Lipetsk, Volgograd, Sverdlovsk, and the Republic of Bashkortostan. In Russia's Volgograd Oblast, an electrical substation was damaged due to falling drone debris, Governor Andrey Bocharov claimed. Overnight on Nov. 3, Alexander Khinshtein, the Governor of Kursk region, said that a substation in the city of Rylsk was attacked. As a result, more than 16,000 consumers in various areas were left without power. A drone attack was also reported in the city of Dovzhansk, Luhansk Oblast. The city is located about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the city of Luhansk and has been occupied by Russian forces since 2014. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia's war machine. Ukraine regularly strikes military targets in its occupied territories and deep within Russia as Moscow continues to wage its war against Ukraine. While the site was primarily created to demonstrate the transparency of Ukraine's drone units, it also carries a subtle element of gamification. Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on Nov. 2 that the strike would have "long-term consequences" for Russia.
