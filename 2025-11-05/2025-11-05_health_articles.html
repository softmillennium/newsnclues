                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Led by Monash University and the University of Melbourne, and published in Nature Communications, the study reveals how rabies virus manipulates so many cellular processes despite being armed with only a few proteins. Researchers believe other dangerous viruses like Nipah and Ebola may also work the same way, possibly enabling the development of antivirals or vaccines to block these actions. Co-senior author Associate Professor Greg Moseley, head of the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute's (BDI) Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory, said the ability of viruses to "do so much with so little" was perhaps their most remarkable skill. "Viruses such as rabies can be incredibly lethal because they take control of many aspects of life inside the cells they infect," Associate Professor Moseley said. "A major question for scientists has been: how do viruses achieve this with so few genes? Rabies virus, for example, has the genetic material to make only five proteins, compared with about 20,000 in a human cell." Co-first author and Moseley Lab research fellow Dr. Stephen Rawlinson, of the BDI's Moseley Lab, said understanding how these few viral proteins performed so many tasks could unlock new ways to stop infection. "RNA is the same molecule used in new-generation RNA vaccines, but it plays essential roles inside our cells, carrying genetic messages, coordinating immune responses, and helping make the building blocks of life." This allows it to infiltrate many of the cell's liquid-like compartments, take control of vital processes, and turn the cell into a highly efficient virus factory. Although this study focused on rabies, the same strategy is likely used by other dangerous viruses such as Nipah and Ebola. Dr Rawlinson said the study should change how scientists think about multifunctional viral proteins. "Until now, these proteins were often viewed like trains made up of several carriages, with each carriage (or module) responsible for a specific task," he said. "According to this view, shorter versions of a protein should simply lose functions as carriages are removed. However, this simple model could not explain why some shorter viral proteins actually gain new abilities. "In doing so, it can access and manipulate many of the cell's own liquid-like compartments that control key processes, such as immune defence and protein production," he said. "By revealing this new mechanism, our study provides a fresh way of thinking about how viruses use their limited genetic material to create proteins that are flexible, adaptable, and able to take control of complex cellular systems." Conformational dynamics, RNA binding, and phase separation regulate the multifunctionality of rabies virus P protein.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study from Houston Methodist sheds light on how Alzheimer's disease may contribute to larger health issues by hijacking the body's ability to regulate its metabolism. Researchers have discovered that along with the negative effects an Alzheimer's diagnosis brings, the disease can also sabotage messages between nerves and blood vessels in fat tissue, which can worsen heart and metabolic conditions such as stroke, heart disease and diabetes. The first-of-its-kind research, "Alzheimer's disease disrupts intra-adipose neurovascular contact," appears in the Journal of Lipid Research and highlights a previously underexplored aspect of Alzheimer's: its potential to cause dysfunction of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system extending beyond the brain. Led by Stephen Wong, Ph.D., the John S. Dunn Presidential Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Engineering, the study was conducted by his team at Houston Methodist, including key contributors Li Yang, Ph.D., a research associate, and Jianting Sheng, Ph.D., an assistant research professor of computational biology and mathematics in radiology. Utilizing three-dimensional imaging and focusing on body fat in mouse models, the study's high-resolution images provide a groundbreaking visual perspective revealing how the disease changes the structure of nerve and blood vessel bundles. These include the sympathetic nerves and blood vessels which play a critical role in regulating fat metabolism through hormonal and neural signaling. This disturbance could help explain why individuals with Alzheimer's often experience issues such as stroke, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and other health troubles alongside cognitive decline. "These insights open new avenues for research into how treating or preventing autonomic dysfunction might improve overall health outcomes for people with Alzheimer's," said Wong and Sheng.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Osaka Metropolitan University team has used stem cells extracted from adipose, the body's fatty tissue, to treat spine fractures in rats similar to those caused by osteoporosis in humans. These cells offer the advantages of being easy to collect, even from elderly individuals, and causing little stress to the body, suggesting a non-invasive way of treating bone diseases. Among osteoporosis-related fractures, compression fractures of the spine, known as osteoporotic vertebral fractures, are the most common type of fracture and pose a serious problem, leading to a need for long-term care and a significant decline in quality of life. Stem cells taken from adipose tissue (ADSCs) are a possible solution to this problem. These cells are multipotent, meaning that they can be differentiated into many different cell types. An Osaka Metropolitan University-led research team involving Graduate School of Medicine student Yuta Sawada and Dr. Shinji Takahashi focused on ADSCs for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The ADSCs were developed into bone-differentiated spheroids and combined with β-tricalcium phosphate, a material widely used for bone reconstruction, to successfully treat rats with spinal fractures. Bone regeneration and strength were significantly improved in rats transplanted with the complex. This study has revealed the potential of bone differentiation spheroids using ADSCs for the development of new treatments for spinal fractures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A commonly prescribed antibiotic could help reduce the risk of some young people developing schizophrenia, new research suggests. Experts found that patients of adolescent mental health services who were treated with the antibiotic doxycycline were significantly less likely to go on to develop schizophrenia in adulthood compared with patients treated with other antibiotics. To better understand potential ways of preventing the condition, researchers from the University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with the University of Oulu and University College Dublin, applied advanced statistical modelling to large-scale healthcare register data from Finland. The team analyzed data from more than 56,000 adolescents attending mental health services who had been prescribed antibiotics. They found that those treated with doxycycline had a 30–35 per cent lower risk of developing schizophrenia than peers who received other antibiotics. Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used to treat infections and acne. Previous studies suggest it can reduce inflammation in brain cells and influence synaptic pruning – a natural process where the brain refines its neural connections. Excessive pruning has been associated with the development of schizophrenia. Further analyses showed that the lower risk wasn't simply because the young people may have been treated for acne rather than having infections, and was unlikely to be explained by other hidden differences between the groups. As many as half of the people who develop schizophrenia had previously attended child and adolescent mental health services for other mental health problems. At present, though, we don't have any interventions that are known to reduce the risk of going on to develop schizophrenia in these young people. Because the study was observational in nature and not a randomised controlled trial, it means we can't draw firm conclusions on causality, but this is an important signal to further investigate the protective effect of doxycycline and other anti-inflammatory treatments in adolescent psychiatry patients as a way to potentially reduce the risk of developing severe mental illness in adulthood."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rates of bloodstream infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria will increase substantially across Europe in the next five years, driven largely by aging populations, according to a new paper published November 4th in the open-access journal PLOS Medicine by Gwenan Knight of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, and colleagues. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health crisis. To effectively target interventions and track progress toward international goals, accurately estimating how the AMR burden will change over time is necessary. In the new study, researchers analyzed data from more than 12 million routine blood tests for bacterial infection susceptibility in 29 European countries between 2010 and 2019. They used these data to generate incidence rates of these infections and predict how rates of drug-resistant bloodstream infections may change through 2050, accounting for projected population changes. Rates are expected to rise more in men than women across six of the eight bacteria studied, and are projected to increase more dramatically in older age groups (74+ years) while stabilizing or declining in younger populations. Models that don't account for age and sex may miss a large part of the future burden, especially among men and older adults, the authors note. Even with strong public health interventions, achieving a 10% reduction in resistant infections by 2030 (aligned with UN targets) was only possible for about two-thirds of bacteria-antibiotic combinations, the study concluded. Gwenan Knight adds, "Our study shows that the future burden of drug-resistant infections won't be uniform-there will be substantial differences between countries, as well as across age groups and between sexes. "What I found most interesting was bringing together different strands of data to show the bigger picture. Age and sex are still rarely considered in antimicrobial resistance projections, yet they make a real difference to who is most affected. Combining these factors with demographic and infection trends really highlighted how challenging it will be to reverse the steady rise in bloodstream infections across Europe." Waterlow, N.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These nanosalts activate anti-tumor immunity by inducing pyroptosis and metabolic intervention. The nanosalts induce ion endocytosis in tumor cells using a Trojan horse strategy, disrupting intracellular ion homeostasis, causing a surge in osmotic pressure, and ultimately triggering pyroptosis. Cesium ions (Cs+) can inhibit the ion channel activity of sodium/glucose cotransporters, hindering glucose transport. The introduction of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) not only amplifies pyroptosis but also initiates immunogenic ferroptosis. Nanosalts, as an important branch of excellent tumor therapeutic agents, deserve full recognition for their value. Nanosalts can bypass ion pumps/channels and enter cells via plasma membrane endocytosis. Due to their high water solubility, nanosalts gradually dissolve and release ions. When these ions accumulate to a certain concentration, they disrupt ion homeostasis. Cell swelling and cytoplasmic efflux release large amounts of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultimately triggering a strong inflammatory response that reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, causing its regression. Once recognized by phagocytosis-related receptors, DAMPs can promote antigen presentation, induce widespread immune cell infiltration, and activate anti-tumor immune responses. However, compared with other nanomaterials, the library of nanosalts is still not rich enough, and many soluble electrolytes have not yet been nanoscaled. Developing novel preparation strategies and expanding the library of nanosalts, especially nanosalts with ion-interference therapeutic functions, is particularly important for addressing the challenges of treating malignant tumors. In this study, the authors achieved the directed synthesis of cesium-based nanosalts and used cesium bromide nanosalts as a proof-of-concept to conduct research on pyroptosis-based tumor immunotherapy. The main highlights of this work include: 1) the development of a novel method for synthesizing cesium-based nanosalts, allowing for wide-range control of nanosalt size; 2) the nanosalts utilize a "Trojan horse" strategy to overcome ion channel barriers, delivering ions into the cell via endocytosis, inducing a surge in osmotic pressure and triggering pyroptosis, releasing DAMPs, and activating a systemic anti-tumor immune response; 3) Cs+ can interfere with the plasma membrane potential, inhibiting glucose uptake by affecting the function of sodium/glucose cotransporters, thereby disrupting tumor metabolic homeostasis; 4) the dietary nutrient DHA not only enhances the pyroptosis effect but also induces immunogenic ferroptosis, forming a dual synergistic therapeutic mechanism; and 5) the anti-tumor immune response of the nanosalts was systematically verified through in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating their significant ability to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis. Through liposome encapsulation technology, the pyroptosis inducer DHA was successfully loaded while simultaneously regulating the ion dissolution and release rate, forming a complete therapeutic system. Intracellularly released cesium ions interfere with the function of sodium-glucose cotransporters, inhibiting glucose uptake and thus disrupting metabolic balance. Under the synergistic effect of multiple pathways, a large amount of DAMPs are released, successfully activating the in vivo anti-tumor immune response. On the one hand, it promotes the maturation of lymph node dendritic cells, mediating downstream immune responses by regulating T cell proliferation; on the other hand, it drives a large infiltration of immune cells, effectively inhibiting tumor proliferation and metastasis. This study confirms that nanosalts are highly promising anti-tumor agents, and the development of next-generation nanosalts provides a reliable pathway for efficient tumor treatment.

Programs should be implemented to identify patients at risk so that we can better manage their chronic care and address health issues that put patients at higher risk of death." Saef Izzy, MD, FAAN, FNCS, corresponding author, neurologist, Department of Neurology at Mass General Brigham Izzy reported that patients with TSCI were returning to the clinics with conditions such as hypertension, stroke, depression and diabetes, but it was unclear how common these conditions were among people with TSCI. While more immediate complications from TSCI-such as difficulty breathing, uncontrolled blood pressure, and heart rate problems-are well known few studies have looked at long-term health consequences for these patients. With this in mind, researchers evaluated the long-term risk of cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions in patients with TSCI, comparing rates to a control group of people who had not sustained this type of injury. Using data from Mass General Brigham and the University of California (UC) Health System, the researchers analyzed hospital-based registries from January 1996 to January 2024. These data were used to compare outcomes with matched control subjects without spinal cord injury. TSCI was associated with an increased risk of death, even in previously healthy patients. This study relied on established medical codes to identify patient conditions. While there is a strong correlation between codes and new diagnoses, the authors note that they excluded patients with pre-existing conditions, which means their results may be more applicable to individuals who were healthier at the beginning of the study period. This could mean that the results underestimate how common chronic conditions are among patients who have had a TSCI. "These findings highlight the need for proactive and multidisciplinary long-term care strategies," Izzy said. "Future studies are needed to identify effective interventions to reduce the burden of chronic disease among patients who have had a TSCI."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research on human brain organoids (HBOs) is directly challenging how biobanks and biomedical institutes recruit volunteers. That is what a new study by Japanese researchers in Frontiers in Genetics concludes after finding that the Japanese public overwhelmingly rejects the common practice of broad consent when their donated cells could be used to create HBOs. This attitude jeopardizes recruitment and calls for an alternative form of consent that follows the project-specific consent model. Researchers can culture donor-derived cells in the laboratories to create three-dimensional, self-organizing structures that closely mimic human brain development. While they offer unprecedented insight into neurological diseases, the technology is not without ethical issues. HBOs are fraught with controversy, because it is believed with future research that they will develop the capacity to think and have consciousness. Currently, donors typically provide broad consent, agreeing to have their cells used for a wide range of future experiments, including those not possible at the time of donation.To test public attitudes towards HBO research, Sawai and his colleagues conducted a survey on HBOs recruiting over 300 Japanese residents. The public response suggested a need for change: nearly three-quarters of respondents expressing serious hesitation or outright refusal, with 36% outright refusing to donate their cells under broad consent and another 37% saying their willingness would depend on specific conditions, such as the purpose and ethical use of the cells. Only 15% were willing to give broad consent after learning about HBOs.An analysis of the reasons for this reluctance indicates that for morally complex areas of research, donors prioritize understanding the purpose, potential benefit, and ethical safeguards of the research, as well as the trustworthiness of researchers, before volunteering their cells. These findings are consistent with interviews and workshops on HBOs taken in European countries and the US, making this a global challenge for current practices in cell donation. To maintain public trust and a vital donor pool, the study concludes that organizations relying on volunteers offering cell samples should adopt project-specific consent for ethically sensitive research topics. "Importantly, it respects the moral view of the donor, which we believe is more likely to encourage donations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from Moffitt Cancer Center shows that RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibition can directly block tumor growth and activate the immune system, offering the first targeted approach for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer with limited treatment options beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors. Results from the study were published in Cancer Immunology Research. Unlike patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, who can benefit from multiple FDA-approved targeted therapy combinations, people with NRAS-mutant disease have no such options. Many either fail to respond or eventually develop resistance. For this group, once immunotherapy stops working, treatment options are extremely limited. That's why developing a targeted therapy for NRAS-mutant melanoma has been such an important and unmet need in the field. How does daraxonrasib (RMC-6236) or its preclinical counterpart RMC-7977 actually work inside the body? RAS proteins act as powerful molecular switches that drive cancer growth. By binding to active RAS proteins (NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS), these drugs block the downstream MAPK signaling pathway that fuels tumor growth. This not only causes cancer cells to stop dividing and die but also makes the tumor more visible to the immune system. It also reduced populations of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which normally help tumors evade the immune system. In laboratory experiments, when these T cells were depleted, the drug was no longer able to eliminate tumors. Were there any patients involved in this study, and if so, what kinds of results did they experience? One patient experienced a complete response, meaning no detectable tumor remained on scans, while the other had a partial response with significant tumor shrinkage. This is a landmark moment because it's the first evidence that an RAS inhibitor can work in this specific group of melanoma patients. If these early findings hold up in larger trials, this could represent the first targeted therapy ever developed for NRAS-mutant melanoma. What are the next steps before this therapy could be more widely available to patients? Daraxonrasib is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial, which primarily focuses on establishing safety, tolerability and optimal dosing. Once this phase is complete, the drug will need to move into phase 2 and 3 trials to evaluate its efficacy in larger, more diverse patient groups. If it demonstrates meaningful and durable benefit with manageable side effects, it could eventually lead to FDA approval and a new standard of care. But it's important to note that this process takes time, and these next stages will be essential for confirming the promise we're seeing now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As breast cancer survival rates continue to climb - 4.3 million women in the U.S. are currently living with a history of the disease and in the next 10 years that number is expected to rise by another million - heart health has become an increasingly important part of survivorship care. Certain breast cancer therapies, while lifesaving, can also place stress on the heart, raising important questions about who might benefit from closer monitoring. But does every breast cancer survivor need to see a cardiologist? A new editorial published in JAMA Oncology and led by UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center investigators Patricia Ganz, MD, a distinguished professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and Eric Yang, MD, director and founder of the UCLA Cardio-Oncology Program, says the answer is more nuanced than many might expect. "Current cardio-oncology guidelines recommend cardiac imaging during and immediately following systemic cancer therapies in breast cancer and other malignant neoplasms, but long-term surveillance with these approaches has not been evaluated and evidence-based guidelines are lacking," the UCLA authors write. Biomarker tests, such as B-type natriuretic peptide, show promise, but their usefulness in cancer survivors remains uncertain. Some breast cancer therapies, including anthracycline chemotherapy and HER2-targeted drugs like Herceptin (trastuzumab), are known to stress the heart in certain patients. For years, doctors have monitored patients during treatment to catch early signs of heart dysfunction. However, it's unclear how long survivors should continue to be monitored once treatment ends, and whether all survivors would benefit from seeing a cardiologist. In the editorial, Dr. Ganz and Dr. Yang evaluated a study that introduced a new tool to help pinpoint which breast cancer survivors face the highest chances of developing heart failure or cardiomyopathy in the decade following treatment. The team created a risk calculator using real-world clinical data from more than 26,000 breast cancer patients within an integrated health care system in Southern California. The findings revealed that while certain breast cancer treatments, including anthracycline chemotherapy and HER2-targeted drugs, did increase risk, most women do not go on to develop serious cardiac disease. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and a history of heart disease contributed more to a woman's long-term heart outlook than the chemotherapy regimen did. The authors also found that cancer treatment alone rarely pushed younger women into a high-risk category, with few women younger than 40 at the time of diagnosis at increased risk, suggesting that routine long-term cardiac imaging for all survivors may not be warranted. Women who may benefit from seeing a cardiologist include those who received higher-risk chemotherapy, developed heart issues during treatment, are older or have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, or report symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue or swelling. "What all breast cancer survivors need is access to primary care that focuses on prevention or management of established cardiac risk factors, as well as regular clinical assessment of their functioning," wrote Dr. Ganz and Dr. Yang.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings open new pathways for discoveries about mental illness, neurological disorders and other diseases related to defects in this part of the brain. The corpus callosum is critical for nearly everything the brain does, from coordinating the movement of our limbs in sync to integrating sights and sounds, to higher-order thinking and decision-making. Abnormalities in its shape and size have long been linked to disorders such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson's disease. Until now, the genetic underpinnings of this vital structure remained largely unknown. We developed an AI tool that finds the corpus callosum in different types of brain MRI scans and automatically takes its measurements." "These findings provide a genetic blueprint for one of the brain's most essential communication pathways," said Ravi R. Bhatt, PhD, co-first author of the study and a post-doctoral scholar at the Stevens INI's Imaging Genetics Center. "By uncovering how specific genes shape the corpus callosum and its subregions, we can start to understand why differences in this structure are linked to various mental health and neurological conditions at a molecular level." Several of the implicated genes are active during prenatal brain development, particularly in processes like cell growth, programmed cell death, and the wiring of nerve fibers across hemispheres. "This work demonstrates the power of using AI and large-scale databases to uncover the genetic factors driving brain development," said Neda Jahanshad, PhD, associate professor of neurology and senior author. "By linking genetics to brain structure, we gain critical insight into the biological pathways that may underlie psychiatric and neurological diseases." "These connections underscore that the same genetic factors shaping the brain's communication bridge may also contribute to vulnerabilities for certain disorders," Jahanshad added. "This study is a landmark in understanding how our brains are built. It not only sheds light on normal brain development but also helps us identify new avenues for diagnosing and potentially treating disorders that affect millions worldwide." The researchers have made their new AI-based tool publicly available to accelerate future discoveries. This approach allows scientists to analyze brain structure at an unprecedented scale and level of precision, reducing years of manual work to just hours. The Stevens INI has become a global leader in applying artificial intelligence to neuroscience, developing tools that are freely shared with the research community. By combining massive datasets with cutting-edge computational methods, the institute is transforming how scientists study brain health and disease. "By pioneering AI tools and making them widely available, we're empowering scientists around the world to unlock new discoveries about the brain far faster than ever before."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of Queensland researchers have captured the first high-resolution images of the yellow fever virus (YFV), a potentially deadly viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that affects the liver. Dr. Summa Bibby from UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience said despite decades of research on yellow fever, this was the first time a complete 3D structure of a fully mature yellow fever virus particle had been recorded at near-atomic resolution. By utilizing the well-established Binjari virus platform developed here at UQ, we combined yellow fever's structural genes with the backbone of the harmless Binjari virus and produced virus particles that could be safely examined with a cryo-electron microscope. Dr. Summa Bibby from UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience "The smooth vaccine particles keep those regions covered, making them harder for particular antibodies to reach." Yellow fever is a major public health concern in parts of South America and Africa and with no approved antiviral treatments, vaccination is the primary means of prevention. Professor Daniel Watterson said the discovery provides crucial new insights into yellow fever biology and opens the door to improved vaccine design and antiviral strategies for it and other orthoflaviviruses. "The findings could even inform future vaccine design for related viruses like dengue, Zika and West Nile." The research was published in Nature Communications. A single residue in the yellow fever virus envelope protein modulates virion architecture and antigenicity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was led by scientists at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and University College London, with support from the BHF Data Science Centre at Health Data Research UK. Our whole-population study during the pandemic showed that although these conditions were rare, children and young people were more likely to experience heart, vascular or inflammatory problems after a COVID-19 infection than after having the vaccine - and the risks after infection lasted much longer." The research team uncovered these findings by analyzing linked electronic health records (EHRs) for nearly 14 million children in England under the age of 18 between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2022, covering 98% of this population. During this period, 3.9 million children and young people had a first COVID-19 diagnosis. The study looked at short- and long-term risks of rare complications including arterial and venous thrombosis (clots in blood vessels), thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets in the blood), myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue respectively), and inflammatory conditions after COVID-19 diagnosis or vaccination. After a first COVID-19 diagnosis, risks of the five conditions studied were highest in the first four weeks and, for several conditions, stayed higher for up to 12 months, compared to children and young people without or before a diagnosis. Over six months, the research team estimated that COVID-19 infection led to 2.24 extra cases of myocarditis or pericarditis per 100,000 children and young people who had COVID-19. Previous research showed that children and young people diagnosed with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing conditions like myocarditis, pericarditis, and thrombocytopenia, compared to their peers who hadn't had a COVID-19 diagnosis. While many studies show that COVID-19 vaccines can help children to avoid severe illness and hospitalization, some also report rare cases of myocarditis in young people shortly after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for mRNA-based vaccines. However, there hasn't been any research directly comparing the longer-term risks of both COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccinations in children and young people until now. Co-author Professor Pia Hardelid, UCL and National Institute of Health and Care Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, said: "Parents and carers have faced difficult choices throughout the pandemic. By building a stronger evidence base on both infection and vaccination outcomes, we hope to support families and healthcare professionals to make decisions grounded in the best available data." Co-author Professor Angela Wood, University of Cambridge and Associate Director at the BHF Data Science Centre, said: Whilst vaccine-related risks are likely to remain rare and short-lived, future risks following infection could change as new variants emerge and immunity shifts. Co-author Professor William Whiteley, University of Edinburgh and Associate Director at the BHF Data Science Centre, said: "Parents, young people, and children need reliable information to make decisions about their health.
