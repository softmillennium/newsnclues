                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is creating a new internal mechanism for employees to report concerns about how its technology is developed and used — making the process similar to how workers already flag incidents of workplace misbehavior, security issues, or legal concerns. The new feature, called “Trusted Technology Review,” will allow employees to report information or concerns about potential policy violations. Smith said the company is also changing its processes to “strengthen our existing pre-contract review process for evaluating engagements that require additional human-rights due diligence.” Microsoft has faced repeated protests from employees and activists, including a group called No Azure for Apartheid, which has accused Microsoft of enabling human-rights abuses through its cloud and artificial-intelligence services. In September, the company confirmed it had found evidence supporting parts of a Guardian investigation that Israeli military intelligence used Microsoft's Azure cloud to store and analyze large volumes of intercepted Palestinian phone calls. Microsoft said it had since cut off access to certain cloud and AI services used by Unit 8200, Israel's military intelligence agency. “We continue to consider lessons learned and apply them to how we run our business and advance our mission in an increasingly complex world,” Smith wrote in the new message. He noted that employees can submit information anonymously, and Microsoft's non-retaliation policy will also apply. Separately, the Guardian recently reported that Israel's cloud deals with Amazon and Google include a secret mechanism allowing the government to be alerted if a foreign legal order seeks its data. Amazon responded at the time: “We do not have any processes in place to circumvent our confidentiality obligations on lawfully binding orders.” Here is the full text of Smith's message, obtained by GeekWire. You'll recall that on September 25, I shared with you actions we took after investigating a news story that reported that Azure was being used to store phone call data obtained through mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. We're adding a new and easy way for employees to report information about practices that you believe may violate the company's policies regarding the development and deployment of our technology. Our standard non-retaliation policy applies and you can raise concerns anonymously. As one step in that work, we are working to strengthen our existing pre-contract review process for evaluating engagements that require additional human rights due diligence. As I've shared before, Microsoft is a company guided by principles and ethics. We continue to consider lessons learned and apply them to how we run our business and advance our mission in an increasingly complex world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers' first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant. However, investors wanted to know what Pinterest's opportunity in agentic commerce — AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users — was given the rapidly changing AI landscape, and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential. During the company's third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a weaker holiday shopping season than expected, citing President Donald Trump's tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. Despite the near-term revenue concerns, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. “One of the really, really interesting things that we're seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,” Ready told investors. “Given current market rates and per token costs, in early testing, we're seeing orders of magnitude reduction in cost with comparable performance using fine-tuned open source models versus leading off-the-shelf proprietary models.” The exec also touched on other areas where Pinterest is considering how to best use AI, including agentic shopping. Ready said that Pinterest already offers “push-button type buying” via its Amazon partnership, and it will wait to see if users actually want the AI to “push the button for them.” Alphabet is increasingly launching ‘moonshot' projects as independent companies — here's why Elon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla AI researchers 'embodied' an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, researchers at Microsoft released a new simulation environment designed to test AI agents, along with new research showing that current agentic models may be vulnerable to manipulation. Conducted in collaboration with Arizona State University, the research raises new questions about how well AI agents will perform when working unsupervised — and how quickly AI companies can make good on promises of an agentic future. “There is really a question about how the world is going to change by having these agents collaborating and talking to each other and negotiating,” said Kamar. In particular, the researchers found several techniques businesses could use to manipulate customer agents into buying their products. “We want these agents to help us with processing a lot of options,” Kamar says. The agents also ran into trouble when they were asked to collaborate toward a common goal, apparently unsure of which agent should play what role in the collaboration.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. China has reportedly issued a sweeping ban on foreign AI chips in any data center backed by government money, according to a report by Reuters. The move applies retroactively to builds still in early stages, meaning accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel may need to be removed or replaced if already installed. The report, citing unnamed sources with direct knowledge, claims regulators have instructed state-funded projects to use only Chinese-made silicon going forward. That includes domestic chips from Huawei, Cambricon, and Enflame, among others. This follows Chinese port crackdowns on all Nvidia imports in early October. Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's Chinese market share has effectively plummeted to zero. The guidance appears to target not only the H20, but also Nvidia's higher-end H200 and B200, which are restricted under U.S. export rules but have still made their way into Chinese data centers through unofficial channels. That flow of gray-market parts may now face stricter internal scrutiny, with implications for training clusters already under construction. Over the past two years, China has funneled more than $100 billion into AI infrastructure projects, most of them aligned with provincial or national goals for data sovereignty. That public investment is what gives Beijing's directive real teeth. Huawei's Ascend line, often cited as the most mature domestic option, still lacks full parity with CUDA-based stacks. The directive comes amid heightened U.S.-China tech tensions and a broader global reordering of AI supply chains. It remains unclear whether the new policy will eventually extend to privately funded deployments. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The total value of liquid cooling components in Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 rack-scale AI system is $49,860, according to a recently released report from Morgan Stanley that was obtained by @Jukanlosreve. The bill of materials (BOM) cost of the cooling system for Nvidia's NVL72 'Oberon' rack — that includes 18 compute trays (each consuming at least 6.6kW* of power, but requiring cooling for 6.2kW*) and 9 switch trays — totals $49,860. By contrast, a cooling system for an NVSwitch tray costs $1,020, so all cooling components for switch trays are priced at around $9,180. As expected, the most expensive cooling components for AI servers are tailor-made high-performance cold plates for CPUs and GPUs that cost $300 per unit, as well as for NVSwitch ASICs that cost $200 per unit. The number of trays remains the same, but each one now includes higher-capacity cold plates that cost $400 per unit. As CPUs and GPUs gain performance, they also gain power consumption, so they require more and more advanced cooling solutions. The transition from GB200 NVL72 to GB300 NVL72 (+20% for the cooling system) and from GB300 NVL72 to Vera Rubin NVL144 (+17%) marks this upward trend very noticeably. Starting with Rubin Ultra GPUs, Nvidia is set to transition to four compute and 16 HBM4E chiplets per package, thus increasing TDP to 3,600W, which will require new cold plates or even the use of immersion or embedded cooling, at least for some use cases. Nvidia itself is preparing an all-new liquid-cooled NVL576 'Kyber' rack-scale solution with 144 GPU packages that will double performance compared to Vera Rubin NVL144 (which carries 72 GPU packages), but at the cost of much higher thermal draw. Exotic cold plates for Nvidia's Rubin Ultra GPUs and other enhancements to their cooling system will likely increase the cost of NVL576's cooling system. How much will it cost is something that remains to be seen, but high-performance cold-plates capable of removing 3.6kW of thermal energy from a GPU package will certainly cost significantly more than $400 per unit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He will also be the city's first Muslim and South Asian mayor. “I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. “A third-world communist won in New York because New York is a third-world city now,” right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X. White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy, meanwhile posted a screenshot from a 2023 report on the Nyc.gov website that showed around 50 percent of New York households contain at least one immigrant, without adding a comment. “Democrats in New York City have chosen a true extremist and Marxist, and the consequences will be felt across our entire nation,” speaker of the House Mike Johnson wrote on X. Many others focused on Mamdani's Muslim faith, pushing Islamophobic conspiracy theories about the future of New York. “America is about to become a very violent country, Mamdani will encourage Muslims to commit political assassinations to acquire power and silence critics,” conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer wrote in one of her many posts about the election on X. Loomer also slammed billionaire Bill Ackman, who congratulated Mamdani on Tuesday night despite his intense campaign against him over the past few months. “Never congratulate a jihadi,” Loomer wrote in response to Ackman's post. Mamdani's campaign promoted religious tolerance and highlighted the fact that he grew up in an interfaith household, where his father was Muslim and his mother was Hindu. Mamdani ran a campaign on making New York affordable for working-class residents, promoting policies including free childcare, a network of city-owned grocery stores, and more to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. “I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,” Mamdani told NBC's Meet the Press in July. “Zohran Mamdani will take you to a very dark place. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, speaking on his War Room podcast on Tuesday night, also compared Mamdani to Khan and said the new mayor would make New York the “wokeist city on planet earth,” while describing the new mayor as everything from a “neo-Marxist” to a “jihadist.” Bannon also suggested that the Department of Homeland Security “denaturalize” Mamdani and “ship him back to Uganda,” where he was born. Mamdani is a dual citizen of the US and Uganda. “Mamdani will usher in a crime wave the likes of which New York has not seen since the 1990s,” far-right influencer Jack Posobiec said on Fox News Tuesday evening, citing something TPUSA cofounder Charlie Kirk posted on X earlier this year. Similarly, Florida representative Randy Fine wrote on X that “New York City has fallen,” adding: “America is next if we don't stop it.” Nancy Mace took a break from posting about her expletive-filled airport tirade to issue a prophecy: “Bread lines about to be a real thing in New York. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, hasn't yet responded to Mamdani's victory in his home city. Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech and said, “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him."

AND SO IT BEGINS!.” Big Interview: We spoke to Zohran Mamdani, New York's mayoral front-runner The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enterprises are overestimating the reliability of their cloud providers and need to rethink their cloud strategy, according to Sam Barker, vice president of telecoms market research at Juniper Research. He maintained in a company blog that enterprises over-rely on a single provider for their cloud services, although that may change in the wake of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage last month that disrupted a key database service and led to many services that rely on AWS also to suffer outages, including Disney+, Fortnite, HBO Max, Robinhood, Roblox, Slack, Venmo and Zoom. While recent outages at AWS and Microsoft Azure caused degraded performance and downtime for many organizations, noted Gartner Vice President Analyst Lydia Leong, “These events highlight an important truth: cloud disruptions happen, but they are not evidence that the cloud is inherently unreliable.” In an article published on the Gartner website, she warned that moving workloads out of hyperscale providers (repatriation) or to smaller sovereign clouds (geopatriation) won't eliminate outage risk. “In fact,” she wrote, “these moves often introduce new risks and may even slow down your recovery when things do go wrong.” “But Gartner research shows that pursuing multicloud resilience can cost more than it saves, introducing technical complexity without truly eliminating systemic risk.” “Cloud outages make headlines because they affect so many people at once, but context matters,” she added. “Every major provider has experienced similar events, from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud Platform. The real differentiator is how well your organization plans for and recovers from inevitable disruption.” The past few years have shown just how fragile the digital world can be, observed Shawn Michels, vice president of product management at Akamai Technologies, a content delivery network service provider in Cambridge, Mass. “From cloud platform outages to undersea cable cuts, even the most sophisticated systems can experience failures,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The most resilient organizations are rethinking their architectures by using phased rollouts, automated rollback capabilities, and continuous observability to make sure problems are caught and contained early,” he explained. It's how people prepare for failure, respond under stress, and learn from every incident.” While the major hyperscale providers are extremely reliable, they're not equally reliable, contended Rich Mogull, chief analyst at the Cloud Security Alliance, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to cloud best practices. Enterprises absolutely overestimate cloud reliability, often assuming that global cloud infrastructure is inherently immune to downtime due to redundancy, maintained Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company, in Newark, Del. “Even hyperscalers like AWS or Azure operate in a complex web of dependencies across regions, zones, and third-party services. An issue in one layer — like identity federation, DNS propagation, or load balancer routing — can still ripple out and break critical functionality, even if core compute nodes are up.” “What's critical for enterprises to internalize is that cloud outages are inevitable, not hypothetical,” he said. “The AWS outage in June 2023, for example, disrupted everything from banking portals to hospital systems — not because AWS lacked redundancy, but because enterprises hadn't built their apps to withstand regional or service-specific degradation,” he added. “Right now, everyone — and especially hyperscalers — is building tons of new data centers across the world,” he told TechNewsWorld. Enterprises don't overestimate cloud reliability; they just misread what it really means, contended Sergiy Balynsky, vice president of engineering at Spin.AI, a cybersecurity company that specializes in protecting SaaS applications from ransomware, data loss, insider threats, and compliance risks, in Palo Alto, Calif. “The cloud isn't a silver bullet,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That's exactly what Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and strong architecture or SRE practices are for. “Customers can absolutely design in resiliency by using different data centers in other regions, deploying it into different zones in those regions, and being able to build out that architected framework, even to the point where they can build out applications spanning multicloud environments for resiliency,” he told TechNewsWorld. Srini Srinivasan, founder and CTO of Aerospike, a real-time NoSQL database company in Mountain View, Calif., added that cloud providers offer a variety of capabilities that allow any enterprise to deliver extremely high availability. However, Aykut Duman, a partner in the digital and analytics practice at the global strategy and management consulting firm Kearney, pointed out that during the AWS outage, despite deploying workloads across multiple availability zones, organizations experienced complete downtime due to a DNS resolution failure that disrupted core services such as DynamoDB and EC2. “Enterprises often assume redundancy at the provider level guarantees uptime, but resilience must be deliberately engineered at the application level.” “Enterprises overestimate cloud reliability, because they often equate cloud scale with invulnerability,” he said. “While hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google offer impressive uptime, no system is immune to failure.” His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. A few years ago, gaming laptops hit their stride. The Razer Blade 14 was a big part of that. With a new OLED panel, a thinner chassis, improved speakers, and the latest hardware, the Razer Blade 14 continues to be one of the most compact gaming laptops you can buy. It's not as thin as the Razer Blade 16, but it's now 0.62 inches thick, shrunken down from 0.70 inches in the previous generation. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Still, it remains impressively portable, and the design looks great. Razer has done a lot of work over the years to avoid dead giveaways that this is a gaming laptop—no gap between the display and the keyboard, no oversized or obvious vents, and no RGB-lit, jagged edges. If it weren't for the green snake logo on the lid and RGB-backlit keyboard, you'd never know this was a gaming machine. That's important, as the Blade 14 is meant to be a do-it-all laptop for work, school, and games. The fantastic keyboard and touchpad help in that regard. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Razer Blade 14 has a $1,800 MSRP, which gets you the RTX 5060, 16 GB of RAM, and a terabyte of storage. There are only a few other 14-inch gaming laptops out there for direct comparison: the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, HP Omen Transcend 14, and the Asus TUF Gaming A14. It has two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB 4 Type-C ports with both Power Delivery and Display Port 2.1, an HDMI 2.1 output, a microSD card reader, and a headphone jack. It doesn't have Thunderbolt 5 like the Razer Blade 16, but using the USB-C port and HDMI port, it can support two external 4K monitors at 144 Hz. It's a worthwhile upgrade over the mini-LED panel in previous generations. It features a 2880 x 1800 resolution, which is higher than what you typically see on a gaming laptop. That's especially true on a 14-inch computer, giving it a pixel density of 242 pixels per inch—nearly as sharp as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The OLED looks great, but one of the benefits of OLED is HDR in gaming, thanks to the incredible contrast from being able to turn off individual pixels. OLED isn't known for being bright, but lately, that's improved on laptops and external monitors. The OLED display on the Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 10, for example, can be cranked up to over 1,000 nits, creating an impressive HDR effect. The Razer Blade 14, however, only maxes out at 620 nits in HDR and 377 nits in SDR. Because of that, I could hardly tell HDR was even turned on. It's still a pretty screen, and OLED has other benefits over IPS panels, including faster response times, less motion blur, and higher contrast. Also, the 120-Hz refresh rate is standard for OLED laptops, but you can get 240-Hz speeds on laptops that use IPS, like the Alienware 16X Aurora, which happens to be a much cheaper device. I haven't tested the latest model yet, but it's a laptop we've liked for years now, and it's on sale often enough for less than the Blade 14. Not only does it perform better in anything CPU-intensive, such as certain games and creative applications, but it's also a more efficient chip. That leads to some improved battery life—at least, better than your average gaming laptop. I got 10 hours and 19 minutes in a local video playback test, which is about the most you can expect to get from the device. Bad news: The RAM is no longer user-upgradeable on the Razer Blade 14, so you'll have to configure it up front with what you need. Because it's soldered, the memory speeds are faster. As for internal storage, you still get one open M.2 slot to expand space if you need it, supporting up to 4 TB. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All configurations start with 1 TB of storage, as well as the aforementioned AMD Ryzen AI 9 365. From there, you can choose between the RTX 5060 and 5070. Razer does force you to add more storage or memory based on your graphics choice, so you can't configure the RTX 5070 with 16 GB of RAM, for example. My review unit performed in line with my expectations for this type of gaming laptop. I found that playing at 2560 x 1600 tended to be a good happy medium between sharpness and smoothness, though I'm sure many will happily keep games at 1920 x 1200 to get the best frame rates. And yes, you probably won't be playing many games at the laptop's native resolution. But these were all tested at max graphics presets without upscaling, frame generation, or ray tracing. So, you can absolutely get better frame rates by using a lower preset and adding a dash of Nvidia's DLSS. I easily got smooth frame rates in all of these games without needing to tank the image quality. All things considered, the Razer Blade 14 doesn't blow me away this year, but standing on its pedigree, it remains one of the best gaming laptops you can buy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starting on Dec. 10, 14-year-olds in Australia will theoretically not be able to post on the subreddit r/Im14andthisisdeep, nor on any subreddit at all, because Reddit is going to be placed on the country's list of age-restricted social media platforms. Kick, the livestreaming service, will also be restricted when the ban goes into effect, and a large swath of the social media world becomes unavailable to young people in Australia early next month. This kind of regulation will look a bit alien to Americans. With the stated aim of protecting children from harmful content, the Commissioner's powers were expanded in 2022, in part due to lingering outrage over the Facebook livestreaming of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in neighboring New Zealand, and the subsequent spreading of that footage on many social media platforms, including Reddit. A preliminary list of social media platforms banned for under-16s was created about a year ago after an investigation by the eSafety Commissioner, and that list keeps growing. According to the Guardian, Roblox, OpenAI's Sora, Discord, Steam, and Twitch are also on the government's radar, and could potentially be banned. Australia itself isn't designing the technology that makes this ban possible. Per the Guardian, the eSafety Commissioner, Inman Grant, explained at a press conference Wednesday that the platforms themselves have to figure out how to keep users below the age threshold from having accounts, or else they may face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars. Also, the Australian government says it has published guidelines for self-assessment, and expects companies to figure out on their own if they need to ban kids and teens without government intervention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most beautiful and wealthy communities on Lake Tahoe is alerting its residents (among whom are several Silicon Valley billionaires) to a potential poop problem in the local water supply. Incline Village has sent out a public notice warning its residents not to drink the water—at least not before they boil it. Unfortunately, the kinds of stuff that can seep into the community's pipes through those cracks and joints are definitely not the sort of thing you want in your drinking water. “Such a system failure carries with it a high potential that fecal contamination or other disease-causing organisms could enter the distribution system,” the notice continues. “These conditions may pose an imminent and substantial health endangerment to persons served by the system.” An official with Incline Village said that there wasn't proof that fecal matter was actually in the water and that the warning was a standard public notice issued under these circumstances. Gizmodo reached out to the lab for comment. The notice sent to residents Monday notes that the water is currently being tested and that results are expected by Thursday. David Duffield, who co-founded Workday, also reportedly lives in the area. Zuck, who loves drinking water, doesn't seem to have a place in Incline, but he does live nearby, so he should heed the warning if he visits a fellow tech titan in the area.
