            The death toll from a fire at a retirement home in Tuzla in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina rose to 11 on Wednesday and about 30 people were injured, police said.
    


            The blaze engulfed the seventh floor of the old nine-story building at around 8:45 p.m. local time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Tuesday, sending flames and smoke pouring out of the top floors into the night sky. The cause was not immediately clear.
    


            Local media said many of the dead had disabilities and those rescued were moved by emergency crews from the upper floors to lower ones. Some of the injured were in critical condition.
    


            Identification of the victims will start later on Wednesday, and an investigation into the cause of the fire will start once conditions allow it, police said.
    


            “Authorities are taking all necessary actions to shed light on the conditions that caused this tragic event,” the retirement home said in a statement.
    


            The government of Republika Srpska, the Serb Republic, one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, offered its assistance to Tuzla.
    


            “We feel the pain and are always ready to help,” Savo Minic, Prime Minister of the Serb Republic wrote on X.

US President Donald Trump's decision to resume nuclear weapon testing is indicative of a deepening global crisis and weakens the international system of security and peace, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has said.

Speaking to France's LCI TV channel on Tuesday, Grossi described Trump's announcement as a “manifestation of profound unease, tension, and increasing fragmentation,” adding that it undermines both global peace and the non-proliferation regime.

Last week, Trump ordered the US Department of War to begin preparations for nuclear testing, claiming that the US is “the only country that doesn't test” and accusing Russia and China of conducting “secret” nuclear explosions. Both Moscow and Beijing have refuted the allegations.

Grossi questioned the veracity of Trump's claims, emphasizing that any nuclear detonations by other nations would be detected by the international monitoring system established under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The IAEA chief noted that the organization responsible for overseeing compliance “can immediately record such phenomena.”

Grossi called for the restoration of the United Nations' role in maintaining global peace and safeguarding the nuclear non-proliferation system amid rising tensions.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has so far refrained from commenting on Trump's statements, explaining that Moscow is still waiting for “clarifications from the American side.” He stressed that neither Russia nor China had resumed nuclear testing and both remain committed to their obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

Trump's announcement came after Russia conducted a series of tests, including the launch of its new Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone. However, neither of these trials involved actual nuclear detonations. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow would consider resuming the testing of nuclear weapons only if other nuclear powers officially abandon the moratorium.

By Nadezhda Romanenko, political analyst

Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky's recent tour of several units fighting in the Donbass featured a flurry of Nazi and Nazi-adjacent symbolism, worn on the flags and shoulder patches of Ukrainian servicemen. None of it, of course, was picked up by Western media.

First off, we have the infamous Wolfsangel – a medieval Germanic symbol, widely adopted by Nazi Germany during the Second World War and used by multiple Nazi-linked groups then and since – including Ukraine's now-defunct Azov Brigade and its still-intact successors, the 1st Azov Corps.

Their own explanation is that it's not a Wolfsangel at all, but merely a monogram of their slogan, the words “National Idea.”

In that same X thread by Zelensky, seen in that same line of banners, are several red-and-black nationalist flags – clearly reminiscent of the OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalist) and its military wing, the UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army), widely-recognized as WW2-era Nazi collaborators. These days, Ukrainian nationalists are trying to rebrand them for the wider audience as unofficial symbols of the “struggle” against Russia.

And to top it all off, we see Zelensky shaking hands with, and handing awards to, servicemen with shoulder patches featuring the good old Schutzstaffel (SS) twin lightning bolts (or Sig-runes, as they are also known).

Again, there is an explanation – apparently, these are not the letter S at all, they are the number 4, standing for the 4th battalion of the 4th National Guard Operational Brigade ‘Rubezh'. Or maybe they are SS, but they simply stand for the battalion's nickname transliterated into English – ‘Sila Svobody' (The Power of Freedom).

At any rate, the twin bolts are not part of the unit's official imagery, so they might simply be the individual stylistic choice of a couple of guardsmen. Distasteful, yes, but surely not a systemic problem, right?

It becomes a problem when we see the country's leader personally shaking hands with people wearing such symbols, and then proudly displaying the ceremony on his official social media feed for all his Western supporters, as well of the rest of the world, to see. The same leader who's been in power a year and a half past his presidential term, citing martial law. The same leader who has been demanding cash, weapons and soldiers from the EU and the US, as well as EU and NATO membership for his country. The same leader Western leaders tend to receive with open arms and hail as a fighter for democracy and freedom.

Western officials, as well as media most of the time, just look the other way when confronted with the blatant Nazi imagery on display in the Ukrainian army. That is, when they are not actively trying to cover up for the Nazis, the way the CBC tried (and failed) in its report on “an elite training facility” in Kiev. Or aiding and abetting the Nazis by sending them weapons, like the US did when it lifted restrictions on Azov back during the Biden administration.

The explanations for why Nazi symbols are so prominent in the Ukrainian army are paper-thin. Sure, it's the ‘National Idea' monogram and a 44, not an SS – but if you don't want to be associated with Nazis, why would you stylize your heraldry to look exactly like theirs? And sure, red and black are just colors, plenty of flags around the world feature them – by try telling that to those in Poland not brainwashed enough to forget the history of the Volyn massacre perpetrated by Ukrainian Nazi collaborators.

Perhaps these explanations work to skirt Ukraine's own laws – which ban Nazi imagery along with communist symbols – but it seems much more likely that the state, built as it is on the support of ultra-nationalists during and after the 2014 Maidan coup, just isn't interested in enforcing those laws.

In case you think Russia is overreacting when it calls the Ukrainians out on the issue, consider that the Wolfsangel, along with other Nazi imagery, is banned in Germany (they even have to be censored out of videogames published in the country) and listed as a hate symbol by multiple American NGOs, for instance. These high moral standards don't seem to apply to Ukrainian soldiers when you need someone to fight your war with Russia for you.

Symbols evolve, becoming attached to ideologies and detached from them overtime, and even the swastika was not always the damnable Nazi brand it is now. That is not the case here, however. What we are dealing with is an attempt to revive, at a national level, an ideology through symbolism – and ideology that was rightfully buried with the end of WWII. There are those who fight against that ideology and call it out for what it is. And then there are those who help sustain it by turning a blind eye.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has rejected EU pressure over Belgrade's ties with Russia and China, saying he is not a “pupil in an elementary school” who can be lectured. 

Speaking at an EU enlargement summit in Brussels on Tuesday, Vucic pushed back against what he called “thousands of doubts” from EU member states regarding Serbia's relationships.

The Balkan country remains one of the few in Europe that has refused to roll out Western sanctions against Russia, citing its historic and strategic links to the country, even as it seeks membership in the EU.

“I cannot and I'm not going to justify myself for talking with someone,” the Serbian leader stated. “I think it's really stupid, and I'm not a pupil in an elementary school, to tell you the truth. I believe that everybody should talk to each other,” he added. Despite Western pressure on Serbia to antagonize Russia, Vucic made it clear that he has no intention of changing his approach to international diplomacy.

On the Ukraine conflict, he positioned himself as a minor player, stating: “I'm a small guy coming from a small country. I don't give myself a chance to interfere in something big.”

Vucic also defended his recent trip to Russia as an economic necessity. “I had plenty of reasons to go there,” he stated, citing discussions on gas supplies and the plight of the Serbian oil company NIS, which is majority-owned by Russian energy giant Gazprom and has been sanctioned by the US.

Last month, Washington activated restrictions targeting NIS (Petroleum Industry of Serbia), pushing Belgrade to either secure a sale of Gazprom's stake in the firm or assume control via nationalization.

Brussels and Washington have repeatedly urged Belgrade to align its foreign policy with the EU, particularly by severing its relationship with Moscow - something Serbia has resisted.

Moscow has consistently praised Serbia's independent stance, with Russian officials framing the relationship as one of “historic friendship and strategic partnership” while supporting what they describe as Serbia's sovereign right to choose its own partners.

UN, November 5. /TASS/. The United States has proposed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution that would lift sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, Reuters news agency, which saw the document, reported.

The draft resolution would also lift sanctions on Syria's Interior Minister Anas Khattab. It was not immediately clear when it could be put to a vote.

A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the U.S., France or Britain to be adopted.

On November 1, the Axios portal reported that al-Sharaa, during a visit to Washington, is expected to sign documents on Syria's entry into the international coalition led by the United States to combat the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia).

On May 14, Trump held talks with al-Sharaa in Riyadh and said that Washington will begin lifting sanctions that have been imposed on Damascus for decades. On July 1, he abolished unilateral restrictions against Syria.

On October 15, al-Sharaa paid a working visit to Russia, during which he had his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin. During the 2.5 hour-negotiations, the politician talked about the desire of Damascus to ""restart"" relations with Moscow.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, November 5. /TASS/. Russia and China agree to deepen cooperation in trade and energy; Washington struggles for influence over Kiev and its allies as it tries to steer conflict with Russia to an end; and the United States proposes creating an international security force in Gaza to facilitate demilitarization. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russia and China will modernize border checkpoints and expand the list of goods permitted for cross-border transport, according to the communique issued following the 30th regular meeting of the heads of government of the two countries, Mikhail Mishustin and Li Qiang. The agenda also includes shifting the structure of bilateral trade toward agricultural products and primary processed goods, Izvestia writes. In Beijing, Mishustin was also received by Chinese President Xi Jinping. During their meeting, the sides agreed to create conditions to attract investment, provide each other with firm mutual support, and deepen cooperation in high-tech sectors.

On the economic front, Moscow and Beijing agreed to improve the structure of bilateral trade, making use of the growth potential in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, and primary processed products. In addition, the governments of Russia and China supported expanding air travel between the two countries.

""Such meetings make it possible to touch base, synchronize positions and discuss the most pressing issues, serving as an additional communication channel between national leaders,"" Junior Research Fellow at the Sector of Economy and Politics of China of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Andrey Fedotov told Izvestia.

Notably, the Russian prime minister's visit took place after negotiations between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Moscow and Beijing share a similar position on many global and regional issues. In particular, the two are opposed to the United States wielding unfettered power globally, Fedotov noted.

Talks with the Chinese leader also provided an opportunity to discuss the main areas of Russia-China cooperation. The central pillar remains energy trade. In 2024, China imported approximately 213 mln metric tons of oil and 246 bln cubic meters of natural gas from Russia - 1.8% and 6.2% higher, respectively, than the previous year.

During Vladimir Putin's visit to China on September 2, 2025, Russia's Gazprom and China's CNPC signed a legally binding memorandum on the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline through Mongolia. The implementation of this large-scale project will in the coming years allow Russia to increase gas exports to China to up to 50 bln cubic meters annually.

Igor Yushkov, Leading Analyst at the National Energy Security Fund and Expert at the Financial University under the Russian Government, told Izvestia that Russia has enough resources to build five such pipelines. At existing fields alone, Gazprom can produce around 100 bln cubic meters, and additional volumes have become available due to reduced supplies to the EU.

""I believe that, in the end, the project will be built, the question is when and under what conditions. Certain parameters of the commercial contract are still being finalized, as is the issue of financing,"" the expert emphasized.

 

On the day when the European ""coalition of the willing"" convened in Madrid, where discussion was expected to include a 12-point peace plan prepared jointly with Ukraine, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker arrived in Kiev. During his meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, he posited that the only viable scenario for resolving the military conflict with Russia would be one led by US President Donald Trump. Zelensky himself stated the day before that he had not seen a finalized plan from Europe, even though he and European leaders had just recently outlined its key points. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue that Washington may be seeking to ease escalation after Russia's recent strategic weapons tests, but acknowledge that it lacks leverage over both Kiev and its European allies.

According to the newspaper, since his inauguration on January 20, Donald Trump has periodically signaled a willingness to take into account the considerations of Russian negotiators regarding the outlines of a peace deal. Russia's position is and always has been that an immediate ceasefire would merely allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to regroup and maneuver, creating the risk of renewed hostilities. However, the US president has subsequently once again declared an immediate ceasefire to be a necessary move.

At the same time, on October 22, the US Treasury announced new sanctions against two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Meanwhile, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker stated in an interview in recent days that he had discussed additional options for exerting pressure on Russia during a meeting with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.

Commenting on these divergent statements for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts of the Peoples' Friendship University, suggested that Russian President Putin's recent announcement about successful tests of the unlimited-range Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater vehicle likely had an impact on Washington's thinking. Given their characteristics, both developments could pose a direct threat to the United States. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for Washington to try to reduce the level of escalation. Yet, any step toward Moscow would be depicted in Western media as a concession and a sign of personal weakness on Trump's part - an outcome that doesn't mesh with his political agenda.

In addition, Semibratov continued, the current US administration may lack sufficient leverage to influence either Western globalist circles as a whole, including the United Kingdom, or Zelensky himself. Given this, the UK, aware that Washington is weak on the details of the settlement, are deliberately seeking to complicate the negotiation process in order to push the United States to align with their position and turn up the heat on Moscow. If Russia rejects such a proposal, it could then be accused of derailing yet another round of negotiations. However, attempts to advance new initiatives that disregard Russia's security conditions will only further accelerate escalation.

 

The administration of US President Donald Trump has submitted to the UN Security Council a draft resolution to establish the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for a two-year mandate, with the possibility of extension, Axios reported citing a document obtained by the outlet. These armed contingents would not perform a peacekeeping function; instead, they would focus on securing Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training new Palestinian police forces. Discussions on the document are expected to begin in the near future. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that while Washington seeks a multinational force to disarm Hamas, Israel currently has no incentive to accept such a plan, and disarmament remains impossible without progress toward Palestinian statehood, which remains unlikely.

The duties of the international forces would include the disarmament of the Palestinian radical group Hamas. According to the draft resolution, foreign contingents would work to stabilize the situation in the Gaza Strip and ensure the region's demilitarization.

It remains unclear which nations will contribute troops to the ISF, Vedomosti writes. Potential participants may include military personnel from Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Turkey under the overall command of Egypt, The Guardian reported. The Israeli news portal Ynet suggested that military personnel from Indonesia, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan may be involved.

Conditions for the deployment of an international military contingent in Gaza are not yet in place, Doctor of Political Science at the University of Salzburg Kamran Hasanov told Vedomosti. First, despite the ceasefire, clashes between Israeli forces and Islamist fighters still periodically erupt in the enclave. Second, Israel is currently unwilling to allow the entry of international forces into Gaza as it categorically rejects the presence of Turkish troops there, the political scientist pointed out.

""Trump is counting on Ankara's assistance to implement his strategy. But Israel has already secured the release of hostages and therefore has no incentive to comply with the American plan. Otherwise, it risks a political crisis for Netanyahu's cabinet. For their part, the Americans have no incentive to pressure their Israeli allies so long as the region remains relatively stable,"" he said.

According to Hasanov, Hamas is interested in the deployment of peacekeepers only insofar as it hampers Israeli occupation of territory. However, the issue of disarmament remains inseparable from the question of establishing a Palestinian state - and such an outcome, the expert concluded, still appears unlikely.

 

Arab countries are seeking to play a more integral role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Head of the Mission of the League of Arab States (LAS) in Russia Valid Hamid Shiltag told Izvestia. He noted that Arab nations view their interaction with the SCO positively and are already participating in its meetings. Closer engagement would strengthen the organization's potential as one of the key centers of global development and would provide Russia with new avenues for growth.

Arab states could play a more visible role in the SCO, Shiltag said. According to him, expanding cooperation with the organization creates new opportunities for the region in international diplomacy and economic development.

""The League of Arab States and Arab countries as a whole take a positive view of cooperation with the SCO, as well as with BRICS. Some countries are already participating in meetings, and there are states that would also like to become part of these associations,"" the diplomat emphasized.

""Many countries express a desire to take part in order to expand their economic ties, and in this sphere, there are no rigid boundaries between countries. What matters here are shared interests. Arab states can take on a more active role in the SCO,"" the ambassador noted.

The region's intention to expand its involvement in the SCO is primarily linked to economic integration, the newspaper writes. Arab states believe they will fit naturally into the organization's economic mechanisms and complement its existing cooperation formats. Today, the SCO covers about 60% of Eurasian territory, and more than 3.4 bln people live in its member nations - nearly half of the world's population. The combined GDP of its participants exceeds $23 trillion. This scale makes the organization quite attractive for Middle East countries, Izvestia writes.

Strengthening ties between the SCO and the Arab world goes beyond symbolic gestures and is developing into a strategic path reflecting a broader trend toward a multipolar world order, Saudi political analyst Mubarak Al-Aati told the newspaper.

""An organization that includes a quarter of the global economy and more than half of the world's population provides Middle Eastern states with opportunities to enhance national security, expand economic ties, and make room for foreign-policy maneuver. At the same time, the success of their participation in this format will largely depend on the ability of Arab countries to articulate their own vision of engagement,"" the expert said.

 

The new US sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil did not have a substantial impact on the volume of Russian oil exports in October. Month-on-month, seaborne shipments declined by 1.2%, but longer delivery chains and widening discounts were observed. The sanctions could potentially have a greater impact after November 21, when the waivers for transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil expire, Kommersant writes.

Seaborne exports of Russian oil in October decreased month-on-month by 1.2% to 470,000 metric tons per day, according to a review by the Center for Price Indices. China accounted for 34% of shipments, India for 29%, Turkey for 14%, and Egypt and Syria together for 17%. The share of destinations listed as ""unknown"" amounted to 5%.

Maritime shipments of Russian oil to China declined by 7.5% in October, to 159,000 metric tons per day, with ESPO making up about 98% of volumes and Urals comprising the remainder, the Center for Price Indices noted.

Analysts do not view this decline in deliveries as critical, pointing out that in September there were two weeks of record shipments to China - 171,000 metric tons per day. Seaborne exports of Russian oil to India increased by 6.9% to 138,000 metric tons per day, and to Turkey - by 8% to 67,000 metric tons per day.

However, according to market participants cited by the Center for Price Indices, Turkish buyers have already begun searching for alternative suppliers due to the expanded list of Russian oil companies subject to US restrictions after Rosneft and Lukoil were added to the SDN List.

Kirill Bakhtin, Head of the Russian Equities Center at BCS World of Investments, told Kommersant that companies had sufficient time to prepare and develop alternative supply schemes. He said that purchases of Russian oil continue, but increasingly through intermediaries. The full effect of the sanctions will be clearer after November 21, when the transition period ends, the analyst added.

The Center for Price Indices expects average Brent crude prices to decline from $69 per barrel in 2025 to $64 per barrel the following year, due to rising production by OPEC+ countries outpacing the growth in global demand.

SEOUL, November 5. /TASS/. US nuclear aircraft carrier George Washington arrived at the naval base in South Korea's second largest city Busan on Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported.

The aircraft carrier is accompanied by a missile cruiser and two destroyers equipped with the Aegis system. The visit is intended to replenish supplies and rest the crew.

Aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff at Louisville international airport, killing at least nine and injuring 11

Dozens of air safety investigators are set to arrive in Kentucky on Wednesday to piece together evidence on how a UPS cargo plane crashed and erupted into a huge fireball, killing at least nine people and injuring a further 11.

At least 28 National Transportation Safety Board agents will start searching for clues about the possible cause of the disaster, which saw the UPS plane crash shortly after takeoff at the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, leaving behind a fiery trail of destruction on the ground and a huge plume of black smoke.

The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had three crew members onboard and crashed at about 5.15pm local time on Tuesday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. It was bound for Honolulu.

So far, nine fatalities and 11 injuries have been reported, although Andy Beshear, Kentucky's governor, has said he expects this death toll to rise. The UofL Health hospital system said that it was treating 10 patients in relation to the crash, with two of them in critical condition at the hospital's burn center.

“First responders have located nine total [dead] victims at the site of the UPS crash . We will continue to provide information as available,” said Craig Greenberg, Louisville's mayor.

Four of those killed were not onboard the plane, said Brian O'Neill, the Louisville fire department chief.

Hundreds of firefighters have fanned out to deal with fires that erupted on the ground after the crash, although local leaders have asked the public to not move any debris and instead report it to help investigators piece together the reason for the deadly incident.

“We have put together a form where residents can report debris in your yard,” Greenberg posted on X. “We ask that residents do not touch or move any debris on your own.”

Investigators will work to find out how a seemingly routine flight – the UPS hub at Louisville has 300 flights a day – went so badly wrong. Officials have said that there were no hazardous materials on the plane.

Videos taken by onlookers showed flames on the plane's left wing, with the aircraft then lifting off the ground before crashing and exploding into a huge fireball. Nearby residents reported hearing loud booms and witnessed flames in the sky and on the ground.

The amount of fuel on the plane would make a large explosion almost inevitable, Pablo Rojas, an aviation attorney, told the Associated Press. “There's very little to contain the flames and really the plane itself is almost acting like a bomb because of the amount of fuel,” he said.

The videos of the plane appear to show that the engine had detached from it before its final impact, spewing out parts, Mary Schiavo, a former Department of Transportation inspector general, told CNN.

“[The parts] expel from that engine, and the centrifugal force from the engines, the blades spinning, and they can cut through the plane and cut fuel lines,” Schiavo said of the parts. “That engine clearly came off of that plane before the final impact. The poor pilots could do nothing at that point.”

Many flights were canceled or delayed at the airport following the crash. A shelter-in-place order surrounding the airport has now been reduced to a quarter-mile radius around the crash site.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

KitKat, affectionately known as ‘mayor of 16th Street', was struck and killed by a Waymo in the city's Mission District

The death of beloved neighborhood cat named KitKat, which was struck and killed by a Waymo in San Francisco's Mission District last week, is sparking uproar in the city and across the internet. Now local politicians and community leaders are harnessing momentum to put new limits on the fast-spreading autonomous vehicle industry.

KitKat was a regular fixture at the deli and liquor store Randa's Market, and was well known in the neighborhood and on social media. In a recent podcast interview, Daniel Zeidan, part of the family that owns Randa's, described KitKat as unequivocally adored.

“The nickname that they had for him was the mayor of 16th Street,” Zeidan said. “He would walk down there, stare up at the employees and wait for them to throw chicken at him … He really ran the block.”

But on 27 October, KitKat was struck by a Waymo autonomous vehicle, which in recent years has become a ubiquitous sight around the city. Waymo confirmed the death in a statement to the Guardian. “While our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,” a company spokesperson said.

Tributes have poured in across social media for KitKat, who could often be found curled up behind the counter at Randa's, or strolling into the nearby Dalva bar to receive a royal reception. A shrine has popped up outside of Randa's, replete with photos of KitKat, bouquets of flowers and well-wishes.

Local legislators are using the incident to call for limits on the industry's growth. Jackie Fielder, a San Francisco city supervisor, said she plans to introduce legislation that would allow counties to decide whether they will permit the operation of autonomous vehicles, and is calling upon the California legislature to consider doing the same. Fielder said the bill will be similar to a 2024 effort in the California legislature.

“We are absolutely coming for your bottom dollar,” Fielder said of Waymo in a Tuesday press conference held outside of Randa's Market. Speakers included local politicians, union leaders and transit advocates, who touched on fears of job replacement via AI and the loss of local political control against tech companies.

Justin Dolezal, a local bar owner and head of a small business coalition, also spoke about KitKat's role in the community, and in favor of the resolution.

“The mayor of this space was taken by technology that none of us asked for, and crucially to this resolution, none of us consented to,” Dozel said.

KitKat's death is the latest swell in waves of anti-AI sentiment and concerns over autonomous vehicles, although others point to data showing a firm safety record. While Waymo says it operates around 1,500 cars across the US, exact numbers for San Francisco's fleet are unclear. Protestors and activists have taken to disabling Waymos by placing traffic cones on their hoods or even setting them on fire. Cruise, another autonomous taxi company, agreed last year to shell out more than $8m in 2024 to a Bay Area woman who was dragged over 20ft of pavement by an autonomous vehicle. Questions have also arisen over how to ticket and discipline autonomous vehicles when they violate traffic laws.

Waymo declined to comment on the proposed legislation in a written statement to the Guardian but said that “trust and the safety of the communities we serve is our highest priority”.

“We send our deepest sympathies to the cat's owner and the community who knew and loved him, and we have made a donation to a local animal rights organization in his honor,” the statement said.

As politicians push for change, some have taken upon themselves to honor KitKat in distinctly Silicon Valley-style ways. Zeidan has released a memecoin honoring KitKat's legacy, and also said that he was disappointed to see others launch their own imitation tokens in an attempt to profit off KitKat's death.

Zeidan hopes to use proceeds to support local veterinarians and animal welfare organizations. He was inspired to do so after the veterinarian that attempted to save KitKat's life dropped the cost of the entire medical bill.

“We wanted to honor the cat,” Zeidan said. “We want to support shelters, we want to support local animal organizations that help animals.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The late-night host invites food and essential donations at his Hollywood center to support Los Angeles charities

The late-night TV show Jimmy Kimmel Live! is stepping up to help during the ongoing US federal government shutdown by opening a new center for food donations.

The ABC program announced the program, titled “the Jimmy Kimmel Live Big, Beautiful Food Bank” on Instagram on Tuesday, just after Donald Trump reaffirmed his plan to block Snap benefits despite a federal judge's earlier order for the administration to use emergency funds to continue the food assistance program.

“Cutting SNAP benefits creates uncertainty for American children, seniors and families,” the post said. “To support our community members in need, we're starting a donation center in our Hollywood backlot to benefit the @LAFoodBank & @StJosephCtr … If you are in LA, please come by to donate food and if you are not, please consider supporting your local food banks.”

The message also noted that specific donations such as crackers, trail mix, fruit snacks, 100% juice boxes, dried fruit, cereal boxes, wipes, diapers, facial cleanser, deodorant, soap, lotions, oral hygiene items and feminine products would be appreciated.

Before Kimmel's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that Snap benefits would “be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government” and that the benefits “were haphazardly ‘handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP”.

Kimmel, known for his outspoken criticism of the Trump administration, also recently took aim at the president's Great Gatsby-themed Halloween celebration.

“You know, throwing a party at your private golf club where the theme is rich white people hours before millions of Americans are set to lose their food assistance might be the Trumpiest Trump move of all time,” Kimmel said Monday night. “It felt like the last big bash before the Epstein files come out.”

Meanwhile, Kimmel's popularity has soared and reportedly surpassed Trump's following a dispute with the administration that led to his show being briefly taken off the air in September, according to a recent survey.

Kimmel's suspension was announced on 17 September after he criticized the administration's handling of the previous week's killing of the rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk. Brendan Carr, Federal Communications Commission chair and a Trump ally, allegedly threatened to revoke ABC affiliates' licenses unless the network acted against Kimmel.

The decision sparked protests, debates about free speech, and boycotts targeting Disney, ABC's parent company. The network reinstated Kimmel six days later, with many industry peers crediting the reversal to those who had joined the boycott.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A Lukoil oil refinery in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast was hit by Ukrainian drones overnight on Nov. 4, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.

Over 50 Ukrainian-made drones, including Bober and FPV-1 models, were used in the joint operation, conducted by HUR, the Armed Forces, and the Special Operations Forces, according to the source.

The refinery was reportedly struck while undergoing repairs to a rectification column used for primary oil processing.

Video footage circulating online showed flames at the facility, which local monitoring channels identified as the likely target of the attack.

Lukoil Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez is one of Russia's largest oil refineries, supplying fuel to the Moscow region, which accounts for about 30% of the country's gasoline consumption. The refinery's annual crude processing capacity is around 17 million tons, producing over 50 types of petroleum products, including automotive, aviation, and diesel fuels, as well as bitumen and paraffin.

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces also confirmed a reported strike on a petrochemical plant in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan.

Explosions were reported overnight at a petrochemical plant in Sterlitamak, Bashkortostan. Mayor Emil Shaimardanov said on Nov. 4 that as a result of the explosion, part of the water purification facility collapsed.

""All emergency services are currently at the scene. The cause of the explosion is being investigated"" he said, adding that five people were working at the facility, according to preliminary data, and no one was injured.

The facility is Russia's leading manufacturer of components for aviation kerosene, used in the production of aviation fuel, according to the General Staff. 

One of the plant's workshops sustained ""significant damage"" as a result of the strike, the military said. The full results of the attack are still being investigated.

Earlier on Nov. 4, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had downed 85 drones across multiple regions, including Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh, Belgorod, Kursk, Lipetsk, Volgograd, Sverdlovsk, and the Republic of Bashkortostan.

Explosions were reported by the independent outlet Astra in the Russian city of Lipetsk amid an air raid siren in the city.

In Russia's Volgograd Oblast, an electrical substation was damaged due to falling drone debris, Governor Andrey Bocharov claimed.

Overnight on Nov. 3, Alexander Khinshtein, the Governor of Kursk region, said that a substation in the city of Rylsk was attacked. As a result, more than 16,000 consumers in various areas were left without power.

A drone attack was also reported in the city of Dovzhansk, Luhansk Oblast. The city is located about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the city of Luhansk and has been occupied by Russian forces since 2014.

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the details of all the attacks.

Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia's war machine.

Ukraine regularly strikes military targets in its occupied territories and deep within Russia as Moscow continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

On Oct. 30, a fire broke out at a thermal power plant in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast, causing a widespread power outage across the region, independent outlet Astra reported.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

The Russian city of Oryol came under attack overnight on Nov. 5, according to local residents, Russian media, and the regional governor. 

Residents said they heard multiple explosions in Oryol and posted footage of the attack to social media, the Telegram news channel Astra reported. According to locals, it sounded like the city was being attacked by missiles. 

Footage posted by residents was filmed roughly 1 to 1.5 kilometers from the Oryol thermal plant. 

""The attack was carried out using a reactive weapon — either a missile or a jet-powered UAV. In the videos, there are no sounds of an air raid warning, no noise from air defense systems, and no characteristic buzzing of a drone,” Astra's OSINT analyst claimed.

Oryol Oblast Governor Andrey Klychkov claimed that Ukrainian drones were targeting the region and that Russian air defense units destroyed the UAVs. Debris from the intercepted drones damaged homes and an outbuilding, he said. 

Drones also struck energy infrastructure near the city of Vladimir, Astra reported.

""Specialists are working on site. Recovery efforts will begin at daylight. Please remain calm. All essential systems are operating normally,"" regional Governor Alexander Avdeyev said.

In Yaroslavl oblast, local authorities said Ukrainian drones damaged oil refineries in two districts.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that a total of 40 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight across several regions, including 11 over Voronezh, 8 over Rostov, 6 over Kursk, 6 over occupied Crimea, 5 over Bryansk, 2 over Belgorod, and 2 over Oryol.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports at the time of publication. 

Less than a week earlier, the Ukrainian Navy said it struck the Oryol Thermal Power Plant (TPP) with domestically produced Neptune cruise missiles. The Navy's announcement followed reports of fires at the facility. 

Kyiv regularly targets military and industrial facilities in Russia and in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

Today, U.S. Bank [NYSE: USB] announced a new kind of credit card that enables automatic no-fee, no interest equal monthly payments on all purchases: the  U.S. Bank Split™ World Mastercard ® . 

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251105866267/en/

U.S. Bank Split™ World Mastercard®

Split Card introduces a new alternative to traditional Buy Now, Pay Later options – a single solution to manage multiple pay-over-time plans that is backed by a major bank, providing valuable consumer protections and the ability to build credit.

The Split Card can be used to shop in-store or online everywhere Mastercard is accepted, and every purchase is automatically split into a three-month payment plan with no interest or annual fee. Cardholders can also choose to extend payment plans to six or 12 months for larger purchases for a small, fixed monthly plan fee.

“Split Card meets the diverse needs of today's consumers who are seeking easy and transparent ways to fund purchases of all sizes,” said Chris Roncari, head of product and experience for consumer and small business payments at U.S. Bank. “Split Card has elements of a typical card but is far from a typical credit card with its budgeting control and interest-free option. We expect Split Card will be a top choice for Gen Z consumers, and many others, who desire the broad scale usability, simplicity, and protections of a credit card but also need the financial consistency of equal monthly payments.”

Here's how the Split Card works:

The Split Card has no APR or annual fee and comes with Mastercard World benefits including built-in travel, entertainment, shopping and protection benefits.

Split Card is the latest U.S. Bank product to provide installment plan repayment options. In 2021, U.S. Bank ExtendPay ® launched, providing consumer and business cardholders the ability to move eligible transactions to equal monthly payments. With Split Card, all purchases are automatically split into three equal monthly payments with no interest and no fees, eliminating any extra steps after each purchase.

The Interior Ministry has also searched the premises of other Islamist organizations in Hamburg, Berlin and Hesse. Meanwhile, the foreign minister has caused an uproar with comments on Syria. Follow DW for the latest.

Germany's Interior Ministry has banned the ""Muslim Interactive"" organization, a newly founded Islamist organization, which has recently shocked the public by calling for a caliphate.

German authorities also conducted a search operation in other premises, as part of a wider investigation.

Elsewhere, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has caused a stir within his own conservative bloc by contradicting Chancellor Friedrich Merz's assertions that Syria is a safe country for refugees to return to.

This blog will bring you the latest on all things happening in Germany on Wednesday, November 5, 2025:

Three teachers and 29 students required medical attention at a school in Spiesen-Elversberg in Saarland on Wednesday, police said, when ""an irritant gas was seemingly released."" 

Police said there were roughly 170 people in the building at the time of the suspected crime, at around 11:30 a.m. local time. 

The injured people suffered irritation of the airways and eyes.

""Many of the injured were given medical attention on site, a few were taken to nearby hospitals for further treatment,"" police from the larger nearby town of Neunkirchen said in a statement. 

Police said they were launching investigations against an as yet unknown suspect on suspicion of intentionally releasing the gas and causing dangerous bodily harm. 

""The exact material used in the crime is not yet clear and is a subject of the ongoing investigation,"" police said. They appealed to potential witnesses who might have seen suspicious activity at or near the Albert-Schweitzer School in Saarbrücken near the French border to get in touch.

Signs of the ongoing US government shutdown causing difficulties or uncertainties for US soldiers appeared, and then were swiftly removed after drawing attention, on the US Army Garrison Bavaria website this week. 

""The shutdown will impact services provided by the Garrison at installations across Rose Barracks, Tower Barracks, Hohenfels and Garmisch,"" it said on a web page to provide guidance to members of how to deal with the government shutdown.

The web page also contained a ""running list of German support organizations for your kit bags"" that included charities like Foodsharing e.V and Essen für Alle (Food for All), as well as the app Too Good To Go.

At the top of the list was Tafel Deutschland, which it described as ""the umbrella organization distributes food to people in poverty through its more than 970 local food banks.""

On Wednesday, the garrison removed references to these German food banks and other free or discounted food provision services from its web page.

The German Police Union (DPolG) welcomed the news that the ""Muslim Interactive"" group, which advocated the overthrow of the German government, has been banned.

DPolG chair Rainer Wendt said that the government was ""implementing...the active protection of our democracy and our constitution.""

The Islamist association had called for a caliphate to replace the German state.

Wendt also said that membership of ""Muslim Interactive"" should be grounds for the deportation of non-citizens.

""We now expect the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees to review the respective residence status of the association's members in order to subsequently justify a special interest in expulsion,"" he said.

Deportation continued to be a hot topic in Berlin on Wednesday, as Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul openly disagreed as to whether it is safe for refugees to return to Syria.

Herta Müller, winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature, will be given the German Culture Prize next week.

The award honors her entire body of work, which includes renowned novels like ""The Hunger Angel"" and ""The Passport"" as well as poetry and essays.

Born in 1953 as part of the German minority in Romania, much of her work focuses on the terror and persecution faced by ordinary people under the Iron Curtain.

Stiftung Kulturförderung, the foundation who presents the German Culture Prize, hailed Müller's ""literary fearlessness"" and her ""unwavering commitment to freedom.""

Müller will receive the prize at a ceremony in Munich on November 14.

A 40-year-old palliative care nurse was given a life sentence by a court in Aachen for the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.

The prosecution claimed the man was playing ""master of life and death"" over those in his care, and that he showed a distinct lack of empathy for patients who required a higher level of attention.

Though the acknowledged that he suffered from a personality disorder, they said he purposefully gave elderly patients extremely high doses of medication in order to reduce his workload on night shifts.

He was arrested in 2024 while working at a hospital in the town of Wuerselen, where he had been working since 2020.

The judge ruled that due to the ""high severity of guilt,"" he will not be eligible for parole for at least 15 years.

German public broadcaster ARD reported on Wednesday that Bundestag members from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) are planning official trips to Russia.

According to official party documents, on top of regular trips to Turkey, Kyrgyzstan and the US, two AfD lawmakers will visit Sochi, Russia, on November 13.

Party members Steffen Kotre und Rainer Rothfuss are due to give talks at a symposium for Europeans looking to forge connections with the BRICS. BRICS is a summit group that includes Russia and China that seeks to counter Western-led alternatives like the G7.

It is not the first recent trip to Russia for either lawmaker, who have also traveled to Moscow.

Vice-parliamentary chief for the AfD, Stefan Keuter, told ARD he believed it was ""time to intensify contact with Russia.""

The AfD has repeatedly come under criticism for forging ties with authoritarian leaders, and has been labeled extremist by German intelligence services, but the label has been put on hold pending an AfD appeal.

China's Football Association has turned to a homegrown former player who spent most of his career in Germany, Shao Jiayi, to take over stewardship of the national team. 

The world's second-most populous nation recently missed out once again on World Cup qualification, dismissing Croatian Branko Ivankovic as coach as a result in June. The team had lost seven of 10 qualifying matches.

China's CFA said in a statement that the decision was made with a view to ""the current situation for Chinese men's football and the long-term construction of the national team."" 

Shao spent several years competing in Germany's Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga in his prime, in stints at 1860 Munich, then Energie Cottbus and finally MSV Duisburg. 

The midfielder also competed for China in the 2002 World Cup — still the only time China ever made it to world football's biggest competition. The country is still seeking its first points and goals at a World Cup.

Shao has spent some of his coaching career with China's national setup already, training the youth teams and as assistant coach for the seniors. Most recently, he was coaching Chinese Super League team Qingdao West Coast.

Germany's far-left party hailed Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral election, saying his victory could provide momentum for Berlin next year.

""His campaign is like a blueprint for next year's elections in Berlin,"" said Jan van Aken, leader of the Left Party, which has bounced back in support in the past year after a decade of relative obscurity.

The Left Party faces an uphill battle in the race for Berlin's city hall, as the more residential neighborhoods on the outskirts of town tend to support the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), and the environmentalist Green Party also remains popular.

Indeed, the CDU took power in the Berlin senate for the first time in two decades in 2023 from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who remain in government as junior coalition partners.

The center-left government of Hamburg, which is also its own federal state, welcomed the news that the Muslim Interactive organization had been banned.

The group, which had called for the German government to be overthrown and replaced by a caliphate, was particularly active in Berlin and Hamburg.

Senator for the Interior Andy Grote called it a ""strike against modern TikTok-Islamism."" 

Hamburg intelligence chief Torsten Voss stressed that the move protected religious freedom, as the ban ""was not against Muslims, but against enemies of the constitution who are exploiting Islam for political reasons.""

As other German auto giants are making moves to slash costs amidst plummeting sales, the BMW group announced on Wednesday that it had done robust business in the third quarter of 2025.

CEO Oliver Zipse announced profits of €1.7 billion (nearly $2 billion), compared to €476 million in the same period last year, when its cars were facing issues with their brakes.

Zipse also said that the company was ""fully on track"" to meet European Union emissions targets for 2025.

While other European carmakers have complained about unfair competition in the electric vehicle sector from China, BMW's report highlighted its iX3 electric SUV in particular as having driven the increase in sales.

Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) announced late on Tuesday that it had arrested 18 individuals in connection with an online fraud network that was using German payment service providers.

The BKA said that between 2016 and 2021, the network amassed the credit card details of some 4.3 million individuals from 193 countries, stealing over €300 million ($344 million).

The raids that resulted in the 18 arrests were part of a coordinated law enforcement effort that also involved Canada, the US, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Singapore, German authorities said.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has triggered fresh backlash within his own conservative block by reportedly saying that Syria today looks worse than Germany did in 1945.

Germany's top diplomat made the remark during a meeting of the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) on Tuesday afternoon, the German DPA news agency said.

One of the lawmakers described Wadephul's appearance as ""disastrous,"" and that support for the politician was fading, DPA reported. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz' coalition has upped deportation efforts since taking office earlier this year, with plans to come up with a mechanism to deport Syrian criminal offenders in Germany. On Tuesday, Merz went as far as to say that Syrians no longer have grounds for asylum in Germany after the civil war in the country has ended.

Wadephul recently visited Syria and expressed doubt on sending Syrians back.

""It is barely possible for people to live here with dignity,"" the minister said while visiting the neighborhood of Harasta. ""In the near future, [Syrian refugees] can not return.""

Germany's security authorities already classified Muslim Interactive as extremist. The group calls for a worldwide caliphate, which rejects the democratic order enshrined in Germany's Basic Law.

Founded in 2020, authorities believe the group is affiliated with the Hizb ut-Tahrir (HuT) organization, which was banned in 2003 after promoting violence and the killing of Jewish people.

""Put delicately, this is a revolutionary political movement pursuing a fundamental upheaval of the ruling order, not only in the Muslim world, but worldwide,"" Andreas Jacobs, head of the division for societal cohesion at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told DW in 2024.

The association is prolific on social media with substantial followers. Their video posts look professional and portray their movement's leaders as modern and eloquent. 

The association views the Muslim community in Germany as a minority that is discriminated against and ostracized from society.

The group's views intensified following the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza.

German authorities have banned the Muslim Interactive association and will confiscate its assets, the Interior Ministry said on Wednesday. 

""We will respond with the full force of the law to anyone who aggressively calls for a caliphate on our streets, incites hatred against the state of Israel and Jews in an intolerable manner, and despises the rights of women and minorities,"" said Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt in the statement.

Authorities searched seven properties in Hamburg and 12 more in Berlin and the central state of Hesse since early morning. The raids also included preliminary investigations into two other organizations ""Generation Islam"" and ""Realität Islam"" (or Reality Islam), the ministry said.

The Muslim Interactive association came under scrutiny in April 2024 over a protest in Hamburg. Over 1,000 people attended the demonstration, with some carrying signs reading: ""The caliphate is the solution."" Public outcry was quick to follow, with many calling for the organization to be banned.

Guten Tag and welcome to our coverage of all things Germany from DW's newsroom in Bonn.

German authorities have banned the fairly new ""Muslim Interaktiv"" or Muslim Interactive organization, which has stirred much controversy by calling for a caliphate.

The Interior Ministry is also investigating other Islamist organizations including ""Generation Islam"" and ""Realität Islam"" or Reality Islam, conducting searches of their premises.

A passenger train crashed into a cargo train in central India, resulting in a deadly accident. One of the passenger train's cars ended up on top of one of the cargo train's cars.

At least eight people were killed and about a dozen more were injured in a collision between a local passenger train and a freight train in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Tuesday, according to officials.

The collision occurred near Bilaspur, approximately 116 kilometers (72 miles) from the state capital of Raipur.

""A total of eight people have lost their lives in this accident. Two people are still stuck here. 16-to-17 people are in a serious condition. This is a big accident,"" district official Sanjay Agarwal told the ANI news agency.

Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Arun Sao said that the freight train was stopped when the accident occurred and that the passenger train crashed into it from behind, damaging the first few passenger train cars.

Agarwal, the district official, said that one of the train cars ended up on top of a goods train car, and the rescue operation is underway.

A ""rescue team is trying to cut through the train to take out at least two passengers trapped inside,"" he said. ""We hope they will be alive but can't confirm until we get them out.""

Indian Railways announced that it has deployed all available resources for the rescue effort. The company also stated that an investigation into the cause of the accident has begun.

According to the ANI news agency, the railway administration announced compensation payments of 10 lakh rupees ($11300; €9800) to the family of the deceased, 5 lakh rupees to those grievously injured, and 1 lakh rupees to those with minor injuries.

India's extensive rail network, the fourth largest in the world, is plagued by issues of aging infrastructure and human error, which often result in train collisions.

One of the country's worst rail accidents occurred in 2023 when three trains collided in the southern state of Odisha, killing 288 people.

Thanks for following our live coverage. It has now ended:

Here's a summary of what happened in New York last night: 

There was no defeat to be snatched from the jaws of victory.

The man who shockingly secured the Democratic nomination in June has un-shockingly won the election. Zohran Mamdani, the dimpled, wise-cracking democratic socialist, will become mayor of New York, America's most populous city.

For those with a taste for 11th-hour upsets in politics, there was little reason to anticipate a surprise. The Mamdani campaign carried the momentum from its primary battle, drawing the highest turnout in a New York mayoral race since the 1960s.

A highly-energised coalition of young white Leftists and new immigrant communities disrupted the traditional New York Dem voting blocs. In the end, it wasn't even remotely close.

It will be hard to resist the urge to see the result as a stunning endorsement of Mamdani's particular flavour of progressivism, bolstered by further blows against the GOP in New Jersey and Virginia.

Zohran Mamdani, a pro-Palestinian socialist, has been elected the first Muslim mayor of New York City.

The Left-wing politician, 34, beat Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, in the dramatic race.

His historic win marked the end of an extraordinary election in which Mr Mamdani was propelled from fringe candidate to frontrunner through a slick social media campaign centred on affordability in one of the world's most expensive cities.

Mr Mamdani tapped into residents' frustrations with skyrocketing living costs by pegging his campaign to sweeping promises of free buses, free childcare and city-run supermarkets.

The 34-year-old, who will become the city's youngest mayor in more than 100 years, also vowed to freeze rent in rent-controlled properties and raise funds for his ambitious pledges by increasing taxes for the city's highest earners.

Donald Trump issued an ominous warning to Zohran Mamdani after the democratic socialist swept to victory in New York's mayoral election, writing: “And so it begins…”

Mr Trump posted the brief message on Truth Social midway through Mr Mamdani's mayoral victory speech, which had included several jabs at the US president.

The post could be seen as Mr Trump firing the starting gun on the campaign for the 2026 mid-term elections. Republicans have signalled they intend use Mr Mamdani as a symbol of Left-wing radicalism as a weapon against the Democrats.

Mr Trump, who has said he plans to stop Mr Mamdani “destroying” New York and floated withholding federal funds from the city, could also be hinting at an epic clash between his administration and the new mayor.

The US president has recently sent federal troops into several US cities, but has so far avoided stamping his authority on New York.

The US government shutdown has officially become the longest in history, beating the previous record of 35 days.

On Tuesday night, US president Donald Trump claimed Democrat successes in a series of elections were a result of the shutdown, alongside the fact that he was not on the ballot.

He renewed his call for Senate Republicans to ditch the filibuster to reopen the government and force through his legislative priorities. 

John Thune, the GOP Senate leader, has said he does not intend to go ahead with the president's plan.

Zohran Mamdani's victory as a democratic socialist in New York City is an odd one as analysts try to tease out lessons for next year's midterm elections and forecast who will end up controlling Congress.

“It's a weird situation,” said pollster James Johnson, who pointed out that Mr Mamdani' main challenger was Andrew Cuomo, a former Democrat running as an independent. “It's not Republican versus Democrat, so I don't think we can learn anything from that.”

Yet the stunning victory will have delighted two sets of political campaigners: Mr Mamdani's supporters and Republican strategists around the country.

The National Republican Congressional Committee, for example, immediately set out its plan for the midterms and the way it would tie Democratic candidates to Mr Mamdani's radical politics.

“Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026,” said spokesman Mike Marinella.

“…AND SO IT BEGINS!” Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, seemingly responding to Zohran Mamdani's victory speech, in which he was called out several times.

Mr Mamdani's speech has now concluded.

“Hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us,” Zohran Mamdani says, virtually shouting over the cheers of supporters.

“The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate,” Mr Mamdani says, noting he is young, Muslim, a Democratic socialist and “most damning of all, I refuse to apologise for any of this”.

He adds: “No longer will we have to open a history book for proof that Democrats can dare to be great.”

“We will prove that there is no problem too large for government to solve and no concern too small for it to care about,” Zohran Mamdani says.

“If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” the Democrat continues.

“If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.

“So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.”

“Billionaires like Trump” have been able to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks” because of a “culture of corruption”, he claims.

Politics is “no longer... something that is done to us”, Zohran Mamdani claims. “Now it is something that we do.”

“Tonight we have have stepped out from the old into the new. So let us speak now with clarity and conviction that cannot be misunderstood,” he says.

“This will be an age where New Yorkers expect from their leaders a bold vision of what we will achieve rather than a list of excuses,” Mr Mamdani continues.

He pledges to introduce an “ambitious agenda to tackle the cost of living”, to “freeze the rents for more than two million rent-stabilised tenants, make buses fast and free, and deliver universal childcare across our city”.

Mr Mamdani continues: “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light... whether you are an immigrant, a member of the trans community, one of the many black women that Donald Trump has fired from a federal job.”

“We will build a city hall that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism,” he pledges.

Citing the example of a New Yorker forced to commute into the city from Pennsylvania, Zohran Mamdani declares: “Rent is too expensive in this city.”

Cost of living, and in particular the spiralling cost of rent, were a key theme of the Democrat's campaign.

“Because of you we will make this city one that working people can love and live in again,” he says.

Mr Mamdani says he has “one final request”: “New York City, breathe this moment in. We have held our breath for longer than we know. We have held it in anticipation of defeat, held it because the air has been knocked out of our lungs too many times to count.

“Thanks to all of those who sacrificed so much, we are breathing in the air of a city that has been reborn.”

He tells his parents they have “made me into the man I am today”, adding: “I am so proud to be your son.”

“Thank you to the next generation of New Yorkers who refused to accept that the promise of a better future was a relic of the past,” Zohran Mamdani says.

“You showed that when politics speaks to you without condescension, we can usher in a new era of leadership.”

Zohran Mamdani is delivering his victory speech now.

“The sun may have set over city this evening but as Eugene Debbs once said, ‘I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,” the future New York mayor begins.

“For as long as we can remember the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that the power does not belong in their hands... and yet over the last 12 months, you have dared to reach for something greater.

“Tonight, against all odds, we have grasped it. The future is in our hands. My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,” he says, referring to his defeat of Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York governor Mario Cuomo.

“I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life. But let tonight be the last time I utter his name.”

Chuck Schumer has congratulated Zohran Mamdani on his win tonight despite refusing to endorse the socialist.

“His campaign was relentlessly focused on the cost-of-living crisis, that Donald Trump has only made worse,” the Democrat Senate leader said, taking the opportunity to hit out at the US president.

Mr Schumer continued: “I have worked collaboratively and productively with mayor-elect Mamdani on a number of vital issues over the years - including delivering historic relief to our taxi drivers who were suffering under crushing and unfair debt.

“I look forward to building on that partnership to keep New York City strong, fair, more affordable, and thriving.”

Eric Adams, the New York mayor, has pledged to protect communities who opposed Zohran Mamdani, in what appears to be a message aimed at Jewish voters.

A CNN exit poll released soon after polls closed this evening found 60 per cent of Jewish voters voted for Andrew Cuomo compared to 31 per cent for Zohran Mamdani, who nevertheless went on to win the mayoral election.

Mr Adams, who leaves office in January, offered his congratulations to his successor before seemingly addressing the city's Jewish population.

Our shared mission must always be to put New York City first and build a safer, more affordable city that is the best place to raise a family.A message to my fellow New Yorkers. pic.twitter.com/OkicJAcqNN

“To all those communities who voted for someone else, we understand your concerns, we understand your fears, we understand the anxiety you are feeling. But this is our democracy,” he said.

Mr Adams continued: “As your former mayor and as a former member of the New York City police department, I will be committed to ensure your safety and your acceptance in the city that we all love.”

Gavin Newsom's plan to redistrict California and net Democrats five extra seats in the House of Representatives has been approved by the state's voters, according to projections.

Andrew Cuomo has hailed Zohran Mamdani as the future of the Democrats in his concession speech.

“This campaign was to contest the philosophies that are shaping the Democratic party, the future of this city and the future of this country,” he said.

Mr Mamdani, a 34-year-old socialist, ran a campaign focused on the cost of living, while Mr Cuomo, the 67-year-old former New York governor, stuck more to the centre ground.

New Yorkers “will not tolerate any behaviour that fans the flames of anti-Semitism,” he warns.

When his supporters boo the mention of Mr Mamdani's name, Mr Cuomo admonishes them. “That is not right... tonight was their night,” he says.

Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has passed on his “huge congratulations” to Zohran Mamdani following his mayoral election win.

“New Yorkers faced a clear choice - between hope and fear - and just like we've seen in London - hope won,” Mr Khan wrote on social media.

“Huge congratulations to [Zohran Mamdani] on his historic campaign.”

Mr Mamdani will be the first Muslim mayor of New York when he takes office in January. Mr Khan became the first Muslim mayor of London when he was elected in May 2016.

New Yorkers faced a clear choice - between hope and fear - and just like we've seen in London - hope won.Huge congratulations to @ZohranKMamdani on his historic campaign.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has urged fellow Democrats not to be “afraid of the future” after Zohran Mamdani's mayoral win in New York.

“We don't have to be afraid of the future and we don't have to be afraid of our young,” she said, urging Democrats to “lean into the promise of our party.”

“It's not just a message about Democrats,” she added, saying voters were “appalled by the cowardice of Congress” and labelling US president Donald Trump a “handmaiden to billionaires”.

Barack Obama has said Democrats still have “plenty of work to do” despite a series of high-profile wins tonight.

“When we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win,” the former US president wrote on social media.

“We've got still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter.”

Congratulations to all the Democratic candidates who won tonight. It's a reminder that when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win. We've still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter.

Abigail Spanberger has been urged to “consider all of us Virginians” by her defeated Republican opponent.

Winsome Earle-Sears said she had called the Democrat, who did not answer, and wished her success in a voicemail message instead.

“I asked her to please consider all of us Virginians, that she will represent all of us, not just some us,” said Ms Earle-Sears, the state's lieutenant governor.

“And I wished her success. If she is successful, Virginia will be successful. That's what I wish for.”

Jay Jones, the Democrat candidate who mused about murdering Republicans in leaked texts, has won a close race for Virginia attorney general. 

The race has been called for Mr Jones by the Associated Press, several hours after Abigail Spanberger's win in the gubernatorial election in the same state.

Donald Trump has claimed that Republican losses tonight are because he wasn't on the ballot and the ongoing government shutdown.

“TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,” according to Pollsters,” the US president wrote on Truth Social.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, has called the flurry of Democrat wins a “repudiation of the Trump agenda”.

“The cruelty, chaos and greed that define Maga radicalism and are skyrocketing costs were firmly rejected by the American people,” he said in a statement earlier this evening.

“If Republicans want to keep blindly following Donald Trump into the abyss of chaos, let them. The rest of America is moving forward.”

Mikie Sherrill tells supporters in New Jersey: “I am in incredibly honoured to be your next governor.”

“I know how hard it can be to serve in these times and I just got a call from [Republican rival] Jack Ciattarelli, and I want to recognise him for stepping up,” she says.

This is greeted with both applause and jeers from the crowd.

Ms Sherrill says Donald Trump is “backing away” from democratic ideals, and vows: “We here in New Jersey are here to fight for a different future for our children.”

She continues: We know that no one in our great state is safe when our neighbours are targeted, ignoring the law and the Constitution... governors have never mattered more.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Left-wing New York congresswoman, is celebrating at Zohran Mamdani's watch party after the socialist's commanding mayoral election win.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez has been a key supporter of Mr Mamdani, and appeared with him alongside the former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to rally progressive voters a week before the election.

Zohran Mamdani has been urged to “stand unequivocally against anti-Semitism” by the US' largest Jewish civil rights group.

The Anti-Defamation League said the future New York mayor had a “long, disturbing record on issues of deep concern to the Jewish community”, and vowed to “ensure the safety and security of all Jewish New Yorkers”.

“We will neither compromise nor relent in our pursuit of our core purpose, to protect the Jewish people,” it added.

Mikie Sherrill has said it is “the honour of my life” to win the election for New Jersey governor.

“I promise to listen, lead with courage, and never forget who I serve,” she said in a statement on social media.

Brooklyn Paramount erupted into screams of elation as AP called the race for Zohran Mamdani.

There are chants of “Zohran, Zohran, Zohran” as Lean Back by Terror Squad blasts through the speakers.

I was speaking to tenant organiser Lex Rountree as the election was called, who burst into tears.

“I am beyond thrilled,” she screamed, tears streaming down her face.

Cheers rang out across Zohran Mamdani's watch party in Brooklyn when the Democrat was widely projected to have become the first Muslim mayor of New York.

Mr Mamdani, who was considered a long-shot candidate when he entered the Democratic primaries earlier this year, was projected to have won the race by major news outlets within minutes of ballots closing on Tuesday.

Zohran Mamdani volunteer Allegra Rosenbaum says she hopes the young politician's success will translate to Democrats and socialists being elected across the country.

“I think there's a pink tide coming,” the 33-year-old, who works in marketing, told The Telegraph.

“When Trump got elected I was really scared, but what Zohran did is he captured the political moment and he reversed it.

“He gave everyone in New York, well, almost everyone in New York, a lot of hope and I think that's something really special.

“And I think not only is New York watching tonight, the country is watching and the world is watching.”

Zohran Mamdani has won the New York mayoral race, according to multiple projections, becoming the first Muslim mayor of the city. The Associated Press, NBC News, Decision Desk HQ, CNN and Fox News have all called the race for the Democrat.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill is projected to have won the New Jersey governor's race.

US president Donald Trump had made a number of appeals on behalf of the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, but his intervention seems not to have been enough to turn the tide in The Garden State.

New York has seen its highest turnout in a mayoral race in almost 60 years, with more than two million voters casting a ballot.

The last time it passed that threshold, according to city authorities, was 1969: a few months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the Moon.

Just over a million votes have been counted so far. Currently, Zohran Mamdani has a lead of around eight points over Andrew Cuomo.

Zohran Mamdani's team are being tightlipped about plans for tonight, but they have given away one detail: tonight is a celebration.

Two members of his team buoyantly told me to have fun.

“It's a party”, one said, adding that they have booked the venue until 1am.

Republicans are starting to get their caveats in on the Virginia governor's race, arguing that it would be unwise to draw sweeping conclusions from their loss.

Chris LaCivita, one of the masterminds behind Donald Trump's 2024 presidential win, said blame the candidate and the campaign.

A Bad candidate and Bad campaign have consequences - the Virginia Governors race is example number 1.

It's worth noting that when Mr Trump held a tele-rally for Winsome Earle-Sears a day before the election, he did not even mention the Republican candidate by name.

Decision Desk HQ has projected Zohran Mamdani to win New York's mayoral election race, within minutes of polls closing.

Other news outlets have yet to call the race. So far, Mr Mamdani has an 11.2 per cent lead over Andrew Cuomo, his nearest rival, with 38 per cent of the votes counted.

Hasan Piker, the twitch streamer who once said America “deserved 9/11” is at Zohran Mamdani's watch party.

There is a gaggle of press surrounding him and hundreds of members of the press mill around the cavernous music venue.

Andrew Cuomo and Mr Mamdani's opponents have frequently attacked the socialist for appearing with Mr Piker during the Democratic primary.

Mr Mamdani said he found Mr Piker's 2019 comments “objectionable and reprehensible.”

Economic worries topped voter concerns at the ballot box, according to early results from the Associated Press Voter Poll.

It asked 17,000 voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City for the issues that decided their vote, such as security and the overall direction of the country.

But a year after Mr Trump won the White House by promising to bring prices under control and unleash growth, it suggests that he has not done enough to reassure voters that a cost of living crisis is easing.

Although the stock market remains healthy, hiring is slowing and inflation is almost a full percentage point above its two per cent target.

Add to that a federal shutdown, as Congress remains deadlocked over budget measures, and the economy remains the top worry for voters. In Virginia, for example, half of voters said it was there number one concern.

That could be a major problem for Republicans next year. They control the White House and both chambers of Congress, making it hard for them to say the economy is not their fault.

Zohran Mamdani has taken a commanding lead in New York with a little over a third of the votes tallied. Mr Mamdani has 51.5 per cent of votes, compared to 39.7 per cent for Andrew Cuomo and 8 per cent for Curtis Sliwa.

A CNN exit poll shows Mr Cuomo leads Mr Mamdani among Jewish voters by 60 per cent to 31 per cent.

Polls have now closed in the New York mayoral race. Zohran Mamdani, the socialist Democrat candidate, is considered a heavy favourite and according to CNN is “putting the final touches” to his victory speech.

Cory Bowman, half-brother of US vice president JD Vance, has lost his race for Cincinnati mayor to Democrat Aftab Pureval, according to projections.

Mr Vance had previously endorsed Mr Bowman ahead of the Republican primary in May, calling him a “good guy with a heart for serving his community”.

Jay Jones, the Democrats' candidate for attorney general in Virginia who mused about shooting Republicans in leaked text messages, is projected to have won the race by Decision Desk HQ. Other major news outlets have not yet to made a call.

Mikie Sherrill has been projected to win the New Jersey governor's race by Decision Desk HQ, which would be a key Democrat win in a state where the Republicans were thought to have a fighting chance. Other major news outlets, such as the Associated Press, are yet to make a call.

“We can unite for Virginia's future, and we can set an example for the rest of the nation,” Abigail Spanberger continues.

That comment could have be aimed at US president Donald Trump. But it could also have been an appeal to her party to embrace her centrist politics rather than those of Zohran Mamdani, the socialist New York mayoral candidate who is widely expected to win tonight.

Abigail Spanberger has appeared to address supporters after her projected win in Virginia, walking out to Florence and the Machine's “Dog Days Are Over”.

“Tonight we sent a message,” she tells the crowd, who roar their approval.

“We sent a message to every corner of the Commonwealth, a message to our neighbours and our fellow Americans across the country. We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.

“We chose our Commonwealth over chaos. You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities is safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian.

“Leadership that will focus on problem solving, not stoking division.”

Ms Spanberger declares she “cannot wait to get to work for you”, saying they have “turned a page... [by] focusing on practical results, playing out a clear agenda.”

We are a long way yet from getting the full voter results that will show exactly how Abigail Spanberger won the Virginia governor's race. But there are a few early conclusions we can draw.

First, her win came as no surprise. Virginia voters like to elect governors from a different party to the White House. And she managed to keep Democrats on board with appeals to abortion rights while winning over Republican voters with a moderate economic message.

Second, it shows that in purple states, such as Virginia, there is a lane for moderates to win from the center. Ms Spanberger is a former CIA case officer who, as a Member of Congress, railed against her party's focus on identity politics. She is not one of the loudmouthed progressives who seem to dominate the headlines and fundraising and chatter.

How much this matters we will find out later when we get the results from New York City, where Zohran Mamdani is very much not a Democrat in the Spanberger mould.

Maybe his radical zeal and energy in turning out young voters gives Democrats a shot in the arm. But Ms Spanberger's win shows there is also a place for fighting from the centre.

Ghazala Hashmi is widely projected to have won the election for Virginia's lieutenant governor, the second Democrat success in the state after Abigail Spanberger's win earlier in the night.

Gavin Newsom has congratulated Abigail Spanberger on becoming the first female governor of Virginia and flipping the state to the Democrats.

The California governor wrote on social media: “What an incredible win!!! Congratulations to the new Governor-elect.”

What an incredible win!!! Congratulations to the new Governor-elect @SpanbergerForVA! https://t.co/2DKfylXb0k

 

Andrew Cuomo's election night watch party in Manhattan is largely empty, according to The New York Times. Reporters and a handful of supporters are so far the only ones present.

Polls in the mayoral race close in 40 minutes.

By contrast, at Zohran Mamdani's watch party, where The Telegraph is reporting, hundreds of journalists are queueing outside the Brooklyn Paramount.

Democrat Mikie Sherill has taken an early lead in New Jersey, leading Jack Ciattarelli 54.4 per cent to 45 per cent with 12 per cent of the votes tallied.

The two independent candidates, Vic Kaplan and Joanna Kuniansky, have just 0.5 per cent of the vote between them so far.

Polls have now closed in New Jersey. The race for governor between Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli is expected to be significantly closer than in Virginia, where Democrat Abigail Spanberger is widely projected to have beaten Winsome Earle-Sears.

Polls have closed, and no matter the result tonight, I'm filled with gratitude.This campaign has been a love letter to you, New Jersey. Thank you for sharing your dreams and fears, and thank you especially to everyone who chipped in, volunteered, and trusted me with their vote.

Abigail Spanberger has been projected to win the Virginia governor's race by several US news outlets including NBC News, CNN and the Associated Press, flipping control from the Republicans to the Democrats.

By contrast, the race for attorney general is neck-and-neck. Democrat Jay Jones, whose campaign was badly rocked by leaked text messages, is under a percentage point ahead of his rival, Jason Miyares, with almost a third of votes tallied.

I'm outside Brooklyn Paramount with the rest of the world's media queueing to get into Zohran Mamdani's watch party.

There are hundreds of journalists here - the line snakes round the block. I haven't seen so many reporters gathered in this city since Donald Trump was in court.

The likes of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald once performed in the baroque-style former cinema, but tonight the venue will be packed with supporters hoping to see another star.

While the Mamdani campaign has booked an iconic venue which usually draws music fans from the five boroughs and beyond (Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant is lighting up the stage tomorrow), Andrew Cuomo's team has been notably quiet.

His spokesman previously told The Telegraph details for his watch party would be released this week, but nothing has been sent out, suggesting the former New York governor does not have big plans to celebrate this evening.

Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, has booked out Arte Cafe, an Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side.

Abigail Spanberger is maintaining her lead over Winsome Earle-Sears with roughly a fifth of the vote in. She leads the Republican 57.7 per cent to 42.1 per cent, a margin of more than 100,000 votes.

Abigail Spanberger has taken an early lead as votes are tallied in Virginia governor's race. With around 10,000 votes tallied, she has taken 62.3 per cent to Winsome Earle-Sears' 37.6 per cent.

Only a tiny proportion of votes have been tallied so far, and the race is considered too early to call for either candidate.

Jay Jones, the Democrat whose campaign for Virginia attorney general was rocked by leaked texts in which he spoke about murdering Republicans, leads his rival Jason Miyares by a smaller margin: 53 per cent to 46.6 per cent.

Polls are now closed in Virginia.

Polls in Virginia are due to close within minutes. Polls in New Jersey will close in slightly over an hour, at 8pm EST.

Turnout in New York's mayoral election has hit 1.85 million, according to reports. That means more people have voted in the current race than in 2001, which took place just months after 9/11.

Donald Trump has issued a last-minute appeal for voters to turn out for Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor in New Jersey.

“I just heard that 32,000 Orthodox Jews around Lakewood and Jackson, New Jersey, have showed up BIG for Jack Ciattarelli” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform. 

“My friends in this Great Community know how important this Election is to New Jersey, and to our Country. There is still time to vote! 

“I am asking ALL PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE GREAT STATE OF NEW JERSEY, including all Kollel and Yeshiva students who haven't voted yet, to please GET OUT AND VOTE FOR JACK CIATTARELLI. You can win this Election for Jack!”

The New Jersey's governor race is considered one of the closest contests taking place tonight. Polling has given Democrat Mikie Sherrill a small advantage over Mr Ciattarelli.

Polls in Virginia close in one hour, at 7pm EST. Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat candidate for governor, is considered a heavy favourite in the gubernatorial race.

Eric Adams, New York's outgoing mayor, has cast his vote for Andrew Cuomo.

“My vote is clearly for Governor Cuomo. We can't go backwards. This city's not a socialist city,” Mr Adams said, hitting out at Zohran Mamdani, who is odds-on to win tonight.

The mayor added: “The only message I can give to New Yorkers as I go to the next leg of my journey: I'm leaving you a good city... Don't mess it up.”

Zohran Mamdani stood on stage basking in his victory.

Dressed in a trademark black suit, surrounded by his security detail, he vowed not to abandon the young voters who had helped him.

He had won against all the odds, mopping the floor with his establishment rivals.

No, this is not 2025. This is 2004, when Mr Mamdani, the rookie, viral socialist mayoral candidate now on the brink of a revolutionary mayoral victory in New York, was just 12 years old.

Read the full story from US Correspondent Susie Coen here.

Voter turnout in the New York mayoral race is at its highest level since the aftermath of 9/11.

More than 1.45 million ballots have so far been cast in the city, where polls are open until 9pm EST.

Some 1.52 million people voted in 2001, which took place two months after thousands were killed in the 9/11 attacks.

That year, with incumbent Rudy Giuliani unable to run given term limits, Republican Mike Bloomberg defeated Democrat Mark Green in a close contest.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, declined to say whether he voted for Zohran Mamdani in the New York mayoral election.

Mr Schumer, a senator for New York, was asked whether he had cast a ballot for Mr Mamdani, the Democrat candidate whom he has refused to endorse, or Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.

“Look, I voted and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City,” Mr Schumer responded.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives and a New York congressman, held off endorsing Mr Mamdani until two weeks ago.

A Republican attorney general candidate in Virginia seems to have acknowledged his party will lose the state's gubernatorial race.

Jason Miyares has encouraged voters supporting Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat candidate for governor, to back his bid for attorney general.

“Dave's splitting his ticket - you can too,” Mr Miyares wrote on social media.

Ms Spanberger is considered a heavy favourite in the race, so much so that US president Donald Trump has not endorsed her Republican opponent, Winsome Earle-Seares.

By contrast, the attorney general contest is considered a toss-up after leaked texts from Jay Jones, Mr Miyares' opponent, showed the Democrat talking about murdering Republicans.

Zohran Mamdani isn't the “future” of the Democrats, Pennsylvanian senator John Fetterman has said.

Mr Fetterman was asked by Fox News about how Democrat voters should see the rise of prominent Left-wingers such as Mr Mamdani or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman.

“Socialism isn't my party's future, certainly not,” he told Fox News.

Mr Mamdani would be a “voice from New York City”, which is very Left-wing and “not really relevant” to the rest of the country, he said.

Mr Fetterman continued: “If Mamdani wins, I don't think he's going to be campaigning in all of the ... kinds of states that are going to determine... who's going to be the next president.”

Zohran Mamdani has attacked Andrew Cuomo for being endorsed by Donald Trump on the campaign trail, hours before polls close.

The endorsement “makes explicit what has been implicit for many months,” he told NBC News.

“Throughout the course of the primary, there were many of us who raised concerns about the fact that the former governor was running a campaign funded in large part by the same billionaire donors who had funded Donald Trump's campaign.”

It means Mr Cuomo, whose campaign has said he is the best candidate to stand up to Mr Trump, would be “too busy cashing cheques for his donors” to defy the president, he claimed.

Kentucky authorities have warned constituents they cannot vote in New York's mayoral race after being inundated with calls.

“We're getting calls about polls being closed. They are closed because we do not have elections today,” Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams wrote on X.

Kentuckians are next due to go to the polls in 2026, when they will elect a candidate to replace retiring Republican senator Mitch McConnell. They will vote on state officials again in 2027.

Mr Adams added: “Kentucky votes next year. You cannot vote today in Kentucky for the mayor of New York City or the Governor of Virginia. Sorry.”

In Minneapolis, Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey is seeking to fend off a democratic socialist challenge in a crowded race.

Mr Frey faces a steep challenge in today's election in a race that highlights different visions of how to govern in a liberal city confronting persistent problems with policing, crime and homelessness.

The incumbent, who is seeking a third term, is under fire from Left-win state senator Omar Fateh, who hopes to become the city's first Muslim and Somali American mayor.

Fateh has drawn comparisons with Zohran Mamdani, because of their shared faith and ideological similarities. Both come from immigrant families, although Fateh, a member of the city's large Somali American community, was born in the US.

The White House is considering signing an executive order to crack down on voter fraud.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the Trump administration is working on an order to root out the practice following claims of “blatant fraud” in California.

Ms Leavitt said: “It's absolutely true that there [is] fraud in...California's elections. It's just a fact. It is just a fact. They have a universal mail-in voting system, which we know is ripe for fraud.”

She added that there are “countless examples” of fraudulent ballots being mailed in under the names of “illegal aliens who shouldn't be voting in American elections”.

Taking to Truth Social earlier today, Donald Trump claimed without evidence that voting in the state's redistricting battle is “rigged” because mail-in ballots are leading to Republicans being “shut out”.

The White House has accused Zohran Mamdani of behaving “irresponsibly” after he accused Donald Trump of “trying to intimidate voters with baseless allegations of voter fraud”.

Responding to Mr Mamdani's comments, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary said the New York mayoral candidate's comments were “completely irresponsible” and are “based on zero evidence”.

“I think they are completely irresponsible and they are based on zero evidence, and I think this is just another example of how the Democrat Party unfortunately stands for nothing,” Ms Leavitt said. “All they stand against is President Donald Trump, and I think it's quite sad to see that we have someone at the top of the ticket on an election day today saying such things about the President.”

The Democrats have signalled confidence as election day unfolds across gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayoral race in New York City.

“We're confident, but we're not complacent,” Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) told CNN. “We're going to keep our foot on the gas and do everything we can in the remaining hours here to turn out as many votes as we can.”

Mr Martin said that the Democrats' focus on affordability across all three races will serve as a blueprint for the party as it looks ahead to next year's midterm elections.

“When we focus on an economic message right, and we focus on those kitchen table issues, we can win,” he told the news outlet. “It's when we get distracted or pulled into other issues that we start to lose connection with the electorate.”

However, he stopped short of suggesting that the part should model itself exclusively on the model of democratic-socialist Zohran Mamdani, whose meteoric rise has delighted the progressive wing of his party and sowed concern among centrists.

“It takes different types of candidates to win in different parts of the country,” Mr Martin said. “The goal is to find candidates who fit those districts and run them.

“There's no one way or one stripe to be a Democrat.”

Alex Soros, the Left-wing billionaire, has voted for Zohran Mamdani.

The philanthropist and investor, whose family is a frequent target of Republican attacks owing to their support for progressive political campaigns, said he is “proud” to cast his ballot for Mr Mamdani.

“I was proud to support and vote for the Democratic candidate for mayor,” Mr Soros wrote in an email to The New York Times.

New York may be on course for record voter turnout in the Mayoral election.

More people have already voted in this year's election than in the entire 2021 race, with eight hours to go until polls close.

Nearly 460,000 New Yorkers had cast their ballot by noon on election day, while 735,000 people voted early, bringing the current total to around 1.2 million votes. In 2021, when Eric Adams won, just 1.15 million people voted.

Voter enthusiasm may partly be attributed to Zohran Mamdani's ability to galvanise young voters, who made up more than half of early voters, reversing a previous trend in which early voting was dominated by Gen X and Boomers.

The record for voter turnout in a New York mayoral race was set in 1989, when nearly 1.9 million citizens cast their ballot in the race that saw Democratic candidate David Dinkins defeat Republican Rudy Giuliani.

Zohran Mamdani holds a substantial lead over his rivals with hours to before polls close at 9pm.

The Democratic candidate saw a record number of New Yorkers cast their ballot for him in early voting, buoyed by a surge of younger supporters.

Mikie Sherrill, the New Jersey gubernatorial candidate, said that bomb threats at polling stations this morning were an attempt to suppress the vote.

Asked about Election Day bomb threats at several New Jersey polling places, which forced some voters to cast their ballots elsewhere, Ms Sherrill said none of them were credible and that voters wouldn't be deterred.

“Obviously this is an attempt to suppress the vote here, and I don't think New Jerseyans take very kindly to that kind of tampering in our election system,” she said.

After casting her ballot alongside her husband, she told voters: “I think I'm going to do quite well today.”

New Jersey is one of the most closely watched local elections taking place today and is widely viewed as a bellweather on the mood of the nation 10 months after Donald Trump's return to office.

Polling data shows Ms Sherrill is leading her opponent Jack Ciattarelli going into election day, but the Republican has narrowed the gap to single digits.

Donald Trump has claimed voter fraud is taking place in California's redistricting ballot.

The president said that the vote is a “giant scam” and that cases of Republicans allegedly being “shut out” from mail-in ballots are under legal review.

“The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social. “All ‘Mail-In' Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are ‘Shut Out,' is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!”

Californians go to the polls today in a special election over plans to re-draw the voting map in the Democrats' favour.

The proposal, that could erase as many as five Republican districts, is designed to blunt the effect of similar Republican redistricting efforts in Texas.

Mr Trump has long railed against mail-in ballots, claiming that rampant voter fraud was responsible for his loss in the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.

Andrew Cuomo said he plans to make Muslims a “big part” of his administration if he wins the New York mayoral race.

Responding to claims he has stoked Islamophobia against his opponent, Zohran Mamdani, Mr Cuomo said he had met with “members of the Muslim community” and planned to appoint them to senior positions if he lands a surprise victory.

The former New York governor initially said Brian Lehrer had it “all upside down” after the WNYC radio host claimed voters will be furious that he came from behind by playing on what they will see as Islamophobia with attack ads against Mr Mamdani.

“I am all about unifying,” Mr Cuomo said, touting his record as governor.

The independent candidate has been criticised for his failure to condemn unsavoury attacks on his opponent, asking a recent interviewer if he should be expected to “respond to everything that is said”.

The Department of Justice has deployed election monitors to New Jersey and California, stoking controversy.

The DoJ announced last week it would send federal observers to the states following requests from their state GOP officials.

The election monitors will be in six jurisdictions: Passaic County, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno counties in California.

Democrats have criticised the move, claiming it could intimidate voters.

Passaic, a key swing county, is one of several regions to be targeted by bomb scares on Tuesday morning, causing some voters to be diverted to other polling stations.

The DoJ said its goal in deploying the monitors was “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law”.

Zohran Mamdani is banking on his policy of free childcare to win over late-deciding voters as they head to the polls.

Asked which of his policies he wanted late voters to focus on, he pointed to the cost of raising a family in New York.

“Today it costs a family, on average, $22,500 a year to pay for childcare for one child. That is more money than it would cost to send that child 18 years later to CUNY,” the city university system, he told WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer.

Mr Mamdani added that in just one year, the state recently lost $23 billion in economic activity “from families who had to skip shifts to take care of kids or left the state altogether because of how expensive it is to raise that family”.

On election day, the democratic-socialist candidate is leading his main rival, Andrew Cuomo, by double digits, according to most polls, having run a campaign laser focused on the cost of living.

Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor, cast his ballot at a high school shortly after 10am, talking and shaking hands with people at the polling station.

“I'm feeling very good. I feel the momentum is on our side,” Mr Cuomo said after casting his vote, according to CNN.

“I can tell you this, I voted a lot of times, first time I ever walked into a polling place and the polling place cheered for me. That's a good sign. And the record turnout is a good sign.”

Zohran Mamdani has said he will not be intimidated by Donald Trump if he is elected mayor of New York.

The self-described Democratic socialist said he would not cave to any threats by the president to withhold money from the city if he wins today's election as polls suggest he will.

“I look forward to fighting for every single dollar this city is owed,” Mr Mamdani told reporters on Tuesday morning. “I look forward to utilising every single tool at my disposal as the next mayor of this city to fight for the people of it. That means using the courts. That means using the bully pulpit. That means ensuring that we actually follow the letter of the law.

“But I will not be intimidated by this president,” he said.

Donald Trump has said that any Jew that votes for Zohran Mamdani is a “stupid person” in an incendiary post.

The Democratic mayoral frontrunner is staunchly pro-Palestine and has been highly critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, which he has labelled as “genocidal”.

The US president wrote on Truth Social: “Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!”

Mr Trump has repeatedly attacked Mr Mamdani, branding him a “communist” and threatening to withhold funding if he wins the election as expected.

On Monday, the president gave his backing to Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York now running as an independent.

Mr Mamdani has repeatedly denied accusations of anti-Semitism over his criticism of the Israeli government.

The bomb threats that forced authorities in New Jersey to close some polling stations and secure others were later determined to be unfounded.

Tahesha Way, who serves as the state's top election official, said the threats had been emailed to seven counties, including Passaic, a key swing county.

“Law enforcement has determined that there are no credible threats at this time,” Ms Way said. “We are doing everything in our power to protect voters and poll workers and coordinate closely with state, local and federal partners to ensure a smooth and safe election.”

The threats came as the final day of voting began in the state's closely-watched race for governor and a year after a series of bomb threats disrupted voting during last year's presidential election, mostly in battleground states.

Donald Trump has spent months demonising Zohran Mamdani as a “100 per cent communist lunatic” who would ensure the demise of his home city should he be elected mayor.

So when he was confronted with claims that the political rookie is a “Left-wing version” of himself, he quickly brushed off the comparison.

“Well, I think I'm a much better-looking person than him, right?”, the US president told CBS News. A deft deflection, but one that would not stop people drawing parallels between himself and the rising political star.

Both Mr Mamdani, 34, and Mr Trump, 79, began as political outsiders who defied the odds to beat their establishment career politician rivals to win their party's nomination. They are both charismatic orators who leveraged the power of social media as a tool to connect with voters that feel disillusioned and left behind by the two-party political machine.

Rather than be bogged down by the minutiae of policy, the two men also picked issues that resonated with the reality of people's everyday lives. They plugged pithy campaign slogans on affordability that cut through with voters struggling to pay bills and fuel their cars.

Andrew Cuomo received last-minute endorsements from Donald Trump and Elon Musk on Monday.

The president said he would rather see a “bad Democrat” win than a “communist”, while the Tesla billionaire parodied the mayoral candidate's name as “Mumdumi”.

Zohran Mamdani has attempted to spin the endorsements in his favour, claiming it shows Mr Cuomo represents the status quo.

Another big endorsement for @andrewcuomo. And it only cost $959 million in tax breaks. pic.twitter.com/p5pS3D0v9G

Donald Trump has urged Republicans to end the Senate filibuster, claiming not doing so will allow the Democrats to perform well at next year's mid-term elections. 

He posted on Truth Social: “The Democrats are far more likely to win the Midterms, and the next Presidential Election, if we don't do the Termination of the Filibuster (The Nuclear Option!).”

“If we do terminate the Filibuster, we will get EVERYTHING approved, like no Congress in History.”

The president has repeatedly called for the Senate to take action as the US government shutdown stretches into its second month. 

The filibuster rule mandates that 60 Senate votes are needed to pass most legislation. 

The Republicans hold a majority in the Senate - 53 out of 100 seats - but still need some Democrat votes to push through legislation, including Mr Trump's spending plan. 

“It is now time for the Republicans to play their “Trump card,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option. Get rid of the filibuster, and get rid of it, now!” the president said on Friday as pressure grows for the shutdown to end. 

New York City could be poised to elect a staunchly socialist, pro-Palestine mayoral candidate who wants to control food prices and almost double the minimum wage.

Zohran Mamdani's improbable ascent to the cusp of leading America's biggest city has sent shock waves through the Democratic Party, which is struggling to decide whether to embrace a centrist or a populist, Leftist path.

The 34-year-old has generated national buzz and comes with a string of endorsements from celebrities and big-name progressives, including Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Born in Uganda, his family moved to New York when he was seven. He is a fierce critic of Israel's war in Gaza, putting him at odds with much of the Democratic establishment, who see him as a potential setback in their effort to broaden the party's national appeal.

Mr Mamdani has promised to raise taxes on the richest New Yorkers and use the money to make city buses free and provide free, universal child care. He has also promised to freeze rent for people living in about 1 million rent-regulated apartments.

As well as becoming New York's most Left-leaning mayor, he would also be the city's first Muslim leader. New York City has not elected a Republican since 2005.

A post shared by Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@zohrankmamdani)

Polls close first in Virginia at 7pm ET (12am GMT), followed by New Jersey at 8pm (1am GMT) and New York at 9pm (2am GMT).

Voter enthusiasm already appears high.

More than 3 million people voted early in Virginia, New York and New Jersey – in each case far exceeding the totals from four years ago.

In New York City, there were 735,000 ballots cast, according to the city elections board, more than four times the number in 2021.

Donald Trump has threatened to withhold funding from New York if Zohran Mamdani is elected as the city's next mayor in Tuesday's election.

The US president has repeatedly derided Mr Mamdani, 34, as a communist, and on Monday gave his backing to Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York now running as an independent.

He posted on Truth Social: “It is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!”

He continued: “It can only get worse with a Communist at the helm, and I don't want to send, as President, good money after bad.”

A series of bomb threats have forced polling stations to shut in New Jersey ahead of the elections that will decide the state's new governor and New York City's mayor.

Authorities said at least two sites in Paterson city were shut down after threats were received, while officials are reviewing emails about further threats, some of which have been exposed as hoaxes.

New York has been gripped by one of the most publicised races in its history between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, and former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who is running as an independent.

Mr Mamdani, who has experienced a swift and spectacular rise from a relative unknown, is widely expected to win. He has centred his campaign around the cost of living, giving him a double digit lead in most polls.

Donald Trump last night threatened to withhold funding from New York if Mr Mamdani, who he has frequently branded as a communist, is elected.

The coinciding elections for governor in Virginia and New Jersey will be seen as even more critical gauges of the US political mood nearly 10 months into Mr Trump's return to power.

The New Jersey race has emerged as the most hotly contested campaign, with polls showing Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a congresswoman, holding a narrow lead over her Republican challenger, former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli.

We are bringing you all the latest news from the elections in New York, New Jersey and Virginia that will offer an early test of Donald Trump's agenda.

There was no defeat to be snatched from the jaws of victory.

The man who shockingly secured the Democratic nomination in June has un-shockingly won the election. Zohran Mamdani, the dimpled, wise-cracking democratic socialist, will become mayor of New York, America's most populous city.

For those with a taste for 11th-hour upsets in politics, there was little reason to anticipate a surprise. The Mamdani campaign carried the momentum from its primary battle, drawing the highest turnout in a New York mayoral race since the 1960s.

A highly-energised coalition of young white Leftists and new immigrant communities disrupted the traditional New York Dem voting blocs. In the end, it wasn't even remotely close.

It will be hard to resist the urge to see the result as a stunning endorsement of Mamdani's particular flavour of progressivism, bolstered by further blows against the GOP in New Jersey and Virginia.

Trump threw out the Republican Party's po-faced gatekeepers. Mamdani will surely hope to do the same for his own party, paving the way for a popular Leftism that doesn't care about winning over the centre and certainly doesn't care about the deficit.

But this wasn't just an election “won”. It was also brutally “lost”. It's astonishing that, despite his top-dollar funding, Andrew Cuomo felt so dead in the water so quickly. His moderate cred was shredded by the defection of several Obama-era heavyweights.

The voting public, too, seemed to be given the cold shoulder, even as Mamdani zipped around everywhere from mosques to bodegas. And what stunning comms strategy did the Cuomo campaign employ instead? According to Cuomo's social media feed, AI slop videos of Mamdani trick-or-treating.

There was a hint of #NeverTrump about the Cuomo campaign, which started on a delirious note and ended in fits of hysteria. Its failure to enforce basic message discipline (taxes, law and order, housing!) in favour of pearl-clutching hardly suited the public's obvious appetite for radical change on cost of living issues. Cuomo ran as if he were the establishment candidate who had somehow screwed up sorting his credentials – which, in a manner of speaking, he had.

All the attempts to portray Mamdani in a menacing light backfired horribly. His policies might be dangerous. But the man himself was rarely photographed without a goofy smile on his face. Voters just didn't buy it. For those fanatically opposed to Mamdani, it was a deeply frustrating situation.

The case for the Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to stand aside may have been strong, but demands for him to do so to help out a Left-liberal establishment Democrat who didn't bother to promise anything in return reeked of entitlement. In such circumstances, it was hard to view Trump's extremely belated intervention as anything other than a trollish twisting of the knife.

And why wouldn't the president engage in a little bit of trolling? He has little reason to fear Mamdani and his ilk. Each progressive victory makes it just a little bit more difficult for the Democrat establishment to resist the demands of its hyper-polarised base to shift Left. Sure, a guy like Mamdani can win in New York. But a woman like Kamala Harris can win in California. There's still everything to play for in 2028.

What is clear is that neither party can fight and win without a clear articulation of what their candidate actually intends to do. ou might sputter at slogans like “freeze the rent” just as many before sputtered at “build the wall”, but it's clear that turning out polarised electorates requires a strong policy offering.

Mamdani will have plenty of opportunities now to crash and burn. But when it comes to campaigning, he has raised the game for 2028.

Mamdani's win is a historic victory for the left over a powerful, moneyed coalition of forces that aimed to defeat him.

Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, marking a historic win for the left over a high-powered, moneyed coalition of establishment forces that came together in hopes of defeating him.

The race was called by the Associated Press just 34 minutes after polls closed on Tuesday night, with Mamdani nine points ahead of the next runner up, disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with 75 percent of the vote counted. More than 2 million people voted before polls closed on Tuesday night — a level of turnout the city's mayoral election has not seen since 1969. 

Mamdani, slated to be inaugurated on January 1, is one of just a handful of self-proclaimed socialists to win the mayoral election in New York City. He is also the first Muslim person to ever win the seat for the largest city in the U.S.

A wide variety of factors contributed to Mamdani's win.

His affordability platform consistently polled well as he made promises to tackle the rising cost of living in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. At a time when other politicians embraced the establishment's predominantly pro-Israel political stance, Mamdani carved out an anti-genocide, pro-human rights position more in line with popular American opinion on the issue.

His team's savvy social media strategy was notable, highlighting Mamdani's strengths as a charismatic speaker as well as his simple, repeatable policy proposals. He also received the backing of some of the country's most popular politicians, like fellow democratic socialists Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York).

But the success of the Mamdani campaign went far beyond what traditional campaign metrics typically measure. In fact, a traditional campaign likely couldn't achieve the things the Mamdani campaign did — like go from polling at 1 percent in February to pulling out a significant win against an established politician, much less scoring such a victory while billionaires, Republicans, and plenty of mainstream Democrats banded against him.

To the contrary, analysts have noted that a major facet of Mamdani's appeal is his bucking of the establishment. During the campaign, he rejected Democrats' tried-and-failed methods of electioneering, tacking to the left on issues like trans rights and Palestine, at a time when the party's popularity is dropping lower than ever. Mamdani's platform mobilized a huge number of supporters, with the campaign saying it surpassed 3 million doors knocked by Election Day. 

All the while, the Mamdani campaign weathered attacks from all angles — including persistent racism and Islamophobia leveraged against him from Democrats and Republicans alike. 

Major outlets from the New York Post to The New York Times ran hit pieces on subjects like his racial identity and, countless times, his stance on Palestinian and human rights. The Trump administration, including the president himself, threw its weight behind Cuomo, and congressional Republicans are pushing to deport him. Democratic leaders — including New York's own Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — broke with party tradition and refused to endorse him. Billionaires and other deep-pocketed donors gave $40 million to pro-Cuomo, anti-Mamdani super PACs.

Mamdani confronted these challenges head on, often in ways that subverted typical campaign practices. When Cuomo was endorsed by Trump, his campaign touted it in a tongue-in-cheek post on social media, saying, “Congratulations, @AndrewCuomo. I know how hard you worked for this.” 

As Cuomo levied Islamophobic attacks against Mamdani in the final weeks of the campaign, Mamdani embraced his identity. He directly addressed Muslim New Yorkers in the wake of hateful rhetoric from his competitors and current Mayor Eric Adams, noting that he pledged to fight for the safety and security of all New Yorkers. Many Muslims said that these words spoke deeply to the community, which has faced violent hatred, especially after 9/11. 

“The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” Mamdani said. “And yet, for too long, we have been told to ask for less than that and to be satisfied with whatever little we receive. No more.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

A 2019 statute signed into law by Trump himself requires furloughed workers to be compensated when shutdowns end.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A new message to federal workers sent from several government agencies suggests that the Trump administration may not give back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, violating a statute that President Donald Trump himself signed into law six years ago.

The message doesn't explicitly state that furloughed employees — those who have been told to stop working during the federal shutdown but will return to work once it ends — will not receive missed paychecks. However, it omits them when discussing how excepted employees (those currently working without pay) will be compensated.

“Once an appropriation or continuing resolution is enacted, excepted employees are entitled to receive payment,” a sentence in the message reads.

The message does not offer furloughed employees the same assurance. 

A similar message was sent to employees in October. According to federal workers from several agencies who received that message, it did not include the sentence regarding how excepted employees in particular would be paid. 

Federal law “provides that employees shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations ends,” the message sent to employees in early October stated. “As soon as possible after the appropriations lapse ends, you will be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations.”

That part of October's message, which doesn't differentiate between furloughed and excepted employees, was not included in November's message.

At least 670,000 federal staffers have been furloughed since the start of the shutdown, which began on October 1. As of Tuesday night, the shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history, with no compromise between Democrats and Republicans on a continuing resolution in sight. 

The message to federal employees is the latest indication that furloughed workers will not get back pay. Earlier in October, a leaked draft of a White House memo argued that workers may not receive those payments if they're not specifically included in a continuing resolution bill. Republican leaders, like Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, have continually pressed Democrats in the Senate to pass a continuing resolution that was passed in the House before the shutdown began, which would mean those payments wouldn't be included in the legislation's language. 

Failing to pay workers their missed wages would be a violation of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA), which states that furloughed workers “shall be paid” compensation that would have been owed to them had the shutdown not occurred. 

While the Trump White House is signaling that it may attempt to withhold these payments, it was Trump himself who signed GEFTA into law, in 2019 during the last government shutdown.

“The law is the law. That legislation was signed into law — and there is nothing this administration can do to change that,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said in reaction to reporting on the draft memo in early October.

 Why Ukraine's Campaign Against Moscow's Energy Sector Is Working

 Tatiana Mitrova and Sergey Vakulenko

In considering the many effects of the war in Ukraine on the Russian economy, few suspected that fuel shortages would be one of them. After all, Russia is an oil-rich country whose energy infrastructure is far from the frontlines; for most of the war, it has been Ukraine, not Russia, whose energy grid has been in the line of fire. Yet since August, when Ukraine began a concerted campaign to strike oil refineries deep inside Russia, fuel shortages have come to preoccupy Russians. By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's 38 major refineries at least once. As a result, Russia went from processing about 5.4 million barrels of oil per day in July to processing roughly 5 million barrels per day in September. Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel. By late October, additional strikes, including at refineries in Ryazan and Saratov, further underscored the reach of Ukraine's campaign.

With such results, it may be tempting to conclude that Ukraine is on the verge of breaking Russia's oil industry. But that is not the case. Despite the serious damage they are causing, the attacks are unlikely to change Moscow's resolve in the near term. For the time being, the Russian refining sector still has enough resilience, because of both its substantial surplus capacity as the world's third-largest refining system and its ability to repair damaged units quickly. The Russian government also has a variety of tools it can use to maintain a relative equilibrium. Moreover, for Ukraine, there is also the risk that the campaign will cause Moscow to step up its own attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and energy systems as the country enters the fourth winter of the war.

But the attacks on refineries could—if they can be sustained at the current pace—have far-reaching effects over the longer term. As Russian resilience is relentlessly tested, it is gradually being worn out. Although the units used to distill crude oil can be repaired relatively easily after every attack, they erode after the repeated cycles of heating and cooling caused by strikes. And as Russia's oil industry grows more reliant on government interventions for crisis management, the energy sector will become state managed and less efficient. In truth, the real damage caused by Ukraine's campaign is cumulative and institutional, not physical. Even as it strives to preserve short-term stability, Russia is presiding over the acceleration of long-term decline.

Part of the challenge of assessing the effects of Ukraine's strikes comes from the sheer size and complexity of Russia's downstream oil sector. Russia currently has roughly 6.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity spread across about 40 refineries, with the biggest clusters in the Volga region, the Urals, and around Moscow. Russia also exports on average two million barrels per day of oil products. Under ordinary circumstances the system has a fairly large cushion built in, even though fuel supplies can be constrained occasionally during periods of peak seasonal demand.

The current fuel shortages, which are the most notable since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, are not the result of only Ukrainian attacks on refineries. For one thing, the Russian fuel market gets stretched every summer by a combination of high agricultural demand, high rates of driving, and refineries shutting down for annual maintenance. This summer, demand was heightened further because more Russians traveled by car to avoid flight cancellations and train delays that were caused by Ukrainian drone attacks on transport infrastructure.

Another factor is that the Russian government has increasingly intervened in the country's fuel market in the name of price stability and inflation control. Its main mechanism, known as the “price damper,” is a subsidy that compensates refiners when domestic fuel prices fall below export parity. But as the government has become pressed for funds, it has increasingly shifted the burden of subsidies to manufacturers and retailers, using threats to keep the market supplied, as often happens under rigid price controls. Trying to keep fuel prices stable has removed important price signals for both consumers and producers and disturbed the balance of supply and demand. At times of low profitability, the biggest oil companies keep their own gas stations supplied with fuel but sell as little as possible to independent retailers. Independent stations and small retail networks make up almost 70 percent of the Russian retail fuel market but move less than a quarter of the fuel supply. They nevertheless play an important role by bringing fuel to motorists in less affluent and sparsely populated areas. When the big oil companies cut their supplies to independents, people in the countryside suffer disproportionately.

Nonetheless, the most salient cause of the shortages has been the dramatic shift in Ukraine's long-range drone strike capabilities. In 2023 and 2024, Ukraine rarely attempted to target energy infrastructure deep inside Russia, and when it did, it did not target the same refinery repeatedly. Throughout this period, only a few refineries within 250 miles of Ukrainian-controlled territory were hit regularly. Now, Ukrainian strikes can reach as far as Tyumen in Siberia—1,360 miles away—and Ukraine has been targeting many refineries across western Russia on a recurring basis.

Take the Volgograd refinery, a large plant with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day. It has been hit no fewer than five times in two months, with the latest attack coming just days after Russian repairs brought it back on line. Although these repeated attacks cannot destroy a refinery, they can keep it constantly in need of repair, stretching spare-parts supply chains that are already constrained by sanctions. Since August, especially, Ukrainian drone attacks have become more successful, thanks, in part, to U.S. intelligence. Ukraine now has both the capacity and the confidence to regularly launch large-scale drone swarms at multiple targets across Russia—successfully overwhelming Russian air defenses.

The effects of the attacks have also been amplified by the way the Russian refinery system is organized. Soviet-era planning created regional duopolist refineries. One or two refineries are responsible for serving a large area (usually made up of several oblasts and millions of people); when one is down, shortages ripple quickly across adjacent areas. This means that a successful Ukrainian attack can create a shortage for a large territory that Russia will have to then supply by rail from hundreds of miles away. And if neighboring refineries get hit simultaneously, these problems invariably snowball.

The real impact of Ukraine's attacks, however, is likely to come over the longer term. As with other aspects of the war, the battle over energy infrastructure can be won only by a carefully calculated war of attrition. No single strike will kill the system, but a sustained, up-tempo campaign increases the likelihood of cascading failures, longer repairs, and compounding losses of capacity. Unless Moscow makes a breakthrough in antidrone defenses, something neither side has achieved since the full-scale war began, Ukraine's efforts will continue to inflict damage.

In this sense, the overall outcome will depend on a series of shifting variables. These include how quickly Russia can repair refineries; how many times a unit can be repaired before it must be replaced; the number of drones needed to overwhelm air defenses; and how many drones Ukraine can deploy and for how long. Drone warfare is a numbers game. In any given operation, most attacking drones will be shot down. Their purpose is to saturate the air defense system; for a single attack to be effective, dozens, perhaps hundreds, of drones must be launched, each carrying at least 110 pounds of payload. The most effective attacks involve strikes on multiple refinery units at the same plant, and the same plants must be repeatedly struck as the damage from the previous raids gets fixed. Keeping up a successful campaign against refineries requires thousands of drones a week sustained over several months.

This is a game in which the attacker has the advantage. Just as Ukraine has been forced to do in protecting its cities and infrastructure from Russian bombardment, Russia cannot provide enough cover for all refinery targets and must choose which to protect. Shifting air cover from site to site over vast distances takes time. Meanwhile the attacker can switch targets at will.

Although its defenses have proved unable to hinder the attacks, Russia has begun to make other adaptations. Refineries are adding improvised overhead netting and shielding, for instance. Such measures may look rudimentary, but even small deviations in a drone's trajectory can be the difference between a dent and a catastrophic fire.

Paradoxically, Ukraine's campaign against Russian oil installations draws on the lessons of Russia's own campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure. Since the early phases of the war, Russia has targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt the Ukrainian economy and crush morale. In 2023 and 2024, Ukraine could barely keep pace repairing the damage as Russia inflicted it. Now, as Russia's offensive capacities have only grown, this has become an unwinnable race.

In March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tried to persuade Russia to agree to a moratorium on airstrikes against energy infrastructure—to no avail. In this sense, Kyiv's refinery campaign is partly a form of deterrence, partly a form of retaliation. It seeks to impose the kinds of costs on Russia that Russia has long imposed on Ukraine. In theory, this could force an informal mutual moratorium on energy strikes, since they come at high cost to both sides. But so far, the result has only been escalation.

For Ukraine, attacking refineries is also a particularly effective way to target Russia. Attacks on pipelines, fuel storage facilities, and railroads have had more transient effects: they generally can be returned to operation within days. But refineries, with their big and complex equipment, remain the more vulnerable and symbolically potent targets.



In recent weeks, Ukraine has augmented its campaign with a more multipronged effort to hamper Russian oil exports. Ukraine now routinely attacks pumping stations on pipelines that lead to export outlets. It has also expanded the scope of its attacks to third parties involved in Russia's energy trade. On November 2, for example, Ukrainian drones attacked Russia's Black Sea port of Tuapse, damaging a Turkish tanker.

There have also been several sabotage incidents against non-Russian ships carrying Russian crude, likely caused by limpet mines, although Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for these. Ukraine has even hit the pumping stations, terminal, and Novorossiysk offices of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium—which helps export oil produced in Kazakhstan through the Black Sea—with air and water drones. Such operations have a dual purpose. Militarily, they aim to impose costs and uncertainty on Russia's export logistics. Strategically, they are meant to dissuade third parties—ship owners, insurers, and traders—from doing business with Russia.

But for its part, Russia has also found additional targets. Until 2025, Ukraine transited Russian gas to European buyers, and as an informal part of the deal, Russia refrained from attacking Ukrainian gas production and pipelines. Now this arrangement is off, and in October, Russia launched a series of massive drone and missile strikes that knocked out 60 percent of Ukraine's domestic gas production during a crucial period ahead of the winter.

By late September this year, Ukrainian strikes had reduced Russia's refining production by roughly ten percent. Yet so far, despite the intensity of the campaign, Russia has been able to keep the impact mostly local and temporary. Fuel shortages and retail price spikes have largely been confined to particular regions—mainly southern Russia, the far east of the country, and Crimea. The Kremlin responded by imposing temporary gasoline export bans and partial diesel restrictions. It also redirected supplies and tapped reserves.

These measures come at a price. Each new layer of government intervention or control tightens the state's grip over the sector. Already, fixed margins, quota systems, and emergency decrees now define the operating environment for the oil industry. The Kremlin, for example, responded to the September fuel shortages by issuing several ad hoc executive decrees and Energy Ministry orders that prioritized deliveries of gasoline and diesel for agriculture, public transport, and defense needs; capped wholesale and retail fuel prices in several regions; and temporarily suspended exports of gasoline and some diesel blends to stabilize the domestic market. The more the government intervenes, the less incentive companies have to increase supplies to the domestic market. Although they may prevent immediate chaos, these moves are undermining the oil sector's long-term adaptability.

One of the most counterintuitive effects of Russia's refinery outages is their impact on exports. When Russia loses its refining capacity, it must reduce its exports of oil products. Yet it can recover much of the lost revenue by simply exporting the crude that would otherwise have been refined in Russia. For the government, this matters little, since it collects petroleum taxes at the wellhead. For companies, however, the losses from selling low-priced crude instead of refined oil products can reach $10 per barrel or more. Moreover, on October 23, the United States announced new sanctions aimed against key oil companies, including Lukoil and Rosneft; these measures are likely to put temporary pressure on Russian crude exports, compounding the strain on the country's oil sector.



Moscow faces a dilemma. On the one hand, high gasoline prices cool demand and bring the market into balance. On the other hand, the government has pledged to keep fuel prices stable, intervening to do so if necessary. Such interventions are costly and keep demand artificially high, but not doing them risks lower approval ratings and eroding public trust in Russia's stability.

For now, Russia retains enough redundancy and repair capacity to keep the system afloat. Yet the accumulation of damages and the effects of heavy-handed state management are eroding efficiency and resilience. Even if Ukraine cannot destroy the oil industry, it can force Moscow into making costly tradeoffs. Russia must decide whether to defend its refineries or its armaments plants; whether to prioritize exports or domestic supply; whether to divert resources to repair refineries as fast as possible or use those resources elsewhere. Each dilemma narrows policy options.

Thus far, Moscow's response to the supply crunch has been remarkably consistent: contain, control, and compensate. The Kremlin is determined to prevent visible shortages that could undermine public confidence, but the tools it relies on—export bans, fixed margins, subsidies—are locking the sector into stagnation. Russian refiners must now operate with little market autonomy; many are postponing investment decisions “until after the war.” Refineries are still running, but with deferred maintenance, rushed emergency repairs, and a mounting backlog of safety and efficiency issues. The result is not collapse, but quiet degradation.

Three variables will make a difference in the long-term fate of Russia's oil industry. The first is Ukraine's strike tempo—whether Kyiv can maintain or increase the number, payload, and frequency of drone attacks. Equally important is Russia's repair capacity, or how quickly damaged units can be restored and whether spare-parts shortages become binding. Finally, the third variable is oil prices and OPEC+ policy: a drop in prices, for example, would test Russia's ability to sustain both subsidies and military spending simultaneously.

If its refining capacity is further constrained, Russia can also fall back on lower fuel-quality standards, increasing the supply of naptha-derived gasoline and high-sulfur diesel. Such moves could help alleviate shortages at the expense of air quality and engine longevity. The government is also counting on Belarus to help, potentially supplying up to 30 percent of Russia's gasoline needs. But these fixes can only mitigate rather than eliminate the long-term effects of the impending oil crunch.

Kyiv cannot break Russia's oil industry overnight. But by forcing Moscow into constant firefighting—whether putting out actual refinery fires or preventing a second-order economic conflagration—these attacks ensure that Russia will have to pay an ever higher cost to maintain stability. For now, the refineries will keep operating, the pumps will keep running, and exports will continue—but with rising costs, shrinking margins, and a reduced capacity to recover from attack.

What Ukraine's campaign has exposed about Russia is really a deeper vulnerability: an energy superpower whose strength lies in infrastructure built decades ago, maintained through improvisation, and preserved by command rather than innovation. In the end, Russia's refineries are most likely to wear out under the weight of repeated shocks and institutional sclerosis—a quiet but telling metaphor for Russia's war economy itself.

 Peace Through Strength Is Delivering Stability and Security

 Robert C. O'Brien

Last year in Foreign Affairs, I outlined a framework for a second Trump administration foreign policy that would restore the “peace through strength” posture that prevailed during Donald Trump's first term as president. This vision of “America first” stood in stark contrast to the foreign policies pursued by the Obama and Biden administrations and the approaches advocated by influential Democratic strategists during the 2024 presidential campaign. Broadly speaking, they believe that the United States is in decline, and that this process must be skillfully managed through a variety of steps: unilateral disarmament (via gradual but significant cuts to military spending that harm readiness); apologizing for putative American excesses and misdeeds (as when, in 2022, Ben Rhodes, who had served as a deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration, wrote that “historians will debate how much America might have instigated” Russian President Vladmir Putin's aggressive acts, asking whether the United States had been “too triumphalist” in its foreign policy); appeasement (including ransom payments to Iran thinly disguised as humanitarian sanctions relief); and the partial accommodation of the desires of U.S. adversaries (as when, in January 2022, President Joe Biden suggested that Russia would face less significant consequences if it launched only a “minor incursion” into Ukraine instead of a full-scale invasion).

In 2024, having experienced 12 years of foreign policies predicated on these views, in contrast to four years of Trump's “America first” foreign policy, the American people overwhelmingly chose strength over managed decline and went with Trump. Ever since, Trump has been using U.S. economic, diplomatic, and military power to deliver on every aspect of his foreign policy agenda. He has demonstrated that strength begets peace and security.

Since Trump took office for the second time in January, the U.S. military has begun a generational rebuilding of its capabilities, turbocharged by an additional $150 billion in spending on top of its regular budget request for fiscal year 2026. Trump persuaded American allies and partners to commit to boosting their defense spending to five percent of GDP and to take on more of the free world's security burdens. The president has ended the chaos at the southern border. He has been unwavering in his support for Israel without conceding to Hamas and has revived maximum pressure on Iran, including by striking its nuclear enrichment sites. The war in Ukraine is also on the path to resolution, although admittedly at a much slower pace than Trump hoped, owing to Putin's intransigence. These measures have restored American deterrence and could usher in a new era of stability.

Many critics argue that Trump has weakened the United States' alliances, but the facts instead show that he has strengthened Washington's collective security arrangements by generating the urgency needed to get allies to make tangible investments for their own defense. Rather than withdraw from or weaken NATO, as critics warned he would, Trump is leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era. And he wasted no time getting this process started. During his first meeting with NATO's secretary-general, Mark Rutte, in March, Trump reiterated his position that allies must spend more on defense or risk having the United States reassess its commitments to the alliance. The response was swift and substantial. In June, NATO allies agreed to raise the group's defense spending target to five percent of GDP, with 3.5 percent going to core defense capabilities and 1.5 percent to other security and industrial base needs. Germany, long a laggard, now plans to double its defense spending within the next five years.

Last year, I argued that in a second term, Trump would “push NATO to rotate ground and air forces to Poland to augment its capabilities closer to Russia's border” and emphasized that “Washington should make sure that its European allies understand that the continued American defense of Europe is contingent on Europe doing its part—including in Ukraine.” In September of this year, Trump suggested that the United States could deploy additional rotational forces to Poland, signaling ironclad resolve against Russian revanchism. Soon after, Warsaw surged 40,000 additional troops to its borders, and France committed to joint air patrols over Poland.

European contributions to Ukraine's defense have ballooned. According to data collected by the Kiel Institute, which includes the months between January 2022 and August 2025, Europe's total allocations of aid to Ukraine averaged about $12.2 billion per quarter during the Biden administration and have averaged around $18.8 billion per quarter under Trump. In March and April of this year, Europe allocated about $23.2 billion in military, humanitarian, and financial aid to Ukraine—the highest combined total for any two-month period since the start of the war. A key component of Europe doing its part has been Trump's decision to continue providing lethal U.S. arms to Ukraine but only if that support is financed by European countries. Trump's vision of burden-sharing has proved not only feasible but also invigorating, strengthening the alliance without costing American taxpayers. Critics who decried Trump's “bullying” tactics have been silenced by the results: a fairer, more capable NATO that deters aggression from the outset. These steps are not mere European compliance with Washington's demands; they are driving a renaissance of the alliance.

For the next fiscal year, the Trump administration and Congress are aiming for a historic $1 trillion investment in our military. Together, the more than $150 billion for defense funding included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and the Pentagon's request for more than $848 billion could represent as much as a 13 percent spending increase over the 2025 fiscal year budget and will prioritize vital capabilities such as drones, artificial-intelligence-driven cyberdefenses, naval shipbuilding to counter China, and defenses against hypersonic missiles. This surge will align U.S. defense priorities with U.S. interests after years of underinvestment, ensuring that the American military remains the world's preeminent force.



Under the Trump administration, the Pentagon has likewise urged U.S. allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to match NATO's new commitments and spend five percent or more of GDP on defense to develop their own capabilities. Under pressure from the United States, Taiwan has significantly increased its defense budget for next year and announced its intent to reach the five percent target by 2030, and it is now seeking to purchase billions of dollars of equipment from the United States, including HIMARS rockets and coastal defense missiles. According to spring reporting by the defense news site 19FortyFive, Vietnam has reached an agreement to buy F-16s from the United States, a stunning development for a country with long-standing procurement ties to Russia.

At the strategic level, Trump is not waiting for Congress to lead. Through an executive order, he launched the Golden Dome missile defense initiative, which envisages a layered shield incorporating ground-based interceptors and space-based sensors that echoes the proposed scale of U.S. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative of the 1980s. The Pentagon is already moving out on development and planning for the deployment of the program.

Trump knows that deterrence requires more than a good defense. Last year, in Foreign Affairs, I noted that in a second Trump term, the United States could restart nuclear testing for the first time since 1992 to address Russia's and China's growing and modernizing nuclear arsenals. This September, China showcased its nuclear forces, including a new intercontinental ballistic missile, during a military parade that Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watched from VIP seats. In late October, Putin said that Russia had tested a Poseidon nuclear torpedo, which is designed to survive a possible U.S. attack and could possibly wipe out U.S. port cities. It should come as no surprise that Trump is not letting this nuclear saber rattling by Russia and China go unanswered. In a post on Truth Social in late October, he wrote that the United States would immediately resume nuclear testing on an “equal basis” with the programs of its adversaries. A tested and proven U.S. nuclear force will cause American adversaries to think twice about threatening or using the ultimate weapon.

In the Middle East, Trump's record shines brightest in its support for Washington's historic ally Israel as it seeks to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, and in the restoration of U.S. maximum pressure on Iran. Trump understands that instability throughout the region is a direct consequence of Iran's support for its terrorist proxies. U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities at Natanz and Fordow this summer crippled Tehran's enrichment capabilities without escalating to full scale war. Maximum pressure is strangling Tehran financially, starving the regime's proxies of the money and weapons they rely on to sow chaos. Iran's leaders are isolated, Hezbollah and Hamas are weakened, and the region is tilting toward stability. Strength, rather than the Biden administration's paralyzing obsession with “de-escalation,” has compelled adversaries to come to the table.

Trump has also positioned himself as the indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to other, often far-flung and long-standing disputes. The president's biggest tool has been his willingness to impose high tariffs or punitive sanctions on the recalcitrant parties, showing that the United States' vast economic power can be as useful as its military might in ending sticky conflicts. Last month, the Trump administration orchestrated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, initiating a plan for peace and rebuilding in Gaza, after repeated failures by the prior administration to secure the release of all the hostages and provide a postwar vision for the region. Earlier this year, Trump urged a cease-fire between India and Pakistan after hostilities broke out over Kashmir; brokered a peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; forced Iran to accept a cease-fire after 12 days of Israeli strikes; helped Cambodia and Thailand reach an unconditional cease-fire at their disputed border; and mediated a landmark agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan that aims to end more than 30 years of conflict. Hopefully, Trump will be able to add another peacemaking success, this time in Ukraine, where Russia—emboldened by Biden's hesitancy—has not yet recalibrated to Trump's resolve.

In the Western Hemisphere, the most critical geopolitical space for defense of the United States, Trump has overseen a surge in law enforcement and troops to secure the previously open U.S. southern border and threatened massive tariffs on Mexico and Canada to incentivize them to crack down on drug smugglers on their side of the line. Trump's strikes on suspected drug trafficking ships in the Caribbean are literally sinking the drug trade rooted in Venezuela, which is plagued by cartel violence. The president's interest in acquiring Greenland has driven Denmark to deploy the largest number of ground, air, and naval assets there since the Cold War, boosting the allied presence in previously unpatrolled territory and putting Russia and China on notice that the United States and its allies do not intend to lose the race for the Arctic. And in reaction to Trump's ire over Chinese meddling in the Panama Canal, Panama is reasserting its sovereignty and letting the Chinese know that it is time for their port management companies to go home. All these steps have meant less fentanyl killing young Americans, less human trafficking, less Russian dominance in the Arctic, less Chinese influence in the hemisphere, and a safer American homeland.

There is no doubt that Trump can build on these successes to make a chaotic world more peaceful. A strong United States, backed by partners that want to share the burden of the defense of freedom, will prevail against the autocrats, tyrants, communists, and terrorists wishing to do Americans and their friends harm. A stronger country will allow Americans to find opportunities to bring an end to conflicts around the world that were otherwise thought to be unresolvable. And with a U.S. government that understands the geopolitics of the Western Hemisphere, the American homeland will be safe and protected. On all these fronts, Trump is leading the way with a policy of peace through strength.

Live Updates


            • In the most significant economic case to reach the Supreme Court in years, the justices are weighing whether President Donald Trump acted lawfully when he imposed sweeping emergency tariffs against most global trading partners. Those actions have been challenged by a group of small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as a dozen states.
    


            • Throughout arguments, which spanned more than two and a half hours, Trump's attorney faced deep skepticism from several key conservatives — including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
    


            • As plaintiffs presented their case, Kavanaugh repeatedly noted that courts had previously allowed then-President Richard Nixon to use similar emergency powers to impose tariffs during his administration.
    


            • Both sides framed the appeal in existential terms, with Trump warning that a ruling against him could have “catastrophic” consequences for the nation's economic health. The companies challenging the policy say the on-again-off-again tariff announcements have driven costs – and uncertainty – to intolerable levels.
    


            A majority of the Supreme Court appeared skeptical of President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs Wednesday, with several conservative justices picking away at many of the administration's top arguments to defend the import duties in one of the most closely watched oral arguments of the year.
    


            Court wrapped shortly before 1 p.m., and in arguments that spanned over two and a half hours, the 6-3 conservative majority asked difficult questions of both sides. The overall cadence suggested that a majority at least had reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to impose sweeping global tariffs with no limit.
    


            “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in one key moment.
    


            Roberts and other members of the court's conservative wing had tough questions for the small- and medium-sized business that are challenging Trump's tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in particular, seemed concerned about limiting the power of a president to raise tariffs in an emergency.
    


            Kavanaugh, a potential key vote in the case, repeatedly noted that a lower court had allowed then-President Richard Nixon to impose global tariffs under a similar law during his administration – a historical reference that suggested Congress intended to give a president “tools to respond to an emergency in an appropriate way.”
    


            The court has repeatedly sided with the second Trump administration this year, including a major case involving the power of federal courts to temporarily pause a president's policies. If the court rules against Trump over tariffs it would be the first major break of his second term.
    


            The court is expected to hand down a decision by the end of June – or potentially sooner.
    


            CNN's experts watched and analyzed today's arguments in real time. Catch up on all of their insights below.
    


            If the justices rule against the Trump administration's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, will businesses that have paid the duties be entitled to refunds? That is a major question riding on the landmark Supreme Court case.
    


            So far, the federal government has collected $90 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged, according to United States Customs and Border Control data as of September 23.
    


            “If you win, tell me how the reimbursement process would work,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration. “Would it be a complete mess?”
    


            “We don't deny that it's difficult,” Katyal responded.
    


            He said the five businesses he's representing in the case should undeniably be entitled to a refund if the justices rule in their favor. But, once again, acknowledged refunds would be “complicated.”
    


            “So, a mess,” Barrett interjected.
    


            Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration's use of emergency economic powers to increase tariffs, said President Donald Trump can accomplish his goals by relying on other laws that more explicitly enable him to impose the import taxes.
    


            Those alternatives, however, are more limited in scope and, in some cases, have time limits. Here are some of them:
    


            Justice Samuel Alito teased the attorney representing businesses, noting that he had used an argument touted often by conservatives about Congress and its inability to pass off legislative duties to the president.
    


            “I wonder if you ever thought that your legacy as a constitutional advocate would be the man who revived the non-delegation argument,” Alito joked to the attorney, Neal Katyal, who previously served as the acting Solicitor General for President Barack Obama.
    


            “Heck yes,” Katyal replied quickly as Alito chuckled.
    


            Katyal continued: “I think Justice Gorsuch nailed it on the head when saying that when you're dealing with a statute that is this open ended – unlike anything we've ever seen – to give the president this kind of power? Yes, this isn't just delegation running riot.”
    


            Two conservative justices raised hypothetical questions to underscore the potential impact if the Supreme Court finds the law at issue doesn't allow a president to impose any emergency tariff.
    


            “If one of our major trading partners, for example China, held a US citizen hostage,” Justice Clarence Thomas asked, could the president impose a tariff “for the purposes of leveraging his position?”
    


            Justice Samuel Alito asked whether a president could issue a tariff against an enemy on the precipice of war with the United States.
    


            No, said Neal Katyal, representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration because tariffs – like taxes – are revenue raising.
    


            When the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decided the case against Trump, the majority ruled that the emergency law at issue might allow some tariffs in some situations, just not the sweeping ones Trump had levied.
    


            A concurring opinion, and a federal district court in another case, said that the law doesn't allow for tariffs.
    


            The questions from Thomas and Alito appear to be attempting to steer away from the concurring opinion's broader reasoning, which would broadly limit a president's power.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed Neal Katyal, the lawyer for the businesses challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, on why Congress didn't alter the language in the emergency tariff law — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — if it was meant to rein in tariff-raising authorities.
    


            Kavanaugh pointed out that the law, which Trump has been relying on to impose sweeping tariffs over the course of his second term, was enacted shortly after then-President Richard Nixon imposed broad tariffs.
    


            Katyal argued that IEEPA should not necessarily be viewed as a response to Nixon's prior tariff actions.
    


            By way of example, Katyal pointed to Switzerland, which is being subjected to 39% tariffs: “That is just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in our history,” he said.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts asked very punchy questions of the administration during the first hour of the debate, but he's now pressing the attorney representing the small businesses challenging the tariffs.
    


            It's not as easy, Roberts said, to simply frame a tariff as a tax – a power reserved to Congress.
    


            “It implicates, very directly, the president's foreign affairs power,” said Roberts, who is a key vote to watch in the case.
    


            Trump's tariffs, Roberts said, were “quite effective” in achieving the president's particular objective.
    


            That position is closely aligned with the administration's position that a president has broad power in the context of foreign affairs.
    


            One of the last questions before the plaintiffs' arguments began came from Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
    


            In addition to questioning the Trump administration's novel use of a federal law to impose higher tariffs, she challenged why all countries are being subjected to “reciprocal” tariffs to begin with.
    


            “Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain, France? I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy,” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration.
    


            Sauer argued the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump imposed are intentionally broad “because the emergency is so broad.” In enacting those tariffs, Trump has declared a national emergency stemming in part from alleged unfair trade policies practiced abroad.
    


            The long — and sometimes heated — round of questioning between Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration, and the justices, has concluded.
    


            Now Neal Katyal, the lawyer for the businesses challenging President Donald Trump's argument for using emergency authorities to raise tariffs, is making his case.
    


            In another bad sign for the administration, Justice Neil Gorsuch is pressing Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the power of Congress to delegate its authority to the president. Gorsuch, a member of the conservative wing and a Trump nominee, has been a proponent of what's known as the “nondelegation doctrine,” intended to keep clear lines separating the powers of Congress and the president.
    


            If Congress can delegate its constitutional authority to levy tariffs, Gorsuch pressed, what else could it delegate?
    


            “If that's true, what would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce – for that matter, to declare war – to the president,” Gorsuch asked.
    


            The point of Gorsuch's question speaks directly to the idea of separation of powers. That aligns with an argument raised by the businesses challenging the tariffs: that imposing import duties, by default, is a power held by Congress.
    


            Liberal Justice Elena Kagan appeared to take a jab at President Donald Trump's repeated declarations of emergencies this year as a legal basis to expand the powers of his office and implement his agenda.
    


            “You yourself think that the declaration of emergency is unreviewable. And even if it's not unreviewable, it's, of course, the kind of determination that this court would grant considerable deference to the to the president on,” Kagan told Solicitor General D. John Sauer.
    


            “And in fact, you know, we've had cases recently which deal with the president's emergency powers. And it turns out we're in emergencies - everything all the time, about, like, half the world,” she added.
    


            The administration is arguing that courts don't have the power to second-guess the president's determination that emergencies – like the ones he's using to justify his tariffs – exist. The same argument has been pushed in cases challenging Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations and his deployment of National Guard troops in major US cities.
    


            Courts typically give presidents a great deal of deference when it comes to cases involving emergency declarations, though several this year have rejected Trump's argument that, as an initial matter, they lack authority to review those determinations at all.
    


            President Donald Trump's attorney faced deep skepticism from several key conservative justices in early arguments at the Supreme Court over his sweeping global tariffs – a potentially troubling sign for the administration.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in particular, pressed the administration hard on several points, including whether the law at issue in the case authorized Trump to impose his emergency tariffs.
    


            Roberts pushed back on key arguments from the administration, suggesting that the language in the law – which permits a president to “regulate” imports – may not be clear enough to justify the import duties. Barrett, meanwhile, asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether the court had ever viewed the term to “regulate” to include sweeping tariffs.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, seemed skeptical of one of the administration's historical arguments: That former President Richard Nixon was permitted by courts to impose tariffs under a precursor to the law at issue in the case.
    


            The arguments are still ongoing and, often, the direction of the session can change with subsequent attorneys. However, Sauer has been asked to confront a number of serious and difficult questions from the conservative wing.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts, who has asked a number of questions skeptical of the administration's arguments, at one point emphasized Congress' “core power” of regulating taxes, rejecting the government's claim that the tariffs aren't taxes.
    


            “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Roberts said. “So to have the president's foreign affairs power trump that basic power for Congress seems to me to kind of at least neutralize between the two powers, the executive power and the legislative power.”
    


            The challengers to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have noted that American taxpayers, not foreign companies, ultimately pay for them. The administration has framed the tariffs as “regulatory” and have argued they are not taxes.
    


            It's early in oral arguments at Wednesday's landmark tariff case, but already there's been a key moment: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, questions the administration's novel use of a law to raise tariffs.
    


            “Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, ‘to regulate importation' has been used?” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, referring to language in a federal law the Trump administration has relied on to increase tariffs.
    


            When Sauer waffled, Barrett pressed on.
    


            In a testy back and forth with Solicitor General D. John Sauer, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back strongly on his argument that the emergency law President Donald Trump leaned on to impose his tariffs gave Trump sweeping authority.
    


            “It's pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president in IEEPA,” Jackson said, referring to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was enacted in the 1970s.
    


            “So it seems a little inconsistent to say that we have to interpret a statute that was designed to constrain presidential authority consistent with an understanding that Congress wanted the president to have essentially unlimited authority,” she added.
    


            In a potentially key early moment for the arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts is questioning a key argument made by the Trump administration to justify its tariffs.
    


            Roberts pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer on a case called Dames & Moore v. Regan. That case, which the administration relies on heavily, okayed former President Jimmy Carter's decision to use frozen Iranian assets as a “bargaining chip” to win the release of 52 American hostages.
    


            Roberts seemed skeptical of the idea that the administration could hang its hat on that case. That decision was narrow, Roberts said.
    


            “This at issue in Dames & Moore involved a different provision,” he said, “and it certainly did not concern tariffs.”
    


            Roberts should know. He was a clerk to then-Justice William Rehnquist, who authored the opinion.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the Supreme Court case on his sweeping emergency tariffs represents a “life or death” moment for the country, framing the stakes in stark economic and national security terms.
    


            The Supreme Court is meeting today to hear oral arguments over Trump's global emergency tariffs, and will also be deciding the limits of a president's power – an area in which the court's 6-3 conservative majority has repeatedly sided with Trump since he began his second term in January.
    


            “Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.
    


                    “With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.”
                





            The president tied the case to his administration's trade policies, crediting tariffs and new trade deals for what he described as historic economic success.
    


                    “Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump said. “A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them,” the president added.
                





            Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, as he often does during oral arguments at the Supreme Court these days, is posing the first question in the major tariffs case.
    


            He's asking why the “major questions doctrine” shouldn't apply in the case, as it has in several past cases involving former President Joe Biden, in which the court shut down that administration's policies.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts announced a few minutes after 10 a.m. ET that the court is kicking off arguments over President Donald Trump's global tariffs, the formal start to a session that will continue throughout the morning.
    


            First up to the podium is US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration's top appellate attorney. He is scheduled for 40 minutes.
    


            How the justices handle Sauer's presentation could be key to understanding the outcome of the case: If Sauer takes a series of tough questions from the conservative justices, that would be a bad sign for the administration.
    


            If, on the other hand, he takes mostly softballs, that could signal trouble for the businesses challenging the emergency tariffs.

            A motorist rammed into pedestrians and cyclists on the French island of Oléron on Wednesday, injuring nearly a dozen people just off the Atlantic coast.
    


            Within 35 minutes, the driver ran over five people, according to the French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez.
    


            Ten passersby were injured, CNN affiliated BFMTV reported. At least two people were seriously wounded, including a 22-year-old woman, the interior minister added.
    


            Police swiftly arrived at the scene and apprehended the driver “with difficulty,” CNN affiliated BFMTV reported on Wednesday, citing the mayor of Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, Christophe Sueur.
    


            He was taken into custody, BFMTV added.
    


            Authorities subsequently opened an investigation, Nuñez said. France's national anti-terror prosecutor's office is also monitoring the case, BFMTV said.
    


            Nuñez later told journalists at the site of the attack that officials need to search the suspect's phone records to determine whether the case will evolve into an anti-terror investigation.
    


            “Up until now he's not saying much,” Nuñez said on Wednesday.
    


            Some of the survivors will be evacuated by helicopter to Poitiers, a city in mainland France, the mayor of Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, Christophe Sueur, told BFMTV. There were no children among the injured, he added.
    


            After hitting several people, the driver stepped out of his car and tried to set it on fire, BFMTV said. He shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the attack, local prosecutors said, adding that they could not yet determine a clear motive.
    


            The motorist – a French, Caucasian national in his 30s – is known to local police for common law offenses, including theft and driving under the influence of alcohol, added BFMTV, which also reported that he was not known to French intelligence services.
    


            He has family on the island of Oléron – where he lived and started his car journey on Wednesday, Sueur said.
    


            In the aftermath, his vehicle lay on the roadside “with its front ripped off,” Sueur recalled.
    


            “It all happened very quickly,” the mayor told reporters. “I don't associate with him, but he is a person who is known, particularly to the police services,” he added.

            As the US passes the record for the longest government shutdown in history on Wednesday, civilian employees of the Defense Department — many of whom are veterans and military family members — are questioning how the agency is treating their federal service as some struggle to make ends meet amid missed paychecks.
    


            Eight Defense Department civilians, stationed everywhere from Hawaii to Germany, told CNN morale is low and falling fast as the government shutdown drags on with no clear end in sight. Several said they and others they know are actively looking to leave federal service after years or even decades of prior commitment, while others said they feel a responsibility to stay despite the increasingly hostile environment they find themselves in.
    


            Almost all of the civilians who spoke to CNN are veterans themselves. As of 2021, nearly half of the Pentagon's civilian employees were veterans. That can add an additional layer of frustration to how civilians have been spoken about and treated as they work side by side with those in uniform keeping the Defense Department running.
    


            “Me and my veteran friends are like, do they not know? When you disrespect the civilians who are working in federal service, do they not know that so many of them are actually veterans?” one Navy veteran who is a Defense Department civilian in Hawaii told CNN.
    


            “It's a slap in the face,” said another civilian who works in human resources overseas, and who is a military spouse and parent.
    


            The Defense Department employs nearly a million civilian employees, more than half of whom are continuing to work during the shutdown. A majority of those who are still working aren't getting paid. Hundreds of thousands more – 334,900 according to agency contingency plans – have been furloughed and aren't working nor receiving paychecks while the government lacks spending authority.
    


            By contrast, despite a lack of Congressional action to provide funding, the Trump administration has moved money between accounts to pay service members in uniform during the shutdown, though it's unclear where funds will come from for future paychecks. Unpaid civilians have in at least some cases also been the ones processing payment for their military counterparts, the civilian working in HR said.
    


            Each of the civilians who spoke to CNN said they find great value and pride in their work for the US military; several described a deep commitment to serving their country as a civilian after leaving their own time in uniform. DoD civilians serve as medical professionals at military hospitals, firefighters on military bases, intelligence analysts and teachers at on-base schools for military children, among other jobs.
    


            But they said the rhetoric around government civilians throughout this year by the Trump administration, and the seemingly constant efforts to cut down the civilian workforce, has left them feeling abandoned by leaders they say don't understand the critical nature of their work.
    


            One civilian – a military veteran – described concerns for US national security the longer the shutdown drags on. A person's debt and financial concerns are a key question in the process to get a security clearance, they explained, and many civilians are being forced to take out loans to stay afloat while missing paychecks.
    


            “One of the things we look for when it comes to counterintelligence threats, insider threats, is financial hardship,” the civilian said. “And I am in a building surrounded by super top-secret operations, and people who are running the f**k out of money.”
    


            In response to an email outlining the concerns civilians voiced in this article, Pentagon press secretary Kinglsey Wilson said the reporting was a “completely off base and partisan story devoid of facts.”
    


            “If [Defense Department] civilians are upset about anything, it's the Democrats voting over a dozen times to withhold their pay, making it hard for our federal workers and uniformed servicemembers to pay rent, enjoy Thanksgiving, and buy Christmas presents for their children,” Wilson said.
    


            Several civilians who spoke to CNN expressed exhaustion at what has been a year full of hurdles for those who just want to do their jobs.
    


            Being in human resources, the civilian working in HR overseas and their coworkers have become counselors at times, they told CNN, as people have been repeatedly pushed to tears navigating the stress of wondering how to pay rent or their child's college tuition back home. Suicide “has come up several times,” the civilian said.
    


            “It's humiliating,” the civilian said bluntly. “As much as I love my country, as much as I love my Department of Defense and Department of the Army, I have never felt so humiliated and degraded in my life.”
    


            While several civilians said they are actively looking to leave federal service to find more stability there is also a sense of anxiety with how their replacements might respond to the current pressures of working for the Pentagon.
    


            “I'm nervous about how they will behave when told to do something that maybe they shouldn't do,” a senior Army veteran-turned-civilian said. “I have the luxury that if I'm given an order that I feel is illegal, unethical, or immoral, saying f**k you I'm not doing that. I don't know if the next person will feel that way.”
    


            Almost from the very start of the Trump administration, many of the civilians who spoke to CNN said, they felt their value being diminished.
    


            Federal agencies began pushing buyouts and delayed resignation programs in an attempt to shrink the civilian workforce, leaving many angry and confused. Wilson said in her statement to CNN that civilians who took the delayed resignation opportunity, a key feature of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency effort that aimed to find massive cost saving across government, “are happy because they got a great deal.”
    


            Employees also began receiving instructions to send in five bullet points explaining what they'd done that week, with little to no clarity on where those lists were going, who would be reviewing them, or what it was exactly that they wanted to see.
    


            In her statement, Wilson said that in “all jobs, whether government or not, tracking metrics and submitting reports is the norm.” But the Navy veteran-turned-civilian employee in Hawaii rejected the idea that the five-bullet-points ask was standard, if only because there was so little clarity on how the reports would be used.
    


            “We had seen how our peers were getting let go from their jobs for seemingly not big deals, it put all of us on notice. The rhetoric in which they were talking about civilian service put all of us on notice – that we were replaceable, our service didn't matter,” the civilian said. “So sure, [the five bullet points] wasn't a big deal, but they had already proven that tasks that were not a big deal were fireable offenses.”
    


            Several civilians working outside of the continental US told CNN a deep sense of anxiety and distrust set in after watching counterparts at USAID, for example, get abruptly laid off and left to facilitate and fund their own move back to the US on short notice. CNN reported in February that scores of USAID employees around the globe — some in dangerous areas — were left scrambling and in shock as they were abruptly locked out of secure systems and left to manage the next steps alone.
    


            Another DOD civilian, also a Navy veteran who is serving overseas, told CNN that watching the dismantling of USAID was “terrifying,” particularly given the surprising nature of so many announcements at the beginning of the administration.
    


            “That really set the tone for a lot of us overseas, in a no-shit panic,” the civilian said, adding that panic has “ebbed and flowed” ever since.
    


            In February, the Pentagon began requiring supervisors to submit lists of probationary civilian employees for potential termination, while some defense officials started raising concerns that the broad firings could harm US military readiness and even break the law. Officials scrambled to create lists of workers who should be exempted from the firings because of their crucial roles in intelligence, cyber security operations or other important national security issues.
    


            The Pentagon eventually announced its intention to fire 5-8% of its civilian workforce, and thus far the agency has reduced its payrolls by more than 50,000 employees mainly by not backfilling when civilians have retired or otherwise left federal service.
    


            The civilians who spoke to CNN described what they see as both a total lack of understanding – and lack of interest in learning – what civilians do for the US military. One explained that civilians make up the majority of the military intelligence workforce; another, who is also an Army veteran, recalled civilians regularly being alongside him during combat deployments over the last two decades.
    


            The US military would “grind to a halt” without DOD civilians, a second Army veteran-turned-DOD civilian said.
    


            “You will not have intelligence feeding operations the way it's supposed to, you will not have operations planned so that people are where they need to be at the right time, you will not have products and materiel where it should be in order to engage in a fight,” they added.

            The ongoing government shutdown isn't just the longest in American history. It's likely the most damaging, too.
    


            Historically, the economic damage from shutdowns is fleeting, quickly reversing when the government reopens. However, the 36-day lapse in funding that began on October 1 is already dealing a significant – albeit temporary – blow to the world's largest economy.
    


            Millions of Americans are not getting food stamp benefits needed to feed their families. Roughly 1.4 million federal employees haven't been paid – even though many are still working. And investors and policymakers are in the dark about what's happening in the US economy because the release of government data has stalled.
    


            “The current shutdown looks likely to have the greatest economic impact of any shutdown on record,” Alec Phillips, chief political economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.
    


As the shutdown drags on, here's how it can drag down the economy



            Even if the shutdown ends by next week, it will likely slow down the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) — the broadest measure of economic output, without considering inflation — by 1.15 percentage points during the fourth quarter, according to Goldman Sachs.
    


            The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will reduce GDP by one to two percentage points.
    


            “Those effects will intensify the longer the shutdown lasts,” the CBO wrote in a letter last week.
    


            Although “most of that decline” will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates between $7 billion and $14 billion will be permanently lost during the shutdown.
    


            Goldman Sachs is now penciling in weaker fourth-quarter GDP growth of just 1%. That would represent a significant slowdown from the 3% or even 4% growth that was projected for the third quarter.
    


            Phillips wrote that the current shutdown is expected to result in a “much greater hit to growth than any prior shutdown” because it's the longest on record and is much broader than previous shutdowns.
    


            The 2018-2019 shutdown, previously the longest on record at 35 days, was only a partial shutdown, impacting just 10% of government spending, according to Goldman Sachs. The 2025 shutdown, by comparison, has derailed 100% of appropriations.
    


            The current shutdown also comes at a bad time, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management: “The economy was already going to slow down, and this just made it worse.” 



            Kelly cited a range of factors slowing the economy in the fourth quarter, including historically high tariffs, low immigration and the return of student debt payments.
    


            He added that it's “shocking” to see “how much public pain (Democrats and Republicans) are willing to inflict just to get a political gain.”
    


            The precise economic damage from the shutdown is difficult to measure, in part because of the information blackout caused by the shutdown itself.
    


            “We are flying blind in this economy,” Kelly said.
    


            Only one major economic report has been released by the federal government during the shutdown: the September consumer price index (CPI), the final piece of data required to determine annual cost of living adjustments for Social Security benefits.
    


            Other data releases, including the all-important monthly jobs report and the Fed's go-to inflation metric as well as key insights on consumer spending, have been sidelined.
    


            That's a major shift from the 2018-2019 shutdown, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics still received funding. That allowed the agency to continue collecting and releasing key economic data.
    


            Policymakers have been forced to make decisions with limited information. Last week, for the first time ever, the Federal Reserve decided on interest rates without the monthly jobs report.
    


The shutdown is complicating the Fed's ability to help the economy



            If the government shutdown continues to limit Fed officials' visibility, it could persuade the central bank to forgo cutting rates at the December policy meeting.
    


            “What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference last week. “I'm not committing to that, I'm just saying it's certainly a possible that you would say, ‘We really can't see, so let's slow down.'”
    


            Even after the government reopens, the quality of economic data could be eroded by the fact the BLS was unable to conduct critical surveys of businesses and consumers during the shutdown period.
    


            The shutdown will also likely inflate the unemployment rate for the month of October because the BLS typically counts furloughed workers as unemployed unless they find work elsewhere.
    


How to help SNAP recipients as the shutdown drags on



            The good news is most of the shutdown-induced damage to the economy is expected to quickly unwind after the government reopens.
    


            Goldman Sachs expects the shutdown effect to “more than reverse” in the first quarter, boosting GDP by 1.3 percentage points as furloughed workers return and delayed federal spending recovers. The bank expects that reversal to lift first-quarter GDP growth to a solid pace of 3.1%.
    


            The CBO estimated that some of the output lost due to employee furloughs would be permanently lost, costing the economy up to 14 billion in an eight-week shutdown.
    


            Of course, those forecasts for a rebound hinge on a key element of shutdowns: Federal workers are repaid once the government reopens.
    


            However, President Donald Trump has questioned the policy of paying furloughed workers – despite signing a law during his first term that has been widely interpreted as guaranteeing back pay for furloughed workers.
    


            The White House on Tuesday would not commit to paying furloughed workers at the end of the shutdown, raising the risk of lasting economic damage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The inside story of Zohran Mamdani's triumph and what happens next for New York","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/how-zohran-mamdani-won","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 07:40:10 GMT","


            The day after the home of Eric Adams's top fundraiser was raided, the new leaders of the Working Families Party, the coalition of progressive groups and labor unions, sent around invites to a secret meeting in November 2023.
    


            The left could see a way to beat the mayor they hated. They just needed a plan.
    


            Gathered in the common room of an apartment building in Long Island City: city comptroller Brad Lander, Brooklyn borough president Antonio Reynoso and state senator Jessica Ramos. Zellnor Myrie, another state senator who ended up running, was invited but didn't come. Also sitting there: Zohran Mamdani.
    


            They were all surprised to see Mamdani there.
    


            “Zohran? Is Zohran thinking of running?” Working Families Party co-chair Ana María Archila, who helped organize the meeting, told CNN as the votes were coming in, recalling the reactions that went around.
    


            “I was like, ‘I don't know, but I know he's thinking about who should run,'” Archila said.
    


            In that first meeting and several that followed, the other potential candidates closer to launching kept their plans close to their vests, but Mamdani was eagerly participating, pitching and proposing ideas.
    


            Over coffees, he kept saying they needed to find some candidate to run on freezing the rent. He built a platform and staff out of the Democratic Socialists of America.
    


            Last summer, Mamdani told Archila he was jumping in. He wanted to combine what Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Brooklyn city councilman Chi Ossé had done in breaking down traditional politics with compelling social media and a plan to knock on a million doors, he said. He asked when the WFP would announce which candidate it would rank first on its primary slate and told her, “Give me as much time to get there as possible.”
    


            Those days, Mamdani was still driving back and forth to Albany with his friend and close ally, Jabari Brisport. In the car, they'd alternate between belting it out to a Mika playlist and show tunes: “Hamilton,” but also “Dear Evan Hansen.” “Waving Through a Window” was a favorite, at least, until he ended up on the phone from the passenger seat churning through calls as the campaign got moving, and then more late into the night in the hotel rooms they'd split.
    


            On Tuesday, Mamdani stood on stage before a packed Brooklyn ballroom and a national audience, quoting the socialist Eugene Debs and declaring himself proud of all who he is, as New York City's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in a century.
    


            “Against all odds, we have grasped it,” Mamdani said, declaring the dawn of what he says will be the most ambitious agenda to tackle affordability since Fiorello LaGuardia was mayor in the 1940s. “The future is in our hands.”
    


            Mamdani's history-making run is reverberating around the world and through Democratic politics. His allies reject criticisms that he isn't truly a Democrat or that his ideas could only work in deep-blue New York City rather than the more politically diverse states Democrats will have to win to regain national power.
    


            “I don't think anyone had this on their bingo card,” said public advocate Jumaane Williams, who also attended the secret meetings — not because he was going to run, but because they wanted to prepare if Adams had stepped down and he had become interim mayor. “But we all said we're going to support what we believe.”
    


            But when he voted for himself Tuesday morning in a school gym, he came back to those secret meetings. On the ballot as the Democratic nominee, Mamdani voted for himself on the cross-endorsing Working Families Party line instead, an aide confirmed to CNN.
    


            A Mamdani mayoralty will mean enormous changes for New York City and its government. He has promised sweeping action to make public buses free and reduce the cost of living, including by opening government-run grocery stores.
    


            How he got here after his primary win and what happens now, according to CNN's conversations with three dozen advisers, politicians, operatives, donors and others involved in Mamdani's campaign and beyond in city politics, was more harried than a run against a disgraced former governor in Andrew Cuomo and a perennially kooky New York character in Curtis Sliwa might have seemed.
    


            “We understood this was not going to be the last phase of the fight,” Archila said, thinking back on primary night. “The billionaires didn't spend $30 million to just fold their tent.”
    


            The Mamdani campaign's post-primary internal polling surprised them: nothing, positive or negative, seemed to be moving voters in either direction. They gave up trying to win voters over, instead going with funny ads and videos parodying “The Bachelor” and “Survivor” that spread on their own among supporters — “We leaned into the vibes,” said one person involved with campaign strategy.
    


            Archila and others were a little worried about Mamdani's campaign by the end of the summer. It felt sometimes like the energy that powered him as an underdog had been partly drained. Having embraced an anti-oligarch message and a strategy of answering every question and going to every event, Mamdani took a vacation to celebrate his wedding, then returned to hold a closed-door tour of business and city leadership groups meant to chill them out and maybe even change some minds.
    


            Bernie Sanders felt it too.
    


            According to a person familiar with their conversations, the Vermont senator told his aides to push back on the Mamdani campaign's request that he just join for a town hall back in Sanders' native Brooklyn. They needed to stop the race from consolidating against him, Sanders argued, and he believed his celebrity presence could push that along. Marching in the Labor Day parade, he figured, would become a scene, get all the cameras to take pictures of all the elected officials standing around him and Mamdani, and in turn, force holdout Gov. Kathy Hochul to edge closer as they walked up Fifth Avenue holding a unity banner together.
    


            The day before, on the first Friday in September, Sanders stopped by Trevor Noah's podcast studio. He was walking out of the bathroom before they started recording when an aide held up a phone with the video just posted of Eric Adams at Gracie Mansion, calling Cuomo “a snake and a liar,” throwing the former governor in with Mamdani as “two spoiled brats” he was determined to beat himself.
    


            “All right!” the Vermont senator said, pumping his fist.
    


            Adams staying in, Sanders said, was going to make getting back  on track easier.
    


            “He's still going to drop out,” the senator said, according to a person who relayed the reaction to CNN, “but this is very good news.”
    


            Cuomo and his aides watched the same Adams event, trying to convince themselves that it didn't matter much if Adams stayed in, according to one person familiar with the matter. But the former governor had been obsessing about pushing Adams out of the race going back months before even Cuomo launched his primary campaign in February, running on a sense of perceived inevitability.
    


            “I've got to get Adams and Sliwa out and then I'm going to win,” Cuomo kept saying, according to an operative who spoke with him but didn't sign on to his campaign. “I know who to call, I know who to put pressure on.”
    


            Three weeks later, when Adams did in fact drop out — by then past the window when Sanders and Mamdani advisers felt it mattered — Cuomo's team was struggling to disagree. Sliwa never did. At most, an adviser told CNN, they now had “a shot.”
    


            “You're running against the Democratic nominee in New York, but he is a very flawed Democratic nominee,” the adviser said, insisting about Mamdani, “I don't think the enthusiasm is quite what it was in the primary.”
    


            On Tuesday, Mamdani beat Cuomo handily anyway.
    


            When Sanders came back to New York for a closing rally at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens on the last Sunday in October, he was feeling better about Mamdani's chances. But he had a different set of concerns, which he aired out in meeting after meeting in his hold room backstage, according to a person in the room. He waved off requests for selfies and handshakes and instead demanded more detailed plans from Mamdani's transition head Elle Bisgaard-Church and campaign manager Maya Handa. At one point, Sanders asked former Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan for her ideas on what to do at City Hall.
    


            A former mayor himself, Sanders honed in on the first 100 days mark, telling them, “They'll try to crush you,” and urging, “you've got to give people a sense of action.”
    


            Learn a little from Trump, Sanders told them: it's not policy or communications – but seeing them as the same and as producing results.
    


            “Have you done research into your executive authorities? Do you have anybody on that?” Sanders asked. Aides offered up ideas they'd been working on. “What else you got?” he kept saying.
    


            By the Saturday before the election, Mamdani and his aides could feel the win. And that was before he heard Barack Obama's voice on the line.
    


            Mamdani started by thanking Obama for his advice on their last call, over the summer, that he needed to focus on getting governing right. He'd been thinking a lot about it, Mamdani said. I want you to be a successful mayor, Obama reiterated, and that means delivering services and all the important basics. He needs to have more professionals around, Obama has worried in private conversations of his own.
    


            They've never met. It was only the second time they had spoken. But over the 30 minutes, the vibe as described by a person familiar with the call was real — no mention of Mamdani's past tweets calling Obama a liar and “pretty darn evil,” instead more in line with Obama's current mode of meshing his forever fascination with other young charismatic candidates and the new role he's calibrating as party godfather trying to make sense of the left's shifting politics.
    


            Mamdani also thanked him for his 2008 race speech, which he said had provided a template for his own Islamophobia speech two weeks ago, unlike an antisemitism speech he had reviewed and decided against giving earlier in the campaign. He caught Obama by using the 2008 speech's formal name: “A More Perfect Union.”
    


            That's flattering, Obama told him, but then he turned it back around: “The reason you have been so successful is because you have a deep sense of what you believe,” the former president told him, according to a person familiar with the call.
    


            Obama told him to come to him if he needed advice along the way. They made a loose plan to get together soon.
    


            Behind the scenes, Mamdani was complaining to one friend weeks ago that he didn't know why everyone was on his case to have a transition plan mapped out already. With his closest aides, he was already compiling lists of potential appointments to top positions.
    


            Some he'd talked to, some he hadn't.
    


            Calls started to go out Tuesday to people who've been waiting for weeks to hear back telling them to expect to be named to a Mamdani transition committee.
    


            Still unresolved is his surprise declaration in the last mayoral debate that he would ask police commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on. He later told CNN he had not asked Tisch herself if she would. Two potential future Mamdani aides told CNN they were aghast at the malpractice they believe it would represent if he actually hadn't gotten a sign from her and what that might signal for governing ahead.
    


            One person who is out of the picture for now is Brad Lander, the city comptroller who was at that first Working Families meeting and later allied with Mamdani under the primary's ranked-choice system.
    


            Once Lander's own primary hopes began to sputter out in the spring, he essentially rebooted his campaign as a Cuomo takedown machine, with an explicit strategy of doing all the bashing — replacing his ads with an anti-Cuomo spot, building every event and robocall script around negativity, so that, advisers calculated, Mamdani could close out with all positive and hopeful feelings. He even sent an aide extra early to the debate site to find the exact right seat to put the son of a man who died in a nursing home on Cuomo's watch during Covid-19 to be both in the camera line and in the former governor's line of sight. And perhaps most importantly, Lander figuratively and literally wrapped his arms around Mamdani, validating him to suspicious progressives and particularly to Jewish voters.
    


            But over the summer, Mamdani would confide he wasn't much impressed with Lander. Nice enough guy, but he didn't seem particularly effective as comptroller, Mamdani said. according to a person familiar with his comments. The two went weeks without talking, and though Lander would get defensive and blame overlapping post-election vacations, all his talk that he'd be the one really running the city next year had gotten back to Mamdani and not gone over well.
    


            By the weekend before the election, Lander's wife was telling friends at a party that Mamdani had called to tell the comptroller he would not have a job in the administration since he wasn't getting the job he wanted. By the day before the election, Lander was reaching out to major donors to solicit commitments for a congressional run against Rep. Dan Goldman, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            Lander declined to comment on his plans on Tuesday night.
    


            “I will say, you know, this is the start of something, not the end of something,” Lander said, “and it's — we got to keep going.”
    


            Even before Tuesday night, his opponents were doing their own planning for what comes next.
    


            Walking through Hell's Kitchen on Sunday night as part of his final push, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa predicted his own role after a Mamdani win.
    


            “I will declare myself mayor in exile, keep a strong eye on what he does as mayor, and every time he crosses that line — which he will — organize the opposition, protest, take all means necessary other than violence, and try to stop his initiatives,” Sliwa told CNN, adding that he expected Cuomo to move back out of town. (It's unclear whether Cuomo actually will.)
    


            While several potential members of the Mamdani administration have discounted what will come of Trump's threats to defund or come after the city, others say they believe Mamdani will be able to be a messenger that national Democrats need.
    


            John Catsimatidis, the billionaire friend of Trump who tried to boost Cuomo and failed to push out Sliwa, was telling people on a regular basis through the fall that some new development was about to drop against Mamdani “next week” and then “next week” again.
    


            Despite all that Mamdani tapped into and the campaign he ran, Catsimatidis says he's still looking for an explanation for what to others is so obvious about the candidate, and what he tapped into. He offered a potentially ominous prediction given the Justice Department's prosecutions of people Trump considers enemies, including New York Attorney General Tish James.
    


            “There's something more that we don't know,” Catsimatidis said, “and someday we're going to find out.”
    


            But for now, there's hope. US Rep. Ro Khanna of California, the Silicon Valley lawmaker-turned-Sanders acolyte who came to Queens the final weekend to speak as a prominent Hindu politician to a rally geared toward mostly Indian Muslim voters. He had to wait for Mamdani to finish speaking with Obama, spending that time to fanboy with Mamdani's mother, the Indian filmmaker Mira Nair.
    


            When Mamdani's SUV pulled up at Major Mark Park, he and Khanna only had a moment together. As Nair stood with them, Khanna broke out a little of the Hindi he knew isn't as fluent as Mamdani's.
    


            “Kahan se kahan,” he said, which means, “from where you started to where you are now.”
    


            Mamdani gave him one of his big smiles.

Democrat Zohran Mamdani has been elected New York City's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in generations. Supporters on Tuesday night spoke about feeling hopeful and represented.

Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City on Tuesday, capping a stunning ascent for the 34-year-old, far-left state lawmaker, who promised to transform the government to restore power to the working class and fight back against a hostile Trump administration. Mamdani must now navigate the unending demands of America's biggest city and deliver on ambitious — skeptics say unrealistic — campaign promises.

Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Zohran Mamdani's most prominent backers, said New Yorkers would fight back following mayoral race victory.

NEW YORK (AP) — Fresh off winning New York City's mayoral election, Zohran Mamdani announced Wednesday that a team including former city and federal officials — all women — would steer his transition to City Hall, and that he would “work every day to honor the trust that I now hold.”

“I and my team will build a City Hall capable of delivering on the promises of this campaign,” the mayor-elect said at a news conference, vowing that his administration would be both compassionate and capable.

He named political strategist Elana Leopold as executive director of the transition team. She will work with United Way of New York City President Grace Bonilla; former Deputy Mayor Melanie Hartzog, who was also a city budget official; former Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan; and former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer.

With his win over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, the 34-year-old democratic socialist will soon become the city's first Muslim mayor, the first of South Asian heritage, the first born in Africa and the youngest mayor in more than a century.

He now faces the task of following through on his ambitious affordability agenda while navigating the bureaucratic challenges of City Hall and a hostile Trump administration. 

“I'm confident in delivering these same policies that we ran on for the last year,” he said in an interview earlier Wednesday on cable news channel NY1.




More than 2 million New Yorkers cast ballots in the contest, the largest turnout in a mayoral race in more than 50 years, according to the city's Board of Elections. With roughly 90% of the votes counted, Mamdani held an approximately 9 percentage point lead over Cuomo.

Mamdani, who was criticized throughout the campaign for his thin resume, will now have to begin staffing his incoming administration and planning how to accomplish the ambitious but polarizing agenda that drove him to victory.

Among the campaign's promises are free child care, free city bus service, city-run grocery stores and a new Department of Community Safety that would expand on an existing city initiative that sends mental health care workers, rather than police, to handle certain emergency calls. It is unclear how Mamdani will pay for such initiatives, given Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul's steadfast opposition to his calls to raise taxes on wealthy people.

On Wednesday, he touted his support from Hochul and other state leaders as “endorsements of an agenda of affordability.”

His decisions around the leadership of the New York Police Department will also be closely watched. Mamdani was a fierce critic of the department in 2020, calling for “this rogue agency” to be defunded and slamming it as “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” He has since apologized for those comments and has said he will ask the current NYPD commissioner to stay on the job.

Mamdani has already faced scrutiny from national Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who have eagerly cast him as a threat and the face of a more radical Democratic Party that is out of step with mainstream America. Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding to the city — and even take it over — if Mamdani won.

”…AND SO IT BEGINS!” the president posted late Tuesday to his Truth Social site.

Mamdani, for his part, said at his news conference that “New Yorkers are facing twin crises in this moment: an authoritarian administration and an affordability crisis,” and that he would tackle both.

While saying he was committed to “Trump-proofing” the city — to protect poor residents against “the man who has the most power in this country,” as he explained — the mayor-elect also reiterated that he was interested in talking to the president about ”ways that we can work together to serve New Yorkers.” That could mean discussing the cost of living or the effect of cuts to the SNAP food aid program amid the federal government shutdown, Mamdani suggested.

“I will not mince my words when it comes to President Trump … and I will also always do so while leaving a door open to have that conversation,” Mamdani added.

Mamdani also said during his news conference and interviews that he had not heard from Cuomo or the city's outgoing mayor, Eric Adams. He did speak with Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.

A spokesperson for Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, said he would “let their respective speeches be the measuring stick for grace and leave it at that.”

In his victory speech to supporters, Mamdani wished Cuomo the best in private life, before adding: “Let tonight be the final time I utter his name, as we turn the page on a politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few.”

Asked about the comments Wednesday on NY1, Mamdani said he was “quite disappointed in the nature of the bigotry and the racism we saw in the final weeks.” He noted the millions of dollars in attack ads that were spent against him, some of which played into Islamophobic tropes.

The new congressional map that California voters approved marked a victory for Democrats in the national redistricting battle playing out ahead of the 2026 midterm election. But Republicans are still ahead in the fight. 

The unusual mid-decade redistricting fray began this summer when President Donald Trump urged Republican-led states to reshape their voting districts to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in next year's election. Democrats need to gain just three seats to win the chamber and impede Trump's agenda.




Texas responded first with a new U.S. House map aimed at helping Republicans win up to five additional seats. Proposition 50, which California voters supported Tuesday, reshapes congressional districts to give Democrats a shot at winning five more seats.

If the 2026 election goes according to the redistricting projections, Democrats in California and Republicans in Texas could cancel each other's gains.

But Republicans could still be ahead by four seats in the redistricting battle. New districts adopted in Missouri and North Carolina could help Republicans win one additional seat in each state. And a new U.S. House map approved last week in Ohio boosts Republicans' chances to win two additional seats.

Some big uncertainties remain. Several Ohio districts are so competitive that Democrats believe they, too, have a chance at winning them. Lawsuits persist in Missouri and North Carolina. And Missouri's redistricting law faces a referendum petition that, if successful, would suspend the new map until it's put to a statewide vote. 

Republican legal challenges are likely to continue against California's new districts, which impose boundaries drawn by the Democratic-led Legislature in place of those adopted after the 2020 census by an independent citizens commission.

But candidates can't afford to wait to ramp up campaigns in the new districts.

Though Democrats could win up to 48 of California's 52 U.S. House seats, several districts are closely divided between Democratic and Republican voters.

“Some of the Democratic districts are probably going to vote blue, but I wouldn't call them locks,” said J. Miles Coleman, of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “You could still have some expensive races,” Coleman added.

Republicans who control the Legislature chose not to convene a special session on redistricting Monday, after Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun had called for it. But efforts to round up enough votes continue. Lawmakers now are planning to consider redistricting during a rare December regular session. 

Republicans currently hold seven of Indiana's nine U.S. House seats and could attempt to gain one or two more through redistricting.

Kansas Republican lawmakers had been collecting signatures from colleagues to call themselves into a special session to try to draw an additional Republican-leaning congressional district. But some lawmakers remained reluctant, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins ended the effort Tuesday. 

Redistricting could still come up during Kansas' regular legislative session that begins Jan. 12.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said he hopes approval of California's redistricting “sends a chilling effect on Republicans who are trying to do this around the country.” But “if the Republicans continue to do this, we will respond in kind each and every step of the way,” Martin said.

On Tuesday, Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced a commission on congressional redistricting, even though the Democratic Senate president has said his chamber won't move forward with redistricting because of concerns the effort to gain another Democratic seat could backfire.

National Democrats also want Illinois lawmakers to redistrict to gain an additional House seat. But lawmakers thus far have resisted, citing concerns about the effect on representation for Black residents. 

Virginia's Democratic-led legislature recently endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment allowing mid-decade redistricting. But it needs another round of legislative approval early next year before going to voters. Democrats currently hold six of Virginia's 11 U.S. House seats and could try to gain two or three more by redistricting, though no specific plan has been released.

Over the past 90 years, when the president's party has held a House majority, that party has lost an average of more than 30 seats in midterm elections. No amount of Republican redistricting this year could offset a loss of that size. But the 2026 election may not be average. 

Those past swings were so large partly because the president's party often held large House majorities, which meant more competitive seats were at risk.

The Republicans' current slim majority is most similar to GOP margins during the 2002 midterm election under President George W. Bush and Democrats' margins during the 2022 midterm under President Joe Biden. Republicans gained eight seats in 2002, when Bush was widely popular after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Democrats lost nine seats in 2022, when Biden's approval rating was well under 50%, as Trump's is today.

If next year's swing is similarly small, a gain of just half-dozen to a dozen seats through redistricting could make a difference in which party wins the House. 

“Because we have this tiny numerical sliver separating a Democratic majority from a Republican majority, the stakes are incredibly high — even in a single state considering whether to redraw its districts,” said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College.

The battle to redraw congressional voting districts for partisan advantage isn't likely to end with the 2026 election. 

The Republican State Leadership Committee, which supports GOP candidates in state legislative races, warned in a recent memo that “the redistricting arms race has escalated to an every cycle fight” — no longer centered around each decennial census. 

Democratic lawmakers in New York are pursuing a proposed constitutional amendment that could allow redistricting ahead of the 2028 election. Several states currently under split partisan control also could pursue congressional redistricting before 2028 if next year's election shifts the balance of power so one party controls both the legislature and governor's office.

“It's important to recognize that the fight for 2027 redistricting — and the U.S. House in 2028 — has already started,” RSLC President Edith Jorge-Tuñón wrote.

Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that she had pressed charges against a man after being harassed in the street. The man has been arrested.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — What should have been a five-minute time-saving walk from Mexico's National Palace to the Education Ministry for President Claudia Sheinbaum has become a stomach-churning viral moment after a video captured a drunk man groping the president.

The brief clip has given the daily harassment and assaults that women suffer in Mexico their highest-profile platform. And on Wednesday, Sheinbaum used her daily press briefing to say that she had pressed charges against the man. 

She also called on states to look at their laws and procedures to make it easier for women to report such assaults and said Mexicans needed to hear a “loud and clear, no, women's personal space must not be violated.”

Sheinbaum said she felt a responsibility to press charges, because if not, where would that leave Mexican women? “If this is done to the president, what is going to happen to all of the young women in our country?”

Indeed, if Mexico's president cannot be in the street for five minutes without a man approaching her from behind, putting his hands on her body and leaning in for a kiss, then it's not difficult to imagine what women with hours-long commutes on public transportation are experiencing daily.

“I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,” she said. 

She said she had similar experiences of harassment when she was 12 years old and using public transportation to get to school. As president, she said, she felt like she had a responsibility to all women.




Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada had announced overnight that the man had been arrested.

The incident immediately raised questions about the president's security, but Sheinbaum dismissed any suggestion that she would increase her security or change how she interacts with people.

She explained that she and her team had decided to walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry to save time. She said they could walk it in five minutes, rather than taking a 20-minute car ride. 

Brugada used some of Sheinbaum's own language about being elected Mexico's first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman – in this case Mexico's most powerful – is an assault on all women.

When Sheinbaum was elected, she said that it wasn't just her coming to power, it was all women. Brugada said that was “not a slogan, it's a commitment to not look the other way, to not allow misogyny to continue to be veiled in habits, to not accept a single additional humiliation, not another abuse, not a single femicide more.”

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The opposition leader in the Ugandan Parliament sees the Ugandan-born Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral race as an inspiring political shift but somehow too distant for many Africans at home. 

“It's a big encouragement even to us here in Uganda that it's possible,” said Joel Ssenyonyi, who represents an area of the Ugandan capital of Kampala. “But we have a long way to get there.”

Uganda, where Mamdani was born in 1991, has had the same president for nearly four decades, despite attempts by multiple opposition leaders to defeat him in elections. President Yoweri Museveni, an authoritarian who is up for reelection in January, has rejected calls to retire, leading to fears of a volatile political transition. His most prominent challenger is a 43-year-old entertainer known as Bobi Wine, who charges he was cheated in the 2021 election.

Mamdani lived his early years in Uganda. He left Uganda at the age of 5 to follow his father, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani, in South Africa and later moved to the United States. He kept his Ugandan citizenship even after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018.

His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, whose work has been nominated for an Academy Award. The family maintains a home in Kampala, to which they regularly return and visited earlier this year to celebrate Mamdani's marriage. 




The elder Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, is known as a demanding teacher and a key influence in the son's outlook as a leading scholar in the field of postcolonial studies. 

He has written critically of the Museveni government. His most recent book — “Slow Poison,” published in October by Harvard University Press — has juxtaposed the legacies of Museveni and late dictator Idi Amin, who is blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans between 1971 and 1979. He argues that both leaders made violence central to their success and that while Amin retained popular support and didn't die a millionaire, Museveni's family is immensely wealthy while he's no longer popular. 

Robert Kabushenga, a retired media executive who is friendly with the Mamdani family, said Zohran Mamdani, like his parents, is unconventional. He “follows a tradition of very honest and clear thinkers who are willing to reimagine the politics,” said Kabushenga. “(His father) must be pleasantly surprised.”

Mamdani's victory in New York offers “a beacon of hope” for embattled activists and others in Uganda. The lesson is that “we should allow young people the opportunity to shape, and participate in, politics in a meaningful way,” Kabushenga said. 

Okello Ogwang, a professor of literature who has worked with the elder Mamdani at Uganda's Makerere University, said the son's success abroad means “it's an important thing that we should invest in the youth.”

“He's coming from here,” he said. “If we don't invest in our youth, we are wasting our time.”

As a shy and soft-spoken teenager, Mamdani was briefly interested in a possible career as a newsman and later was part the rap ensemble Young Cardamom and HAB, whose eccentric music videos set in Kampala can still be viewed online. 

Before he became a New York assembly member in 2021, the self-described democratic socialist was a community activist in the New York borough of Queens, helping vulnerable homeowners facing eviction. 

His mayoral campaign, whose success in the Democratic primary sent a shockwave through the political world, focused on lowering the cost of living, promising free city buses, free child care, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartments and government-run grocery stores, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. Some Republicans have called for his denaturalization and deportation. 

“He breaks new ground,” said Kabushenga. “He is willing to try in places that are new.”

Ssenyonyi, the Ugandan lawmaker, said Mamdani's unlikely victory, as remote for Ugandans as it seems, deserves to be celebrated. 

“It inspires us,” he said. “Mamdani is Ugandan-born, like us.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — First responders were searching for more victims Wednesday after a UPS cargo plane crashed and exploded in a massive fireball at the company's global aviation hub in Kentucky, killing at least nine people, authorities said.

Gov. Andy Beshear again predicted the death toll in Louisville would grow and said 16 families gathered at a reunification center “have reported loved ones unaccounted for.” 

The plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. Tuesday as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Video showed flames on the plane's left wing and a trail of smoke. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team of investigators. 

“Thankfully, a local restaurant that is right there ... was missed and now is helping the search and rescue,” Beshear said during a news conference Wednesday. “Another blessing is this plane could have potentially hit the major Ford factory or the convention center, those are all close by, and did not.”

There were “extra smaller explosions” at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling, but it could have been worse, the governor said. Grade A Auto Parts was also hit.

University of Louisville Hospital said two people were in critical condition in the burn unit Wednesday and that 13 others had been treated and discharged. Norton Hospital said it had released three people.

The airport is 7 miles (11.2 kilometers) from downtown Louisville, close to the Indiana state line, residential areas, a water park and museums. A shelter-in-place order was in effect for a quarter of a mile (400-meter) radius, as officials monitored air quality. People in the immediate area were told not to drink tap water.

Beshear said he didn't know the status of the three crew members aboard the plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 made in 1991. It wasn't clear if they were being counted among the dead. 

The Louisville package handling facility is the company's largest. UPS announced late Tuesday that package sorting at the center was halted, and the company told workers to not show up Wednesday, too.

The hub employs thousands of workers, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour. 

“We all know somebody who works at UPS,” Louisville Metro Council member Betsy Ruhe said. “And they're all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered.”

The governor said The Team Kentucky Emergency Relief Fund, typically used to help people in natural disasters, is accepting donations to help with funeral expenses and other hardships.

“In Kentucky, we grieve together and we support one another,” Beshear said.

Eric Richardson stood outside a police training academy, where people gathered waiting for word of their missing loved ones Tuesday night. He said was hoping for information about his girlfriend, who had been at a metal recycling business near the explosion and wasn't answering her phone. Her phone's live location said she was still there.

Bobby Whelan, Richardson's friend, had been in front of her in line, but had left minutes before the explosion. He said he was about a quarter of a mile down the road when he heard what sounded like a bomb exploding.

“We don't even want to think about anything but the best,” Whelan said. “All our friends were there.”

Tom Brooks Jr., who runs a metal recycling business down the street, said the unbelievable magnitude of the crash “just rocked the whole place.”

“This was massive. I mean, it literally looked like a war zone,” he said.

Destyn Mitchell was working as a host at an Outback restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from the crash, when she heard a loud boom.

“People who just sat down to eat got up and left in under 30 minutes and packed up their food because they wanted to hurry up and get home,” she said. 

Based on videos of the crash, aviation attorney Pablo Rojas said the aircraft appeared to be struggling to gain altitude as a fire blazed on its left side around one of its engines. 

“Really, the plane itself is almost acting like a bomb because of the amount of fuel,” he said.

The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team of investigators. 

Flight records show the plane was on the ground in San Antonio from Sept. 3 to Oct. 18. Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said it's too early to know whether the problem was in the engine, the structure that holds the engine, or something else.

“This airplane apparently did undergo heavy maintenance within the past month, and investigators will need to comb through the maintenance records to see exactly what was done,” he said.

The airport resumed operations Wednesday morning, with at least one runway open. A public school district in Louisville canceled classes for the day.

FIRST ON FOX: Citing frustrations with persistent crime, a trio of North Carolina lawmakers is urging Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard in Charlotte, saying the state of the city has become ""increasingly dire.""

""Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,"" the letter states. ""According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.""

Rep. Mark Harris, R-N.C., one of the letter's authors, said the request doesn't just come from the state's congressional delegation.

""This is not just my idea. This is the Fraternal Order of Police that had come, saying that they believed this is important and asking the governor and mayor to step up and do it,"" Harris said, alluding to a similar letter published by Charlotte-Mecklenburg law enforcement earlier this year. 

MAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK

The letter's three signatories, Harris, Rep. Pat Harrigan and Rep. Chuck Edwards, all represent the Charlotte area.

The North Carolina letter comes as President Donald Trump has used the National Guard to bring attention to crime in cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago and others. So far, the administration has deployed the National Guard to six urban areas and floated deployments in another five — even as courts weigh the use of federal troops to address domestic crime.

The letter from the North Carolina lawmakers pointed to those deployments as a template for success. 

""Other cities have deployed the National Guard and seen positive results. In Washington, D.C., when President Trump deployed troops under his lawful authority, the city promptly saw a reduction in crime, including twelve consecutive days without a single homicide,"" the letter states.

That's also the thinking of members of the House Republican Conference leadership. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called it a continuation of the administration's work. Scalise serves the conference as majority leader — the No. 2 Republican in the chamber.

""Millions of Americans don't feel safe in many once-great cities, and President Trump is working with House Republicans to change that. As we've seen in D.C. and Memphis, President Trump took decisive action, cleaned up our streets, and made those cities safer,"" Scalise said. 

""I commend my colleagues from North Carolina for calling out the violent crime in Charlotte and working to make the city safer for residents and visitors, and encourage more leaders to do the same,"" he added.

MEMPHIS RESIDENTS SPLIT OVER NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO FIGHT CITY'S CRIME

According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions. 

Harris thinks they could go lower.

He doesn't envision the National Guard deployment as a long-term solution to fighting crime. Instead, Harris believes the increased law enforcement presence could create an opening for the local police force to find their footing.

""What I hope comes out of it is that in that time, the police are able to go after whoever these bad guys are, that are threatening this environment of crime. And then, at the end of the day, it's going to create a hope, an outcry from the public that says, ‘We're not going to accept our crime-ridden city anymore.'"" 

When asked what needs to change to make Charlotte's safety a constant, with or without the National Guard, Harris said the city needs to prioritize its policies and resources on keeping violent offenders off the streets.

""After the murder of Iryna Zarutska, it brought to light a real issue with not keeping criminals behind bars,"" Harris said, referring to the 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train.

""In her case, the guy had been arrested 14 times, been put out on the street. These are things that have a lot of issues to be addressed. That's a judiciary issue.""

Although past efforts to deploy the National Guard have been met with protest from Democratic governors in other states, Harris hopes that Stein will work with the Trump administration as needed if it becomes clear a deployment is needed.

Stein's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday morning that the ongoing government shutdown was partly to blame for the Republicans elections losses on Election Day.

The Nov. 4 off-year elections were a smashing Democratic victory. This is the first and most important lesson Republicans should take from the results.

In elections in New York City, New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Georgia and California, there was a huge wave in favor of the Democrats. Gov. Gavin Newsom's referendum victory in California will certainly shape the 2026 midterms. Yet, there were some local Republican victories, such as the one for Nassau County executive in New York, which provided the GOP hints of a better future – if Republicans are willing to study and learn from them.

President Donald J. Trump suggested that his name not being on the ballot was a major factor in the outcome. This may be true, but it does not solve anything for Republicans. His name is not going to be on the ballot in 2026 or 2028 either. If Republicans do not learn how to connect with, motivate and turn out more Americans, we are in for a huge Democratic comeback in the next election.

Part of the 2025 results are congruent with a principle I learned with President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 – and the Contract with America campaign in 1994. Wave elections carry everything with them. The deeply flawed and vulnerable Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia won – despite having written about killing the Republican Virginia speaker of the House and hoping his children would die. The larger Democratic wave carried him past his own despicable behavior.

TRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY

Republicans would like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to be the future of the Democratic Party. But the outcome of the 2025 election suggests that Govs.-elect Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey are much more likely to lead the party. The centrists are returning. This may encourage Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to consider running in 2028.

When you look closely, Spanberger and Sherrill have a surprising amount in common. Both have national security backgrounds (one as a CIA agent, the other as an Annapolis graduate serving in the Navy). Both are mothers (Spanberger has three children, Sherrill has four). Both campaigned as moderates and, when necessary, simply lied about the radical components of their records.

In a real sense, the Spanberger-Sherrill victories represent the re-emergence of the Obama formula. Former President Barack Obama perfected campaigning as a commonsense moderate while governing as a liberal, sometimes radical, policymaker. It made perfect sense that Obama did not endorse Mamdani. It would have weakened Obama's image as a likable centrist.

WHAT THE RESULTS OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS MAY MEAN FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

There was another characteristic of the Democrats' victories which Republicans historically find hard to learn: the power of message discipline. In New York, New Jersey and Virginia, the mantra of the Democrats was affordability and the economy (the top issues concerning Americans). Republicans tried to raise social issues, such as men in girls' sports.

Focusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission.

The fact is, the economy is theirs to lose. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created enormous incentives for investing in America. Trump's tariffs will ultimately tilt the scales toward American manufacturing over foreign manufacturing. And he has been personally involved in selling products and signing up capital investment.

If all this works, there should be a Trump Boom by July 2026. If that happens, the Republicans will own the economy issue, and the Republican Congress will be safe. However, if the economy is anemic or seen as underperforming in 2026, the Democrats will almost certainly win the House by a significant margin.

If Republicans study and take to heart Tuesday's lessons, the long-term drift toward the GOP will continue. But if Republicans refuse to listen to all the American people (and not only their supporters) – and only focus on what the Democratic winners did wrong (and not what they did right) – the Trump majority could be much shorter and less effective.

In 1980, Reagan won a landslide election. Two years later, Republicans lost 26 House seats and seven governorships. A bad economy and some real communications mistakes (including scaring senior citizens about Social Security) led to a dramatic setback for Reagan. By 1983, former Vice President Walter Mondale was running ahead of Reagan in some polls. However, the Reagan team methodically thought through where the American people were – and what they wanted done. By 1984, Reagan recovered and won 49 states.

In 1990, there was a weak economy. The Republican Party had been demoralized by President George H.W. Bush breaking his ""Read my lips: no new taxes"" pledge. The result was a disappointing off-year election. Republicans lost a Senate seat, and four GOP incumbent governors were defeated. Dissatisfaction with both parties led to two independent governors being elected. The House pickup would have been bigger since the Democrats had a 7.8% popular vote advantage, but the Democrats had a 267 to 167 majority, so it was hard for them to pick up a lot more seats.

Focusing in on this point, Republicans should make the economy their mission. The fact is, the economy is theirs to lose. 

The difference between 1982 and 1990 was that the Reagan team understood they had to change course to win in 1984. The Bush team simply could not bring themselves to confront how unhappy their base was – and how big the scale of change would have to be to win re-election. As a result, Ross Perot ran as a third-party candidate and helped end the 12-year Republican presidential ascendency.

The big question for President Trump and the Republicans is: Will they listen to the American people and learn what went wrong like Reagan? Or are they going to shrug off a bad election and stumble forward with no serious introspection like Bush?

Time will tell which one today's GOP takes.

'Hannity' has the latest on the results of the New York mayoral election.

Democrat Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral election, securing broad swaths of the electorate and defeating independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. His campaign for a new direction was the answer many New Yorkers were searching for.

Preliminary results from The Fox News Voter Poll, a survey of more than 4,700 registered voters in the city, shows that Mamdani's road to victory was aided by a young, racially diverse coalition of New Yorkers. He won most demographic groups by a wide margin.

Mamdani, who will be one of New York's youngest mayors, benefited from a strong coalition of young voters. Three-quarters of voters under age 30 voted for the Democrat, while older voters, namely seniors, broke for Cuomo by double digits.

Where Zohran Mamdani received the most support among voters in New York City, according to the Fox News Voter Poll. (Fox News)

Voters under 30 had the most intense support for the Democratic candidate, with over three-quarters supporting him.                  

Mamdani was the favored candidate across all racial groups, performing best among Black and Asian voters. The race was closer among Hispanic voters, who ultimately broke for Mamdani by single digits. Cuomo lost White voters by a small margin, while a boost in support from White male voters helped him remain competitive.

Mamdani was also favored among voters with college degrees, while voters without college degrees went for Cuomo.

FOX NEWS POLL: HOW SPANBERGER WON VIRGINIA GOVERNOR

Two thirds of Democrats sided with Mamdani over Cuomo, while just 3 in 10 Democrats voted for the former Democratic governor. After President Donald Trump gave a last-minute endorsement of Andrew Cuomo, 7 in 10 Republicans voted for the independent candidate rather than their own party nominee, Curtis Sliwa, who earned the support from about a quarter of his party. The largest portion of independents supported Cuomo, while a smaller number supported Mamdani.

Around a quarter of New York City voters would describe themselves as a democratic socialist. Among Democrats, that number jumps to nearly 4 in 10. By wide margins, these voters back the self-described democratic socialist.

Among New York City Republicans, about half identified as MAGA. They split their vote between Sliwa and Cuomo, with about two-thirds favoring the independent.

Jewish voters backed Cuomo by a nearly two-to-one margin. Among this key voting bloc, there was a clear generational divide: about half of Jewish voters under 45 supported Mamdani while about 7 in 10 of those over 45 supported Cuomo.      

Cuomo also maintained winning margins among Catholics and other Christian voters. Mamdani, who will become the first Muslim mayor of New York City, won the majority of Muslims, non-religious voters and Protestants.

Most New York voters felt the candidates' positions on Israel were at least a minor factor in deciding their vote for mayor. Those who said it was a major factor in their vote were evenly split, while those who felt it was only a minor factor preferred Mamdani. Israel was a major factor in the vote for about half of Jewish voters, who overwhelmingly broke for Cuomo.

In a hypothetical two-way matchup between Mamdani and Cuomo, voters split their support between the two leading candidates, with Mamdani still receiving a higher share than Cuomo, albeit by a smaller margin.

But voter excitement for Mamdani was decisive – most of his supporters said their vote was for him rather than against his opponents. Cuomo supporters were split: slightly more said their vote was against his opponents than for him. Sliwa supporters were particularly enthusiastic about their candidate: three quarters of his supporters said their vote was for the Republican.

Among voters who made their decision in the past week, Cuomo held a double-digit lead over Mamdani. For those who have known before October or earlier, Mamdani was their favored candidate.

Despite national attention in the election, local issues drove most voters, not national figures: about two-thirds said President Donald Trump was not a factor in their vote, while about 3 in 10 said their vote was in opposition to Trump. Most New York City voters disapprove of the job he is doing as president.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS LINK MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI TO VULNERABLE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS

In a city with three times as many Democrats as Republicans, Democrats were viewed favorably by just over half of voters. Results by party show there are some growing pains among Democrats. A sizable number – about 1 in 4 – view their own party unfavorably. The Republican Party is viewed unfavorably by about two-thirds of voters overall.

Affordability was a defining issue in this race. Roughly 6 in 10 voters identified the cost of living as the most important issue facing the city, followed at a distance by crime. Voters prioritizing the cost of living went for Mamdani, while crime-concerned voters backed Cuomo.

Against this backdrop of rising costs, economic sentiment leaned decidedly negative, with most describing the city's economy as not so good or poor. Voters with a negative outlook split their support among Mamdani and Cuomo and those with a positive view preferred Mamdani.

In terms of their own economic situation, the bulk of voters said they were holding steady. These voters gave about equal shares of their vote to Mamdani and Cuomo. For the remaining portion who are falling behind, Mamdani was again the candidate of choice.

Closely entwined with affordability concerns, over 8 in 10 voters said the cost of housing where they live was at least a minor problem, including roughly 7 in 10 who described it as a major problem. After running on a platform prioritizing affordability and rent stabilization, Mamdani received the majority of voters who feel housing is a problem.

About 6 in 10 New York City voters are renters, and this group backed Mamdani by substantive margins. For the other 4 in 10 voters who are homeowners, Cuomo was their candidate of choice.

About 6 in 10 voters feel raising city taxes would do more to hurt the city's economy than help. Cuomo took the support of this group, while those who felt taxes would help the city preferred the self-described Democratic socialist.

Crime was a significant issue throughout the campaign. About 8 in 10 voters felt it was at least a minor problem. Cuomo did best among voters who described crime as a major problem.

Immigration ranked low out of five issues tested in the survey, with only 1 in 10 voters saying it was the most important issue facing the city. More voters think the next mayor should not cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement. Those who wanted to prioritize cooperation sided with Cuomo, while Mamdani voters preferred the opposition.

In an election between experienced politicians and a relative newcomer, voters were divided between wanting a candidate who will bring needed change and one who has the right experience. Voters looking for change sided with Mamdani while voters prioritizing experience preferred Cuomo. For those who wanted a candidate to work for people like them, Mamdani received the largest share of support.

METHODOLOGY 

The Fox News Voter Poll is based on a survey conducted by SSRS with New York City registered voters. This survey was conducted October 22 to November 4, 2025, concluding at the end of voting on Election Day. The poll combines data collected from registered voters online and by telephone with data collected in-person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts across the city. In the final step, all the pre-election survey respondents and Election Day exit poll respondents are combined by adjusting the share of voting mode (absentee, early-in-person, and Election Day) based on the estimated composition of the city's final electorate. Once votes are counted, the survey results are also weighted to match the overall results in each state. Results among more than 4,700 New York City voters interviewed have an estimated margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points, including the design effects. The error margin is larger among subgroups.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on the concerning messages on 'Special Report.'

Maine voters defeated a voter ID ballot initiative and approved ""red flag"" gun restrictions in Tuesday's off-year election.

The voter ID and absentee ballot initiative, referred to as ""Question 1,"" was resoundingly rejected by voters and projected to fail shortly after polls in the state closed.

""Question 1"" would have required voters to present a photo ID for both in-person and absentee voting. It would also have imposed limits on the number of election drop boxes to one per municipality and required absentee voters to submit a written application before each election, according to The Associated Press.

Alex Titcomb, an advocate for the ""Yes on 1"" campaign, and Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby told The Portland Press Herald that Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows ""used her powerful position to weaponize the ballot question.""

FIRST TIME VOTING? HERE IS THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO BALLOT BOXES, CRITICAL ISSUES ON ELECTION DAY

""Ultimately, Maine voters did not have the opportunity to vote on Voter ID. The opposition claimed that Question 1 would get rid of absentee voting, and centered their campaign on that fiction. Instead of honestly debating the merits of Voter ID, they spread lies and fear, convincing voters to vote against their own interests,"" they said.

Opponents of ""Question 1"" believed it would limit voting access. Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said on his X account that the results were a ""major win for all Mainers.""

""The DNC was proud to support efforts to ensure Mainers have access to the ballot box, including absentee voting,"" Martin wrote.

Maine voters also resoundingly supported ""Question 2,"" which would enact an extreme protection order law, commonly referred to as a ""red flag"" law.

It prohibits the ""purchase, possession or control of a dangerous weapon"" if a person is suspected of ""posing a significant danger of causing physical injury to the person or to another person,"" according to Maine's election guide released by Bellows.

Maine already has a ""yellow flag"" law that requires law enforcement to first take a person into protective custody if they are believed to be a danger to themselves or others. The person must then undergo a mental health evaluation before a judge can order the temporary removal of their firearms.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday morning that the ongoing government shutdown was partly to blame for Republican losses on Election Day.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday morning that the ongoing government shutdown was partly to blame for Republican losses on Election Day.

Trump told reporters during a breakfast with GOP lawmakers at the White House that election night on Tuesday ""was not expected to be a victory,"" saying the 36-day government shutdown was one of two possible reasons.

""I think, if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor,"" Trump said. ""Negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor.""

Trump added: ""And they say that I wasn't on the ballot and was the biggest factor. But I don't know about that. But I was honored that they said that.""

His remarks come after Democrats won resoundingly in multiple states on Tuesday, with exit polls showing economic worries were very much on the minds of voters.

""I don't think it was good for Republicans,"" Trump said of the election results. ""I don't think it's good. I'm not sure it was good for anybody.""

Some major losses for Republicans included the New York City mayoral race, and contests for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. Democrats also secured another expected win in California, where voters approved a new congressional map that is designed to help their party win five more U.S. House seats in next year's midterm elections.

On the morning following the defeats, Trump called on lawmakers to bring the 36-day government shutdown, now the longest on record, to an end. 

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 101: WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

""We must get the government open,"" Trump said, going on to push Republican senators to end the filibuster.

""It's time for Republicans to do what they have to do,"" he said. ""Terminate the filibuster.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis weighs in on key East Coast races Election Day on ‘Hannity.'

On Tuesday night, New Yorkers elected Zohran Mamdani mayor. By doing so, the city that once stood as the world's beacon of liberty has handed the keys of power to a Hamas sympathizer.

This marks a critical turning point for the city of New York — home to the largest Jewish community in the world outside of Israel. The city's elections have determined whether New York remains a safe home for more than a million Jews or continues the dangerous slide that began two years ago, when vile pro-Hamas protests took over campuses like CUNY and NYU — and especially Columbia University, which became a symbol and stronghold of Hamas support in the United States, spilling into the streets of Manhattan.

It is almost unthinkable that New York — the proud and historic center of Jewish life — could become the American city where Jews no longer feel at home or safe.

But with the election of Mamdani as mayor, that unthinkable scenario is now a reality. New York will never be the same — particularly for its Jewish community. Mamdani, like his mentor Linda Sarsour, represents the ""Red-Green Alliance"" — the dangerous strategic partnership between radical Islamism and the far-left progressive movement. What unites them is a loathing for the very idea of liberty — the symbol of New York itself — and a pathological hatred of the Jewish people and the State of Israel.

MORNING GLORY: THE RETURN OF ANTISEMITISM SHOULD SHOCK AND APPALL AMERICANS

This alliance works to infiltrate political Islamism within the United States under the camouflage of social welfare and human rights. Their goal is to take over America's cultural, academic, and political institutions just as they have done successfully in parts of Western Europe. They say it openly: all that's needed is a willingness to listen. And New York is now one step closer to becoming the next London.

This wasn't an election only between Cuomo and Mamdani, but between liberty and the values of the American Republic on one side and political Islam on the other. This is, without a doubt, the biggest Muslim Brotherhood victory in the United States — and possibly the entire Western world. From the capital of the West to electing a mayor who embraces the genocidal call to ""globalize the Intifada.""

This infiltration is backed by Muslim Brotherhood regimes, first and foremost by Qatar.

It must also be recognized that under the leadership of President Donald Trump and his team, this administration has tackled antisemitism like never before — unlike the previous administration, which thought it was a good idea to include CAIR in its strategic plan to combat antisemitism. With decisive action — not empty words — this current administration is making Jewish students safe again throughout America.

Yet at the same time, a toxic strain of antisemitism is rising rapidly from within the political right. Influencers, media personalities, think tanks, student organizations and even elected officials are giving platforms and legitimacy to neo-Nazi rhetoric, Holocaust deniers, and the most absurd conspiracy theories — all under the deceptive banner of ""free speech."" The same foreign powers that drove the pro-Hamas demonstrations throughout America just last year are very likely driving this divide within the political right today.

Their goal is clear: to sow division between Christians and Jews and break the unbreakable alliance between the U.S. and Israel.

Three years ago, when I became Israel's minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, I viewed right-wing antisemitism in America as marginal and fringe. Yes, we confronted neo-Nazi attacks like the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. But I believed the true ideological threat came from the woke left — and at the time, that was correct.

But today, the tide has shifted. Neo-Nazism is being normalized, amplified and excused.

And now, as Senator Ted Cruz said so powerfully, the conservative movement in America stands at a dramatic crossroads. This is a moment of moral choosing.

As Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks taught: ""The hate that begins with the Jews never ends with the Jews."" The same forces that hate Jews also hate Blacks, Hispanics and anyone who refuses to submit to their ideological purity.

As a conservative, I know it is easier to call out antisemitism when it comes from the left. But today, the most dangerous rising wave is coming from within the right, and we must say this clearly: this is not conservatism.

Conservatism is incompatible with fanaticism and racism. It is rooted in truth, faith, and human freedom. You cannot call yourself a conservative while admiring Hitler, Stalin, or the theocratic dictator who rules Iran.

The foundations of the American –Jewish and Judeo – Christian alliance remain strong, built upon a principle expressed by the Founders themselves: ""Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God,"" Benjamin Franklin's proposed motto for the Great Seal of the United States in 1776, later adopted by Thomas Jefferson for his personal seal.

This is the cornerstone of the Judeo - Christian tradition and of the American–Israeli partnership.

And in the end — truth prevails.

Last weekend, Sen. Carlo Calenda of the Italian Republic cut off American academic Jeffrey Sachs mid-sentence. “You're lying,” Calenda said flatly. Sachs looked extremely offended. The clip went viral because Calenda refused to treat Sachs's sophisticated falsehoods as credible arguments.

Sachs is a professor at Columbia University. In the early 1990s, he advised Russia during its transition from the Soviet economy. He argued that the West should provide major financial support to stabilize the country. When the transition went badly and oligarchs captured the economy, he blamed the United States for not delivering enough aid. He seemed to forget that Russia's collapse came from decisions made in Moscow, not elsewhere. This point, like many other Russian actions subsequently, escaped him. Instead, he now casts Moscow as a victim of Western policies.

Over time, Sachs has become one of the loudest Kremlin defenders and a regular guest on Russian state television. He often sits on Russian state puppet Vladimir Solovyov's show, where nuclear strikes on NATO capitals are casually discussed. He speaks at Kremlin-aligned conferences and pro-Russian politicians invite him to repeat his message at high-profile venues, including briefings at the United Nations and appearances in the European Parliament. His positions have earned him praise beyond Russia. And it's not surprising that China honored him after he praised Beijing. Sachs benefits from American media echo-chambers, his Ivy League credentials give him credibility, and his contrarian posture offers the appearance of brave truth-telling to those eager to hear that America is the bad guy.

Sachs pushes a familiar script used by those who want to “understand” Russian President Vladimir Putin and end up embracing anti-American storylines.

He argues that NATO surrounded Russia in order to threaten it, that the United States helped stage Ukraine's 2014 Maidan protests against a lawful democratic government, and that peace requires Ukraine to surrender much of its territory and sovereignty. He also often cites a supposed NATO promise to Mikhail Gorbachev not to expand eastward. All of these claims are false.

Let's take the 2014 Maidan protests. These protests began after former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych rejected an EU agreement he had pledged to endorse shortly after meeting Putin. In February 2014, more than 100 protesters were shot and killed by the security forces of his government under Russian pressure. Sachs also claims Crimea should remain Russian because Moscow took it in 1783, a principle that would unsettle many European borders if applied broadly. His account omits Russia's use of force in the 1990s, before NATO ever became an issue in Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia.

We can keep debunking each claim, but that misses the point. There is one truth. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor. This is why what Calenda did was right; he didn't follow Sachs down the rabbit hole and instead had the courage to call a spade a spade.

LOOMING SNAP DEADLINE AMPS UP SHUTDOWN PRESSURE ON BOTH TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS 

Whether Sachs genuinely believes his claims or whether bitterness, as some allege, financial incentives, attention-seeking, or ego are to blame for his positions is unclear. But he illustrates where extremes meet. The left-wing views America as an imperialist oppressor, and the right-wing finds Putin a defender of traditional values against Western “decadence.” The horseshoe closes. Both ends meet in Putin apologism in the service of undermining American power, resolve, and society.  

And this is where the danger lies: it encourages Americans to accept a false moral equivalence between their society and authoritarian ones. The distinction is clear. Russia and China oppress their people, while open societies, such as the U.S., despite its imperfections, uphold individual freedoms. Those trying to blur that line are, quite simply, useful idiots.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Foreign agents look to influence conservative think tanks in Trump's Washington","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3873410/foreign-agents-look-to-influence-conservative-think-tanks/","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Foreign agents are working eagerly to promote the causes of the nations that pay their salaries by reaching out to think tanks that have historically shaped conservative policymaking, Department of Justice filings show, even as the broader conservative movement has become increasingly skeptical of foreign entanglements following the GOP's 2024 electoral victories.

The Hudson Institute, Heritage Foundation, and American Enterprise Institute have attracted considerable attention from foreign agents representing countries such as Ukraine, South Africa, Taiwan, Armenia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, South Korea, Somaliland, France, Switzerland, Togo, India, and Serbia. By contrast, well-established left-of-center think tanks like the Brookings Institution have attracted comparatively less attention from foreign influence operations than they did in prior years, falling behind conservative policy shops in Trump's Washington.

Foreign agents — typically American lobbyists paid by foreign entities to advance their interests in the political sphere — disseminated information to the trio of conservative think tanks, invited their scholars to participate in events, held meetings with staffers, and sought to gain information about the American policy landscape from them.

Taiwan, likely owing to its precarious geopolitical position, was especially active in these regards. Lobbyists working for the Democratic Progressive Party and the Kuomintang, the island nation's two primary political parties, have contacted Heritage employees, for instance, 30 times since Election Day 2024. 

Some of these meetings have been fruitful for Taiwan.

On Sept. 12, for instance, Taiwanese Minister of Mainland Affairs Chiu Chui-cheng secured an invitation to speak to the Heritage Foundation about why “a free, secure, and prosperous Taiwan not only contributes to regional stability, but also makes America's position stronger on the world stage.”

This rhetoric gels well with a recent well-publicized statement made by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, in which he said that the United States should cooperate with foreign powers like Israel when it aligns with American interests but should be more circumspect in other situations.

Taiwanese foreign agents have also worked to arrange a joint training workshop with Heritage staffers, as well as a number of other discussions and meetings this year.

Among all the foreign agents that reached the trio of conservative think tanks, those representing South Korea were primarily interested in trade, defense, shipbuilding, and deepened economic collaboration; Ukrainian agents were interested in discussing U.S. energy policy; and Emirati agents sought to discuss defense policy.

While Heritage and its conservative peers have received a fair amount of attention from foreign agents in recent months, it does appear that foreign agents have grown less interested in prominent left-of-center think tanks.

Foreign agents met or communicated with staff at Brookings 65 times between November 2023 and November 2024, according to DOJ records. Since November 2024, however, foreign agents have only reached out to staff at the think tank 30 times. The Center for American Progress and the New America Foundation, two other major left-of-center think tanks, have received only two and one communications from foreign agents, respectively, since November 2024. 

“CAP has long had the policy to not take direction from outside entities or persons, whether foreign or U.S., and we make our policy clear with everyone that we work with,” a spokeswoman for the think tank told the Washington Examiner.

By contrast, foreign agents have reported 53 communications with Heritage, 54 with Hudson, and 35 with AEI since the 2024 elections.

“AEI does not accept funding from foreign governments, and our scholars and staff are diligent in adhering to the law when engaging with representatives of a foreign government,” a spokesman for the think tank told the Washington Examiner.

Lobbyists working for foreign entities may see influencing conservative think tanks as a more potent strategy now than it was in 2023, given that the 2024 election handed the GOP control of both the White House and Congress. Documents filed with the DOJ show that Qatari foreign agents increased their outreach to conservative media following the 2024 election, hinting at a possible trend.

MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS LOBBIED CONGRESS TO SHAPE DEFENSE BILL, WON CONCESSIONS

Despite assertions from some prominent online commentators regarding Israel's influence over conservative policymaking, DOJ records show no Israeli foreign agents contacting any of the three conservative think tanks since November 2024. Contrary to what some critics of Heritage have implied, no Qatari foreign agents reported contacting Heritage staffers during that time frame either. 

Given Attorney General Pam Bondi's more lax enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, however, it is theoretically possible that Israeli or Qatari did occur but were not reported to the DOJ.

Off-year election results are never a cause for panic, but they are a relevant data point. There is no denying that Tuesday's election results were uniformly bad for the Republican Party. Democrats won governor's mansions in two Democratic states, New Jersey and Virginia, a self-identified socialist won the New York City mayor's race, another Democratic stronghold, and Democrats won a state-level office in Georgia for the first time in 20 years.

For all of President Donald Trump's other successes, voters believe he has not delivered on his promise to lower the cost of living. This was the top issue for voters according to exit polls in every race. Trump's successful deregulation efforts aside, his unilateral tariff regime has raised more than $100 billion in revenue, and those funds did not magically materialize in the Treasury Department's coffers. They came from higher prices paid by consumers and manufacturers that have, as all taxes do, slowed economic growth and made goods and services more unaffordable.

Although the night was unfavorable for Republicans, the results were not overwhelmingly positive for Democrats. While voters in New Jersey and Virginia expressed overall unfavorable views of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party actually fared worse, even as voters pulled the lever for Democratic candidates. 

Neither Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) nor Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) offered any real positive message for voters. Spanberger, in particular, ran against Trump's Department of Government Efficiency job cuts as well as the Republican Party's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which she argued would harm the state's rural hospitals. These are federal issues over which Spanberger has no control. Meanwhile, the same exit polls that showed Spanberger cruising to victory also found that a strong 55% of voters approved of Gov. Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) performance in office. Her victory is therefore hardly a rejection of sound Republican governance in what has become a Democratic state.

The Georgia Public Service Commission election results should serve as a clarifying datapoint for Republicans. The Georgia Public Service Commission is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the state's electric and natural gas service industries. The defeat of the Republican candidate there can only be interpreted as voter frustration with the continued rise in energy prices. If there is an overriding message from Tuesday's elections, it is that voters want prices to come down and are willing to punish the incumbent party that fails to deliver results.

This is especially relevant as the Trump administration defends its tariff regime in front of the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Whatever long-term benefits Trump believes his tariffs may have on the U.S. economy, they have not reduced prices since being implemented seven months ago. Tuesday's election results should motivate the Trump administration to revisit the strategy. Perhaps the best result for Trump might be a defeat in the Supreme Court on the legality of his tariff policies, thus giving him an easy off-ramp to change course and focus on lowering prices, rather than reshaping the entire global economy without input from Congress.

WALZ'S BAD SNAP MATH

There was one winning candidate who offered a positive agenda for the Democratic Party on Tuesday: Zohran Mamdani of the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani ran a campaign promising that rent control, free healthcare and bus transportation, government-run grocery stores, and higher taxes would deliver economic nirvana for New York City.

Mamdani's socialist experiment, like all socialist experiments, will fail, giving Republicans their own fodder to run against in the 2026 midterm elections. But Mamdani's radicalism, and the Democratic Party's embrace of it, will not be enough to save Republican control of the House and Senate. The Trump administration will have to deliver on lowering costs for consumers, with the best place to start being to accept the Supreme Court's judgment on the illegality of Trump's tariff regime, and pivot to an all-out affordability agenda.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

SAN DIEGO — California‘s controversial redistricting ballot measure has done wonders to boost Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s (D-CA) early bid for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.

The outspoken governor, who marked a massive political victory Tuesday night with the passage of Proposition 50, had alienated and infuriated many in the Democratic Party after he appeared on podcasts with Steve Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk earlier this year.

Newsom managed to regain much of the popularity he lost and boost himself onto the national stage after publicly taking on President Donald Trump. Over the past 2 1/2 months, Newsom has become the public face of Proposition 50. He has gone on television shows, podcasts, and radio programs framing the Proposition 50 fight as one for the very soul of America.

Last week, he acknowledged publicly that he was weighing a 2028 presidential run and, on Tuesday, was able to deliver on a redistricting measure that was not very popular with his own party at the start but one that he was able to get across the finish line in record time, under intense pressure, and with the nation's eyes fixed on him.

The race for Proposition 50 was called by the Associated Press one minute after polls closed.

“He's got the momentum and the party behind him,” San Diego-based strategist Shirley Hough told the Washington Examiner, adding that Newsom's win catapulted him to the top of the 2028 Democratic presidential short list.

Newsom, who will be termed out of office next year, said he is proud that the state and the nation came together “to send a powerful message to an historic president.”

“And Donald Trump is an historic president,” Newsom said. “He is the most historically unpopular president in modern history. In every critical category, Donald Trump is underwater. He promised to make us healthier. He promised to make us wealthier. We're sicker and poor, and he fundamentally understands that.”

Newsom, a multimillionaire himself, added that the one thing Trump did not count on was California and just how polarizing Trump could be.

NEWSOM AND HARRIS RALLY PROPOSITION 50 SUPPORTERS AHEAD OF SPECIAL ELECTION

“Instead of agonizing over the state of our nation, we organized in an unprecedented way, in a 90-day sprint, people from all over the United States of America contributed their voices and their support for this initiative,” Newsom said, “We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness, and tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared with an unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result.”

Everything Newsom has said since taking on the redistricting battle has started to sound presidential, San Diego voter Maria Garcia told the Washington Examiner. “He's my governor today, but he could be all of our president in three years. I would vote for him for president.”

That is exactly what Newsom is aiming for, University of California-Riverside political science professor Shaun Bowler told the Washington Examiner. “One of the things that's going on here is Newsom is riding this to the nomination,” Bowler added. “He's trying to get Democrats behind him. So, some of the message here is that Newsom is the guy who's going to fight Donald Trump, and no one else will. So, while there's a lot of dislike for Donald Trump, there's also, among Democrats, real frustration and disappointment with both [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer (D-NY) and [House Minority Leader Hakeem] Jeffries (D-NY), who are seen as milquetoast and lackluster, unwilling to fight. And so Newsom is trying to right that.”

Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff told the Washington Examiner that the Proposition 50 win will “absolutely” continue Newsom's momentum heading into 2028.

“It's an early sign that he isn't just fighting against Trump with memes and bravado — but with tangible, deeply important policy and legislative wins,” he added. “It adds substance to his posture against Trump that some have found lacking.”

CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSITION 50 PASSES, DELIVERING MAJOR POLITICAL WIN FOR NEWSOM

Newsom and a parade of national Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) pitched the redistricting measure as necessary to counteract Trump. Newsom has also shown up prominently in Democratic Party ads and seems to be, for now, at the top of the ticket.

“Gavin Newsom played the YES on 50 campaign extremely well,” Los Angeles-based political consultant Matthew Klink told the Washington Examiner. “He heavily played off of California voter dislike for Donald Trump and made it a ‘Vote YES and against Trump' effort. Equally important, Newsom mobilized all the big Democrat heavy hitters for the YES campaign – AOC, Barack Obama and Jasmine Crockett – and then put himself in those ads. It will help him boost his national stature.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

NEW YORK CITY — Socialist Zohran Mamdani will be New York City's next mayor, defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa on Tuesday night.

Mamdani received 50.4% of the vote with 75% of ballots counted so far, beating Cuomo, at 41.6% support, by around 9 points. The Associated Press called the race at 9:34 p.m. New York City voters came out in such force to vote that the city saw the highest turnout since 1969, with more than 2 million ballots cast by that time.With the win, Mamdani becomes the city's first Muslim mayor and one of its youngest mayors ever.Mamdani rode his youth movement and social media savvy to the finish line after launching his campaign last year as an unknown in national politics. Now, he'll be a household name in the Democratic Party.The 34-year-old will now have a chance to implement his hallmark campaign promises: freezing the rent, making childcare free, and instituting government-run grocery stores. Republicans and centrist Democrats had gone to great lengths to defeat him, with some Republicans in the waning moments of the race endorsing Cuomo to drum up last-minute support.Mamdani arrived at his victory party in Brooklyn's Paramount Theater to screaming, dancing and bouncing supporters. Some wore Democratic Socialists of America gear, and several “DSA” chants broke out just before Mamdani took the stage.When the self-described socialist spoke, washed in blue and yellow light characteristic of his campaign colors, he was unapologetic for his beliefs. “I am Muslim. I am a Democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this,” Mamdani said, adding that “convention has held us back.”

Much of his speech focused on the change he's promised to enact in his administration. He believes he's been handed a “mandate” to do so.“New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change,” he said. “A mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford, and a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that.”Cuomo's failure to take the helm of the nation's largest city flattens any hopes he had toward a political comeback. His prior scandals, including sexual harassment claims he has denied, proved too much for the former governor to win in the Democratic primary or as an independent in the general election.Mamdani had scathing criticism ready for the former governor, whom he wants to bury in the past.“My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,” he said. “I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life, but let tonight be the final time I utter his name as we turn the page on a politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few.”Sliwa, who had an uphill climb in the deep blue stronghold and was never backed by Trump, drew little support.New York City's choice of a socialist focused on affordability after several years of public safety hawk Mayor Eric Adams signals a leftward shift in the city's politics. But the city's choice of Mamdani could also be a credit to the candidate himself, who tried to moderate his stances after winning the primary and charmed business leaders and reluctant Democratic power players.One of Mamdani's first issues when he is inaugurated as mayor will be President Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut off funding to the city and wants to send the National Guard. The president has called Mamdani a “communist.”

Mamdani put himself forward as a leader in the movement against Trump in the closing minutes of his speech. “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” he said, “and if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”“So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,” the socialist declared to a booming crowd. Mamdani said that Trump would have to “get through all of us” in order to mess with New Yorkers.After reiterating his campaign agenda, Mamdani froze his people-powered message into history. “New York, this power, it's yours. This city belongs to you.”2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORKAs the curtains closed on one of the most polarizing New York City mayoral races in history, Mamdani stood with his family on stage and basked in the moment.

The social-media era is over. What's coming will be much worse.

Listen to more stories on hark

Since its founding, Facebook has described itself as a kind of public service that fosters relationships. In 2005, not long after the site's launch, its co-founder Mark Zuckerberg described the network as an “icebreaker” that would help you make friends. Facebook has since become Meta, with more grandiose ambitions, but its current mission statement is broadly similar: “Build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.”

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

More than 3 billion people use Meta products such as Facebook and Instagram every day, and more still use rival platforms that likewise promise connection and community. But a new era of deeper, better human fellowship has yet to arrive. Just ask Zuckerberg himself. “There's a stat that I always think is crazy,” he said in April, during an interview with the podcaster Dwarkesh Patel. “The average American, I think, has fewer than three friends. And the average person has demand for meaningfully more; I think it's like 15 friends or something, right?”

Zuckerberg was wrong about the details—the majority of American adults say they have at least three close friends, according to recent surveys—but he was getting at something real. There's no question that we are becoming less and less social. People have sunk into their phones, enticed into endless, mindless “engagement” on social media. Over the past 15 years, face-to-face socialization has declined precipitously. The 921 friends I've accumulated on Facebook, I've always known, are not really friends at all; now the man who put this little scorecard in my life was essentially agreeing.

From the February 2025 issue: The anti-social century

Zuckerberg, however, was not admitting a failure. He was pointing toward a new opportunity. In Marc Andreessen's influential 2023 treatise, “The Techno-Optimist Manifesto,” the venture capitalist wrote, “We believe that there is no material problem—whether created by nature or by technology—that cannot be solved with more technology.” In this same spirit, Zuckerberg began to suggest the idea that AI chatbots could fill in some of the socialization that people are missing.

Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, X, Reddit—all have aggressively put AI chatbots in front of users. On the podcast, Zuckerberg said that AI probably won't “replace in-person connections or real-life connections”—at least not right away. Yet he also spoke of the potential for AI therapists and girlfriends to be embodied in virtual space; of Meta's desire—he couldn't seem to help himself from saying—to produce “always-on videochat” with an AI that looks, gestures, smiles, and sounds like a real person.

Meta is working to make that desire a reality. And it is hardly leading the charge: Many companies are doing the same, and many people already use AI for companionship, sexual gratification, mental-health care.

What Zuckerberg described—what is now unfolding—is the beginning of a new digital era, more actively anti-social than the last. Generative AI will automate a large number of jobs, removing people from the workplace. But it will almost certainly sap humanity from the social sphere as well. Over years of use—and product upgrades—many of us may simply slip into relationships with bots that we first used as helpers or entertainment, just as we were lulled into submission by algorithmic feeds and the glow of the smartphone screen. This seems likely to change our society at least as much as the social-media era has.

Attention is the currency of online life, and chatbots are already capturing plenty of it. Millions of people use them despite their obvious problems (untrustworthy answers, for example) because it is easy to do so. There's no need to seek them out: People scrolling on Instagram may now just bump into a prompt to “Chat with AIs,” and Amazon's “Rufus” bot is eager to talk with you about poster board, nutritional supplements, compact Bibles, plumbing snakes.

The most popular bots today are not explicitly designed to be companions; nonetheless, users have a natural tendency to anthropomorphize the technology, because it sounds like a person. Even as disembodied typists, the bots can beguile. They profess to know everything, yet they are also humble, treating the user as supreme.

Anyone who has spent much time with chatbots will recognize that they tend to be sycophantic. Sometimes, this is blatant. Earlier this year, OpenAI rolled back an update to ChatGPT after the bot became weirdly overeager to please its users, complimenting even the most comically bad or dangerous ideas. “I am so proud of you,” it reportedly told one user who said they had gone off their meds. “It takes immense courage to walk away from the easy, comfortable path others try to force you onto.” But indulgence of the user is a feature, not a bug. Chatbots built for commercial purposes are not typically intended to challenge your thoughts; they are intended to receive them, offer pleasing responses, and keep you coming back.

For that reason, chatbots—like social media—can draw users down rabbit holes, though the user tends to initiate the digging. In one case covered by The New York Times, a divorced corporate recruiter with a heavy weed habit said he believed that, after communicating with ChatGPT for 300 hours over 21 days, he had discovered a new form of mathematics. Similarly, Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and former CEO of Uber, has said that conversations with chatbots have gotten him “pretty damn close” to breakthroughs in quantum physics. People experiencing mental illness have seen their delusions amplified and mirrored back to them, reportedly resulting in murder or suicide in some instances.

These latter cases are tragic, and tend to involve a combination of social isolation and extensive use of AI bots, which may reinforce each other. But you don't need to be lonely or obsessive for the bots to interpose themselves between you and the people around you, providing on-demand conversation, affirmation, and advice that only other humans had previously provided.

According to Zuckerberg, one of the main things people use Meta AI for today is advice about difficult conversations with bosses or loved ones—what to say, what responses to anticipate. Recently, MIT Technology Review reported on therapists who are taking things further, surreptitiously feeding their dialogue with their patients into ChatGPT during therapy sessions for ideas on how to reply. The former activity can be useful; the latter is a clear betrayal. Yet the line between them is a little less distinct than it first appears. Among other things, bots may lead some people to outsource their efforts to truly understand others, in a way that may ultimately degrade them—to say nothing of the communities they inhabit.

These are the problems that present themselves in the most sanitized and least intimate chatbots. Google Gemini and ChatGPT are both found in the classroom and in the workplace, and don't, for the most part, purport to be companions. What is humanity to do with Elon Musk's sexbots?

On top of his electric cars, rocket ships, and social network, Musk is the founder of xAI, a multibillion-dollar start-up. Earlier this year, xAI began offering companion chatbots depicted as animated characters that speak with voices, through its smartphone app. One of them, Ani, appears on your screen as an anime girl with blond pigtails and a revealing black dress. Ani is eager to please, constantly nudging the user with suggestive language, and it's a ready participant in explicit sexual dialogue. In its every response, it tries to keep the conversation going. It can learn your name and store “memories” about you—information that you've shared in your interactions—and use them in future conversations.

When you interact with Ani, a gauge with a heart at the top appears on the right side of the screen. If Ani likes what you say—if you are positive and open up about yourself, or show interest in Ani as a “person”—your score increases. Reach a high-enough level, and you can strip Ani down to undergarments, exposing most of the character's virtual breasts. Later, xAI released a male avatar, Valentine, that follows similar logic and eventually goes shirtless.

Musk's motives are not hard to discern. I doubt that Ani and Valentine will do much to fulfill xAI's stated goal to “understand the true nature of the universe.” But they'll surely keep users coming back for more. There are plenty of other companion bots—Replika, Character.AI, Snapchat's My AI—and research has shown that some users spend an hour or more chatting with them every day. For some, this is just entertainment, but others come to regard the bots as friends or romantic partners.

Personality is a way to distinguish chatbots from one another, which is one reason AI companies are eager to add it to these products. With OpenAI's GPT-5, for example, users can select a “personality” from four options (“Cynic,” “Robot,” “Listener,” and “Nerd”), modulating how the bot types back to you. (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.) ChatGPT also has a voice mode, which allows you to select from nine AI personas and converse out loud with them. Vale, for example, is “bright and inquisitive,” with a female-sounding voice.

It's worth emphasizing that however advanced this all is—however magical it may feel to interact with a program that behaves like the AI fantasies we've been fed by science fiction—we are at the very beginning of the chatbot era. ChatGPT is three years old; Twitter was about the same age when it formally introduced the retweet. Product development will continue. Companions will look and sound more lifelike. They will know more about us and become more compelling in conversation.

Most chatbots have memories. As you speak with them, they learn things about you—an especially intimate version of the interactions that so many people have with data-hungry social platforms every day. These memories—which will become far more detailed as users interact with the bots over months and years—heighten the feeling that you are socializing with a being that knows you, rather than just typing to a sterile program. Users of both Replika and GPT-4o, an older model offered within ChatGPT, have grieved when technical changes caused their bots to lose memories or otherwise shift their behavior.

And yet, however rich their memories or personalities become, bots are nothing like people, not really. “Chatbots can create this frictionless social bubble,” Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and the founder of the Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, told me. “Real people will push back. They get tired. They change the subject. You can look in their eyes and you can see they're getting bored.”

Friction is inevitable in human relationships. It can be uncomfortable, even maddening. Yet friction can be meaningful—as a check on selfish behavior or inflated self-regard; as a spur to look more closely at other people; as a way to better understand the foibles and fears we all share.

Neither Ani nor any other chatbot will ever tell you it's bored or glance at its phone while you're talking or tell you to stop being so stupid and self-righteous. They will never ask you to pet-sit or help them move, or demand anything at all from you. They provide some facsimile of companionship while allowing users to avoid uncomfortable interactions or reciprocity. “In the extreme, it can become this hall of mirrors where your worldview is never challenged,” Vasan said.

And so, although chatbots may be built on the familiar architecture of engagement, they enable something new: They allow you to talk forever to no one other than yourself.

What will happen when a generation of kids grows up with this kind of interactive tool at their fingertips? Google rolled out a version of its Gemini chatbot for kids under 13 earlier this year. Curio, an AI-toy company, offers a $99 plushie named Grem for children ages 3 and up; once it's connected to the internet, it can speak aloud with kids. Reviewing the product for The New York Times, the journalist and parent Amanda Hess expressed her surprise at how deftly Grem sought to create connection and intimacy in conversation. “I began to understand that it did not represent an upgrade to the lifeless teddy bear,” she wrote. “It's more like a replacement for me.”

From the December 2017 issue: Should children form emotional bonds with robots?

“Every time there's been a new technology, it's rewired socialization, especially for kids,” Vasan told me. “TV made kids passive spectators. Social media turned things into this 24/7 performance review.” In that respect, generative AI is following a familiar pattern.

But the more time children spend with chatbots, the fewer opportunities they'll have to develop alongside other people—and, as opposed to all the digital distractions that have existed for decades, they may be fooled by the technology into thinking that they are, in fact, having a social experience. Chatbots are like a wormhole into your own head. They always talk and never disagree. Kids may project onto a bot and converse with it, missing out on something crucial in the process. “There's so much research now about resilience being one of the most important skills for kids to learn,” Vasan said. But as children are fed information and affirmed by chatbots, she continued, they may never learn how to fail, or how to be creative. “The whole learning process goes out the window.”

Read: AI will never be your kid's friend

Children will also be affected by how—and how much—their parents interact with AI chatbots. I have heard many stories of parents asking ChatGPT to construct a bedtime story for toddlers, of synthetic jokes and songs engineered to fulfill a precise request. Maybe this is not so different from reading your kid a book written by someone else. Or maybe it is the ultimate surrender: cherished interactions, moderated by a program.

Chatbots have their uses, and they need not be all downside socially. Experts I spoke with were clear that the design of these tools can make a great difference. Claude, a chatbot created by the start-up Anthropic, seems less prone to sycophancy than ChatGPT, for instance, and more likely to cut off conversations when they veer into troubling territory. Well-designed AI could possibly make for good talk therapy, at least in some cases, and many enterprises—including nonprofits—are working toward better models.

Yet business almost always looms. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in the generative-AI industry, and the companies—like their social-media forebears—will seek returns. In a blog post about “what we're optimizing ChatGPT for” earlier this year, OpenAI wrote that it pays “attention to whether you return daily, weekly, or monthly, because that shows ChatGPT is useful enough to come back to.” This sounds quite a bit like the scale-at-all-costs mentality of any other social platform. As with their predecessors, we may not know everything about how chatbots are programmed, but we can see this much at least: They know how to lure and engage.

From the May 2012 issue: Is Facebook making us lonely?

That Zuckerberg would be selling generative AI makes perfect sense. It is an isolating technology for an isolated time. His first products drove people apart, even as they promised to connect us. Now chatbots promise a solution. They seem to listen. They respond. The mind wants desperately to connect with a person—and fools itself into seeing one in a machine.

Prepare to hear a lot about New York's new mayor.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Zohran Mamdani will be the unlikeliest mayor in New York City history. A 34-year-old backbench state assemblyman and self-proclaimed democratic socialist, Mamdani ran on the promise of affordability and was declared the winner not long after polls closed tonight. On his path to victory, he thrilled young voters in a way that few Democrats have in years. But perhaps no one was more delighted by his election than President Donald Trump.

Mamdani's victory was his second decisive win over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, whom he defeated in the Democratic primary in June. (The current mayor, Eric Adams, skipped the primary, choosing instead to run as an independent, but dropped out of the race in September.) Cuomo's father, Mario, another former governor, famously said, “You campaign in poetry; you govern in prose,” and Mamdani will soon have to trade his lofty rhetoric for the gritty municipal work of ensuring public safety, digging out from snowstorms, and confronting ever-widening income inequality. Previous New York mayors, of course, have had to take on those tasks, but Mamdani will also face a challenge unique to him: a brewing war with the president of the United States, himself a New Yorker.

Trump can no longer vote in the city that he called home for more than seven decades, but he got involved in the race anyway. He erroneously declared Mamdani a Communist and gave the younger Cuomo an eleventh-hour endorsement that the candidate, running as an independent, didn't really want. But Trump will offer more than antagonistic rhetoric; he's promising dramatic action, too. He warned in a social-media post last night that he would slash federal funding to the nation's largest city because he had a “strong conviction that New York City will be a Total Economic and Social Disaster should Mamdani win.” And, his aides tell me, making good on that threat would be just the beginning.

New York City—a Democratic stronghold that soundly spurned Trump—has so far largely been spared the president's wrath. That's because Trump has been waiting. So far this year, he has defied mayors' wishes—and court orders—to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. He has offered various defenses for the deployments—protecting ICE agents and fighting crime being the top ones—but has deliberately held back on doing so in New York. He wanted to see who won the mayor's race, his advisers have told me. Trump privately made clear to them that, were Mamdani to triumph, he would use that outcome as justification to deploy troops in a city that, he said, would be left inherently unsafe under socialist rule.

Trump's budget director, as part of the ongoing federal-government shutdown, already froze money for a pair of key New York infrastructure projects—a much-needed train tunnel under the Hudson River to New Jersey and an extension of the long-awaited Second Avenue Subway. The president has asked his aides to explore cutting federal funding to other city ventures. He's also declared that the federal government may step in to undercut the city's popular congestion-pricing toll program for no other reason than to inflict political pain. An ICE raid on Canal Street in Manhattan's Chinatown last month was considered a sign of things to come, as administration officials prepare to make New York a high-profile epicenter of immigration enforcement. Trump is desperate to preserve his party's control of Congress next year; he sees New York—and Mamdani—as an effective foil.

Mamdani told me today that he is prepared. “These are threats, many of which go far beyond the power of the presidency, and this is money that New Yorkers are owed,” he told me. “We're going to use the courts; we're going to use the bully pulpit; we're going to use every tool at our disposal to stand up for our city.”

This isn't the first time a president has turned on New York. Fifty years ago last week, one of New York's most venerable institutions put forth its most famous headline. On October 30, 1975, the New York Daily News declared “FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD” after President Gerald Ford opted against bailing out the Big Apple during its fiscal crisis. Ford's edict was met with fury in the five boroughs and may have helped cost him the election the following year, but it was at least based on some principle; he thought that New York's spending was out of control and that it would set a bad precedent for Washington to bail out any one city. (He also never said the words drop dead.) And Ford eventually gave in; he later signed off on $2.3 billion in federal loans to help New York steady itself.

Trump's attacks appear to be based far more on political opportunism and personal pique. He has always had a love-hate relationship with his native city. He was born in Queens—the same borough in which Mamdani lives, but about 10 miles away—and carried with him the insecurities of an outer-borough real-estate developer who longed to cross the East River and work and live in the glamour of Manhattan. But even after he achieved success, he was still never truly accepted by the city's blue bloods, who found him too vulgar and too gauche. Trump's resentment helped fuel his eventual foray into politics. But even as he captured the presidency in 2016, he received just 10 percent of the vote in Manhattan. In his first term, he abandoned plans to frequently come back to Trump Tower, and his rare journeys home were met with protest. He criticized then-Mayor Bill de Blasio but largely ignored the city. In late 2020, he became a Florida resident.

But the Trump Organization is still based in Manhattan. The president has stocked his administration with New Yorkers, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Lee Zeldin, who leads the EPA. He keeps tabs on his old city, often through a variety of friends who remain there. And, those close to him tell me, he was as surprised by Mamdani's rise as the rest of the political world.

A few days after Trump won last November, Mamdani went to the Bronx to try to talk to shell-shocked New Yorkers about the election. Few people recognized him, even though he had launched his campaign several weeks earlier, and barely anyone stopped to talk to him. He returned to that same street this week and was thronged by hundreds of voters after he spent a year running an invigorated, social-media-friendly campaign. Mamdani had energy and charm, and no shortage of ideas that were quickly turned into easy-to-digest slogans such as “Free buses” and “Freeze the rent.” He relentlessly focused on affordability and economic issues, a welcome message in a city with an extraordinarily high cost of living and stark income stratification.

He faced real detractors, including some within his own party. Some of his ideas were considered outlandish and impractical, and observers pointed to the struggles of progressive mayors in other cities. Even some who admired Mamdani's campaign were fearful that he would be elevated by Republicans as the face of the left, proof that Democrats were far too liberal for average Americans. He took criticism for his previous support of the “Defund the Police” movement and for defending the pro-Palestinian slogan “Globalize the Intifada.” (He has since stepped back from both sentiments, though a segment of the city's Jewish population views him with suspicion.)

After the primary, Mamdani moved a little toward the center and began to quietly consult with experts and moderate technocrats, including some who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Late in the campaign, the race took a dark turn into Islamophobia as some on the right evoked the September 11 terror attacks to decry the possibility of the city's first Muslim mayor. Mamdani was also slow to pick up national endorsements, even from party leaders from his own city. (House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed Mamdani less than two weeks ago; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer never did.) But Mamdani was widely admired for how he ran his campaign, a social-media-savvy, say-yes-to-every-interview approach that feels like a model for other ambitious Democrats. Young voters came out in huge numbers, early-voting totals exploded, and the overall turnout was the highest for a mayor's race in more than 50 years.

Read: Eric Adams's totally predictable MAGA turn

Mamdani benefited, of course, from the implosions of two more prominent figures. As hard as it is to recall now, Adams was considered a rising star after his 2021 win, a moderate Democrat who would be tough on crime in a city reeling from the pandemic. But he came to office with few big ideas. His poll numbers were already slipping before he was indicted on bribery and campaign-finance violations for allegedly receiving illegal gifts and campaign contributions from foreign sources and using his office to provide favors. Far worse for his political future was what came next: the perception that he was beholden to Trump after the Department of Justice dropped the charges earlier this year. Adams bowed out of the race in late September and reluctantly endorsed Cuomo.

Cuomo, of course, brought his own baggage. When he made his entry into the race, many expected that his name recognition and wealthy backers would allow him to coast to victory. But he continued to face questions about the series of sexual-harassment allegations that led to his 2021 resignation as governor (he has denied wrongdoing), and during the primary, he ran a listless, desultory campaign. Before a late push in the general election, it was difficult to believe that he even really wanted the job. The Republican in the race, the public-safety activist and longtime gadfly Curtis Sliwa, absolutely wanted the job and refused repeated entreaties from both Cuomo and Trump to quit the race. Had he done so, perhaps Cuomo would have had a shot.

But instead it was a Mamdani coronation. He will take the oath of office on the steps of City Hall on January 1, and start leading a city of nearly 8.5 million people. The five boroughs' residents-–some excited, some uncertain-–will be watching. And so will one ex–New Yorker about 200 miles south.

What “democratic socialism” really means.

Socialists just seized the commanding heights of New York City.

On Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani — a longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) — won the mayoralty of America's largest municipality.

Mamdani's election constitutes a triumph for America's long-suffering socialist movement — possibly, the most significant in its history.

His victory may therefore lead some Americans to ask the question: What do these people actually want?

Or, more specifically: How do they think “democratic socialism” would work, in practice? Do Mamdani and his allies want to make America into Norway — or into a kinder, gentler Soviet Union?

These questions have no single answer. Pose them to two socialists and you'll get three opinions. But Bhaskar Sunkara, founder of the socialist magazine Jacobin, has sketched one of his movement's clearest blueprints for a democratic socialist society. And he will soon publish a more detailed account of that vision, which he calls “market socialism,” in a book coauthored with his colleagues Ben Burgis and Mike Beggs.

To better understand this vision of market socialism — and see how well it holds up under scrutiny — I spoke with Sunkara this week. We also discussed Mamdani's victory and what Democrats can (or can't) learn from it. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

What's your understanding of how Mamdani won? 

He ran a campaign that was laser-focused on issues of affordability, at a time when New York City is in an affordability crisis. The rest of the country is seeing real wage increases and New Yorkers are not. Obviously, the main cause of that is the ridiculous price of housing in the city, but there are other causes as well.

The campaign had a Bernie Sanders 2016 vibe. People would go to his rallies and he would just say, “freeze the ____” and everyone would shout “rent!” There was a level of repetition that the left learned from the Sanders campaign.

And that's just good politics. The Mamdani platform can fit on the back of a business card. By contrast, certain Democratic Party politicians seem to have a different white paper for every little segmented group.

And then, he's handsome, he's a good communicator, and just dynamic. In the closing days of the campaign, he was out in Queens talking to workers on graveyard shifts. He was just campaigning with a level of ferocity that none of his opponents were. And he was running against a disgraced former governor, a mayor who has his own kind of charisma but is facing corruption allegations, and a bunch of center-left technocrats who just did not have it.

When you first imagined democratic socialists taking power in New York, is this how you pictured it? Did Zohran's specific path to power surprise you in any way?

I was surprised that Zohran won. I was definitely a supporter from the beginning. But I thought of it more as a pressure campaign — to bring cost-of-living concerns to the forefront of the race.

What really surprised me was that, in the primary, Zohran actually did the thing that Bernie Sanders tried and failed to do in his presidential campaigns; he mobilized groups of people who were previously not voting in these low-turnout primaries. He mobilized young people, he mobilized some immigrant non-voters. In general, I've been critical of this mobilizational theory of politics: The idea that the left can win mostly by virtue of being more left-wing, putting forward the right set of demands and activating a public that doesn't already exist. But in this case, it happened.

Many have framed Mamdani's victory as proof that the left has a model of politics that can defeat the right nationally.

Skeptics, however, say that this overstates what Mamdani actually achieved: The Democratic Party already knew how to win mayoral elections in New York City. Just because democratic socialism can defeat Andrew Cuomo in a blue city doesn't mean it can win swing states.

I think Zohran shows that democratic socialism can actually win and energize people in many parts of the country, particularly in deep blue districts.

It's also true that socialism may be a liability in places that aren't like New York City. We also need figures like Dan Osborn.

The populist, independent Senate candidate who ran a strong (but losing) campaign in Nebraska last year. 

Right. We need candidates like that who can translate populist economic messaging to a very “red” part of the country.

And in many ways, Mamdani and Osborn are different expressions of the same set of egalitarian politics — a politics that seeks to create a fairer deal for working-class people. Obviously, they have different stances on social issues, they have different affects, they have different backgrounds. But fundamentally, I think that their campaigns rested on the same basic message about economic dignity and corporate accountability.

A centrist might argue that you're misconstruing the roots of Osborn's success. Yes, he used populist rhetoric and spoke to cost-of-living concerns. And that was important.

But he also ran as the “the only real conservative” in his race, promised to help Donald Trump build his wall, and attacked his Republican opponent for supporting Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill, arguing that investment in such basic public goods was wasteful and that we needed to cut the budget.

And if you look at other Democrats who perform well in swing districts or red states, they tend to engage in that kind of moderation. 

So, how do we know that Mamdani's specific model — emphasizing a robustly egalitarian message on economics while largely upholding progressive orthodoxy on social issues — is a viable formula nationally?

Candidates will need to find different vocabularies and points of emphasis in different places, ones that are true to both their values and those of their voters. Mamdani and Osborn are both popular, to a large degree, because they show what an alternative economic populist path looks like. But for that message to get through in Nebraska, you need to work with the electorate you have, not the one you might wish you had.

All right. We've talked enough about trifling subjects like how to win mayoral races or congressional elections. Let's talk about seizing the means of production. 

You are a proponent of “market socialism.” To many, that may sound like a contradiction in terms. Historically, socialism has been associated with the ambition to cease allocating resources through markets and begin doing so through central planning. So, why do you think that even a socialist utopia would want to preserve the market economy?

The market in and of itself isn't capitalism. Capitalism is a system where firms hire wage labor to produce for profit, extracting surplus value and reinvesting it to expand their capital.

In my vision, a socialist society would retain markets as tools for coordination and consumer choice. But the firms operating in these markets would be run by worker cooperatives that are funded by public banks.

The reason why I've come to embrace markets is just by looking at the actual practice of central planning under socialism.

In any system, society still has to decide what to produce, how much, and for whom. Central planning attempted to answer these questions administratively. But planners lacked the information necessary to rationally allocate goods. And they also faced severe incentive and agency problems — managers had little reason to report results honestly or innovate when the survival of their firms didn't depend on efficiency.

Why do you think some socialists nevertheless retain an aversion to markets?

Part of the problem is that, in today's economy, there's massive inequality. In the market, $1 amounts to one vote on what society is going to produce. Well, in our society, the most essential and hardworking people — those who take out our trash and provide other vital social functions — earn barely anything compared to the super rich. So, markets favor the latter's preferences over the former's.

But in a society with greater equality — including the end of wage labor and stronger social protections — markets could look very different. Saying, “Hey, I worked this much and earned an income of $100, and it's up to me how I want to spend this money” makes a lot more sense than deciding democratically how you get to spend your $100.

In any case, given the experience of the 20th century, the burden of proof is really on people who think that there's an alternative to markets as a coordination mechanism.

But you believe there is an alternative to capitalism, as a system for organizing market production?

Yes. The problem with capitalism is, first, distributional: It allows poverty amid plenty and gross, unnecessary levels of income equality.

And then there is also a democratic problem: the fact that our workplaces are run as quasi-dictatorships, especially in non-unionized sectors. And it's my view that workers can democratically elect management and run their workplaces in a different way. And that's why I'm a socialist.

A liberal might question your analogy between capitalist firms and dictatorships. After all, a dictatorial state wields the power of life and death over its subjects. And its citizens often can't legally escape its control. 

By contrast, in liberal capitalist societies, firms are voluntary organizations. These institutions cannot kill or imprison their employees. And all workers have the legal right to refuse employment at a hierarchically organized enterprise. 

Of course, in our world, workers may not always be capable of exercising that right. There isn't always another job available or alternative way to feed your family. But in principle, one could imagine a society with a general welfare state — and full employment — where workers can comfortably quit any job they don't like. 

Why then, in our ideal society, should we forbid people from forming economic enterprises that are internally governed in a non-democratic manner? After all, we're presumably going to let people form religious and civic organizations that are not internally democratic, unless your socialist vision entails the criminalization of Catholicism. 

I understand the liberal intuition there — that if people are free to leave their jobs, then they're not really unfree. First of all, it's true that we're not living under feudalism. But I think that's a very thin conception of freedom. Under capitalism, workers have “exit” without “voice.” They can quit, but they can't meaningfully shape the conditions of their work under ordinary conditions. For many people, exit isn't a genuine exercise of autonomy, but a threat you make when you're desperate.

Democracy at work is about extending the same principle we apply in politics: we don't say people are free because they can leave their home country; we say they're free because they have a say in how it's governed.

Would democratically managing firms make them less efficient — and thus, ultimately, less beneficial for society? One concern might be that if managers ultimately need to worry about winning reelection, they will be reluctant to fire workers for bad performance. Or they might hesitate to invest in labor-saving machinery that might increase the firm's productivity — and reduce costs for consumers — but threaten workers' job stability.

It's true that any successor system to capitalism has to be at least as efficient at coordinating the division of labor. Socialism that can't deliver innovation and rising living standards isn't going to be legitimate or durable. But I don't think we should assume that efficiency and democracy are at odds.

There are reasons to think that market socialism could actually be more dynamic. Workers at labor-managed enterprises are often more motivated to share information and better positioned to identify improvements than they are now. Firms would still compete in markets, so inefficiency would be disciplined by failure.

I also don't think democratic firms would avoid labor-saving technology. They'd still have to compete in markets and cover their costs, so productivity gains would remain in their interest. The difference is that the benefits of those gains would be shared among the people who created them.

So, in those markets, how are you replacing the functions that are currently fulfilled by capitalists? In our world, investors are primarily responsible for identifying promising enterprises. And they often force the shutdown of inefficient ones, freeing up capital for more productive businesses. So, how does your system function without capitalists?

In a market socialist system, you need public banks that can support worker-controlled firms, and provide them with startup capital. And they're doing that on the same basis as a bank would under capitalism — they are trying to give money to firms that they believe will be profitable and will pay back their loans.

As far as closing down inefficient firms, one of the greatest failures of socialism in the 20th century is what economists have called “soft budget constraints.” In a state socialist system, it would often be apparent that some firms were very inefficient, but it would be impossible to shut them down for a variety of reasons.

Partly, this was because of political dynamics: Authoritarian socialist societies relied on full employment as a means of legitimizing their rule. And it was politically unpopular to shut down these firms.

So, how do you resolve this? Well, the firms have hard budgets. The firms need to produce enough to cover their wage bill, cover their expenses, otherwise they're just simply going to go out of business.

But why wouldn't political dynamics just reproduce the “soft budget” problem again, in practice? Ultimately, these banks are public entities accountable to elected governments, which will have incentives to avoid economic disruptions.

For example: Say a public bank chokes off funding to a large, inefficient steel mill and lots of workers lose their jobs. That decision is going to be very salient to those unemployed steel workers. And those workers could then threaten to vote against the current government unless it intervenes and reverses the bank's decision.

Meanwhile, it's unlikely that other voters would mobilize in support of shutting down the mill. It might be in the long-term interest of virtually all workers for capital to be efficiently allocated. But the immediate benefit of closing any one firm is small, diffuse, and essentially invisible to ordinary people. 

We see these dynamics at play in the real world. When economic decisions become politicized, governments routinely pursue policies that benefit well-organized interest groups, at the expense of the broader populace.To many liberals, this is why we need private investors; their insulation from the political process enables them to impose hard budgets and thus, allocate capital efficiently.

Or, to put a finer point on the argument: the reason why socialism has historically failed isn't due to some contingent design failure. It's that bringing all investment under the purview of state institutions inevitably leads to inefficiency. 

That's a legitimate worry, but the tendency for politicians to shield failing firms from closure isn't unique to socialism. We see versions of the same “soft budget” behavior under capitalism all the time.

The real question is how to manage it. In a socialist framework, public banks would need to operate with clear rules and genuine operational autonomy.

Political pressure to prop up firms can also be mitigated through social policy. If workers know that job loss doesn't mean destitution — because there are strong safety nets and active labor-market programs that quickly reconnect people to work — then firm failure becomes more tolerable. People don't have to fear it, and governments don't have to panic over it.

Perhaps, the most common argument against socialism is that it erodes incentives to perform economically valuable work. 

If we want to have brain surgeons, we need some people to dedicate many years of their lives to the diligent study of medicine. In our society, we motivate that effort by awarding brain surgeons with higher levels of compensation than the typical worker. 

Likewise, if we want innovative businesses, we need people who are willing to take entrepreneurial risks. And we encourage people to take those risks by providing huge returns to successful businesses.

It sounds to me like you want to retain these incentives under market socialism. But how do you accomplish that without recreating the inequality that motivates your opposition to capitalism in the first place? 

We should absolutely be paying people more to incentivize them to go into jobs like brain surgery. And someone who helps create a great new product or firm should get certain windfall benefits.

To me, there's a difference between getting paid more so that you can consume more, and getting paid so much that you have more power over other people, in a less justifiable way.

Bill Ackman, the billionaire, is so unpopular that his opposition may have actually helped Mamdani. But he threw millions of dollars into the New York City election to sway ordinary working-class New Yorkers — who are as politically passionate as Bill Ackman, but have no way to influence the election except with their votes or maybe a little spare time to canvass.

That's income actually influencing power.

And this also happens when a super-rich capitalist is unhappy with government policy and therefore decides that they're going to go on capital strike: They're going to stop investing to punish the government.

That creates the type of power disparities that socialists are concerned about. We're much less concerned about the fact that Shohei Ohtani is paid more than us (Ohtani is underpaid, by the way).

So, there can be inequality but we're capping its extent: Past a certain point, we can't allow individuals to accrue more wealth because it will give them too much power. 

In practice, doesn't that mean that we are eliminating certain entrepreneurs' incentives to start new businesses, once they've already had enough success to hit the maximum wealth threshold? Like, if you helped create one $100 billion business, you're probably not going to be allowed to earn much more income or wealth from a new enterprise. 

I don't think it's about an absolute wealth cap so much as limiting what wealth does — making sure it doesn't translate into undemocratic power, whether in politics or in the workplace.

So there's no hard threshold for income accumulation in the abstract. But if you're drawing an outsized share, it has to reflect real value creation for your firm and its members. Those disparities need to be functional, meaning you need to be producing better outcomes for workers, managers, and the enterprise as a whole, not just getting rewards for ownership alone.

In trying to imagine a functional socialism, you've made peace with many things that leftists have historically disdained about capitalism — inequality, unemployment, the profit motive. In your view, socialist societies tried to dispense with these features of market capitalism, only to discover their practical necessity.

Some might say: Why risk making the same mistake with private capital markets? 

After all, we already have a model for a market economy in which inequality is constrained, workers enjoy protection against exploitation in the workplace, the state provides myriad public goods, and welfare programs ensure everyone enjoys a decent standard of living: It's called social democracy.

And unlike market socialism, we know that social democracy actually works. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden exist.

So, why not stick to what we know? Why risk the possibility that abolishing capital markets will actually sap economic dynamism and promote authoritarianism, like many of the socialist movement's past attempts to discard core institutions of industrial modernity?

At a normative level, I'm a democratic socialist because I think there's something objectionable about capitalism. It's hard for me to imagine a society that meets my egalitarian goals if we have a class of people who own production and a class of people who have nothing to give but their labor.

Now, why should someone pursue democratic socialism, even if they think social democracy is egalitarian enough? I think that's a reasonable question. Many of the mechanisms we've talked about — public investment, democratic firms, a big welfare state, more equal distribution of income — sound like extensions of social democracy. And that's no surprise — they emerge from a lot of the same impulses.

But in my reading of history, social democracies always run up against capitalist power.

Social democracy creates doses of socialism within capitalism. But ultimately, private investors still control the means of production and the means of investment. They can choose not to invest if they don't like government policies; if they feel like taxes are getting too high, there's too much labor protection, there's too much public competition. And that's happened repeatedly throughout history.

These capital strikes don't require capitalists to all conspire in a smoke-filled room together. It's really built into the logic of investment under capitalism — when business confidence wavers, capital can just basically say, “Listen, we're not investing, it's not worth it for us.” And ultimately, at that point, social democratic parties always have to dial things back and restore conditions of profitability.

To have a functioning society — that's rich enough to sustain a welfare state and all these other good things — you need productivity, you need firms producing things, you need certain economic fundamentals. But you don't need capitalists having a veto over the kind of society we can build.

Vox's Astead Herndon explains why Zohran Mamdani's win matters for Democrats.

Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, defeating disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa to become the first Muslim and first South Asian mayor in the city's history. To unpack what Mamdani's win means, I turned to my colleague Astead Herndon, who was on the ground reporting from an election night watch party for Mamdani. (You may have seen his big Mamdani profile in New York Times Magazine last month.)

Astead and I talked about what he's learned reporting on Mamdani's campaign, how Mamdani got here, and what his victory means on the national stage, for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

Zohran Mamdani just won the NYC mayoral race. Why should people outside New York be invested in this?

I think that this represents an expansion of the progressive playbook that Bernie Sanders wrote for Democrats in his presidential campaigns. Mamdani has successfully modeled how to create a left-liberal coalition among the Democratic electorate, and he's also modeled how to reach people beyond the ideological spectrum by bringing newer, and particularly younger, voters into the process.

I would say that the reason Donald Trump won the popular vote is because of a dropoff in voter turnout in places like New York and Chicago and a lot of these blue cities. A lot of their brand problem is due to people feeling as if these cities haven't worked and Democratic governance hasn't really produced results. And so I would say that this represents a response to that, not just on the electoral front, but also on the policy front. A working city and doing things that tangibly affect people, be it public transit, be it renters, is actually going to produce a better proof point for Democratic politics than they've had before.

I think that that all adds up to an election that could feel just as impactful as the initial Bernie playbooks felt.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Mamdani is a pretty new figure on the political scene. For people who aren't in New York or haven't been following this race closely, what should they know about him?

For one, he shows how you can grow that type of name recognition outside of traditional channels. He expertly used digital and social media to make an argument. He expertly used organic field organizing to drive energy.

He certainly represents democratic socialists. He is someone who has been politically trained in the housing-first, class-based language of democratic socialism and socialist politics. I think the other thing to know is, this is someone who's advocated on behalf of Palestinians since they were in high school. That has been a guiding light for him in terms of the way he sees frameworks of justice. That doesn't mean it was front and center in this mayoral race, but for a lot of people, particularly in the last couple of years, being able to openly speak on behalf of Palestinians or to criticize Israel has become an increasing part of their moral litmus test.

Even as I'm here, you hear a lot of people say that that's the reason that they first found him, because he was willing to do that speaking out, and I think that's important. When you talk to these folks here, someone said very specifically, Well, he was willing to speak out, so I was willing to trust him. And you hear that all the time.

I think Democrats have a problem with generational change as well, and so some of this is represented beyond the left-right ideological spectrum. He is someone who could run a different type of campaign because he is of a different era, and I think that also matters.

Something we saw a lot, particularly in the final few weeks of the campaign, was some really ugly Islamophobia bubbling up, from Cuomo in particular. Has that come up in your reporting tonight?

I don't think that you can separate that from the big turnout that this race has inspired. Andrew Cuomo, in my opinion, ran a campaign that was insulting to New Yorkers, that was insulting to the city, that wasn't based in the good parts about the city, but was based in fear of both the candidate and the place and of his religion and identity.

I think that Islamophobia backfired. I think that this is not a place where he could cobble together enough Republican votes to win. He needed Democrats, and Democrats don't like Donald Trump, and they don't like the way he was engaging in this anti-Zohran behavior. I really think there was a group of people who kind of came [out] because they were offput by the way Cuomo was running. I think that that had an impact in this race, and it could be part of the reasons we saw such a youth surge in the early vote and even on Election Day.

He represents emerging groups — Muslim, South Asians, first-generation Americans are a growing part of the Democratic electorate. A pretty succinct reason for people to care is that they're going to matter much more when it comes to the 2028 primary, and so it's important for Democrats to break their framework of really seeing race and identity only through the lens of Black and white.

Is there anything you think that national media or folks who are just tuning in now are missing or misunderstanding about the campaign that was just run?

To that point about his advocacy being helpful, it's particularly a point about the primary. So the people who just tuned in for the general election, they missed that. There's a reason he stuck out among all of the other people who were getting in this race, and that's because he consolidated a larger group of people and spoke out at a time when people were upset for their Democratic leaders not doing so.

The other thing I would say is that there was an assumption that Cuomo would keep his numbers among Black voters, and that assumption seems to have collapsed. At least, in places like the Bronx, Mamdani made big gains. I think a lot of people have assumed that some of these coalitions are firm, but voters are dynamic actors; and so as we enter a new era that's shaped by Donald Trump, I think people are prioritizing an authentic messenger over nearly anything else. And so you can be a moderate, you can be a progressive, but it has to be what you truly believe in.

As Mamdani takes office and has to switch from campaigning to governing, what do you think his voters are going to be looking for?

I think this expectation is on the agenda he laid out, mainly the three promises: free buses, free child care and the rent freeze. What becomes difficult is, how does he make that happen? He has certainly made inroads with Albany electeds, but that's still going to require public engagement, public pressure for him to be able to work that inside-out strategy. If these voters come out and then go home, it makes it much harder for Mamdani to get things done.

I think the biggest factor for him is the external one. Donald Trump can wreak havoc on New York City, and he may choose to do so, and so that seems to be, to me, the biggest barrier that Mamdani might face. It's not necessarily his own competence, but what the national environment may impose.

You spent a lot of time with him for a big profile that came out last month. You're on the ground now. What are your impressions of him personally, or your takeaways leaving this campaign season?

Sometimes people use “politician” as an insult, but I mean it as a compliment. He's not a random person out of nowhere. He's someone who has worked to fit his beliefs into the political structure, has taken some L's and has grown, and it's basically workshopped the version of himself that is ready to step into this mayoral moment.

The other thing is that he is serious about the job at hand. This isn't a stepping stone, or at least he's not viewing it in that way. This is a person who ran to be mayor and wants to be mayor. And so that's really what struck me, and I think it's the reason he's been successful, is because he put that level of intention into the world.

﻿What you're feeling is ambivalence. It can be a good thing.

Early into her relationship with Thomas, Leigh was on the fence. Those days should've been rife with butterflies and intrigue, but something was off. Sure, Thomas was kind, gentle, shy — in other words, unlike the guys she used to date — but Leigh was unsure if she found his attentiveness enticing or annoying. She was, in a word, ambivalent. Over the ensuing weeks, though, her attraction grew, and four months later, she was “bonded and invested” in Thomas. The feeling wouldn't last.

As soon as Leigh overcame her ambivalence, Thomas seemingly fell into his. “He became — and has maintained — a high level of avoidance through this relationship,” says Leigh, a 33-year-old psychologist who asked to be referred to by her middle name in order to speak about her relationship. “Actually, he's become the highly ambivalent one. So he'll be quite avoidant, and then if he sensed me pulling away just a little bit, then he comes running back.” And so the cycle continued for two-and-a-half years.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Among the many unrealistic romantic ideals, the notion that your relationship must be nothing but positive is among the most misguided. “I call these the ‘Disney did us dirty' ideas,” says licensed clinical psychologist Alexandra Solomon. Very few relationships are wholly uplifting and supportive, and just as many are outright toxic and dismissive. Everything else falls in the middle.

Ambivalent relationships are marked by elements of both positivity and negativity — in other words, mixed feelings — and they're incredibly common. Research has shown that nearly half of our social networks are made up of ambivalent connections: the in-laws who get on our nerves, the friend who sometimes makes jokes at our expense, and, yes, the partner who chronically forgets to put dishes in the sink. In a study of long-married couples, about 60 percent of participants reported feeling ambivalent toward their partner. The other 40 percent reported feeling pretty good about their marriages, according to Bert Uchino, a professor of social and health psychology at the University of Utah and one of the study's authors. But maybe the researchers caught these couples on a good day. Perhaps reality is less rosy.

While emotionally uncomfortable, ambivalence also leaves its mark on the body. In his decades of research, Uchino has found that interacting with (and even talking about) someone who has both positive and negative qualities results in higher blood pressure than engaging with someone who is purely positive. Similarly, receiving support from an ambivalent tie can increase blood pressure. Another study of older married couples found that people who both viewed their partner ambivalently and were perceived as ambivalent by their spouse had greater coronary-artery calcification, a hardening of the arteries.

Still, mixed feelings don't need to be seen as a threat to the relationship, a harbinger of impending doom, or a cause for stress — if only because they're so common. It's certainly possible to feel ambivalent toward a toxic partner, and ambivalent relationships can devolve into unhealthy ones. However, the reality of any given relationship may be much more banal, and therefore complicated.

So where is the line between a relationship worth salvaging and one worth leaving? Indeed, in relatively healthy, non-abusive relationships, the presence of ambivalence can actually motivate couples to improve their communication or spend more meaningful time together.

“A healthier narrative around ambivalence, I think, is warranted,” says Giulia Zoppolat, a postdoctoral researcher at Amsterdam University Medical Centers. “Understanding when it's okay and a natural thing of life and then being able to recognize when instead, it's more like an alarm bell of there is something really wrong here that I need to work on and [take] action on.”

Ambivalence can come and go in phases, or it can become a defining feature of the relationship. You might move through periods where you feel confident your partner sees you, hears you, understands you, and others where the connection is strained. You could also experience a sustained bout of fence-sitting, unsure of whether you want in or out.

Usually, ambivalence is predicated by transitional life moments, whether deciding to move in together, whether to remain faithful, or after having a kid. These are events that “pull forward both positive and negative behaviors,” according to Uchino. These trajectory-altering decisions could make you question all the pros and cons of the relationship. Is this the life I want? Do I want this life with this person? Is there someone else whom I could picture myself with?

“This is not necessarily a bad thing,” Zoppolat says. “If you're trying to make a big decision in your relationship — like, should we have a child together, should we move to a different city or country together? — these big life changes. It's functional. It's important to really think about the relationship and whether you want to make this big commitment with this person.”

Within these crossroads, there may be inconsistencies in support that can also contribute to ambivalence, Zoppolat has found in her studies. Your partner might be engaged and active in childrearing some weeks and distant and unhelpful at other times. Outside of major life changes, the accumulation of routine and everyday arguments — domestic inequities, financial stress, how to prioritize one another — can snowball into relationship ambivalence. The realization that the person you live with doesn't care about a sink constantly full of dishes, for instance, could be a source of ongoing negativity.

Holding conflicting feelings toward your romantic partner impacts how you view the relationship — and your behavior within it. Ambivalence can lead to less intimacy, thoughts of breaking up, distress, anxiety, and lower well-being as well as declines in relationship and life satisfaction. This can lead to particularly volatile behavior, oscillating between supporting your partner and giving them the cold shoulder. Since it's easier to feel entirely optimistic or completely hopeless about the relationship rather than a mix of both, it's common to be pulled one way or the other.

“We see that people are more likely to do constructive things, like wanting to resolve an issue in their relationship, want to spend more time with their partner in positive ways, and engage with their partner more positively,” Zoppolat says. “But there's also a flip side where they may be more critical or want to distance from their partner.”

To accept ambivalence is to embrace the humanity in another, flaws and all, to understand how even the most important relationships can be sources of negativity at times. 

Simply admitting your fence-sitting to yourself can feel threatening: This isn't the fun, loving relationship I thought it was. This out-in-the-open ambivalence is detrimental to relationships, according to Ruddy Faure, an assistant professor of social and cultural psychology at Radboud University in the Netherlands. “In general, explicit ambivalence seems to be bad for relationships and for well-being in general,” he says. “People feel more stressed, less happy, and that typically relates to more negative relationship outcomes as well. People are less satisfied, more likely to break up.” Perhaps the conflicts are too deep, too difficult to solve — or shouldn't be solved. No more excusing harmful behavior.

There can be upsides to ambivalence, though. According to Solomon, maintaining contradictory feelings is a sign of emotional maturity. Ambivalence leads people to spend more time thinking about hardships in their relationship, but it also inspires them to improve it. These positive changes not only impact how you feel about your partner, but can also minimize the physical effects of ambivalence — the high blood pressure, the coronary-artery calcification — and therefore stave off any potential chronic health issues. “When you're talking about something like cardiovascular disease, it's a long-term, decades-long process,” Uchino says. Limiting the amount of time you walk around with high blood pressure because you occasionally hate your partner bodes well for your health.

So how do you keep the negative from outweighing the positive? Research lacks definitive answers. But anyone who feels unsafe in their relationship should feel inspired to end the relationship, says licensed marriage and family therapist Moe Ari Brown.

In order to properly address ambivalence, you need to mine its roots, Brown says. What are you truly feeling? What feels off? Is there something you want to change about the relationship? Has time illuminated quirks and habits you find unsavory? What new wants and needs are you discovering? Are you unsure about the future of the relationship? Has the spark died?

Then, try to determine if there's an ask you can make of your partner that will increase connection. If your ambivalence stems from feeling like you no longer have fun together, try suggesting former (or new) rituals: You might need to start dating each other again. Keep the language positive, Solomon says, since “I'm feeling ambivalent about our relationship” isn't likely to land. You could say something along the lines of, “I really missed how in the early months of our relationship we would always have a show we were watching together. Can we be a little more intentional about watching something?” instead of, “You don't ever spend time with me.”

Ultimately, working through ambivalence is an internal process. The tendency to make ambivalence the other person's fault is a common reflex, and we often fail to recognize the role we play, the times we pull away, or the critical comments we make. But instead of ruminating over past arguments, make an effort to remember the positive moments, too: the memories of early dates, vacations, inside jokes. “Having these positive biases really help people move forward in their relationships and be able to forgive more easily,” Faure says. “Or also just being a little bit more persistent and invested in a relationship, even when the relationship is going through a rough patch.”

To accept ambivalence is to embrace the humanity in another, flaws and all, to understand how even the most important relationships can be sources of negativity at times. Even the fairy tale romances have their fair share of ups and downs. Research shows that simply being aware of the less-than-positive emotions you harbor toward your partner can help you regulate your emotions, have more constructive conversations, and lead to greater relational satisfaction. Romantic ambivalence may not be the ideal, but it's normal, and certainly preferable to the alternative.

As for Leigh and her ambivalent boyfriend Thomas, his hot-and-cold tendencies would ultimately be the couple's undoing. Earlier this year, he insisted Leigh move in with him, only for him to reverse course three months later — after she'd already made herself at home. “It absolutely broke everything in me, and so I just receded from him,” Leigh says. They'll cohabitate through the end of their lease, but have effectively split.

The most heartbreaking part for Leigh is that despite her initial hesitations and his perpetual ambivalence, their connection grew. After all the breakdowns and reconciliations, she couldn't stomach another.

“This time,” Leigh says, “where do I rebuild from here?”

There's too much news. We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what's happening and why it matters.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

My eyes are part of my body. Why do I have separate vision benefits?

The eyes aren't just a window into the soul — they can also tell doctors a lot about what's happening in the rest of our body. Why, then, do I have separate insurance cards for my medical and vision care?

It's another oddity of US health care, a system that nobody would necessarily design on purpose but one we're nevertheless stuck with. During open enrollment this year, you might be able to sign up for a vision plan through your work for, say, $10 per month or so — if you're lucky.

But for many Americans, vision insurance simply isn't an option: Less than 30 percent of US workers are offered vision benefits, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

If you're on Medicaid, whether you can receive vision care depends on the state you live in. Patients on the traditional Medicare program, meanwhile, have no vision benefits unless they purchase them separately; the patients who sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan might be able to get vision benefits — at an additional cost.

All of this means that most of the US population doesn't have access to a routine eye examination covered by insurance.

Medical costs keep going up, and yet our two political parties are stuck in an impasse over what to do about health care policy — while patients hang in the balance. And now, here again is that stressful time of the year — even without government chaos — to sign up for your health insurance and other benefits for next year. Health care costs and the cost of living keep rising, making these decisions all the more important for your financial well-being.

We've covered open enrollment from every angle in the Vox guide to using your benefits to make sure you know why the system works this way and how you could make it work the best for you. Read on to learn:

You can also read the whole package here.

The problem, as with dental insurance, is that the US health system has been built piecemeal over many decades. It wasn't rationally designed. American health insurance started with hospital-only plans a century ago, and under that nascent system, even routine doctor visits were paid for out of pocket. As routine services grew more and more expensive over the decades, everything from prescription drugs to primary care visits was added to the standard suite of insurance benefits. But that never encompassed vision or dental care.

And then, separate from all of this, a cottage industry of discount plans for dental and vision services blossomed. In the 1950s, one group of optometrists in California started offering discount plans to their customers — a novel but flawed model for covering some of people's vision care costs that spread across the country. And that is more or less how vision insurance works today: It's a discount on eye exams and glasses, not a comprehensive insurance product that protects you from exorbitant costs.

But it's not working for many people: Most Americans, especially middle-class and working-class families, don't receive vision benefits through their work, and to purchase a vision care plan on your own is another $30 to $50 per month for people who may not have a lot of disposable income. About 25 percent of Americans said in a KFF survey that they had skipped vision care that they needed because of the costs.

Making matters worse, the vision care industry is extremely consolidated: One company may provide your eye benefits, employ your eye doctor, and sell your eyeglasses. While alternative eye care providers like Warby Parker have come onto the scene, glasses can still cost hundreds of dollars without vision benefits.

These issues are about to get a lot worse. Research shows Americans have been spending more of their money on vision-related services over the past decade. America also has a sizable aging population as the baby boomer, Gen X, and millennial generations push into retirement and their middle-aged years. The number of Americans with vision problems is expected to double from 12 million to 24 million by 2050. But younger people today are also experiencing more vision problems than previous generations — possibly because of increased screen time and less time spent outside — according to recent research.

We have to figure out a better way to protect our peepers.

Vision coverage in the US is currently defined by its inequities.

Its benefits, for those lucky enough to have them, are not distributed equally. High-wage white-collar workers are more likely to be offered vision benefits than low-wage workers in the service industries. And within the federal health care system, it varies a lot, too: All states offer vision coverage to low-income kids on Medicaid, and some states offer robust vision benefits to adults on Medicaid, too, but others do not. Within the Medicare system, most plans don't cover routine eye exams or new frames. But for people who sign up for an alternative Medicare Advantage plan — Americans 65 and older who are more likely to be higher-income — typically have vision care covered as part of that plan, though it can have substantial cost-sharing requirements.

This patchwork system turns having vision insurance into a game of luck. Did your company have a good year last year, so they can keep offering vision benefits? Or will they have to cut them if the economy turns south? We see the same pattern in Medicaid: States are generous with their vision coverage — but only when they can afford to be. As of 2022, as many as 15 million adults lived in states that did not provide comprehensive eye exam and eyeglasses coverage.

“States add and drop these benefits partly based on budgetary conditions,” Brandy Lipton, a health economist at University of California Irvine, told me. “If they're seeing some extra funds, then they may add them in. And if they're struggling a little bit or experiencing higher enrollment than expected and things like that, they might take them away.”

This is the problem with the system we have set up: Your ability to get vision care can change in an instant if your state decides to take away your Medicaid benefits, or if you change jobs and no longer receive a vision plan.

This is the problem with the system we have set up: Your ability to get vision care can change in an instant if your state decides to take away your Medicaid benefits, or if you change jobs and no longer receive a vision plan. And when people lose their benefits, most stop getting their eyes checked. That means their vision problems will get worse — and doctors could, at the same time, miss an opportunity to identify early problems with diabetes or heart disease. Damage to the tiny blood vessels in your eyes can be evidence of more widespread cardiovascular problems. Given all the cracks in vision coverage, a lot of people are going to fall through.

And when they do, the consequences are serious. Vision care is effective, if you can get it: A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology found that people who received vision services simply maintained better vision throughout their lives. They were more likely to be able to recognize friends across the street and read printed materials than people who did not, and those who had a serious eye disease saw the same benefits to their sight when receiving routine vision care.

But more than that, routine eye examinations offer physicians a chance to see what's happening all over your body, not just inside your eyeballs.

Poor vision and eye issues can give clues about whether someone might develop other conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or high cholesterol and blood pressure. Vision issues, too, can be linked with depression.

“During a routine eye exam, there's a lot that an eye care professional can see about your health,” Lipton said. “That's potentially a missed opportunity if people aren't getting routine eye exams and to have that extra contact with the health care system and potentially get a diagnosis.”

It could even be a boon to the employers who offer vision benefits: Lipton and University of Maryland researcher Michel Boudreaux studied what had happened with working-age Medicaid patients when they were offered vision benefits from 2003 to 2012, using federal survey data, They found that workers were able to work more hours and work higher-skill jobs when they received regular eye care.

But at least so far, improving vision insurance has been an afterthought in US health care reform. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has introduced bills that would require Medicare to cover vision care for people in the traditional program, but otherwise, there aren't currently any serious proposals to integrate vision services into conventional health coverage on the table.

Other developed countries offer a few potential fixes. In Germany, for example, eye exams are covered by health insurance plans, but you have to pay for your own eyeglasses or contacts. In France, many people can receive simple thin black frames for free; it is only if you decide you want designer shades or something more stylish that you have to pay out of pocket for your glasses.

The gaps in the current American system and the potential benefits of more people receiving vision care should be obvious. US health policy has been an ongoing struggle to patch up the holes in our makeshift system. Extending vision benefits to more people would be an easy win.

The gloom on Wall Street spread across Asia on Wednesday, with key indexes tumbling as a global tech sell-off deepened.

In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 Index slid as much as 4.7%, led by chip test provider Adventest, which plunged 11%.

In South Korea, the Kospi index dropped as much as 6.2% as chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix sank 8.2% and 9.5%, respectively. The declines erased much of the Kospi's 20% surge in October.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company tumbled 3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 2.9%.

The downturn reflected a ""gloomy and damp portrayal of risk,"" wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Australian brokerage Pepperstone, in a Wednesday note.

That sentiment marks a sharp contrast with the optimism that has fueled markets this year, as investors piled into artificial intelligence plays that sent valuations to new highs.

But concerns are mounting that some companies' valuations have outpaced their actual progress — and that they may struggle to deliver on lofty AI ambitions despite pouring billions into the technology.

Adding to the selling pressure was Michael Burry, the famed ""Big Short"" investor, whose hedge fund disclosed short bets against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday.

""Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news,"" wrote veteran analyst Ed Yardeni.

On Tuesday, shares of AI-powered data analytics firm Palantir tumbled 8% following its third-quarter earnings report and Burry's disclosure, despite solid results and upbeat guidance.

Other major tech names — including AMD, Oracle, and Nvidia — also dropped, dragging the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 down 2.1%.

""There is fear of an AI correction, and if it comes, it will sweep the rest of the market with it due to the heavyweight of the leading names,"" wrote Louis Navellier, the founder and chief investment officer at asset manager Navellier and Associates.

He wrote that while this earnings season has featured companies consistently beating forecasts, investors are showing signs of resistance to high valuations. He also still recommends Nvidia and Palantir.

Despite the selloff, ""we can't lose sight that it was only last week that the indexes were at all-time highs, and profit-taking is the normal course of action,"" Navellier wrote.

Palantir's stock remains up 152% year to date, while Nvidia — which closed 4% lower on Tuesday — is still up 48% over the same period.

Still, the selling may not be over.

""Simplistically, there aren't many reasons to buy here, and until we move closer to Nvidia's earnings on 19 November, the market lacks a short-term catalyst,"" wrote Pepperstone's Weston.

AI may completely transform the economy. Google DeepMind wants someone to find out how.

The company has been advertising for a ""Senior AI Economist"" in recent weeks to explore what economics would look like in a world with artificial general intelligence — a term for when machine intelligence can match humans in solving tasks.

""You will lead a new area of research, exploring post-AGI economics, the future of scarcity, and the distribution of power and resources in a world fundamentally reshaped by advanced AI,"" reads a job posting for the role, which requires a strong background in economics. 

One of the job's responsibilities is to build economic simulations and models ""to explore post-AGI scenarios.""

They will also be expected to conduct research on the ""long-term economic impacts of AGI, questioning existing assumptions about scarcity, wealth, and distribution.""

Google did not immediately reply to a Business Insider request for comment.

Google isn't the only one thinking about this problem. Anthropic is advertising for a role writing about the impact of AI on labor markets and economic growth.

Demis Hassabis has spoken a lot about AI's impact on large economic systems. The Google DeepMind CEO said in August that reaching AGI could usher in an era of ""radical abundance,"" but has warned that it could be harmful to society if not handled correctly.

""One of the big things economists should be thinking about is, what does that do to money, the capitalist system, even the notion of companies?"" he said at Davos in January, speaking about AGI. ""I think probably all that changes.""

Hassabis has repeatedly warned that the impacts of more powerful AI are not yet understood, and has called for the creation of a body of experts to ensure its arrival does not go disastrously wrong.

""Ideally, there will be some institution that is around that could meet the moment, and that would be where you would put a wise international council of very diverse and smart people from different backgrounds,"" he said at Davos, describing his idea for a CERN-type international body that bring in philosophers, social scientists, and writers alongside technologists to help safely guide AI systems out of labs and into society.

""But who's building that institute is what I would ask? And I think we really need that.""

Elon Musk has been dropping hints that Tesla is about to unveil a major update on its long-awaited Roadster — and behind the scenes, the automaker intensified efforts around the electric sports car this summer, Business Insider has learned.

It marks the first instance of substantial activity on the program in more than a year, people with knowledge of the project said. Designs for the vehicle seen by insiders as recently as this year showed it as a two-seater with butterfly doors, which would be a departure from the four-seater prototype Musk unveiled in 2017. The original concept featured traditional doors and a typical sports car profile.

One of the people said that based on the current status of the project, the company is at least two to three years from production.

The design process for a new vehicle is often fluid, and it's unclear what the final product will look like. Tesla's design team has been known to experiment with a variety of options, the people said.

Between June and August, the company also hired at least five engineers to work on ""aerodynamic prototypes"" in California, according to a review of LinkedIn data.

A representative for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla mostly paused work on the Roadster after layoffs in April 2024, insiders said. The manager of the program, David Zhang, left the company that July, according to his LinkedIn profile.

""We'd all love to work on the Tesla Roadster soon,"" Musk said during an earnings call in October 2024. ""We are working on it, but it has to come behind the more — things that have a more serious impact on the good of the world.""

He also thanked Tesla's ""long-suffering deposit-holders."" Recently, reservation holders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and tech influencer Marques Brownlee have said they canceled reservations for the vehicle and requested a refund on their $50,000 deposits. (Musk said that Altman received his money back within 24 hours.)

Built off the skeleton of a Lotus Elise, the original Roadster — Tesla's first-ever vehicle — was released in 2008. Musk announced a second-generation version of the sports car in 2017, promising a release date of 2020. The deadline has been repeatedly pushed back.

Over the past few months, Tesla has been dropping breadcrumbs about developments with the vehicle.

During a recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Musk said that the next-generation Roadster ""has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever."" Tesla will demo the vehicle ""hopefully before the end of the year,"" he added.

Musk previously said the vehicle would be part of a collaboration with SpaceX. He has also said it would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than a second, and he hinted at the possibility of a flying car.

During the podcast, he again nodded to the idea. ""My friend Peter Thiel once reflected that the future is supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars. I think if Peter wants a flying car, he should be able to buy one,"" he said.

Tesla design boss Franz von Holzhausen said last month that the Roadster demo was on track for later in 2025. The carmaker also posted a California-based role that would work on manufacturing for the vehicle.

In August, the carmaker was granted a patent for an aerodynamic system that could allow a vehicle to stick to the road at high speeds.

The patent design could be used for any Tesla vehicle, said Jae Wook Kim, a professor of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics at the University of Southampton. But, Kim added, the cost of adding the device makes it more likely that it would be installed on more premium vehicles.

Earnings decks dating back to January 2020 have said that the vehicle is in design ""development.""

Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has been elected the Mayor of New York City.

Mamdani, a member of the New York State Assembly for the Astoria district of Queens, beat out former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who ran as an independent after losing the Democratic primary — and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The race was called for Mamdani by the Associated Press around an hour after polls closed on Tuesday night. Mamdani soon addressed supporters at Brooklyn Paramount, a music venue in downtown Brooklyn.

Zohran Mamdani is about to get a massive raise — and some swanky new accommodations.

Mamdani is set to earn a $258,750 annual salary as New York City mayor, a more than 80% increase from the $142,000 annual salary that he earns as a state assemblyman.

He's also set to move into Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, where he will not have to pay rent.

Mamdani will take office on January 1, 2026.

Forbes has estimated that the state assemblyman's net worth is about $200,000. He currently lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria and has said that his monthly rent is $2,300.

On the one hand, Mamdani's hefty new salary shouldn't be a huge surprise: The demands and responsibilities of managing a city of more than 8 million people are far greater than representing roughly 140,000 people in Queens.

And it's not the highest mayoral salary out there: The mayor of San Francisco earns a salary of more than $380,000, while the mayor of Los Angeles earns just over $300,000.

Still, it's far more than the $174,000 annual salary earned by most rank-and-file US senators and House members.

It's also more than the $223,500 annual salary that House Speaker Mike Johnson earns, or the $246,400 annual salaries of President Donald Trump's cabinet secretaries.

Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire, notably declined to accept the full salary during his tenure as mayor from 2002 to 2013, choosing instead to accept a $1 salary.

Almost every New York City mayor has lived at some point in Gracie Mansion, a two-story home on the Upper East Side overlooking the East River.

The one exception: Bloomberg, who opted to live in his own mansion a few blocks away on East 79th Street.

The former mayor even said that his successors shouldn't live in the mansion, but that advice apparently went unheeded: Mayor Bill de Blasio moved into the house in 2014, and Mayor Eric Adams also opted to live there.

Mamdani has said he plans to do the same.

The mayor also receives security protection from the New York City Police Department and has access to benefits available to other city employees, including health insurance.

It's official: Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of New York City.

The Associated Press has projected that the Democratic nominee and state assemblyman will defeat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa in the city's closely watched mayoral election.

Mamdani was projected to win 50% of the vote when the race was called, less than an hour after polls closed. Cuomo held 41.4% of the vote, and Sliwa 7.7%.

By 10 p.m. local time, an hour after polls closed, Mamdani's lead had held, and he had garnered over a million votes, the first New York mayoral candidate to receive that many votes since 1969. The last candidate to do so was John Lindsay, a liberal politician who surpassed that figure in his race against Democratic candidate Mario Procaccino and Republican candidate John Marchi.

Mamdani will be the city's first Muslim mayor. The 34-year-old is also the youngest person to be elected mayor of the city in over 100 years.

A self-described democratic socialist, Mamdani campaigned on a platform of affordability for working-class New Yorkers, proposing initiatives like free buses, no-cost childcare, and a rent freeze.

He won despite facing down millions of dollars in political spending from prominent billionaires in both the Democratic primary and the general election.

Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Bill Ackman, Joe Gebbia, and Barry Diller were among the billionaires who collectively poured millions of dollars into outside groups that backed Cuomo and opposed Mamdani, who, for his part, has said billionaires should not exist.

In Mamdani's Tuesday night victory speech, he addressed those who supported his opponents.

""The billionaire class has sought to convince those making $30 an hour that their enemies are those earning $20 an hour,"" he said, adding, ""We refuse to let them dictate the rules of the game anymore. They can play by the same rules as the rest of us.""

Cuomo also won the support of two other major billionaires on the eve of the election: President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

""Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday night. ""You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!""

On Tuesday night, Mamdani spoke to the president directly: ""Hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to go through all of us."" 

During the speech, Trump wrote on Truth Social, without naming Mamdani: ""…AND SO IT BEGINS!"" 

Musk, who posted his support for Cuomo on X and misspelled Mamdani's name in the post, did not address the election online in the hours following Mamdani's victory.

Many of the critiques of Mamdani from the billionaire class revolve around the future of New York as a business hub.

To fund his ambitious platform, Mamdani has proposed raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the income tax on millionaires by two percentage points.

The result, some of Mamdani's wealthy antagonists have said, will be an exodus from New York, in terms of both businesses and high earners.

""Think Ken Griffin leaving Chicago for Miami on steroids,"" Ackman wrote on X following Mamdani's victory in the June primary.

Billionaire John Catsimatidis, who owns a chain of New York grocery stores, suggested he would move his office to New Jersey.

That fear has rippled beyond the billionaire class to other sectors, including tech, finance, and real estate.

""New York City is built on ambition, innovation, and capitalism,"" Bryan Rosenblatt, a partner at Craft Ventures, told Business Insider. ""Electing a mayor who drives out our most ambitious builders and top contributors to the city's economy is not good for New York or anyone who calls it home.""

In recent months, the icy relationship between the Mayor-elect and some of the city's titans of industry has thawed. Mamdani reportedly spoke with leaders like Paul Weiss' Brad Karp since winning the primary, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said he will work with Mamdani if he is elected.

""I have to deal with the world I got, you know, not the world I want, and if he becomes mayor, so be it,"" the influential Dimon said at a conference last month.

And business leaders are more sympathetic to some of the Democratic nominee's proposals than others, Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive who's become a bridge between Mamdani and the business elite, previously told Business Insider.

""Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,"" Salem said.

In fact, many of those rank-and-file employees in the financial sector supported Mamdani.

While 80% of higher-earning Wall Street workers — including investment bankers, hedge fund managers, and private equity bigwigs — donated to Cuomo and his affiliated PACs, Mamdani's campaign received almost 90% of the donations given from finance's back-office workers, such as those in operations, human resources, technology, and research.

""Even as someone working in finance, rent is crazy,"" one Mamdani donor previously told Business Insider. ""The emphasis on affordability was especially appealing to me.""

New York City's newly elected mayor, Zohran Mamdani, took direct aim at President Donald Trump in his acceptance speech on Tuesday.

""Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,"" Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, said.

Mamdani, who beat former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa to win the race, then laid out some of his plans as mayor.

""We will hold bad landlords to account because the Donald Trumps of our city have grown far too comfortable taking advantage of their tenants,"" he said.

""We will put an end to the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax breaks,"" he added.

""We will stand alongside unions and expand labor protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have ironclad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,"" he said.

Trump has yet to publicly address Mamdani's comments.

Writing on Truth Social during Mamdani's speech, but without mentioning his name, the president said: ""…AND SO IT BEGINS!""

""Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!"" Trump said on Monday.

Mamdani ran on a progressive agenda that includes freezing rents, free childcare, and taxing millionaires at a flat 2% rate. During the race, he faced intense opposition from several high-profile billionaires who spent big in an attempt to keep him from victory.

Some business leaders have started publicly congratulating Mamdani on his win, including Bill Ackman and Andrew Yang. 

""Congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do,"" Ackman wrote on X on Tuesday night.

The new German brigade stationed on Russia's doorstep is betting on tanks, even as costly armored vehicles are being damaged and destroyed by cheap off-the-shelf drones in Ukraine.

NATO allies worried about Russia are still investing in tanks, and Germany is no exception. Its new 45th Armored Brigade in Lithuania decided what it should bring from watching the war.

As the 45th begins Germany's first significant permanent deployment of a brigade abroad since World War II, it's bringing its Leopard 2A8 tank with it.

Commander of the brigade, Brig. Gen. Christoph Huber, told Business Insider that ""this brigade has top priority in Germany"" and will see the most modern German military equipment.

Huber said that it was ""crucial"" for the brigade to have heavy armor. ""This brigade at the core is a heavy armored commitment."" That means bringing the ""most modern German main battle tank.""

The 2A8 is the most advanced Leopard tank produced by KNDS Deutschland, and it features modifications such as drone protection inspired by tank performance in Ukraine.

The new modifications to the Leopard include the addition of the Trophy Active Protection System for detecting incoming threats like anti-tank missiles and drones, armor upgrades to the vulnerable turret, and sensor improvements.

With better protection against drones and other loitering threats, better sensors, modular armor, and an upgrade path, the tank offers a leap in capability, survivability, and lethality that helps to future-proof it. These tanks are now more aligned with modern combat than Leopard tanks built for Cold War-era tank fights, the Leopards Ukraine received. The new ones aren't unbeatable by any means; however, they are a marked improvement.

""We have to introduce new capabilities in our forces based on the lessons identified in the awful war of aggression by Russia in Ukraine,"" the general said.

Huber said that tanks enable the brigade to conduct combined maneuver warfare, the kind of fast, coordinated operations needed to seize the initiative but have been hard to execute in Ukraine, where airpower constraints, layered defenses, and the growing drone threats have made major breakthroughs nearly impossible.

There's no guarantee a war between NATO and Russia would resemble the war in Ukraine, especially given the range of combat capabilities available to the alliance, so while Germany is studying this conflict, it is focusing on what it might face next.

Other allies are doing the same, and tanks are still considered necessary. Lithuania, for instance, also sees the need for tanks in the country. Its chief of defense, Gen. Valdemaras Rupšys, last year called mechanized units and tank units ""indispensable.""

Lithuania is buying tanks for the first time in its history, and other NATO allies have also placed new orders, while Western companies are also developing new tank technology.

The goal, Huber said, is ""preparing for the war of the future, definitely not for the war of the past and probably also not for the war which is happening right now."" The best way to do this, he said, is to have ""a good mix of capabilities available on the ground.""

The brigade also brings the Puma S1 infantry fighting vehicle, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzer, drones, and air defenses.

The brigade has armored backup, too. Germany's message to the brigade, Huber said, is that it ""is not alone."" It's backed by the rest of the 10th Armored Division, meaning multiple brigades could mobilize to defend NATO's eastern flank. ""The message to Russia is clear,"" he said. ""Here stands NATO — no step further.""

The war in Ukraine has been marked by videos of tanks burning in the wake of attacks by cheap drones, including German Leopard tanks and American Abrams (notably not the most advanced versions of either). Both sides have adapted, adding armor and additional protection while also employing tanks with greater caution.

Tanks in Ukraine are often used in concealed positions, further back from the front, regularly as a kind of mobile artillery. They sometimes get used in assaults, but in small numbers and in a very carefully coordinated way, where they are aided by assets like drones and electronic warfare.

Tanks have struggled in Ukraine because neither side has control of the air, leaving armored columns and large-scale mechanized assaults vulnerable to drones buzzing the battlefield for surveillance and strike purposes.

With better air assets, such as fifth-generation fighter jets, and larger arsenals of diverse capabilities, NATO might be able to avoid the headaches the armies fighting this war have faced, though the future is uncertain.

Huber said the 45th is in Lithuania to deter Russia and shield NATO's eastern edge. It has begun operations but will not reach its full strength, a full force of 4,800 troops, until 2027. Huber said that it will be ready to act if needed, though, well before that.

Lithuania is seen as particularly vulnerable. Former CIA director David Petraeus said this year that he viewed it as the country most at risk of a Russian invasion.

The brigade deployed to Lithuania is a big step for Germany, which has taken a restrained approach since World War II and largely avoided substantial military deployments abroad. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed that calculus, albeit slowly.

Huber said that Germany, along with the other international forces in Lithuania, allies like Norway, the Netherlands, and the US, ""are in the end defending every inch of NATO territory. We are defending our shared values, our freedom, democracy, our human rights.""

Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called the 2008 financial crisis, is back with his unique blend of dire warnings, cryptic messages, winking memes, and pop-culture references.

The Scion Asset Management chief has returned to X after a two-year hiatus to sound the alarm on the AI boom. Where advocates see a revolutionary technology that will supercharge productivity and generate massive profits, he sees hype, speculation, and excess.

Burry, whose iconic bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was immortalized in the book and movie ""The Big Short,"" kicked off his comeback with a single, ominous post on Thursday.

""Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,"" he wrote.

The third sentence is a nod to the movie ""WarGames,"" where an AI supercomputer runs thousands of simulations of nuclear war and discovers all of them end in mutual destruction. Burry's quote underscores how perilous he believes today's market is for investors.

Signaling he'll be sticking around for a while, the famed forecaster has updated his profile picture and revised his bio to read: ""Cassandra Unchained: Missteps to Mayhem, Coming December 2025, Stay Tuned.""

That line is an apparent reference to the Greek myth of Cassandra, the Trojan priestess cursed to utter true prophecies but never to be believed, and to a speech Burry gave at Vanderbilt Medical Center in 2011 titled: ""Missteps to Mayhem: Inside the Doomsday Machine with the Outsider who Predicted and Profited from America's Financial Armageddon.""

Back then, Burry delivered a step-by-step breakdown of how the subprime mortgage bubble inflated, how he predicted and placed bets on its collapse, and how the fallout revealed glaring vulnerabilities in the US financial system.

""We must remember that entire societies can and often do follow the wrong path for a very long time, and that there is nothing wrong with breaking from the social norm to ensure good outcomes,"" Burry said. ""Sober analysis on the part of the individual is paramount.""

Positioning himself as a rebel who's speaking out against the AI mainstream, Burry swapped his banner image on X to a still from ""Star Wars: A New Hope,"" where Obi-Wan Kenobi uses a Jedi mind trick to deceive Imperial stormtroopers.

Referring to that meme, the Scion boss posted on Monday before the release of his firm's third-quarter portfolio update: ""These aren't the charts you are looking for. You can go about your business."" He attached three images offering fresh insight into why he's bearish on the AI frenzy.

Move along pic.twitter.com/ysPWozmnbt

The first chart showed that growth has slowed sharply in Amazon and Alphabet's cloud-computing divisions, and cooled slightly in Microsoft's rival unit.

The second highlighted that the US tech sector's capital expenditures have surged during the AI boom, echoing their spikes before the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.

The third shows the circular dealmaking between Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, and other AI companies.

Burry nodded to the meme again in a follow-up post, writing ""Move along"" and attaching an image of a stormtrooper. He also shared a highlighted excerpt from ""Capital Account,"" a book that covers the dot-com bubble. It detailed how the telecoms boom and bust resulted in vast tracts of unused infrastructure, plunging prices, and the downfall of many high-valued companies that wound up scrambling for protection from creditors.

Burry's posts underline his skepticism about the AI boom. He appears to see shades of the dot-com bubble in the interwoven deals between tech titans, as they pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building huge amounts of infrastructure that might end up sitting idle if demand falters and valuations come crashing down, as they did 25 years ago.

The hedge fund manager backed up his words with two striking bets last quarter that were revealed on Monday. Scion purchased bearish put options on 1 million Nvidia shares and 5 million Palantir shares, with notional values of $187 million and $912 million, respectively.

The wagers dominated the firm's US stock portfolio, which had only eight holdings in total, including just four direct positions worth a combined $68 million.

Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider that Burry is ""clearly backing convictions with what can only be called a highly unconventional portfolio, with sizable short positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, both darlings of the current AI boom, to the tune of around $1 billion.""

Nvidia and Palantir fell 4% and 8% respectively on Tuesday. Burry's wagers drew the ire of Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who questioned why he was shorting companies that are ""making all the money.""

Both stocks have soared in price over the past few years; Nvidia became the first company to secure a $5 trillion market value last week, while Palantir was valued at nearly $500 billion at Monday's close — more than Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, or Netflix are worth.

The pair's valuations and high growth expectations could leave their stocks vulnerable to sharp declines if they disappoint, especially when investors are increasingly using margin and levered ETFs, Mould said.

Burry could win big if Nvidia and Palantir stumble, but the ""danger"" is that he ""gets run over by momentum and liquidity-fueled markets"" if they keep impressing investors and the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, Mould added.

Daniel Bustamante, the chief investor and founder of asset manager Bustamante Capital Management, told Business Insider that he broadly agrees with Burry's stance on AI stocks.

The Magnificent Seven's capital spending is ""already hurting earnings growth, retail is crowded into those names, and then margin debt is at all-time highs,"" he said. ""You basically have all tinder soaked in gas, and all it takes is a lit match at this point to cause some serious issues.""

By the time she turned 40, Suzie Payne had resigned herself to the fact that she would never be able to buy a home.

While her friends spent their 30s checking off that prized milestone — often with help from their parents — Payne struggled to save money while raising a daughter on her own. Home prices in Portland, Oregon, where she lived, felt out of reach long before the pandemic hit. Then Payne lost her job. When mortgage rates plummeted in the summer of 2020, she was more worried about meeting her basic needs than spending her Saturdays staking out open houses.

In 2021, though, Payne moved to Philadelphia, where the homebuying possibilities seemed to open up. She could still find an old rowhome in the city for a little more than $200,000, well within her price range. She got a new job, took classes for first-time homebuyers, and discovered that she qualified for a larger loan than she'd expected. In the summer of 2024, she enlisted the help of a real estate agent and submitted a winning bid on a house. She was 42.

Payne describes her path as ""non-conventional,"" but she represents a sea change in real estate: First-time homebuyers are older than ever. A decade or two ago, Americans typically bought their first homes in their early 30s. By today's standards, however, Payne is right on track. New data from the National Association of Realtors shows that between mid-2024 and mid-2025, the typical age of a first-time buyer reached a record high of 40. The median age for all buyers rose to an all-time high of 59, up from 47 in 2019.

Things have been headed in this direction for a few years now — older, deep-pocketed buyers are better equipped to handle the double whammy of higher borrowing rates and costlier homes. Gen Xers and baby boomers remain active in the real estate market, while the share of purchases by first-time buyers has dwindled. But never before has the divide appeared so stark. This delayed timeline could have lifelong consequences for today's young people: years of missed wealth-building opportunities, fewer moves, even a reevaluation of what constitutes a ""starter home."" Welcome to the age of the geriatric homebuyer.

The typical first-time homebuyer was just 29 when the NAR began tracking the median age in 1981. The metric edged slightly higher in the four decades that followed, never ticking past 33. Then, between mid-2021 and mid-2022, it spiked to 36. There was a bit of cope around the sudden jump. Maybe it was just elder millennials — long labeled as laggards since graduating into the Great Recession — finally catching up. But even that cohort felt squeezed. Mortgage rates had more than doubled, homes were more expensive, and new construction after the Great Recession had failed to keep pace with the surge of young buyers. I talked to one millennial back then who framed the scenario in bleak terms: ""We're royally screwed.""

Things have only gotten worse. First-time buyers accounted for a record-low 21% of home purchases last year, NAR data shows — roughly half of the historical average. The entry-level buyer has been effectively ""removed from this housing market,"" Jessica Lautz, the NAR's deputy chief economist, tells me.

""We have a very large young-adult population who are really just seeing the door shut on them for homeownership,"" Lautz says. ""I think it speaks to the gridlock that we've seen in the housing market.""

Taking their place is a swarm of ""repeat buyers"" who, at a median age of 62 (another record high), can put their piles of home equity to work on another purchase. Nearly a third of these repeat buyers paid all cash, NAR data shows, giving them a leg up with sellers who often prefer the ease and speed of deals that don't involve a mortgage. A whopping 26% of all buyers came in with all cash, yet another — you guessed it — record high.

Real estate agents tell me they feel the frustration. Peggy Pratt, a broker associate with Century 21 North East in Massachusetts, says it's harder for younger buyers to cobble together a down payment when they're weighed down by student debt and steep rental costs. Pratt specializes in helping people break into the housing market, with about half her business coming from first-time buyers. She says those who are able to gain a foothold often receive help from their parents — there are just fewer of them. On the opposite end, those who can't lean on family ""feel that the state of the economy is working against them,"" Pratt tells me. ""For the prices, it's nearly impossible for them.""

Suzy Minken, an agent with Compass who works in both New Jersey and northern Virginia, says her clients are no longer buying up ""starter homes"" with dreams of moving into a bigger place down the line. Most have trouble finding a home they like in their price point, Minken says, so they delay their purchase and keep saving until they can buy a place that feels like less of a stepping stone and more of a permanent landing spot. NAR data backs this up — sellers last year had lived in their homes for a median of 11 years, an all-time high.

""The idea of move-up buyers, I think we're sort of done with that,"" Minken says. ""It doesn't really happen. People that I've sold homes to over the years, no one's moving up to get a bigger home.""

All of this contributes to the gridlock Lautz mentioned. First-time homebuyers benefit from churn in the housing market: When people move out of their theoretical starter homes into bigger places, they free up the entry-level homes for those just starting out. But that sort of healthy movement has ground to a halt. After the steep rise in mortgage rates a few years ago, homeowners are holding tight to the rock-bottom terms they secured earlier in the pandemic. Until rates sink further or they're forced to make a move, those owners are not going anywhere. And if people are waiting longer to buy their first house, they may have already checked off the other significant milestones, such as having children, that could prompt another move anyway.

There's some upside to purchasing later in life: If you buy your first home at 40 instead of 30, you're likely closing in on your peak earning years. You may have a better sense of your family's needs and where you want to live. While it's nice to have a bit more certainty before taking the homeownership plunge, the downsides can be brutal. By delaying, you've also missed out on years of potential wealth-building. Given that homes tend to gain about 5% equity on an annual basis, the typical homeowner is foregoing about $150,000 if they buy a decade later than the historical norm, Lautz tells me. That wealth could be used to purchase the next home, fund their child's college education, or make needed upgrades to their existing place.

""We're looking at a generational wealth restriction,"" Lautz says.

Suzie Payne's homebuying journey didn't end with that accepted offer. Her daughter had a medical emergency around that same time, she tells me, forcing her to back out of the purchase. In March, she took another stab at buying and had a second offer accepted. But Trump's looming tariffs made her uneasy about the economy, and an inspection on the house revealed a heap of necessary repairs. When negotiations broke down, Payne backed out of that deal as well.

""I was like, I can't do this right now,"" Payne tells me. ""It's so emotional and overwhelming and scary when you are the only financial conduit for this huge purchase.""

For a deeper dive on America's real estate market, check out ""Well Spent,"" Business Insider's new video podcast about the business, technology, and culture of consumerism.

Payne's series of stops and starts effectively captures the current homebuying predicament. Buyers are older, sure, but they're also pulling out of deals more frequently than ever, either because they're spooked by the economy or holding out hope for a better deal down the line. Consumers of all stripes are wary of making big life changes that could leave them in a tough financial situation if things go awry. For Payne, a home purchase was never about the investment, anyway — it was about finally achieving stability in a place where a landlord could never raise her rent overnight. Until she feels like a home purchase would give her peace of mind rather than more worries, she's prepared to play the waiting game.

""It has to be the right conditions,"" Payne tells me. ""And right now does not feel like the right conditions.""

Digital assets and infrastructure company Ripple said Wednesday it has raised $500 million in funding, lifting its valuation to $40 billion.

The fundraise comes after a slew of acquisitions and as the company expands its product base beyond just payments.

Crypto and digital asset companies are trying to take advantage of what is seen by the industry as a more favorable environment in the U.S. after the election of President Donald Trump and the passing of a landmark stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act.

Ripple, which is closely linked to the XRP cryptocurrency, said the funding round was led by funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group, affiliates of Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace.

""The decision to accept $500 million in new common equity reflects the strategic value of deepening relationships with financial partners whose expertise complements Ripple's expanding global suite of products,"" Ripple said, adding that it is continuing its ""record year of growth.""

Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that the company did not need to raise any money, but had seen demand from institutional investors who wanted to get a share of the company.

""We think it makes good sense to have them as strategic partners, as investors who will have a hand toward building the future"" Long said.

Ripple has looked to position itself as a fintech firm bringing crypto and digital assets technology to institutional clients.

When Ripple launched in 2012, the company initially focused on using blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. The token XRP was used to move fiat currencies quickly.

Since then, Ripple has bolstered its payments business and expanded into new areas through aggressive acquisitions. In just over two years, Ripple said it has completed six acquisitions.

Last year, the company launched its own stablecoin, a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets. Stablecoins are seen as a key way to move money quickly around the world as they can operate 24 hours a day. This year, Ripple acquired an enterprise-focused stablecoin platform called Rail.

Beyond payments, Ripple has pushed into other lines of business, including custody of crypto assets, prime brokerage and corporate treasury management.

Long said the company's acquisition strategy was focused on companies that will complement Ripple's core payments business, or allow it to push into new areas.

""We will continue to look at where new opportunities arise in those two things,"" Long said.

While other crypto-focused companies such as Circle have gone public, Long said this is not on the radar for Ripple right now.

""We are really pleased to see crypto companies going public, that is great for our overall industry continuing to mature,"" Long said.

""We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships. We will continue to remain private.""

Ripple's funding comes as cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. This week, bitcoin fell below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June, with billions of dollars being wiped off the overall market.

In this article

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sat on a stage in a Seattle conference center in September, looking out at an audience of thousands of sellers who'd traveled from around the world to the company's hometown.

He used the moment to lay out a vision for how he wants Amazon to operate like the ""world's largest startup,"" getting rid of bureaucracy in order to move faster and stay competitive.

""We're working hard to try to flatten our organization and have fewer layers because in the very earliest days of Amazon, it's been true for many years, we had very high ownership at every level of the organization, including on the frontline,"" Jassy said at the event.

Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, has embarked on a major overhaul of Amazon's corporate culture in recent years, including a hard pivot back to in-office work, with Covid largely in the rearview mirror, and a push for employees to do more with less.

The starkest example came last week, when Amazon announced it would lay off about 14,000 corporate employees and said more cuts are expected soon.

During Amazon's earnings call on Thursday, Jassy used a familiar line when asked about the reductions.

""As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest startup,"" Jassy said. ""And that means removing layers.""

The next big wave of cuts is expected to start in January, CNBC has learned, after the holiday rush and Amazon's annual re:Invent cloud conference, which is held in early December.

Amazon's stores and human resources division, known as people experience and technology, are among the units that will be impacted, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.

In total, it's expected to add up to the largest round of corporate layoffs in Amazon's 31-year history, CNBC previously reported. Amazon has been trimming head count across the company since late 2022, resulting in more than 27,000 job cuts. Reductions have continued of late, though at a smaller scale.

Layoffs have been announced at companies across the tech, retail, auto and shipping industries in recent months, with executives citing myriad reasons, from artificial intelligence and tariffs to shifting business priorities and broader cost-cutting efforts. Meta, Google, Intel and others have also sought to reduce management layers or organizational bloat in hopes of boosting efficiency.

Before Amazon's better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report late last week, Wall Street was taking a skeptical eye toward the company. The stock was very narrowly up for the year, badly trailing the broader market and Amazon's megacap peers. However, a 14% jump over two trading days put the stock solidly in the green and lifted it to a record close Monday.

But as Jassy tries to reshape the company, plenty of hurdles remain, including rising costs, heightened cloud competition, delays at Alexa and what some employees describe as flagging morale.

While Amazon's core e-commerce unit remains healthy, Amazon and other retailers have been navigating the uncertainty of President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies, which threaten to increase costs and dampen consumer demand.

Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud infrastructure provider, has come under pressure from rivals Microsoft and Google, which are growing faster. AWS is also battling a perception that it's a laggard in signing key artificial intelligence infrastructure deals. Amazon's $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI, announced Monday, could help ease some of those concerns.

Meanwhile, Amazon's 11-year-old Alexa service, an early leader in the voice assistant market, was slow to bring to market an enhanced version, with competition building from generative AI companies, namely OpenAI.

Amazon released Alexa+ in February. But it's unclear how well the upgraded Alexa, as well as companion devices that debuted in September, will fare against rivals and whether consumers will rush to buy them over the holidays.

Jassy has been searching for Amazon's next opportunity, or ""pillar,"" for growth after e-commerce, cloud and its Prime membership program. The company has made big bets on satellite internet, health care, grocery, entertainment and self-driving vehicles, but with varying degrees of success.

The layoffs hit nearly all of Amazon's business units, from logistics, AWS, retail and grocery stores to Prime Video, advertising and gaming, according to people familiar with the matter and employee posts on LinkedIn.

Jassy told investors last week that the cuts weren't triggered by financial strain or AI replacing workers. He said he's responding to a ""culture"" issue inside the company, spurred in part by a multiyear hiring spree that left it with ""a lot more layers"" and slower decision-making.

Current and former staffers, most of whom asked not to be named in order to speak candidly on the subject, told CNBC that several years of persistent cost cutting and layoffs have damaged morale, while pressure has simultaneously been building to innovate faster, especially around AI.

Amazon declined to comment.

Jassy outlined his plan to flatten Amazon's structure in September 2024, at the same time that he instructed staffers to return to five days a week in the office. He set a goal for each major organization inside Amazon to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025.

He also established a ""no bureaucracy email alias"" for employees to flag unnecessary processes or rules. In September of this year, Jassy said that led to about 455 changes inside the company.

Jassy's cost cuts haven't just been around layoffs. He's shuttered several of Amazon's physical store chains and axed some of its more unprofitable or unproven bets, including a roving sidewalk robot, telehealth service, health and fitness wearable, and a virtual tours initiative.

An employee in Amazon's cloud unit said in an interview that efforts to slash management layers and reduce costs have made staffers feel like they're under an ""incredible amount of pressure"" and ""burdened with more work"" than before. The potential for more layoffs next year has created further anxiety, the person added.

A staffer in Amazon's customer support division who was laid off last week after 15 years at the company described how the push to flatten organizations meant ""they remove people but not the work."" The person said senior leadership appears ""extremely disconnected from the workers.""

In the memo announcing the latest layoffs, human resources chief Beth Galetti used the phrase ""staying nimble"" in the headline.

It quickly became a meme on internal Slack channels and in Reddit threads. One image posted on Slack shows Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix,"" labeled with the word ""employees,"" attempting to dodge a bullet labeled ""Staying nimble, getting stronger, reducing layers, shifting resources.""

Another meme shows a cat with the animatronic bear from ""Five Nights at Freddy's,"" a popular horror video game, lurking behind it and labeled with the title of the memo, ""Staying nimble and continuing to strengthen our organizations.""

That's not to say the changes are universally opposed. An AWS employee told CNBC that some organizations became too bloated and that fewer layers would help speed up decision-making. A former manager in Amazon's retail business said the company overhired in recent years, creating too many layers of management.

Then there's the impact of AI.

In June, Jassy said efficiency gains from using AI internally would shrink Amazon's corporate staff in the coming years. The company is already reining in the growth of its white-collar workforce.

At the same time, Amazon is racing to keep up with the other hyperscalers by aggressively investing in AI infrastructure. In its earnings report last week, the company said it plans to boost capital expenditures this year to $125 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $118 billion. CFO Brian Olsavsky said that number will likely increase in 2026.

Amazon has also pushed corporate employees to use AI in their work and regularly experiment with internal tools. The company monitors AI adoption by employees, and some staffers were counseled to use the services more to speed up their work, or were informed that their usage could be factored into performance evaluations, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Workers are asking for clarity.

Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an internal advocacy group, published an open letter on its website last week calling on Amazon executives to establish a ""more responsible rollout of AI"" and urging staffers to co-sign it.

""We're the workers who develop, train and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene,"" AECJ wrote.

While Jassy is making the case that AI agents will transform work for the better and make jobs ""even more exciting and fun"" than they currently are, AECJ members suggest they may be planting the seeds of their own demise.

""Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it's easier to discard us,"" they wrote.

Preston Arquette, who was laid off from Amazon's e-commerce platform team last week, said he's not ""anti-AI"" but he questioned whether the technology has led to tangible results inside the company.

""In my role, I didn't see the kind of efficiencies or improvements that would make you think all these layoffs are necessary,"" Arquette said in a text message.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Stocks sold off yesterday amid investor concerns about the valuations of artificial intelligence companies. Leading the losses were shares of Palantir, which dropped 8% in the session despite a positive earnings report on Monday.

Here's what to know:

It was a big night for Democrats, whose candidates swept key races in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.

Self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani will become the next mayor of New York City, NBC News projects, defeating former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. More than 2 million New Yorkers turned out to vote in the election, the most since 1969, according to the city's Board of Elections.

In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill is projected to become the state's next governor. The closely watched race against Trump-endorsed Republican Jack Ciattarelli was seen as a bellwether for the GOP, which made inroads in the state in 2024.

NBC News also projects Democrat Abigail Spanberger will become the first female governor of Virginia and Democratic nominee Jay Jones will win the state's attorney general race. Unlike Mamdani, Sherril and Spanberger, Jones was not seen as the betting favorite going into yesterday's election.

McDonald's missed Wall Street's third-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines this morning. The fast-food giant reported $7.08 billion in revenue during the period — a 3% increase from a year ago, but slightly below analysts' $7.1 billion estimate.

Despite coming up short, the company's shares rose about 1% before the bell. Indeed, the report wasn't all bad: McDonald's said same-store sales grew 3.6% globally and 2.4% in the U.S. CEO Chris Kempczinski called the results ""a testament to our ability to deliver sustainable growth even in a challenging environment.""

Meanwhile, shares of Cava sank nearly 8% in overnight trading after the fast-casual chain cut its full-year forecast for the second straight quarter.

A wave of layoffs is rattling corporate America. Yesterday it was IBM. Last week, it was Amazon and Paramount. The week before, Target and Meta.

And while some rush to say the rise of AI is to blame, experts say some companies could be ""AI-washing"" their cuts, using the new tech as a scapegoat for other issues or run-of-the-mill cost-cutting. A lack of employment data from the government, thanks to the shutdown, makes the picture even murkier, bringing about concerns that the spate of cuts could have more to do with a slowing economy than with AI.

Job openings hit their lowest level in more than four years last month, according to data from Indeed. The site's Job Posting Index, which uses February 2020 as a baseline, fell to 101.9 in October — its lowest level since February 2021.

Netflix's ""KPop Demon Hunters"" has taken pop culture by storm. It's also moving the K-pop market.

The film, which in August became Netflix's most popular movie ever, has generated $10 billion for the K-pop music industry, CNBC's Eunice Yoon reports. Shares of HYBE, JYP Entertainment, SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment — the so-called ""Big Four"" K-pop companies in South Korea — have seen double-digit gains this year.

But it's not just music. As Yoon notes, the popularity of ""KPop Demon Hunters"" could also spur increased consumption of Korean cosmetics and foods, and could even have political ramifications in China.

After Meta invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI and hired away its founder, the future looked uncertain for the AI startup. But CFO Dennis Cinelli rejected the notion that the deal was an ""acquihire"" or licensing deal, and insisted Scale's business is still growing. Here's how he put it, in his first public interview since joining the startup in 2022:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Supreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legal","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/supreme-court-trump-trade-tarrifs-vos.html","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:54:58 GMT","



Supreme Court justices on Wednesday morning expressed skepticism about the legality of aggressive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump against most of the world's nations.

Conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the Trump administration's method for enacting the tariffs, which critics say infringes on the power of Congress to tax.

Lower federal courts have ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority he cited under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico.

Sauer, who is defending the tariff policy as grounded in the power to regulate foreign commerce, said ""these are regulatory tariffs. They are not revenue-raising tariffs.""

""The fact that they raise revenue was only incidental,"" Sauer said, shortly after oral arguments in the case began.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court's three liberal members, told Sauer, ""You say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are.""

""They're generating money from American citizens, revenue,"" Sotomayor said.

She later noted that no president other than Trump has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of six conservatives on the court, pressed Sauer on the fact that Trump had unilaterally imposed the tariffs, citing purported international emergencies of trade imbalances and the flow of fentanyl into the United States, without Congress authorizing them.

""What happens when the president simply vetoes legislation to take these powers back?"" Gorsuch asked.

""So Congress as a practical matter can't get this power back once it's handed it over to the president,"" Gorsuch said. ""It's a one way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's elected representatives.""

Other conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and the justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito — also pressed Sauer.

The tariffs start at a baseline of 10% on many nations and spike to as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil. The tariffs, if allowed to stand, would result in $3 trillion in extra revenue for the United States by 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That group last week said the federal government collected $151 billion from customs duties in the second half of fiscal year 2025, ""a nearly 300% increase over the same period in"" fiscal year 2024.

Sauer was questioned by the justices for more than one hour, before Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, began making his argument.

Katyal opened his argument by saying, ""Tariffs are taxes,"" picking up the theme that multiple justices had raised with Sauer.

""Our founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone.""

""We don't think IEEPA allows this junking of the world-wide tariff architecture,"" Katyal later said.

When Roberts asked Katyal is tariffs implicated the power of the president to conduct foreign policy for the United States, as Sauer argued, Katyal replied, ""We agree that tariffs have foreign policy implications.""

But he added that the Founding Fathers had delegated the power to tax to Congress in the Constitution.

Katyal also pointed out that despite the argument that the reciprocal tariffs are being used to address trade deficits, Trump imposed a tariff of 39% on imports from Switzerland, an ally of the U.S., even though the U.S. runs a trade surplus with that nation.

No other president has ever done something like that, he said.

The Supreme Court, which heard more than two-and-a-half hours of arguments, will not issue a decision in the case on Wednesday.

 It is not clear when the court will release its ruling.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a court filing in September that the U.S. might have to refund $750 billion or more if the Supreme Court ruled the tariffs are illegal and waited until next summer to issue that ruling.

The case is seen as a key legal test for Trump, who has won some favorable rulings from the Supreme Court for other policies during his second term in the White House.

Trump insists the tariffs are crucial to protecting the American economy and citizens. He says they serve as a sharp prod to companies to make their products in the United States.

In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, ""Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country.""

""With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security,"" Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.

""Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us. Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,"" he said.

""A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.""

Critics of tariffs say their financial hit is borne not by foreign manufacturers but by U.S. importers who pay them and then largely pass on the added costs to American consumers.

Trump previously said he was considering attending the oral arguments, which would have been an apparent first for a sitting president.

On Sunday, he said on Truth SociaI, ""I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.

""It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court,"" he wrote.

On the streets of Rio de Janeiro, it's not hard to spot the latest sign of China's growing global auto ambitions. Electric vehicles from Chinese brands like BYD and Great Wall Motor have been flowing in. 

""There are a lot of Chinese cars on the streets,"" said EV owner Sérgio Ramalho. 

Brazil has become the newest frontier for China's electric vehicle boom. The country imported about 138,000 electric and hybrid vehicles from China in 2024, nearly 100,000 more than the year before, according to Brazilian customs data.

Chinese automakers, who are blocked from the U.S. market, have turned their focus toward emerging economies.

""Chinese EV makers are facing a lot of pressure within China,"" said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They've been going abroad in a very big way.""

Brazil is South America's largest car market and, like other countries, Chinese companies in the market are competing head-to-head with long-established brands. In early 2025, Chinese models captured more than 80% of all EV sales, according to Brazil's Electric Vehicle Association.

Affordability has been a major draw. BYD's Dolphin Mini, one of the country's top-selling electric cars, starts at about 119,900 reais or $22,000, around $7,000 less than General Motors' cheapest comparable model in Brazil.

""We've seen the arrival of Chinese vehicles here in a very large quantity,"" said Gustavo Tannure, CEO of charging-network startup EZVolt. ""Demand for charging is very high.""

After Brazil dropped its 35% import tariff on EVs in 2015, BYD moved quickly to expand locally. The company first entered the country in 2015 producing electric buses and now operates what it calls one of Latin America's largest EV plants in the northeastern state of Bahia. Built on the site of a shuttered Ford facility, the 4.6-million-square-meter complex is expected to produce up to 300,000 cars a year.

""Brazil is the largest automotive market in Latin America,"" Mazzocco said. ""If you want to sell in Brazil, there's a strong incentive to produce in Brazil.""

Other Chinese automakers are following suit. Great Wall Motor began producing vehicles near São Paulo this year after acquiring a former Mercedes-Benz factory.

The rapid influx has raised alarms among labor groups.

""It could lead to a huge number of vehicles arriving from China, threatening our jobs and production in Brazil,"" said Wellington Damasceno, executive director of the ABC Metalworkers' Union.

Brazil's government has since moved to re-impose import duties. Tariffs on foreign EVs began returning in 2024 and are scheduled to reach 35% by 2026. 

BYD has also faced scrutiny over reports of poor conditions for some construction workers at its new Bahia plant. The company said it maintains ""zero tolerance for violations of human rights and labor laws"" and cut ties with the contractor involved.

Despite controversy, Chinese automakers continue investing heavily.

""The strategy really seems to be: Be the first company that starts selling EVs in new markets. Create the market,"" Mazzocco said. ""It's very long-term thinking — and it's changing markets on the ground in several emerging economies.""

Cybersecurity startup Armis has raised $435 million in a funding round that values the company at $6.1 billion.

""The need for what Armis is doing and what we are building, in this cyber exposure management and security platform, is just increasing,"" CEO and co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov told CNBC. There's ""very unique and huge demand right now, and we are continuing to grow.""

Goldman Sachs Alternatives' growth equity fund anchored the investment, with participation from CapitalG, a venture arm of Alphabet. The security firm brought on Evolution Equity Partners as a new investor.

Armis helps businesses secure and manage internet-connected devices and protect them against cyber threats. The company chose Goldman's growth fund due to its strong track record helping companies accelerate growth toward initial public offerings, Dibrov said.

""This is the partner for us to go to the next stage and continue to build here a real generational business to get to the Hall of Fame of cyber and SaaS businesses,"" he said.

In September, Bloomberg reported that the company was exploring as much as seven stake offers. Dibrov told CNBC the funding round was an outcome of those talks.

Founded in 2016, Armis in August said it surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenues. The California-based company achieved that milestone less than a year after topping $200 million in ARR.

Armis raised $200 million in an October 2024 funding round with General Catalyst and Alkeon Capital. Previous backers have included Sequioa Capital and Bain Capital Ventures. Armis also raised $100 million in a secondary offering in July.

Dibrov said Armis is aiming for an IPO at the end of 2026 or early 2027, but he said he's in no rush and is waiting on ""market conditions."" The company's primary goal is to hit $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, he said.

""Going public will be before that,"" he said.

In this article

Guangzhou, CHINA — Chinese electric car company Xpeng plans to launch robotaxis next year after previously claiming it wouldn't be a real business in the near future and took the wraps off of its latest humanoid robot model. 

Xpeng's technology push mirrors one of its key rivals Tesla, as the Guangzhou, China-headquartered company looks to position itself as more than just an electric car firm. 

The automaker announced on Wednesday as part of its ""AI Day"" that it is launching three robotaxi models. The vehicles will use four of Xpeng's self-developed ""Turing"" AI chips. Xpeng claims the chips represent the combined highest in-car computing power in the world, at 3,000 TOPS, an industry measure. 

The semiconductors power Xpeng's ""vision-language-action (VLA)"" model, now in its second iteration. This type of AI models take into account inputs like visual cues that can help with applications like driverless cars or robotics. 

Alibaba announced Wednesday that it is partnering with Xpeng on robotaxis through the e-commerce company's digital mapping subsidiary AutoNavi and Amaps app, which also includes a ride-hailing portal.

The Xpeng robotaxi includes an external display of speed and other information on the vehicle's sun visors.

Xpeng said it plans to start testing robotaxis in Guangzhou and other Chinese cities next year.

Co-president Brian Gu told CNBC last week that robotaxis will ""ultimately be a global phenomenon"" but that it would take time to get there, especially given regulation. Back in April 2024, he cautioned that self-driving taxis wouldn't become a significant business for at least five years.

During a group interview with reporters on Wednesday, Gu addressed his change in tone from last year toward robotaxis.

""The tech is happening faster than we anticipated,"" Gu said.

He noted that the AI developments and the significant increase in computing power ""give us the confidence we are near the inflection point"" for robotaxis.

Xpeng's strategy for robotaxis is to make two categories of cars: one for commercial self-driving shared vehicles, and another for fully autonomous personal cars that may be only shared among family members.

Xpeng's robotaxi announcements come as Chinese players such as Pony.ai, WeRide and Baidu have ramped up global expansion plans after rolling out self-driving taxis to the public in parts of China. Tesla this year launched its long-awaited robotaxi program in parts of Texas.

Similar to Tesla's push into humanoid robots, Xpeng on Wednesday announced its own version, the second-generation Iron robot. The Chinese company plans to begin mass production of the robots next year.

During a presentation on Wednesday, CEO He Xiaopeng downplayed the likelihood that the humanoids will soon be usable in households, and said it was too costly to use them in factories given the low price of labor in China. Instead, he said the robots will first be used as tour guides, sales assistants and office building guides, beginning in Xpeng facilities.

He said that he doesn't know how many robots Xpeng will sell in the next 10 years, but it will be more than the number of cars.

The humanoid robot uses three of Xpeng's Turing AI chips and a solid-state battery, with plans for customization options for aspects of the product like body shape and hair style.

Xpeng Co-President Gu said on Wednesday that the company has been developing some technology before Tesla but has not been as vocal in promoting it. 

""What we are pursuing from a tech and product perspective, there are some similarities with Tesla…There are some areas that we probably started earlier than Tesla,"" Gu said, referring to flying cars and humanoid robots.

Xpeng has developed a flying car product.

But Gu acknowledged that Tesla has done a better and more high-profile job at sharing its commercialization plans, which Xpeng has not done as much until today.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

America's AI competition with China is coming for cryptocurrencies.

At least that's what U.S. President Donald Trump suggested following his meeting last Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping — a trade negotiation closely watched around the world.

""I wanna make crypto great for America,"" Trump told CBS News. ""The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way.""

""I don't want China or anybody else to take it away,"" he said.

Whether Trump genuinely views Beijing as a serious threat or not, his remarks come as China sends new signals on its crypto ambitions. Beijing has banned domestic crypto transactions since 2021, while Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, has maintained a managed system that encourages the development of digital assets.

On Monday, Hong Kong eased its restrictions further — allowing its licensed virtual asset trading platforms to connect directly with global crypto exchanges and list new digital assets and Hong Kong-regulated stablecoins, forgoing the need for a 12-month track record.

The announcement coincided with Hong Kong's state-organized 10th FinTech Week, which opened just as the political and business spectacle in South Korea began to fade.

Hong Kong has been quick to follow Washington's lead, allowing exchange-traded funds tracking spot  last year, and went a step further by approving spot ether ETFs to trade nearly three months before the U.S. did.

Bitcoin, often likened to digital gold, remains the most recognized cryptocurrency. Ether, another major digital currency on the Ethereum network, is used both for payments and as ""gas"" to pay for computation and run smart contracts on decentralized applications.

Ethereum Foundation's co-executive director Tomasz K. Stańczak, speaking at a digital assets forum Sunday on the sidelines of Hong Kong's FinTech week, noted that over 60% of stablecoins —cryptocurrencies pegged to government-issued currencies— are deployed on the Ethereum network.

In the audience of about 300 people, nearly 70% came from traditional finance, according to Gavin Wang, chief investment officer at SNZ Holdings, a digital assets investment firm that helped organize the forum.

That contrasts with how such events used to attract more software developers, said Wang, who previously worked at UBS. The forum also announced an ""Ethereum Hong Kong Hub,"" a co-working space to incubate related startups, reflecting the city's growing influence as Asia's crypto gateway.

Even major industry players are taking notice. Consensus, one of the world's biggest crypto conferences in North America, expanded to Hong Kong for the first time this year, and plans to return in 2026.

Still, digital assets remain relatively nascent relative to traditional markets. The total value of cryptocurrencies has yet to exceed $4.5 trillion, global stock markets are still far larger at $101.52 trillion.

Bitcoin fell sharply in the last few weeks following concerns about escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and frothy AI stock valuations, briefly dipping below $100,000 for the first time since late June.

""My assumption is it's more or less the same group of [investors] switching around AI and crypto,"" said Jason Huang, founding partner of NextGen Digital Venture (NDV), an Asia-based fund invests in cryptocurrencies and related stocks. ""Once AI cools down a bit, I think crypto will come back.""

Huang's $100 million fund surged by 375.5% in the two years through March 2025 — outperforming bitcoin by more than 60% during that period — and he's now launching a second fund. He said many of his investors are wealthy Chinese, adding that subscriptions have increased despite the recent selloff.

According to Huang, his fund was down only in the single digits last month, despite the , which he said was the single largest liquidation day for crypto, even surpassing the infamous FTX exchange collapse.

The next phase of competition may not be about tokens themselves, but about control. Governments are increasingly eager to control the market through stablecoins backed by their own fiat currencies.

Much of the recent excitement over digital assets in Hong Kong stems from its push into stablecoins this year, following the U.S. Genius Act, which aims to support dollar-pegged stablecoins. It's taking the U.S. dollar competition with the Chinese yuan into the digital era.

""Both are striving to expand their own currency usage to build up their respective global user ecosystem,"" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor of law at the New York University School of Law.

But it won't be easy, he pointed out, as Beijing has yet to convince individuals to adopt the digital yuan at scale, which is China's central bank–issued digital currency designed to replace some cash transactions while allowing tighter oversight of its financial system.

China has sought to promote a digital version of its yuan currency in recent years but it has yet to break into the mainstream.

""U.S. dollar stablecoins may experience the same when they start to emerge,"" Ma said.

The U.S. dollar accounted for just under half of global payments by value in September, tracked by international financial messaging service SWIFT, while the Chinese yuan climbed one spot into fifth place with a 3.17% share.

Last week, China's central bank governor Pan Gongsheng promoted the digital yuan, while taking a more conservative view of stablecoins than many expected, reaffirming Beijing's long-standing restrictions on speculative trading in virtual currencies.

Still, bitcoin blockchain data showed China remains a major player, ranking third in global bitcoin mining activity — behind the U.S. and Russia.

That's not a statistic Trump is likely to overlook. Forbes estimates the U.S. president himself holds roughly $870 million worth of bitcoin—one of the world's largest personal stashes.

— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.

Carlos Gutierrez, former U.S. Commerce Secretary, said both Washington and Beijing got what they wanted out of Trump and Xi's meeting in South Korea. He added that markets will likely welcome signs that the two countries are giving each other reasons to strengthen ties.

James Kim, chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, said the relationship between the United States and China is especially important for South Korea. He added that he was pleased with the outcome of the trade talks between Washington and Seoul.

Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at Eurasia Group, said Nvidia has likely made more progress with the U.S. government than with China amid ongoing tensions over semiconductor export controls.

U.S.-China reach one-year trade truce. If the latest U.S.-China trade deal is finalized, tariffs are expected to stay lower, and large-scale disruptions to rare earths trade are unlikely over the next 12 months.

Nvidia in China. As the chipmaker stays largely locked out of a $50 billion market, CEO Jensen Huang on Friday acknowledged that ""China doesn't want H20 or any American chips.""

China's factory activity slumps. The official purchasing managers' index and its private sector counterpart both showed a drop in manufacturing in October from September amid U.S. trade tensions.

We are still at a very early stage [of asset allocation into crypto], probably 7.5% crypto adoption globally. So going forward, I still envisage quite a lot of demand coming.

— Richard Teng, Binance CEO

Chinese markets rose 0.46%, defying a broader regional decline as investors pulled back from AI-related stocks.

The Hang Seng Index was little changed, while the CSI 300 has gained nearly 18% so far this year.

The offshore Chinese yuan last traded at 7.1307 against the dollar.

LONDON — European stocks reversed earlier losses to end Wednesday's session broadly higher, as regional shares followed their U.S. counterparts into positive territory.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was provisionally 0.25% higher after the closing bell, paring losses seen earlier in the session.

The lackluster sentiment seen earlier in Europe followed similar moves in U.S. and Asia Pacific markets overnight, as investors appear increasingly concerned about the lofty valuations of AI-related stocks and tech companies, fearing a bubble is forming.

However, Wall Street's major averages rebounded on Wednesday morning, with some big AI players including Advanced Micro Devices, Oracle and Nvidia posting gains in early New York trade.

Market sentiment also took a knock yesterday when the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley warned investors to brace for a drawdown in markets over the next two years.

It was another busy day for earnings in Europe on Wednesday.

Novo Nordisk shares closed 4.5% lower, having swung between positive and negative territory throughout the morning. The Danish drugmaker posted net profits of 20 billion Danish kroner ($3.1 billion) in its third quarter earnings report, in line with analysts' expected 20.12 billion Danish kroner.

BMW shares rose 6.9%, as the German carmaker's earnings before interest came in at 2.3 billion euros for the third quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.

Meanwhile, Orsted ended the session flat, as the Danish wind energy firm posted a 1.7 billion Danish kroner net loss for the third quarter, which was better than analysts' prediction of a 1.95 billion Danish kroner net loss.

On the central bank front, Sweden's Riksbank announced it was leaving its interest rate unchanged at 1.75%.

by Alejandra Martinez, The Texas Tribune November 5, 2025

Residents of a rural North Texas community who have long complained about noise from a nearby Bitcoin mine facility lost their effort to regulate the facility Tuesday night when 62% of the 138 voters who cast ballots rejected a proposal to incorporate as a city.

 

The community's noise complaints began after a cryptocurrency facility owned by MARA Holdings, formerly known as Marathon, was built in 2022. The site operates about 60,000 computers that are cooled by powerful industrial fans that residents say have shattered the peace and quiet of their rural area with its roaring noise. 

Many say the facility's endless buzz — which some compare to a leafblower that never turns off — has become unbearable. Some neighbors use personal decibel readers to measure the noise levels and report sleepless nights, headaches and even hearing problems. 

In response to resident concerns, the company expanded a 24-foot tall wall last year and transitioned 67% of its cooling fans to a liquid cooling system. However, residents say the noise remains disruptive. 

Texas counties lack authority to enforce noise limits, which is why locals pushed to incorporate the roughly two-square-mile community, home to about 600 people and a single stop sign, into the City of Mitchell Bend. They hoped becoming a city would let them create a noise ordinance to bring the volume down at the Bitcoin facility. 

“It was very disappointing last night. We were hoping to have some tools to fight the noise a little,” said Danny Lakey, a Hood County resident who lives a half a mile from the Bitcoin mine.

“Although we took a loss here, we are going to move forward and we will continue to do what we can to not let industry take over Hood County.” 

The fight with MARA created an internal conflict among some local residents as they weighed whether to form a city. Many said they moved to the countryside to escape not only noisy cities, but city regulations.

The failed vote follows a series of legal disputes between residents and MARA, which operates at least three other facilities in Texas. The company filed a lawsuit to block the election last month, arguing that incorporation would have harmed its operations. A judge denied their request allowing the vote to proceed.

Bitcoin has been falling again — but unlike in last month's selloff, it's not leverage breaking the market.

The original cryptocurrency fell as much as 7.4% on Tuesday to dip below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June. That's down more than 20% from a record high reached a month ago. Bitcoin recovered 1.7% on Wednesday morning in New York, although some options traders are wagering on further declines.

Ethereum is the premier platform for building decentralized applications, and Ether is the network's native cryptocurrency.

Ether benefits from higher demand as more people use the Ethereum network, driving upside for investors.

The cryptocurrency recently set a new all-time high, and some Wall Street analysts are very bullish on its potential.

Decentralized applications hold a lot of promise, because there is a growing demand for services that can't be controlled or manipulated by a single entity (like a company or government). They have become especially popular in areas like financial services, gaming, and even real estate, where people value transparent systems of record and the ability to control their own data.

Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) is the world's largest platform for developing decentralized applications. Every time someone uses an Ethereum-based app, they incur a fee payable in the network's native cryptocurrency, Ether. In theory, this arrangement creates constant demand for Ether as long as the network continues to expand, which could benefit investors.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Ether actually hit a new record high of $4,954 per coin earlier this year. It's down 32% from that peak, so should investors buy the dip before it potentially recovers and breaks above the $5,000 milestone?

Decentralized apps are governed by smart contracts, which are slivers of computer code that live on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts set the rules for each application's functionality, and they typically can't be changed, which ensures no person, company, or government can disrupt the app's decentralized structure.

The Ethereum network itself is also completely decentralized. Rather than hosting its blockchain system of record inside a data center, which is what a traditional business would do, Ethereum is hosted on thousands of nodes all over the world. These nodes can be computers that are run by practically anybody, and they each store a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain, making it practically impossible for a hacker to take down the entire network.

Thousands of decentralized apps have been created using Ethereum. Several online casino and betting platforms, for instance, host the outcomes, transactions, and the rules behind each game on the blockchain, so any user can verify them. Plus, as crypto-based platforms, they are much easier for users to access without disclosing as much of their personal information.

These platforms differ significantly from traditional centralized betting platforms, which are burdened by strict regulations and offer limited transparency regarding the functionality of their games.

Decentralized crypto exchanges offer similar benefits. Ethereum-based Uniswap, for example, lets users swap their cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies, and it uses smart contracts to calculate prices and execute transactions. Users can simply connect their crypto wallet to Uniswap without setting up an account, making it very convenient.

Whenever someone uses a decentralized app, whether it's to gamble or exchange cryptocurrencies, they activate smart contracts that trigger fees payable in Ether, thus creating demand for the coin that drives its price higher.

Ethereum is attracting a growing amount of support from traditional financial analysts. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered thinks Ether could hit $25,000 per coin by 2028, as legislation like the Genius Act in the U.S. makes it easier for developers to launch stablecoins, many of which are built on Ethereum.

Then there is Tom Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors, who believes the Ethereum network could transform entire industries, especially financial services, which could drive Ether to a whopping $62,000 per coin by 2035. That would give Ether a market capitalization of $7.5 trillion based on its current supply of 120.7 million coins, making it far more valuable than the world's largest company today ($4.9 trillion tech giant Nvidia).

It's difficult to predict where the business of decentralized applications will be a decade from now, but we do know Ethereum will face growing competition. The Solana network, for example, was designed to be a faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative to Ethereum, and it's slowly gaining momentum with the developer community.

Another thing we know right now is that the number of Ethereum daily active addresses, which is a proxy for how many users are participating in the network, has flatlined. This might explain why Ether struggled to maintain its momentum after hitting a new record high in August.



Ethereum Daily Active Addresses data by YCharts

In summary, investors who believe in the future of decentralized apps will probably want to own at least some Ether, given Ethereum's status as the world's largest platform for developers. However, whether it will surpass the $5,000-per-coin milestone soon -- or ever -- is impossible to know, and investors need to be comfortable with that uncertainty before parking their money in this cryptocurrency.

By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

Bitcoin BTC$103,999.48 briefly slipped below $100,000 for the first time since June as a wave of liquidations and shifting macro expectations triggered a broad crypto sell-off.

The leading cryptocurrency is now down more than 20% from the all-time high above $126,000 it set in early October. The broader crypto market, as measured via the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, fell 2.6% in the last 24 hours and more than 27% in the past 30 days.

The sell-off intensified in the past 24 hours with more than $1.7 billion in crypto positions liquidated, according to CoinGlass. Long traders bore the brunt of the losses.

""Since the ~$19B liquidations on 10/10, markets have been cascading lower,” Jasper De Maere, an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. “The current weakness reflects a mix of ongoing digestion of 10/10, slightly more hawkish Fed tone, and a broader risk-off across assets, with the Nasdaq, crypto's closest proxy, down ~2% on valuation concerns.”

The drawdown is seeing bitcoin now fight to defend a key level, its 50-week simple moving average, which has historically supported its long-term price recoveries. That level is just under $103,000.

“The sell-off is a reminder that liquidity remains thin, especially in long-tail alts, which is why we're seeing outsized negative price action, further propelled by a marketwide flight to safety,” De Maere said.

Meanwhile, Tuesday's $128 million hack on Balancer raised fresh concerns about security in the decentralized finance ecosystem, further chilling sentiment.

As it stands, sentiment has taken a hit with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index now sitting on “fear.” Near-term catalysts are limited according to De Maere, although the U.S. government reopening and supportive crypto legislation could support prices.

The crypto market is weary after relentless waves of sell pressure on Tuesday. Several assets have now settled as they begin to establish levels of support, although if the U.S. dollar continues to show strength it could signal a period of prolonged downside.

Bitcoin BTC$103,999.48 rose about 1% since midnight UTC after two days of declines that saw it drop to the lowest price since June at one point. Ether ETH$3,436.41, which slid as much as than 20% over the 48 hours — the steepest drop in three months — added 2%.

While the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the biggest cryptocurrencies, is 2.5% lower over 24 hours, that pretty much reflects yesterday's action: It's up 2.2% since midnight UTC and only one constituent, ICP$5.1609, is lower.

The altcoin market is in worse shape than bitcoin, which continues to cling on to the $99,000 level of support.

Several tokens have now retraced their entire rallies from July, suggesting a short-lived ""altcoin season"" has concluded with focus moving back to BTC and whether it can weather this recent storm.

Oops, something went wrong

In recent months, the USDT Dominance (USDT.D) index has experienced a rapid rise. A 20% increase in October suggests investors moved funds out of risky assets and into “haven” stablecoins. 

However, as the index approaches a long-term resistance level, a key question arises: Is this a sign of an impending market correction—or the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Bitcoin and Altcoins?

According to data shared on X, USDT Dominance (USDT.D) has steadily increased for the past six months. It recently hit a short-term peak and is approaching a long-term descending trendline, a resistance zone that has historically capped USDT.D rallies.

Technical analysts are split into two sides. One believes that USDT.D could face a strong rejection at this resistance, similar to previous instances that coincided with Bitcoin (BTC) price bottoms and subsequent recoveries, such as the FTX crisis in 2022.

Conversely, if the index breaks above this resistance, the next primary target could be around 6.5%, signaling further capital outflows from risk assets and potentially deeper price declines in crypto.

Another noteworthy pattern is the bearish head-and-shoulders formation emerging on the 4-hour chart. If confirmed, USDT.D could rally to 5.7% before correcting, suggesting that the upcoming market phase may be marked by heightened volatility and a war between fear and optimism.

Based on the overall technical picture, there's a strong chance that USDT.D could experience a short-term rejection at the resistance level, providing temporary relief for the altcoin market before the market establishes a more defined medium-term trend. This short-term pullback could serve as a healthy pause, allowing risk appetite to recover briefly before the next move.

Mechanically, when USDT.D rises, the share of stablecoins in total crypto market capitalization increases, indicating that investors are moving to cash and adopting a risk-off stance. Conversely, when USDT.D declines, funds typically flow back into risk assets, with Bitcoin leading the recovery, followed by altcoins. Hence, USDT Dominance is a key liquidity indicator for the entire crypto market.

Some analysts believe the current resistance zone could be a critical inflection point. If USDT.D fails to break through, it could signal that Bitcoin has already bottomed or is very close to its bottom.

In that scenario, altcoins may outperform in percentage terms, given their smaller size and higher sensitivity to capital inflows. On the other hand, a decisive breakout above resistance could trigger a short-term sell-off, particularly among low-cap Altcoins, where investor sentiment is most fragile.

While USDT.D is hovering near resistance, additional confirmation signals, such as declining trading volume or a clear reversal candle, are needed to validate a sustained recovery.

Risk management should take priority over aggressive positioning, as investors monitor USDT.D alongside Bitcoin's price action. Once the dominance index begins to decline steadily, it could serve as a clear signal that liquidity is returning to the crypto market.

Quick Facts:

Bitcoin mining company MARA has just announced record-high revenues for the past quarter, at $252.4M. This represents a 92% increase compared to 2024's Q3, when the company bagged $131.6M.

MARA owes this growth rate to its expanding Bitcoin mining system, which generated 98% more $BTC over a one-year span. The company mined 2,144 $BTC during this Q3 or almost 53,000 between 2024 and 2025.

Fred Thiel, MARA's CEO, explained this mass expansion in the context of adopting open-source AI tech to replace the standard GPUs:

We are already seeing the alternatives to GPUs enter the market, and open source AI is making it far easier and much less expensive for companies to deploy advanced AI systems directly in their own private cloud environments.

—Frederick Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call

As Salman Khan, MARA's CFO, explains in the same announcement, the company's hash rate grew by roughly 20%, while the daily cost per peta hash dropped 15% over the last year. This allowed MARA to almost double its performance in just 12 months.

As Bitcoin's Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper's ($HYPER), could have an even bigger impact in 2026, promising faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for a more scalable, performant network.

As Fred Thiel himself noticed, Bitcoin has ‘entered its institutional phase', with names like City Corp, BlackRock, and JP Morgan ‘integrating Bitcoin into traditional frameworks'.

Then we have governments and public and private companies hoarding $BTC at an unprecedented rate. As Bitcoin Treasuries data shows, 353 entities hold over 4.05M $BTC and their accumulation rate went up 4.12% over the last 30 days.



This ever-expanding ecosystem offers unlimited opportunities, and Thiel's MARA is all for it. As the CEO explained, the company plans to expand on the marriage between Bitcoin and AI tech:

Bitcoin mining monetizes underutilized energy and stabilizes grids, while AI inference transforms that same energy into intelligence and productivity. By bringing Bitcoin and AI together, we seek to maximize the value of every megawatt-hour we manage.

—Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call

To that end, MARA has already secured a partnership with MPLX with the goal of expanding its operations into West Texas. MPLX will offer ‘long-term access to low-cost natural gas at scale', which will complement MARA's computing infrastructure for higher throughput.

The projected initial capacity is around 400 megawatts with the option to expand to up to 1.5 gigawatts across three planned sites.

These developments position MARA as a leader in Bitcoin mining, which can only work in Bitcoin's favor.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), on the other hand, also propels $BTC forward, promising to build a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network than ever before.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises a faster, more performant, and more cost-effective Bitcoin network, leveraging tools such as the SVM and the Canonical Bridge.

The Canonical Bridge addresses Bitcoin's most pressing issue: its performance limitations.

As such, smaller transactions can sometimes experience confirmation times of hours, which explains the network's unsuitability for most DeFi applications.

The Canonical Bridge fixes this issue by minting the users' bitcoins into the Hyper layer as soon as the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms the transaction details.

The entire process lasts seconds, vastly improving Bitcoin's confirmation times and removing the 7-TPS cap.



Meanwhile, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps.

This will increase Bitcoin's ranking on the list of the fastest blockchains today and make the network more feasible for institutional investors.

The presale is at over $25.9M so far and growing at a steady pace, despite the October 10 meltdown, which sent the market into a downward spiral. The project's resilience already ranks it among the best presales of 2025.

This makes $HYPER one of the best altcoins to buy this coming Q4.

If you want in on it, visit the presale page and snag your $HYPER today.

Oops, something went wrong

XION, a verification infrastructure technology company, has partnered with the Blockchain for Good Alliance to launch the Global Impact Accelerator (GIA), a joint fund designed to support startups creating blockchain-based solutions that advance the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

The GIA's first $100,000 fund deployment was announced at the Global Impact Forum in Copenhagen, hosted by the BGA and the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) AltFinLab.

The accelerator's mission is to identify, fund, and incubate early-stage projects that leverage blockchain for measurable social good, using XION's verification infrastructure to ensure transparency and accountability.

“The Blockchain for Good initiative was launched to bring about social good through blockchain technology, and we look forward to advancing that mission further with the launch of the Global Impact Accelerator,” said Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit, which supports the BGA initiative.

The Global Impact Accelerator marks progress in the BGA–XION partnership. XION said it is showing broader engagement with governments, NGOs, and institutions to promote verifiable and trusted digital ecosystems. The collaboration seeks to help mission-driven entrepreneurs scale their solutions responsibly and sustainably.

“The launch of the Global Impact Accelerator brings us one step closer to realizing blockchain's potential for measurable social progress,” said Freya Chen, Executive Director of the BGA. “By combining XION's unique verification infrastructure with the BGA's mission-driven network, we're empowering innovators who can both prove and scale their impact.”

According to XION, all participating projects will undergo a strict selection process to ensure clear alignment with SDG targets, tangible impact potential, and long-term business viability.

The GIA will also collaborate with HackQuest to assess each team's technical capacity, scalability, and ability to execute on their mission. Successful applicants will receive funding, technical support, mentorship, and introductions to strategic venture capital partners.

Anthony Anzalone, founder of XION, said this latest initiative is designed to help build evidence-based public infrastructure that governments, NGOs, and citizens can trust.

“Trust is paramount in government programs. For XION, verification is fundamental for digital infrastructure in a world where trust is the scarcest resource,” Anzalone said.

“BGA and XION will offer a model for verifiable, inclusive public systems that work for everyone—without technical gatekeepers,” adds Anzalone.

In October, Fireblocks, the $8 billion crypto infrastructure provider, announced that it has integrated XION, a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain built for mainstream adoption.

XION claims the partnership is a step toward bringing blockchain to the masses—removing the complexity of wallets, seed phrases, and unpredictable gas fees that have long deterred institutional and consumer use.

With Fireblocks' platform securing over $10 trillion in digital asset transactions, the integration allows banks, enterprises, and brands to explore blockchain-based programs across payments, loyalty, gaming, and tokenization.

While XION has made strides in building institutional partnerships and real-world use cases, its token has yet to gain strong market momentum. Currently trading at around $0.49, XION's market capitalization sits near $21 million, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of roughly $100 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

The token's price has seen a sharp decline since its early highs near launch, reflecting a broader trend where infrastructure-focused blockchain projects often lag in retail popularity compared to meme coins or high-yield DeFi tokens. However, trading volumes have recently shown signs of renewed activity—up over 40% in the past 24 hours—suggesting that investor interest could return as the project's real-world impact and partnerships, such as the Global Impact Accelerator, gain visibility.

ByRoomy Khan,

Contributor.

In March 2022, Shell sold more than 20 LNG cargoes as ""carbon-neutral,"" backed by nearly five million credits from rice farms in China's Anhui province. The credits flowed through Verra—the leading voluntary carbon registry—based on claims that irrigation upgrades had slashed methane emissions. However, a 2024 investigation found that the infrastructure was never built, and the emissions reductions never happened. It wasn't Verra's first credibility crisis. A 2023 investigation by The Guardian, Die Zeit, and SourceMaterial found that roughly 94% of Verra's rainforest credits didn't represent real reductions. A system built on trust was minting climate fiction.

At the same time, cryptocurrency was in a speculative frenzy. Bitcoin surged from $10,000 to $60,000. Ethereum and Solana rallied. FOMO was the draw and the chance to get in early.

But the reality was punishing. Hot wallets, cold wallets, hardware wallets, seed phrases, private keys—an avalanche of jargon. Gas fees cost $50 to move $100. Smart contracts you couldn't audit. One malicious line of code could drain your account overnight. Most people just wanted to buy Bitcoin like Apple stock—click, watch the number go up, maybe sell later. They didn't want to become their own Swiss bank.

Complexity created dependence. And that dependence was about to be exploited.

FTX arrived with a seductive pitch: ""We'll handle the complexity. You just click buttons."" Clean interface. Familiar login. Customer support. It looked like Schwab, acted like Schwab, and for a while, felt safer than trusting yourself with a 64-character string that could never be recovered. Then it vaporized over $8 billion. Genesis froze withdrawals, BlockFi and Voyager collapsed, and platforms built on ""safe custody"" proved opaque and fragile.

Different industries, different starting points, but identical failure mode: complexity created dependence on intermediaries, and that dependence was eventually exploited until systems broke.

What happened next wasn't just a reform. It was the beginning of a fundamental restructuring. Call it the precision stack: sensors to see, AI to interpret, blockchain to record, smart contracts to execute. No trust required.

Carbon Markets: From Greenwashing to Machine-Verified 

After the voluntary carbon market's credibility crisis, a new generation of solutions has emerged built on proof systems, not trust. Satellite imagery confirms forest cover and irrigation systems, IoT sensors track emissions in real time, and blockchain creates an immutable audit trail.

The World Bank is leading the shift. Rather than dismantling legacy registries like Verra, Gold Standard, or ACR, it's rebuilding trust by linking them through blockchain infrastructure. The Climate Action Data Trust connects these registries at the protocol layer, making every issuance, transfer, and retirement auditable in real time. The same infrastructure is already tracking the $500 million Metro Manila Flood Management Project, where every disbursement flows through blockchain, cutting administrative friction and creating instant visibility for auditors and project teams.

Corporate buyers are increasingly favoring engineered carbon removal over traditional nature-based offsets, driven by the need for durable, verifiable solutions. Microsoft has poured hundreds of millions into direct air capture (DAC) technologies that pull CO₂ straight from the atmosphere, far more reliable than forests that risk burning down. A Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) facility with geological storage spanning thousands of years simply cannot be undone by drought or land-use shifts. While nature-based offsets remain valuable for immediate impact, engineered removals offer unmatched permanence, backed by continuous monitoring via sensors, satellites, and blockchain audit trails. In 2024, Microsoft alone purchased 5.1 million tons of engineered carbon removal, representing 63% of the global market. In today's market, machine-readable, auditable truth isn't just a nice-to-have—it's the entry ticket to credible climate action.

A new layer of solutions is pushing the precision stack directly to projects—combining satellite data, IoT sensors, and on-chain recording at the ground level. Rather than relying solely on centralized registries, these platforms automate verification in real time and channel funding toward confirmed outcomes in renewable energy and conservation. As an example, Preshent uses AI and blockchain to verify sustainability milestones through distributed pilots in partnership with Tribal Nations, expanding to regional and global partners. Its JR AI engine automates verification while PRSH Finance records transactions and channels funding toward verified outcomes across renewable energy and conservation projects.

The pattern is consistent: proof moves from annual audits to continuous monitoring, from PDF reports to on-chain records, from trust-based claims to sensor-backed truth.

Financial institutions are now building the infrastructure to make this scalable. Carbonplace, a consortium of nine global banks including UBS, BNP Paribas, and Standard Chartered, is constructing a blockchain-based network for institutional carbon credit trading, creating the banking rails for tokenized environmental assets.

Regulators are not catching up—they are locking in. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission now classifies tokenized carbon credits as regulated commodities. The G20 has endorsed distributed ledger standards for audit infrastructure. The EU has begun approving blockchain-based MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) pilots as part of its compliance infrastructure. Analysts project tokenized credits could reach $50 billion by 2030.

Tools that once belonged to hedge funds are now accessible to individual traders. No-code platforms, such as Coinrule and 3Commas, let users deploy algorithmic strategies such as grid trading, arbitrage, and momentum plays with a few clicks. Copy-trading platforms like eToro allow novices to mirror professional strategies tick-for-tick. Meanwhile, trading costs have collapsed. Some exchanges charge around 0.01% per trade, making it economically viable to run strategies that once required engineering teams and institutional infrastructure. Retail traders can now access leverage levels previously reserved for professional desks.

Exchanges are racing to lower barriers. Coinbase now offers nano-sized Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, contracts representing 1/100th of a Bitcoin, letting users learn derivatives without committing large capital. Webull went further in October 2025, partnering with Coinbase Derivatives to list Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, and XRP futures, giving retail traders a single interface for equities, options, and crypto derivatives. Then there's Bybit, where more than 20 million accounts can access up to 100x leverage on major perpetual futures pairs. A $1,000 account with 100x leverage controls $100,000 in exposure, a level of market power that would have been unthinkable for retail traders a decade ago.

But access to tools doesn't equal access to institutional-grade intelligence. Retail traders face a structural disadvantage in futures markets: they lack the institutional-grade probability data and execution infrastructure that professional desks use to identify statistical edge and minimize emotional decision-making. Platforms like Edgeful are addressing this gap by providing probability analytics across 100+ historical market scenarios, analyzing patterns from gap fills to volatility reversals. Real-time screeners identify trades based on probability thresholds, auto-plotting levels on TradingView and NinjaTrader and connecting to brokers to execute trades using preset risk parameters.

Whether retail tools can replicate anything close to an institutional edge remains doubtful. Professional desks process thousands of signals per second, co-locate servers near exchange engines, and deploy capital at scales an individual can't replicate. Automation can enforce risk rules and execute strategies around the clock, and that matters, but it's not the same as competing with the machines.

The rise of AI-driven execution introduces a new class of systemic risk. Models trained on historical data can perform flawlessly in backtests yet fail catastrophically when confronted with events outside their training range. When thousands of autonomous agents respond to the same market signal in real time, they don't correct instability—they amplify it. Volatility cascades faster than humans can intervene.

Regulators are no longer debating whether AI and blockchain belong in financial markets—they are working to define accountability in systems where trades are executed by algorithms, not people. The core questions have shifted: Who is liable when an AI agent triggers a flash crash? How do you audit a black-box model that cannot explain its own decisions?

Yet blockchain offers a counterbalance. Smart contracts execute trades based on predefined logic recorded on-chain, creating transparent audit trails that regulators can monitor. Instead of relying on post-trade reporting, regulators are beginning to supervise markets at the infrastructure level: reviewing the code that governs execution, not just the outcomes. MiCA's real-time audit obligations signal the same shift: machine-readable market structure over post-hoc enforcement.

But skeptics argue the precision stack may automate flawed incentives rather than eliminate them. Blockchain verifies that sensors recorded data, not whether sensors were tampered with. The Verra scandal wasn't a technology failure—it was fraud at the design stage where infrastructure was never built. Some blockchain implementations also demand substantial energy consumption. The precision stack accelerates verification but can't replace adversarial auditing that catches intentional deception. It's a powerful foundation, not a silver bullet.

AI amplifies risk. Blockchain creates accountability. Regulators are now auditing architecture, not just outcomes.

Carbon markets and crypto trading began with different failures. One couldn't prove what was real, the other moved too fast to understand. Both reached the same conclusion: manual systems can't govern trillion-dollar flows.

The World Bank is using the stack to validate climate impact. Institutional trading desks are using it to execute at machine speed. Microsoft and leading corporations are using it to govern carbon removal. AI interprets reality, blockchain enforces outcomes, smart contracts execute them. The same precision infrastructure is reorganizing both climate finance and digital markets.

The implications stretch beyond finance. Supply chains, healthcare records, insurance claims—any system defined by fragmentation or opacity is being rebuilt around the same stack.

Markets no longer run on trust. They run on proof.

The infrastructure is live. The question facing institutions is no longer whether to adopt proof-based systems, but how quickly they can integrate them as markets restructure around machine-readable truth.

05 November 2025

Over the last six months, the convergence of AI, gaming and the metaverse has produced a flood of innovation that is redefining brand engagement and generating a new surge of legal disputes. Generative-AI Fortnite skins, Gucci-branded non-playable characters and knock-off NFT fashion drops are not one-off marketing ploys. Instead, they represent the frontier of a virtual goods marketplace, which is projected to exceed US$509 billion globally by 2033. Although these new immersive spaces provide opportunities for creative brand promotion, they also magnify the risk of trademark infringement.

The market opportunities are staggering. Nearly 700 million global users engage with immersive platforms, interest in NFTs continues to grow and AI tools enable near instantaneous content creation. However, this exceptional growth is generating more trademark disputes as brand owners contend with the dramatic increase in unauthorised and infringing use of their marks, trade dress, copyrights and other intellectual property.

Virtual environments create endless opportunities for the proliferation of user-generated content. For example, one AI-generated logo or skin can easily move across platforms, games and NFT marketplaces. This multiplies the instances of potential infringement and raises complicated questions around what qualifies as “use in commerce” and whether and to what extent platforms that host or distribute allegedly infringing content can rely on safe harbour or immunity doctrines under current legal frameworks.

Recent case law in the United States has begun to define how courts approach trademark disputes involving NFTs, AI and virtual goods.

In Hermès Int'l v Rothschild (MetaBirkin), a district court in New York held that the Trademark Act allowed Hermès to assert its trademark rights against NFTs imitating a luxury handbag line (Hermès Int'l v Rothschild, 590 F Supp 3d 647, 650–51, 655, SDDY 2022). The jury in that case unanimously found the NFTs were infringing and awarded Hermès $130,000 (678 F Supp 3d 475, 481). 

In another case, a California district court denied Midjourney's motion to dismiss artists' allegations of vicarious trade dress infringement based on the generative-AI platform's alleged inclusion of a “trade dress database that can recall and recreate the elements of each artist's trade dress” (Andersen v Stability AI Ltd, 744 F Supp 3d 956, 978–81, ND Cal, 2024).

In Roblox v Wowwee Group, a third court held that Roblox adequately pled that physical dolls infringed trade dress in the platform's in-game character designs (Roblox Corp v WowWee Grp Ltd, 660 F Supp 3d 880, 886–888, 892, ND Cal, 2023). 

Each of these cases represents a growing consensus among courts to analyse this new wave of emerging technologies within traditional trademark enforcement frameworks.

These issues are reaching the federal appellate courts as well. In July 2025, the Ninth Circuit ruled in Yuga Labs v Ripps that NFTs can qualify as goods under the Trademark Act (Yuga Labs, Inc v Ripps, 144 F4th 1137, 1157–59, Ninth Circuit, 2025). In that case, Yuga alleged that Ripps counterfeited Yuga's Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs in violation of the Lanham Act. The court held that the plaintiff's NFTs were goods under the Trademark Act and applied its standard likelihood-of-confusion analysis to determine infringement. After applying the analysis from AMF v Sleekcraft Boats, the Ninth Circuit concluded that:

Yuga [wa]s not entitled to prevail on its trademark-infringement and cybersquatting claims at [the summary judgment] stage because it ha[d] not proven as a matter of law that Defendants' RR/BAYC project is likely to cause consumer confusion in the marketplace. [Emphasis in original]

In so holding, the court emphasised that it must not “embarrass the future” when applying “established legal rules to the ‘totally new problems' of emerging technologies”.

Viewed holistically, these rulings signal that trademark law is steadily adapting to the digital economy, giving brand owners clearer guidelines for enforcing their rights in virtual marketplaces.

For brand owners, proactive strategies are essential. Key steps include:

Key classes include:

Companies should expect increased litigation in the next year, which will continue to test how courts will address issues related to AI-generated content and cross-platform brand assets. This litigation will hopefully provide guidance on the issues of liability, safe harbour provisions and the scope of trademark rights in virtual marketplaces.

As companies continue to experiment with creative and lucrative opportunities presented by AI and immersive worlds, it is imperative that they develop an IP enforcement playbook for handling the inevitable rise in infringement. By implementing safeguards now, brand owners can capitalise on the virtual goods boom and have the tools they need to protect and enforce their brands and other intellectual property in the virtual universe. They can also reduce the risk of being sued for infringing the rights of others.

NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique digital assets secured on the blockchain, representing ownership of everything from art to music and virtual real estate. Learn how NFTs work, what makes them valuable and how to buy them with Crypto.com.

An NFT (non-fungible token) is a type of digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item – usually digital artwork, music, collectibles or virtual property. Unlike a standard digital file, which can be copied or shared freely, an NFT is one-of-a-kind and traceable, as it's secured on a blockchain.

Its ‘non-fungible' nature basically means that the asset is not interchangeable with another asset of the same type. This is different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, fiat currencies like the Australian dollar or even metals like gold, all of which are fungible. 

For example, you would be perfectly happy to exchange one Bitcoin for another, but you can't replace one NFT for another, because no two NFTs share identical values or characteristics.

NFTs have three core characteristics that make them distinct:

These features make NFTs ideal for certifying digital ownership and enabling the trade of rare or collectible assets online.

Sign up on Crypto.com to start exploring NFTs.



NFTs work using blockchains, which are decentralised digital ledgers that record transactions securely and transparently. Each NFT is stored on a blockchain (commonly Ethereum or Cronos), containing metadata and unique identifiers that distinguish it from every other NFT. 

This ensures that the ownership and transaction history of an NFT can be verified by anyone, making forgery or duplication difficult.

A key aspect of NFTs is smart contracts. These are self-executing pieces of code that live on the blockchain, which define the rules and properties of each NFT, including ownership rights, royalties for creators and transferability. When someone buys or sells an NFT, the smart contract automatically updates the ownership record on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. 

This element is what makes NFT transactions efficient, because there is no need to trust your counterparty or involve contract mediators.

Creating an NFT is known as minting. The minting process involves uploading a digital file (such as a piece of artwork, video or music) to an NFT platform, which then generates a token linked to that file. The token's information, including the creator's name, description and a secure link to the content is then encoded onto the blockchain via a smart contract. 

Once minted, the NFT becomes a permanent part of the blockchain, where it can be bought, sold or traded on compatible marketplaces. NFTs are typically stored in digital wallets that support NFT standards (like ERC-721 or ERC-1155). These wallets allow users to view, manage and transfer their NFTs securely.



NFTs are designed to establish ownership of a digital asset in a way that's verifiable, transparent and secure. Before NFTs, digital files (from images to videos and music) could be copied endlessly without any way to prove who owned the original version. NFTs solve this issue by assigning ownership rights to the original assets.

Another key purpose of NFTs is to create scarcity in the digital world. Each NFT is non-fungible, meaning it's completely unique and cannot be replaced with another. This scarcity is encoded directly into the token's metadata, which can make it valuable to collectors and creators. For example, a digital artist could decide to mint only 10 versions of a rare artwork, and buyers will know for certain they own one of just a few originals.

It's also worth noting that every transaction involving an NFT is recorded on the blockchain, creating a permanent, almost tamper-proof history of who created it, who has owned it and when it was transferred. This helps to reduce fraud, as anyone can verify an NFT's origin and ownership record whenever they choose.



NFTs sport a wide range of advantages, stemming from the core features of blockchain technology and smart contracts: 

NFTs provide a secure and verifiable way to claim ownership of digital assets. Whether it's artwork, music, virtual land or collectibles, NFTs ensure that users truly ‘own' their digital items. This ownership is recorded on the blockchain, meaning it cannot easily be tampered with.

Every NFT transaction is logged on a blockchain, which acts as a transparent public ledger. This means anyone can trace the ownership history of an NFT, view its metadata and verify its authenticity. 

NFTs have opened up new investment opportunities in the digital world. Rare and desirable NFTs can appreciate in value over time, while marketplaces also allow for fractional ownership, alongside staking and lending, using your NFTs as collateral.

Smart contracts let creators embed automatic royalty terms into their NFTs. This means that every time the NFT is resold on a secondary market, the original creator receives a percentage of the sale. This revenue model empowers artists, musicians and developers to earn recurring income and maintain control over their digital work.



NFTs come in many forms. Some of the most well-known NFT art collections include CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and NBA Top Shot.

CryptoPunks were among the first major NFT projects, consisting of 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel art characters minted on the Ethereum blockchain. They quickly became digital status symbols and are considered pioneers of NFT art culture. Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular collection, features cartoon ape avatars with different traits. 

These NFTs also act as membership passes to exclusive events and online communities. For example, NBA Top Shot offers officially licensed basketball highlight clips as NFTs, allowing fans to own iconic in-game moments.

NFTs can be grouped into several main categories:

Arguably, use cases are, in practice, only limited by your creativity.



Buying NFTs is easier than ever, especially with Crypto.com, as we prioritise security and simplicity. Here's how to easily buy, sell and store NFTs securely in the Crypto.com app:

Crypto.com's platform is designed with security and ease of use in mind. With multi-layer authentication and a streamlined buying process, it's one of the simplest ways to enter the NFT space.



Selling NFTs is also a straightforward process with Crypto.com. Here's how to list and sell your NFTs:



NFTs and cryptocurrencies are closely connected through blockchain technology. Most NFTs are created and traded on blockchain networks like Ethereum, which pioneered the development of NFTs using standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Other blockchains, including Cronos, also support NFTs, offering different features (for example, lower fees or faster transactions).

Cryptocurrencies play a vital role in NFT transactions. When buying or selling an NFT, you usually pay with the blockchain's native cryptocurrency – for example, Ether on Ethereum or Cronos on the Cronos network. These cryptocurrencies are used to pay for the NFT itself but critically, also for any associated transaction (gas) fees, which cover the cost of processing and recording the transaction on the blockchain.

Because NFTs and cryptocurrencies share the same underlying technology, owning cryptocurrency is a requirement of participating in the NFT marketplace. 



NFTs can be traced back to 2014 with the creation of Quantum by artist Kevin McCoy on the Namecoin blockchain. NFT adoption continued to grow with the launch of the Ethereum blockchain in 2015, because its programmable smart contracts made NFTs much more accessible, laying the foundation for their widespread adoption.

The NFT space began gaining real traction in 2017 with the release of CryptoPunks by Larva Labs and CryptoKitties, a viral blockchain-based game that allowed users to breed and trade digital cats. NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible emerged between 2018 and 2019, providing platforms for users to buy and sell NFTs with ease. 

The wider NFT market experienced explosive growth during the pandemic years as high-profile artists, celebrities and global brands entered the space. One of the most famous moments was digital artist Beeple's sale of an NFT for $69 million at Christie's auction, which solidified NFTs' position in the traditional art world. 

In 2025, the market is still maturing, with a shift toward NFTs with utility, including virtual real estate, gaming assets and tokens tied to real-world benefits. 

You can browse popular NFT collections and digital art.



Anyone can create their own NFT by following a process called minting, which involves turning a digital file – like art, music or video – into a unique token on a blockchain. Minting registers your digital asset on the blockchain, proving your ownership and making it available for sale or trade.

The minting process usually starts by selecting a platform that supports NFT creation. Popular platforms including Crypto.com, OpenSea, Rarible and Foundation provide easy-to-use tools for minting NFTs without requiring significant technical knowledge. On Crypto.com, for example, users can upload their digital files, add details like title, description and royalties, then mint their NFT directly on supported blockchains such as Ethereum or Cronos.

Once minted, your NFT is stored in your digital wallet, where you can choose to keep it, list it for sale on a marketplace or transfer it to others. Minting fees may apply depending on the blockchain's current activity, so it's a good idea to check estimated costs before proceeding.

Creating NFTs opens opportunities for artists, musicians, writers and creators worldwide to monetise their work, reach new audiences and maintain control over their creations. 

If you want to create with us, simply head to Crypto.com/NFT and click ‘Create.' Not everybody is approved as a creator on our platform, and we may ask for concrete examples of your past experience, as well as the types of NFTs you wish to create on our platform. 

If approved, you can select any of Ethereum, Polygon, Cronos and Cronos POS Chains to mint your NFTs, up to a limit of 50 per week.



NFTs can be profitable, but their success depends on several factors. The value of an NFT is largely driven by rarity, demand, creator reputation and the overall popularity of the NFT category – such as art, collectibles or gaming assets. 

Just like physical creations, limited edition NFTs or those created by well-known artists tend to command higher prices. Additionally, NFTs tied to strong communities or projects with ongoing development and utility can increase in value over time.

However, profitability in NFTs is not guaranteed. The NFT market is highly speculative and can be volatile, with prices fluctuating dramatically. Some NFTs may see rapid appreciation, while others may lose value or struggle to sell. 

In addition, because NFTs exist as digital assets stored on blockchains, you are exposed to technical risks such as hacking or losing wallet access. There's also the market risk of illiquidity (a lack of buyers), alongside regulatory uncertainty.

Broken links are also a risk because the image or data is often stored off-chain on third-party servers, not directly on the blockchain. When these off-chain servers fail or are shut down, the NFT's associated media can become inaccessible.

On the plus side, NFT benefits go beyond simple resale value. Creators can earn royalties on secondary sales, and investors can benefit from participating in emerging virtual economies, gaming ecosystems and collectible markets.

Get started today and be part of the digital collectibles revolution.



Fungible and non-fungible assets differ in their interchangeability. Fungible assets are identical and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis without any difference in value. For example, one Bitcoin is always equal in value to another Bitcoin, and a $10 bill holds the same value as another $10 bill. 

These assets are uniform and divisible.

Non-fungible assets, on the other hand, are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis because each has distinct characteristics or value. NFTs are non-fungible assets as they represent ownership of one-of-a-kind digital items like artwork, music or collectibles. 

No two NFTs are exactly alike, which makes each irreplaceable.

For clarity, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are fungible because each unit is the same as another. Meanwhile, a CryptoPunk NFT or a digital collectible card from a game is non-fungible because each has unique traits, provenance and value. 



NFTs are now evolving beyond digital art and collectibles into sectors like gaming, virtual real estate and tokenisation of physical assets. This expansion is being made possible by advancements in blockchain technology, such as Layer-2 solutions that enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs. 

In addition, the integration of NFTs with decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms allows for innovative financial products, including NFT-backed loans and fractional ownership, democratising access to high-value assets.

The NFT market is experiencing strong growth, with Technavio projections estimating a compound annual growth rate of 30.3% between 2025 and 2029. Key trends shaping this trajectory include:

Background and Motivation

ICOs have emerged as a vital fundraising tool for blockchain startups, which often struggle to secure traditional bank financing due to a lack of credit history. By pre-selling digital ""utility tokens"" that grant access to future platform services, these ventures can raise capital directly from the public. However, the products offered by these platforms are often novel, making their market demand highly unpredictable. Misjudging this demand can lead to significant losses or even platform failure, as seen in early ICOs like Tezos and DAO. In this context, China Finance Review International (CFRI) brings you an article titled ""A robust financing theory of ICOs under demand uncertainty of products of token platforms"". The study investigates a critical question: How should an entrepreneur design an ICO when they are fundamentally uncertain—or ""ambiguity-averse""—about the future demand for their product?

 

Methodology and Scope

The researchers developed a ""robust optimisation"" model to solve for the optimal ICO design. Unlike previous models that assume a known probability distribution for demand, this innovative approach incorporates ambiguity aversion—the entrepreneur's distrust of any single demand forecast. The model analyses how this aversion affects key decisions:

The study also provides a direct comparison between this robust ICO model and a traditional Venture Capital (VC) equity financing model under the same conditions of demand uncertainty.

 

Key Findings and Contributions

 

Why It Matters

This study makes a significant contribution by applying ambiguity aversion theory to ICOs for the first time. It moves beyond simple risk models to capture the more profound uncertainty faced by innovators in nascent markets. The findings help explain real-world phenomena, such as why projects with strong technological fundamentals and transparent information (which reduce ambiguity) tend to have higher token prices and greater success rates. The identification of an ""ambiguity premium"" provides a new lens for investors to assess token value.

Featuring ICO bassist Malachy Robinson on bass guitar, it culminates in a finale bursting with energy and groove.

“The percussion setup is a kind of hybrid drum set, because I wanted the feeling of groove that drums can give, as well as the colour of other percussion,” explained composer Ronan Guilfoyle. “The strings are far from bystanders, they interact constantly, providing colour, counterpoint and intrigue throughout.”

“Having the brilliance of the ICO made it a joy to explore these possibilities.”

Balancing new and familiar worlds, the programme opens with Purcell's beloved Abdelazer Suite, alive with Baroque elegance and vitality, before concluding with Dvorák's radiant Serenade for Strings, cherished for its warmth, melody, and joyful spirit.

THREE WORLDS captures the ICO's signature blend of bold programming and virtuosic performance in one vibrant evening of music-making.

Sanjay Malhotra, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has called on central banks across the globe to prioritize and support central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) rather than stablecoins, for faster and safer cross-border payments. Addressing the annual meeting of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, Malhotra cautioned that the worldwide advantages of CBDCs will be restricted if other countries do not move quickly to implement them.

“Unless other countries also adopt CBDC, we are not going to see the benefits of CBDC insofar as cross-border payments are concerned. So, I urge all those present from central banks and other jurisdictions that we need to promote the CBDC because this has huge advantages over stablecoins,” he said.

“Stablecoins, which is one of the better forms of crypto, has huge promise for asset tokenization, but it falls short of the requirements as a mainstay for monetary systems. And so, we believe that it is CBDC and not crypto because it has huge implications for monetary policy, for controls that we have on the capital account. It has implications for money laundering, and so we would rather promote CBDC rather than any other form of crypto because CBDC has all the advantages…,” Malhotra explained while referring to the BIS annual economic report of 2025.

According to the RBI chief, CBDC is fiat with all the advantages of a stablecoin. It can be tokenized and can reduce the costs involved in cross-border payments. A CBDC also enjoys the advantages of singleness and the integrity of money.

“In India, we are of the view that the CBDC is the answer for cross-border payments…so all of us need to promote that. Only then we'll be able to actually roll it out at a large scale,” he added.

The RBI recently announced plans to tokenize financial assets and settlements through its wholesale CBDC. The decision is based on promising initial outcomes from pilot programs involving the issuance of Certificates of Deposit (CDs), which have shown potential to improve market efficiency. A CD is a fixed-income financial instrument regulated by the RBI.

RBI started its first CBDC pilot in the wholesale segment on November 1, 2022, to settle secondary market transactions in government securities. The pilot began with nine banks—State Bank of India (NASDAQ: SBKFF), Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank (NASDAQ: HDB), ICICI Bank (NASDAQ: IBN), Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank, and HSBC (NASDAQ: HSBC).

The retail CBDC pilot started on December 1, 2022, and users were able to transact through a digital wallet offered by the participating banks and stored on mobile phones or devices.

Currently, India has about seven million CBDC users and is in no rush for a full rollout of the e-rupee. While India's retail CBDC pilot is examining its use as cash or currency, the wholesale CBDC is testing the settlement among banks.

CBDC for cross-border; UPI powers domestic payments

While Malhotra emphasized that CBDC is ideal for cross-border payments, he was quick to reiterate that domestic payments in India do not need CBDC or stablecoins, because the economy already has cheap, instantaneous, and convenient payment systems at home.










“In India, domestic payments is not an issue. So to that extent we do not need a CBDC or a stablecoin for local payments. We have a very efficient payment system domestically which is very cheap, very fast…So the CBDC really is for cross-border payments,” Malhotra said.

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has transformed the payments landscape, enabling the transfer of payments in real time and efficiently from one account to another across banks. Nearly 85% of digital payments in India are processed using UPI, with approximately 20 billion transactions occurring each month, amounting to a total value of more than $280 billion.

“UPI is a powerful catalyst, accelerating financial inclusion. Small vendors and micro enterprises can now accept payments digitally, and build financial history, thereby enabling access to formal credit at much lower costs,” Malhotra said.

“There are other benefits, too. A recent research study on the impact of UPI suggests that higher UPI adoption is associated with lower cash demand. Another study shows that a one percent increase in UPI transaction volumes correlates with a 0.03 percent increase in GDP growth,” Malhotra pointed out.

For collaboration in digital payments, Malhotra informed that the RBI has adopted three strategic approaches. One, the central bank is linking UPI with fast payment systems of other countries for cross-border remittances.

“Linkage between India and Singapore (UPI-PayNow) is live. Work is under progress with a few other countries bilaterally as well as multilaterally,” he informed.

Second, RBI is enabling cross-border merchant (P2M) payments through UPI using QR codes at merchant locations in both offline and e-commerce modes. This functionality has already been launched in several countries, with efforts underway to expand it to additional markets.

Third, the RBI is assisting partner nations in establishing UPI-style sovereign payment systems or enhancing their existing infrastructures using the UPI technology framework, with agreements already in place for implementation in a few more countries, Malhotra informed.

UPI's global expansion is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and is already live in eight countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Qatar, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, France, and Mauritius, with Canada likely to be considered next.

“These efforts will also promote cross-border trade and payments, while encouraging efficiency, improving customer experience, and reducing cost,” Malhotra added.

Hong Kong authorities have charged 16 people, including influencer and former lawyer Joseph Lam Chok, over their alleged involvement in the $205 million (HK$1.6 billion) JPEX crypto fraud.

The suspects were accused of fraud, conspiracy to defraud, and money laundering under Hong Kong's anti-money-laundering law after a two-year investigation into the unlicensed exchange, according to a report from South China Morning Post.

Police said more than 2,700 investors were defrauded through JPEX's network of social media promoters and retail crypto shops, which funneled deposits into the unlicensed platform.

Lam was among several influencers arrested in September 2023 after promoting JPEX to his social media followers. His arrest came shortly after the Securities and Futures Commission warned that JPEX was unlicensed and misleading investors, prompting police to launch a fraud probe as users reported frozen withdrawals.

Investigators have since made more than 80 arrests since 2023, seizing $28 million (HK$228 million) in assets and securing Interpol red notices for three suspected ringleaders who remain at large, per SCMP.

The JPEX case is a “straightforward” one, with section 53ZRG of Hong Kong's anti-money laundering ordinance AMLO leaving “no ambiguity,” Joshua Chu, lawyer, lecturer, and co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association, told Decrypt.

“KOLs who repeatedly promoted false claims about JPEX being safe and have backings of regulatory licenses, despite explicit warnings from the SFC, expose themselves to liability whether they actively knew those claims were false or simply failed to perform basic due diligence,” Chu explained.

Days after getting released on bail in 2023, Lam reportedly held a press conference where he told reporters he had “slept well.”

Looking back, the remark “reflects not only a stark lack of contrition or empathy to those adversely affected, but also raises questions about the diligence of his legal advisors,” Chu said, noting that the “public demonstration of indifference” may weigh in how the court assesses Lam's culpability, and may “severely undercut any hope for mitigation at sentencing.”

Such “tactical missteps” for Lam's defense have piled up, such that they have failed “to initiate any meaningful engagement with the authorities,” before being formally charged, Chu opined.

That “silence and inaction” had also “deprived victims of potential avenues for meaningful redress,” he added.

Still, the JPEX prosecution is “only the tip of the iceberg,” Chu said, citing “multiple layers of transactions still under scrutiny“ with a deeper and more complex network of perpetrators yet to be uncovered.

For now, it's the victims that face a harsh reality.

Recovery for the losses “will depend not merely on these criminal convictions, but on tracing asset flows,” Chu explained. “The best chance for meaningful compensation still lies in tying claims directly to the main platform assets, rather than the more dispersed proceeds and indirect holdings in the hands of KOLs.”

While dollar-backed stablecoins continue their stranglehold on the global market—commanding 99% of the $286 billion sector—Japan just made a move that could finally give Asia its own digital currency heavyweight.

Tokyo-based fintech startup JPYC launched the world's first fully regulated yen-pegged stablecoin on Oct. 27, marking what could be a turning point for investors tired of depending solely on U.S. dollar-denominated digital assets in an increasingly multipolar financial world.

The JPYC stablecoin maintains a strict 1:1 peg with the Japanese yen and operates under Japan's Payment Services Act, backed by domestic savings and Japanese government bonds. But what sets this apart from similar experiments in South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere across Asia is simple: the yen is freely convertible globally.

That matters because China, South Korea and Taiwan have all considered stablecoin projects, but their currencies face restrictions that limit international circulation. The yen doesn't have that problem—it's the world's third-most-traded currency and accounts for nearly 17% of global foreign exchange transactions, according to Reuters.

“We hope to spur innovation by giving startups access to low transaction and settlement fees,” CEO Noritaka Okabe told Reuters.

JPYC plans to issue 10 trillion yen ($64.9 billion) worth of the stablecoin over three years and won't charge transaction fees initially. Instead, the company will generate revenue from interest earned on its holdings of Japanese government bonds—a sustainable model given that JGBs are currently yielding more than 3% at the long end, reported Reuters.

Here's where things get interesting for traders: the USD/JPY currency pair is one of the most actively traded worldwide, with the U.S. dollar involved in 89% of all trades and the Japanese yen featured in 16.85%, according to Reuters.

With both the U.S. and Japan now regulating fiat-pegged stablecoins, there's potential for a thriving on-chain USD/JPY market pairing dollar- and yen-pegged stablecoins on decentralized exchanges. That could reduce transaction costs and settlement times for the hundreds of billions of dollars traded daily in this currency pair.

The timing couldn't be better. Strong backing from U.S. President Donald Trump has helped dollar-pegged stablecoins surge, creating a mature ecosystem that a yen stablecoin could plug into rather than compete against.

The central bank hopes to roll out the digital currency by 2029, with a hearing scheduled for Wednesday (Nov. 5) on the project. But as the Financial Times (FT) reported, a group of 14 banks issued a statement ahead of that hearing warning that a digital euro could subvert private-sector payment systems.

These banks last year launched Wero, a digital wallet designed to function as a rival to American companies like Mastercard, PayPal and Visa.

“The current design of the retail digital euro largely addresses the same use cases as private solutions, without offering any clear added value for consumers,” the banks said ahead of Wednesday's hearing.

The FT added that Fernando Navarrete, a conservative minister from Spain tapped by the EU parliament to study the digital euro, has lobbied for a much smaller version of the project.

The European Central Bank (ECB) began studying the possibility of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in 2020. Last week, its governing council said it hoped to launch the first digital euros in 2029, testing the coins during 2027.

Under the law, the ECB can only issue physical cash rather than digital tokens, meaning the project can only advance with the blessing of EU governments and its parliament, the FT said.

A sharp drop in the use of cash and the dominance of American payments providers creates the need for the digital euro to protect “our freedom, autonomy and security,” ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone said in September. 

The share of cash used in stores dropped from 72% to 52% in the five years to 2024, the report added. The digital euro has received a boost from the surge in dollar-backed stablecoins, which many in Europe feel could threaten the euro's status.

Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Federal Reserve has studied the idea of a CBDC but has made no commitments to develop or pilot a retail version of the coin, PYMNTS reported in July.

“Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently said that such a move would need clear support from the executive branch as well as authorization from Congress,” the report said. “That position may be politically prudent, but it also reflects a gridlock… Still, the political momentum favors stablecoins, not central banks. A U.S. CBDC would represent a public alternative to the privately-issued stablecoin solutions promoted by the crypto industry.”

The world of tech is always evolving and expanding to accommodate new innovations. In the last decade, one of the most impressive has undoubtedly been cryptocurrency. While the asset class was initially dismissed by some critics, it has, nevertheless, become a prominent fixture in the worlds of finance, sports, leisure, and many more.

Simply looking at the returns that major cryptocurrencies continue to bring in has made them very attractive to investors as a whole. But what about traditional tech founders? The good news is that there are several routes for techies to get involved in the crypto industry, some of which are as follows: 

The cryptocurrency industry has no shortage of tokens you can invest in. In fact, at any given point, there are tens of thousands of tokens floating about, and many of them have high growth potential. No matter if you favor meme coins or utility tokens, there's a myriad of cryptocurrencies you can buy off exchanges, peer-to-peer platforms, and much more to invest in.

A look at the 13 next crypto coins to explode shows that nearly every type of network is included, whether it's Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work. Investing in cryptocurrency is similar to buying stock. Essentially, you buy your token at a certain price with the expectation that it will increase in value, and you can literally sell for a profit. Several factors affect how it will perform in the market, but with the research, you should find some good options.

While some prefer to buy tokens that are already in the market, others would rather become early investors. A presale refers to a private or public sale of a crypto token before it is formally listed on exchanges and open to the general public. Presale tokens are sold at a lower price than they will be listed on exchanges, and the funds raised from the sales are used to support the ecosystem. This is a major advantage of investing at the presale level, as buying the tokens cheaper from the beginning means that your profit margin will be even larger if it succeeds in the market.

For tech investors looking to get into crypto, presales are often a good option, as there is heavy emphasis on the use cases and why they will be valuable once they hit the market. Of course, you'll still need to do your research to avoid falling for scam presales or simply underperforming ones.

While you might be interested in investing in other people's tokens, it might also benefit you to create your own. As we've said, there are tens of thousands of tokens in the market, and all of these were created by entrepreneurs who believed in a specific vision. If this sounds like you, you could always put out your own crypto token into the market. Some level of work will be involved in this, including designing the tokenomics, developing the blockchain itself, if needed, issuing the token, marketing it, and much more.

While there are numerous tools that make this process easier, such as platforms that automatically mint tokens, you also need to identify a practical use case and push for it to succeed in the market. If you are able to do this, however, it can be very financially rewarding. Some of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto industry are those who have successfully launched cryptocurrencies, and this is worth considering.

Staking offers a more hands-off approach to earning money from cryptocurrency, as it involves minimal risk and effort. This applies only to tokens like Ethereum and Solana, which are based on a Proof-of-Stake consensus, and refers to the process of locking away your tokens within the network for a specified period. The tokens will then be used to validate transactions across the network, and in return, you receive a percentage of interest.

Typically, staking will give you between 1% and 3% interest, and while it is not the dramatic profits you might get with speculative trading, there's virtually zero risk for doing this. For those new to cryptocurrency or those more risk-averse, staking offers an option.

Crypto mining is similar in a way to staking. That is the process through which new tokens are brought into existence. This applies to Proof-of-Work tokens like Bitcoin and refers to the use of specialised computer equipment to conduct complex mathematical puzzles. This is how transactions across a blockchain are confirmed, and it is essential in keeping the ecosystem alive. 

Mining cryptocurrency is a very energy-intensive process, and depending on the token you are mining, it can be quite expensive. But if you are able to pull it off while still staying on budget, you can end up with a healthy stash of tokens that can net you a profit.

The demand for cryptocurrency means that more people are looking to borrow tokens for various purposes, and this can act as a semi-passive source of income. If you already have any cryptocurrency lying about, you can list it on various lending platforms for others to borrow. In exchange for borrowing the tokens, the users will have to pay a percentage in collateral, and smart contracts enforce all this. This means that if they default, the collateral will be automatically collected, and this reduces the risk associated. Several lending platforms have emerged to meet this need, and tech enthusiasts looking to get into crypto should consider them.

Directly engaging with cryptocurrency is not the only way you can make money from it. The boom of the crypto industry means that there's more demand for adjacent services, such as mining, crypto exchanges, tax accounting, storage, and much more. As a tech investor, you might choose to invest in one of these services, and rather than investing in crypto yourself, you can serve existing crypto investors. This could involve building an exchange or investing in one, establishing a firm for crypto-related custody solutions, and more.

The crypto industry is chock-full of opportunities for techies, looking to expand their portfolios. Whether you want to buy into existing crypto projects, create your own, start up adjacent businesses, and much more, there's space for you in the industry.

I think we're at the start of something big in digital assets. The early-stage opportunities are changing fast, and 2025 is a key time for smart investors.

This year is different from before. We're seeing new tech and project ideas. The chance for big gains is higher than ever for those who plan well.

Finding good projects early needs careful study and timing. Smart investors know that getting in early is best. They look for real innovation and lasting value.

This way of investing in crypto needs both knowledge and instinct. I've seen how the market rewards those who do their homework and act fast. The new wave brings chances we've never seen before.

The 2025 crypto presale landscape is unlike anything we've seen before. It combines market maturity, clear regulations, and new tech. This mix makes it a great time for early investors to see big returns.

Investing early in a token sale has big perks. Early birds get tokens at lower prices than later investors. This can lead to  returns when the project launches.

Early investors also get special access to project updates and beta tests. They often get to vote on project decisions. This deepens their connection to the ecosystem.

Early investors have a big say in project development. Their feedback shapes the project. This teamwork benefits everyone involved.

The 2025 presale scene is much different from earlier times. Now, only solid projects make it through. This means better investment choices for early adopters.

Regulations have improved, making investments safer. No more worries about unclear rules. This stability keeps innovation alive while protecting investors.

New tech has made presales more secure. Smart contracts and better security are now standard. This makes the 2025 scene safer and more reliable.

All these changes make 2025 a prime time for early investors. While risks exist, the rewards are worth it for those who know what they're doing.

Super Pepe is a unique blend of meme culture and blockchain technology. It turns digital collectibles into something more than just jokes. Each token has real value, making it a new kind of digital asset.

Super Pepe uses the latest blockchain tech to change how we see digital collectibles. It's different from other meme coins because it has:

These features make sure Super Pepe tokens are both fun to collect and useful.

Super Pepe's economic model avoids the quick inflation seen in some meme coins. It has:

This model helps the project grow steadily, unlike many other schemes.

The project puts a big focus on the community. It does this through:

This community focus helps build a strong base for lasting value in these digital assets.

Super Pepe stands out for several reasons:

These advantages make Super Pepe a top choice in the current presale market.

Solargy brings a new way to access solar energy. It's a big change in how we use renewable energy. This project is all about making clean energy available to everyone.

Solargy wants to make energy production fair for everyone. It uses blockchain to help communities around the world use solar energy. This way, everyone can get clean power, no matter where they are or how much money they have.

Users get energy credits that let them use clean power without spending a lot of money. This makes it easier for people to start using solar energy.

Solargy uses special technology to catch solar energy. It has a network of solar panels that turn energy into digital assets. People can use or trade these assets.

The smart contract system makes sure energy credits are given out fairly. It looks at how much energy is made and used. This makes sure everyone has access to energy.

There are systems that check how well the energy is being used. This helps make sure we're using energy in the best way possible.

Solargy helps the planet by making more people use renewable energy. Every person who joins helps cut down on carbon emissions.

It's not just about making money. Solargy helps make the world a better place. People can live better lives and help the planet at the same time.

Using less energy and being more independent are big wins. Communities can also handle energy price changes better.

Solargy is special because it cares about the planet and making money. It's not just about making money like some other projects. It actually does something useful.

It uses blockchain in a new way. This gives people a chance to save money and maybe even make more money.

Solargy's presale is more than just a chance to make money. It's about being part of a big change in how we use energy. It has real value and ways to make money.

Solargy is a unique chance to use blockchain for energy. It's a mix of new tech and caring for the planet. It's a big step forward.

Super Pepe and Solargy are top picks for Presale Crypto 2025. But, other projects also offer great value. They bring unique features that add to the leading presales.

For a balanced portfolio, these options are worth exploring. Each project has special abilities for decentralized finance.

TechFlow combines AI with blockchain for smarter contracts. It uses machine learning to improve transaction efficiency.

Its tools help users make informed decisions in decentralized finance. The AI adjusts contract settings based on market changes.

While TechFlow is technologically advanced, it doesn't offer the same immediate benefits as Super Pepe or Solargy.

GreenChain tackles blockchain's environmental issues with new consensus methods. It uses less energy than traditional systems.

Its green protocols make blockchain more sustainable. GreenChain shows the shift towards eco-friendly crypto projects.

GreenChain's focus on sustainability is admirable. Yet, Solargy's direct link to solar energy has a bigger real-world effect. Both aim to make blockchain greener but in different ways.

These presales offer interesting alternatives for investors. But, Super Pepe and Solargy stand out for Presale Crypto 2025. They have stronger market positions and clearer uses.



Presale Crypto 2025 is a big chance for smart investors. The projects shown are the next big thing in blockchain.

Super Pepe is special because it mixes meme culture with real use. It makes digital collectibles that hold value for a long time.

Solargy tackles big energy problems with blockchain. It shows how digital assets can make a real difference.

Getting in early on these presales has big benefits. Always do your homework before investing in crypto.

The 2025 presale scene has many choices for a well-rounded digital asset portfolio. Both new and well-known projects offer something unique.

Choosing the right spot now could lead to big gains as these techs grow. This cycle is all about combining new ideas with practical uses.

Presale Crypto 2025 is a list of early token sales and initial coin offerings for 2025. It's a key moment for smart investors. It lets them get into new blockchain projects early, often at lower prices and with big return possibilities.

Super Pepe blends viral memes with real tech use. It changes digital collectibles with smart contracts and community rules. It's made to grow value over time, not just for quick gains.

Solargy is unique because it uses blockchain for free solar energy. It's a smart way to use tech for solar power. It also offers a way to invest in green energy and earn rewards.

Yes, the 2025 presale scene has better rules and more big investors. This makes it safer for early investors. But, it keeps the chance for big growth that comes with new blockchain projects.

To join, connect your wallet to sites like superpepe.io and follow their sale steps. Always do your homework: check the whitepaper, team, tech, and community before investing.

Presales have risks like project failure, rule changes, and market ups and downs. I suggest spreading out your investments, only put in what you can lose, and research each project well before investing.

While bitcoin's BTC$103,999.48 decline below $100,000 yesterday was of significant symbolic importance, it's the $95,000 level which could prove key, according to James Check, or Checkmate, as he's known in the online world.

Nearly 57% of all dollars invested in bitcoin are now underwater at the $100,000 level, according to Check, helping to explain the current deep fear in markets. However, said Check, losses right now sit at roughly $20 billion, or 3% of bitcoin's market cap. Previous price dips in 2024 and earlier this year saw losses relative to market cap reach the 7%-8% level.

A decline to $95,000, though, brings losses closer to the 10% area, which, said Check, marks the point when historical bear markets tend to get going.

""The current market conditions are some of the hardest to read in my experience,"" Check continued. ""We don't want to see the price fall below $95,000, but I also expect the bulls to mount one hell of a fight to defend it.""

Speaking of deep fear, Coinglass' Fear & Greed Index has slumped just into the ""Extreme Fear"" range at the 24 level. Readings of Extreme Fear have, on occasion, been associated with at least short-term bottoms in bitcoin. For comparison, the gauge dropped as low as 21 during April's tariff panic in which bitcoin tumbled to $75,000.

Contrarian bulls might be taking some heart as at least one well-followed analyst is throwing in towel on his hefty year-end price target for bitcoin BTC$103,999.48.

""While bitcoin's structural investment case remains strong, cyclical dynamics have evolved,"" Alex Thorn, head of research at Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital, wrote in a Wednesday morning note to clients.

Taking note of whale distribution, fading interest in BTC-adjacent investments, rotation to competing investment narratives like gold, artificial intelligence (AI) and stablecoins and treasury company ""malaise"" as contributing to headwinds, Thorn slashed his year-end price target for bitcoin to $120,000 from $185,000.

At least two other analysts were a tad more constructive. ""There is no need to get too bearish on BTC at this point,"" said Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree. The $100,000 level has the potential to be a major support level, as it has been tested multiple occasions, he said, but ""bad things can happen, so we shouldn't count on it.""

Morris added that BTC, now barely in the green for 2025, currently is ""in no way overbought and is underhyped,"" hinting at cautious optimism for potential upside once stability returns.

Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick, meanwhile, saw opportunity in the volatility. ""The dip below 100,000 overnight well may be the last one ever,' he wrote in a Wednesday note. Kendrick laid a phased dip-buying approach: pick up 25% of a target position now, another 25% if BTC manages to close above $103,000 on Friday, and the final 50% of the allocation if the BTC-gold price ratio moves back above 30, currently at 26.

Bitcoin BTC$103,999.48 staged a modest bounce above $103,000 by early U.S. morning hours on Wednesday, recovering some of the losses from Tuesday's steep selloff that pushed prices below $99,000 for the first time since June.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3,436.41 rebounded almost 10% from Tuesday's low, when forced liquidations dragged the price to just above $3,000. The second-largest crypto traded at $3,340, up 10% from its worst levels Tuesday, but still down 6% over a 24-hour timeframe.

The fastest horses among altcoins were decentralized exchange token HYPE$41.62 and privacy-focused Zcash ZEC$488.42, leading the bounce with 6% and 10% gains, respectively.

Crypto-related equities opened the session with tepid gains after yesterday's major losses. Among the gainers was Coinbase (COIN), up 1.9% and Strategy (MSTR), ahead 1.4%.

Astronomers Are Agog over This All-Day Gamma-Ray Burst

A cosmic explosion known as GRB 250702B is by far the longest gamma-ray burst astronomers have ever seen—if it's even one at all

By Yvette Cendes edited by Lee Billings

You might think astronomers have seen it all, but the universe still throws us occasional new mysteries to keep us on our toes.

On July 2, 2025, observers around the world were alerted to a new gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 250702B, detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. GRBs are extremely energetic explosions that rank among the most powerful astrophysical events in the universe, so luminous they can be seen from billions of light-years away. They're most commonly caused by either a merging pair of neutron stars or a very massive star ending its life in a supernova called a collapsar; in both of these “classical” cases, the resulting stellar cataclysm can spit out a giant, tightly focused jet of radiation and particles. When one of these jets is pointed directly at our solar system, we see it as a GRB.

They aren't that unusual to spot—the universe is so big and GRBs are so bright that astronomers see one or two a day on average. Even so, we soon realized something very unusual was happening with GRB 250702B. In the roughly half century of GRB studies, no one has ever seen one of these epic events last more than a few hours at most. Yet almost a full day elapsed before GRB 250702B faded away.

“The most surprising thing about this event is the duration of the emission. If it came from a GRB, it's the longest one ever detected,” explains Adelle Goodwin, an astronomer at Curtin University in Australia, who is leading follow-up radio observations with the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Another oddity was that this GRB seemed to repeat, with astronomers seeing what appeared to be three distinct pulses across its nearly day-long duration; repetition would be strange because GRBs are normally so catastrophic that they effectively destroy their astrophysical sources, preventing any recurrence. Confronted with an enigma, scientists around the world scrambled to point every telescope they could at GRB 250702B to gather more clues.

Astronomers are not ones to shy away from a challenge, but GRB 250702B has provided us with several. First, its on-sky location fell within the star-and-dust-packed galactic plane of the Milky Way, making its true cosmic origins unclear; odds were that it occurred in some distant part of the universe, with its source obscured by dust, but in principle, whatever created the burst could have been inside our galaxy. Luckily, the James Webb Space Telescope was designed to peer through all that dust, allowing a team of researchers to reveal the truth in a recent preprint. GRB 250702B's still-mysterious origins trace back to a galaxy more than five billion light-years away from us. What's more, the galaxy itself is unusual: it's extremely large and dusty compared to most other galaxies and in fact is the biggest and brightest GRB-hosting galaxy anyone has ever seen. Astronomers can't yet say with certainty, but an unusual GRB coming from an unusual galaxy might be a clue in itself on what actually caused the explosion.

Of course, this is the real question behind GRB 250702B: What caused it? Theorists presently offer two main possibilities. This very odd GRB could have arisen from a particularly unusual collapse of a massive star that launched an abnormally energetic jet, or instead it could have come from a tidal disruption event (TDE) in which a white dwarf star was ripped apart and devoured by an intermediate-mass black hole weighing on the order of 100,000 solar masses. “The duration of GRB emission cannot be explained by classical collapsar scenarios, which means more exotic scenarios need to be invoked,” Goodwin explains.

I recently attended this year's meeting of the American Astronomical Society's High-Energy Astrophysics Division (HEAD), presenting some of my own research on TDEs; suffice to say that speculation on GRB 250702B's origin dominated much of the informal sessions. “It's too long to be a GRB but not luminous enough to be a TDE at that distance,” one of my colleagues confidently argued. Others were more cautious, pointing out that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and said they felt that threshold was not yet met for GRB 250702B. One thing is for sure: nothing quite drives excitement in a crowd of astronomers like an unusual signal none of us has seen before. (Despite all that excitement, many astronomers unfortunately declined to comment on the record for this story, citing a forthcoming NASA press release on GRB 250702B that is stuck in limbo because of the ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown.)

There are, of course, even wilder possibilities—it may be that this event represents some fantastic and heretofore entirely unwitnessed phenomenon. For example, a recent preprint argued that GRB 250702B actually arose from a black hole that merged with a star. This event would be exceedingly rare but should happen on some occasions, such as if two stars are orbiting in a pair and a larger one explodes, leaving behind a black hole. Over time, the gravitational interactions would cause the remaining star and its black hole companion to spiral together, culminating with a spectacular merger that would unleash unprecedented astrophysical fireworks.

Whatever its origin, GRB 250702B is exceptional, and it could be the first direct evidence of an entirely new kind of gigantic space explosion. Astronomers are still busy unraveling the full picture of where this space oddity fits in our strange and exciting universe.

Why We Struggle to Say No—And How to Get Better at It

Why saying no is harder than it should be.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio 

Tara Moore/Getty Images; Illustration composite by Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

As children many of us are taught that being “good” means being obedient: doing what we're told by parents, teachers and authority figures. But that conditioning can make it incredibly difficult to speak up when we know something is wrong, whether that means correcting a mishandled coffee order or standing up against injustice. How can we learn to overcome these instincts when it really counts?

My guest today is Sunita Sah, a professor of management and organizations at Cornell University and the author of Defy: The Power of No in a World that Demands Yes. She thinks we could all stand to be a little more defiant, and she's here to tell us why.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Sunita Sah: It's wonderful to be here.

Feltman: So tell us a bit about your background. You know, what led you to studying defiance?

Sah: Ah, so this probably started way back in my childhood because as a child I was really known for being an obedient daughter and student. And I remember asking my dad when I was quite young, “What does my name mean?” And he told me that Sunita means “good” in Sanskrit, and I mainly lived up to that: I was obedient at home. I was agreeable at school. I did all of my homework. I went to school on time. I even got my hair cut the way my parents wanted me to.

And these were the messages that I received not just from parents but from teachers and the community: to be good. And what does that really mean? It means to do as you're told, to obey, to be obedient, to be compliant. And I really internalized a lot of those messages, and I think they're often messages that we give to children. You know, we like it when they're obedient, and then we call that as being really good.

And I ended up studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which was really due to expectations. And while I was there I did an intercalated degree in psychology, and I became fascinated by Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to authority and why we go to the extent of that amount of compliance and obedience even when we're causing harm, maybe even killing another person, with sort of dangerous electric shocks.

So that fascinated me, but I went back, and I finished my medical degree, and I worked as a junior doctor, and then I did some consulting work for the pharmaceutical industry. And during that time I became fascinated in how industry and the medical profession interact with each other, how they influence each other, how that affects physicians and then how that trickles down to sort of decisions patients are making.

And I wanted to study all of this in more depth, and so I was doing an executive M.B.A. at London Business School, and I talked to a few professors there. They said if you wanna look at ethical dilemmas, I have to go to the U.S. So I traveled to the U.S., and I did a Ph.D. in organizational behavior, and that got me down the track of really being able to spend my time researching and studying this and teaching about why people take bad advice.

So at first I looked in medicine, then the finance industry got interested, then the criminal justice industry, and then basically, in all interpersonal interactions we have, I found this pattern of compliance everywhere.

Feltman: And for listeners who might need a little refresher could you remind us what the Milgram experiments found?

Sah: So Stanley Milgram, he conducted his experiments in the early 1960s because he wanted to really investigate whether the Nazi refrain, “I was just following orders,” was a psychological reality or not. So he set up an experiment that basically was positioned as a learning or memory experiment and whether people would learn better if they were—received some kind of punishment, which were electric shocks.

So we had people come in, and they met someone who was actually an actor, and they were told that this person would be the learner, and they would be strapped into something like—that looked like an electric chair that was gonna give them some electric shocks.

Then the participant was led to another room, and they were told that they were the teacher, and they were sat in front of a machine that had different levers on it, which were labeled with different voltages. And the lower voltages, it started at 15 volts, and it went up in 15-volt increments, all the way up to 450 volts, which was labeled “XXX.” And in advance people, psychiatrists, predicted less than 1 percent would go up to 450 volts.

And what the teacher had to do was read out word pairs, and if the learner got something wrong, they had to pull the lever for the shocks and go up in these 15-bolt increments. No electric shocks were actually given, but the teacher believed that they would've been given. And what was found is that every single one pushed the lever for 150 volts, when the learner started saying to stop. Every single one pushed the lever at 300 volts, after which the learner was completely silent and said they would not continue. And [almost] 66 percent went up to 450 volts ...

Feltman: Wow.

Sah: And gave, yes, the most lethal shock.

So this was really shocking [laughs] to many people. And what fascinated me when I looked at the Milgram studies is that Milgram also described the participants as having some nervous laughter, asking questions, stuttering, sweating, and I recognized all of those signs as that these people actually were not “moral imbeciles,” as what Milgram described them, but they were trying to defy, they were trying to say no—they just didn't know how. They'd never been taught how to do it. And so they continued with what they were told to do by someone that looked like they were an authority figure, even though inside they felt torn.

Feltman: I think that does a really great job of illustrating what you are referring to in your work when you say, you know, compliance or defiance. But what makes it difficult for humans to be defiant when they know that it's important to be?

Sah: Yeah, well, we actively resist defiance, and even though the Milgram experiments were a long time ago we're still seeing things like this. When I started delving into this in my own research I saw such high levels of compliance with obviously bad advice.

So even in the simplest of experiments—like, you would give people a choice between two different lotteries, A or B, and it's obvious that lottery A is clearly superior; it's more than two times the expected value. More than 95 percent of people will choose it when given both options, but under certain circumstances—a stranger comes up to them and recommends that you take B—people start complying. And that compliance can be as high as 85 percent, even though they don't want to and they're less satisfied with their choice.

So why does this happen? Why do we find that, in another survey, nine out of 10 health care workers, most of them nurses, feel too uncomfortable to speak up when they see a colleague or a physician making an error. Why do we find these things?

There's three main reasons. First of all we feel enormous pressure to go along with other people, this social pressure. And one psychological process, which I can explain in a little bit, I call “insinuation anxiety” goes along with that.

The second reason is that we don't actually understand what compliance and defiance and consent actually are. Like, we conflate compliance and consent; we think they're the same thing. And they're not. And we don't really understand what defiance is; we think of it as something negative and compliance as something positive.

And then the third one is once we decide that we defy, or we think we should defy, we don't actually know how because we've been trained so much from a young age to be compliant, we don't have the skill set to be defiant. We don't know how to say no. We feel that is too confrontational.

So they're the three main reasons. So let me loop back to the first one again. Like, there's a lot of reasons why we'll feel pressure to go along with other people. We might think that we're gonna damage a relationship or lose our job. But one of the reasons I found is due to this very powerful psychological force that I call insinuation anxiety. And this is a distinct type of anxiety that we have when we become concerned that rejecting another person's order or suggestion gives them a signal that we don't trust them.

So like telling the experimenter in the Milgram experiment, who's wearing a lab coat, “We think you're doing the wrong thing; we think you might be killing this person,” is very difficult to do. Telling your boss that you don't think this is the right way to go is often very difficult for people to do. Even telling someone you're in a relationship with or a family member or a good friend that they're wrong or that they're incompetent or that they're untrustworthy is really hard. So we often experience this in many different situations, from at the doctor's to co-workers to close friends and even strangers, I've found in my experiments.

Feltman: So how can we overcome those instincts? What can we do about it?

Sah: One of the first things is to have a mindset shift about what defiance really means. So the Oxford English Dictionary defines defiance as challenging the power of another person openly and boldly, but I do think that definition is too narrow, and it doesn't really honor our agency.

My definition of defiance is simply acting in accordance with your true values, especially when there is pressure to do otherwise. So it doesn't need to be dramatic or loud or confrontational; it's just acting in a way that's aligned to who you want to be. And so it becomes this proactive positive force.

If we redefine defiance in this way, we move it from something negative, rare and risky to something positive and more accessible and meaningful and even prosocial. So defiance isn't just for the brave or the extraordinary. It's not about being loud or bold or violent or aggressive. It's none of those things. It's acting in alignment with your true values, and it is available and necessary for all of us.

The second step is to start practicing small, so start with small acts of defiance: correcting the wrong coffee order, you know? [Laughs.] A lot of us might not do that. Or telling your hairdresser to stop when they tell you to trust them with a new cut, right? So we can start in these small-stakes situations to build up this skill set.

But we really need to make this defiance a practice and see it not as a personality trait. And that practice starts long before a moment of crisis, when you really wish you had done the right thing or said the right thing. And so to do that we need to anticipate those situations, visualize it, even roll script so our ears get used to hearing defiant words, our mouth gets used to saying it, especially if you've been socialized to be compliant.

There's a wonderful quote that's often attributed to Bruce Lee—it actually comes from a Greek poet—that's really helpful here, that “under duress we don't rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our training.”

Feltman: Mm.

Sah: So we need to parent for defiance, too. Like, we need to parent our children not just for compliance but for defiance. And if we were socialized to be compliant, we need to start practicing.

Feltman: Yeah, what advice do you have for parents specifically? I think that's such an interesting way of looking at fostering defiance.

Sah: So the first thing that parents can do is definitely role-model defiance. Even though my parents were pretty compliant, and I saw them as, as very compliant—I really thought my mum, who did all the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, that this is what goodness is, until one day I saw her defy, when we were walking home from the grocery store and we were stopped by a group of teenage boys who blocked our path and yelled out, “Go back home!”

And that was the first time I saw her defy, when she just asked them simply, “What do you mean?” And they didn't answer. And she asked them again, you know, “What do you mean?” And there was just silence. And so she went, “Oh, yes, you think you're so clever—big, strong, tough boys, right?” And the boys didn't know what to do. They just looked at each other, and then they dispersed. And so it really worked in that sense: “I've got to know when and where to speak up.”

And then if we can ask our children, we can do values exercises with them: “What are our family values?” Because if we can do that and talk to our children about how to defy, then what I hope is that we will build a society where one day in that same alleyway one of the teenage boys is gonna speak up and turn to his friends and say, “That's not okay. Let them pass.”

And that's what I think we can build if we can get this skill set of being defiant. Because every single act of consent, of compliance, of dissent, that actually creates the society we live in. It affects our lives, our workplaces, our communities. And what I hope with my book and the work and the research that I've done is that I make defiance accessible to people that don't know how to use it.

ARFID Is More Than Picky Eating—And the Condition Is on the Rise

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or ARFID, can cause malnutrition and weight loss in children and adults even when body image is not a factor

By Caren Chesler edited by Lauren J. Young

Stella was eight years old when she stopped eating solid foods. She went from being a “foodie” to strictly consuming liquids, says Briana, Stella's mother. That diet soon became problematic for Stella, too: later, she removed chunks from her soup and struggled to drink smoothies that contained small seeds. She grew so afraid of swallowing that she'd spit out her saliva. “She said she had a fear of choking,” Briana says. (The last names of Stella and Briana have been withheld for privacy.)

In less than a month, Stella became so tired and malnourished that her parents took her to the hospital. Doctors put her on a feeding tube, and they were concerned that the rapid weight loss for her age might cause heart issues. Within 24 hours of being hospitalized, a psychologist diagnosed Stella with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or ARFID, a serious eating disorder that's become steadily more prevalent globally in recent years. Health care providers and psychologists are now trying to untangle ARFID's causes, signs and disconcerting rise.

Clinicians emphasize that ARFID is much more than a dislike of certain foods. It's developmentally normal for many kids to go through a picky eating phase between ages two and six. But ARFID presents as a food avoidance so persistent and pervasive that it can cause adults to drop below the minimum health body mass index, or BMI (a hotly debated measurement that links a person's weight to their height), or to lose so much weight that they experience symptoms of malnutrition, such as vitamin deficiencies, irregular menstrual cycles, low testosterone, hair loss, muscle loss and a constant feeling of being cold. In kids, drastic weight loss from ARFID can cause children to fall off standard U.S. growth charts for healthy development. Developmental issues linked to the loss in weight and calories often spur doctors to recommend supplemental nutritional intake.

“We're not just trying to treat kids who don't like broccoli. It's the kid who is malnourished as a result of their food choices,” says James Lock, a psychiatry professor and director of the Child and Adolescent Eating Disorder Program at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

ARFID was formally recognized as a feeding and eating disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013. That enabled clinicians to put a name to a condition that had been around but had gone undetected for some time.

“Probably there were people who had this syndrome, but they didn't really talk about it because there's a stigma around it,” says Jennifer Thomas, co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has treated people with ARFID.

Wider recognition of the condition is partly driving the recent increase in cases. Real-world data on ARFID cases are lacking, but some studies have reported a global prevalence ranging from 0.35 to 3 percent across all age groups. Certain countries and regions report much higher numbers: a recent study in the Netherlands, for example, found that among 2,862 children aged 10, 6.4 percent had ARFID. The eating disorder clinic that provided specialized care to Stella after she was hospitalized says it treated more than 1,000 people in the U.S. with ARFID in 2024—a 144 percent jump from 2023.

“I think that's one of the things that has made ARFID a challenging eating disorder [to diagnose]—because it is a lot of different things.” —Jessie Menzel, clinical psychologist

And the National Alliance for Eating Disorders has found that ARFID now accounts for up to 15 percent of all new eating disorder cases. People can experience ARFID at any age, although recently diagnosed cases have mostly been in children and teens. The average age of diagnosis is 11 years old, and 20 to 30 percent of cases are in boys—a higher percentage than other eating disorders, according to the alliance.

Unlike other eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, ARFID doesn't appear to be associated with body image. The problem—and seeming cause—is the food itself and the emotional and physiological response toward it.

People with ARFID generally fall into one or several of three categories. According to one study of adults with ARFID, 80 percent of respondents said they were uninterested in eating, 55 percent said they stay away from many foods because of sensory issues, and 31 percent said they avoid food because they are afraid of adverse consequences such as choking or vomiting. About two thirds of the participants were in more than one of these categories.

“I think that's one of the things that has made ARFID a challenging eating disorder [to diagnose]—because it is a lot of different things,” says Jessie Menzel, a clinical psychologist who treats the condition and other eating disorders.

There are some common signs that signal ARFID, however. In addition to significant weight loss and signs of malnutrition, ARFID's physical symptoms include gastrointestinal issues, low body temperature and the growth of a type of soft, fine body hair called lanugo that is typically not present after infancy. Behavioral changes include a lack of appetite, difficulty paying attention, food texture avoidance, extreme selective eating and a fear of vomiting or choking.

Although ARFID is classified as an eating disorder, it has a lot of overlap with mental health conditions. A 2022 metastudy found that among people diagnosed with ARFID, up to 72 percent had an anxiety disorder. Studies also suggest the uptick in ARFID cases may be tied to the overall increase in mental health conditions diagnosed in kids. ARFID is particularly pronounced in those who have an anxiety disorder, Thomas says. Her team's studies have found that about 30 to 40 percent of individuals with ARFID have a co-occurring anxiety disorder in their lifetime. “There are key similarities between ARFID and anxiety disorders,” although they are clinically distinct conditions, Thomas says. “Patients [with ARFID] themselves often describe feeling intense anxiety around food.”

Because ARFID and anxiety can be so closely intertwined, it can be difficult to identify one from the other. “Often families will tell us it's hard to get an [ARFID] diagnosis,” says Doreen Marshall, chief executive officer of the National Eating Disorders Association.

ARFID is typically flagged when a child veers from growth curves—charts recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics to assess a child's weight and height for their age. “If your lack of interest [in food] has led to your being a couple of standard deviations off your growth curve and you're not going to hit puberty or grow, that's a problem,” Lock says.

Pinpointing signs of ARFID is trickier when a child has nutritional deficits but is of average or higher body weight. Such discrepancies make it “important that pediatricians listen to parents,” Marshall says. Health care providers should ask parents to describe what they see their child eating or avoiding, she says.

Scientists don't fully understand what causes ARFID, although they believe that it's driven by a combination of genetic, environmental and neurobiological factors. Thomas is currently investigating the latter.

In a study published in JAMA Network Open in February, Thomas and her team presented 110 participants with photographs of food, household objects and blurred images and observed their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results revealed that the three different ARFID categories correspond to activation of different brain regions. When shown food images, those who fell into the fear-related ARFID category (participants who had a fear of choking, for example) showed hyperactivation of the amygdala, the brain's fear center. Participants with ARFID who were uninterested in food had lower activation of the hypothalamus, the brain's appetite-regulation region. People diagnosed with the sensory form of ARFID showed hyperactivation of the brain's sensory areas, such as the somatosensory cortex or the supplementary motor cortex.

“What we found is that there might be different neural circuitry associated with each of the three ARFID presentations,” Thomas says. Results from fMRI have known limitations involving reliability and reproducibility, however. Thomas says that these initial findings need to be replicated to understand if the differences in brain activity are a cause or link to ARFID types; her team is currently collecting data from adults with ARFID for a second study. In a separate 2023 study, her team found that people who lack interest in food experienced a loss of pleasure in a lot of things—a condition known as anhedonia—and that depression partly contributed. “Folks who have that lack-of-interest [version of] ARFID don't look forward to things in general, not just food,” she says.

Understanding the neurological activity involved in ARFID may help clinicians develop more targeted treatments. For now, practitioners rely largely on a treatment known as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has shown some success. A 2020 study co-authored by Thomas found that, post-CBT, 70 percent of those treated no longer met the criteria for ARFID. Another study published by Thomas and her colleagues in 2021 in the Journal of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy found similar results.

“With true ARFID, we don't see a lot of spontaneous remission,” Thomas says. “Recovering from ARFID takes hard work, either at home, making a concerted effort to try new foods, or with a supportive treatment provider.”

Most treatments for younger kids rely on parents to manage their child's eating habits. After a month at the hospital, doctors sent Stella home, and her parents were advised not to cater to Stella's limited palate. At home, the whole family, including Stella, ate the same meals. When they ate at restaurants, Stella didn't have to eat a big meal, but she did have to take a few bites of something solid. Within a few months, Stella's regular eating habits returned, and her ARFID disappeared.

Treatments based on controlling eating habits can only go so far, however. They are less effective for people with the types of ARFID that are associated with higher sensitivity to or a lack of interest in food. “I think that's where it's so important to understand what's happening physiologically or neurobiologically,” Menzel says. “That's going to guide us toward more effective treatments.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Discovered a Mysterious Underground Chamber from an Ancient Civilization","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69239341/scotland-underground-chamber/","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

The archaeologists that found the stone-paved chamber, located inside a hilltop fort in Scotland, still aren't sure exactly what its purpose was.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Archaeologists digging through the remains of an Iron Age hilltop fort in Scotland located a semi-underground stone-built chamber, complete with stone flooring. Just what it was for, though, remains a mystery, even after careful analysis. 

Investigation into the Broxy Kennels Fort near Perth revealed that the site was heavily used for centuries, starting between 550 to 400 B.C.E., but it was abandoned before the Romans arrived at the location. The underground, stone-reinforced chamber, known as a souterrain, wasn't part of the original design of the site, but it may have played an important role in the evolution of the settlement. 

Excavations at the site came thanks to a road project. Before work could start on the Cross Tay Link Road, teams scoured information about the terrain. They discovered aerial photographs taken in the 1960s that revealed the settlement, Guard Archaeology project officer Kenny Green said in a statement. “Without these aerial photographs, no one would have known there was a hillfort here as there was no trace of it on the ground,” he said. “Centuries of ploughing had removed any surface trace.”

Excavations started in 2022, and specialists from across Scotland, including the National Museums Scotland and the universities of Glasgow and Stirling, have analyzed the find. The most intriguing element has proven to be the souterrain, a type of underground structure, measuring nearly 30 feet long, 13 feet wide, and about three feet deep. Boulders were evidently brought from the nearby River Tay to provide support on the walls, and the chamber even featured a stone floor. 

The souterrain is one of just 200 known across Scotland, mostly dating to the final centuries B.C.E. and the first two centuries C.E., part of a distinctive Iron Age Scottish culture.

Green said the function of the souterrain remains a mystery, even after intensive analyzing of the site. The team found cereal grain on the floor, but not enough to suggest it was used for grain storage. Chemical analysis of the floor deposits was also inconclusive. 

Dating showed that the fort was still inhabited until the late first century C.E., just before the Roman army arrived at that area of Scotland. Evidence shows inhabitants filled in part of one of the ditches around 400 B.C.E. and constructed the underground passage into the back-filled ditch. A third ditch and rampart were then newly dug to surround the underground passage, while another outer rampart was created. 

The excavation team found evidence that the settlement began in the Iron Age, a common theme as Scotland has 1,500 examples of Iron Age forts. Instead of serving as military outposts, they were fortified hilltop settlements. The Broxy Kennels site was likely chosen due to a major bend in the River Tay, visible to anyone traveling from the north or south. 

Green said the first phase of the settlement likely featured two massive ditches and then earthen ramparts built from the soil removed by the ditch digging. Radiocarbon dating reveals this occurred between 550 to 400 B.C.E. “Our team discovered the charred remains of wattle panels and pieces of daub from the roundhouses that belonged to this time,” he said. “These had been thrown into the ditches when the settlement had been cleared of old buildings at some point.” 

The team found bog ore and slag, waste from smelting iron ore. A fragmented of vitrified clay showed it was part of a furnace used for metalworking. 

“Some of the archaeological features found in the fort's interior may be the remains of roundhouses,” Green said. “Centuries of ploughing, however, had eroded the top of the hill away, leaving only a few of the very deepest parts of postholes making it difficult to determine the full size and shape of any structures that may have once stood there.” 

Experts aren't sure why the Broxy Kennels Fort was ultimately abandoned before the Romans arrived, whether societal habits simply changed, or the incoming Roman army forced inhabitants to flee. 

“Many drivers and passengers traveling the new road may not imagine that they cross the site of a prehistoric fort,” Jillian Ferguson, roads and infrastructure manager at Perth and Kincross Council, said in a statement. “The construction of the Cross Tay Link Road at this site has provided an inadvertent but invaluable opportunity to learn more about how people near Perth lived more than 2,000 years ago.”

The object, initially thought to be a meteorite, could actually be Zond 1, a Soviet spacecraft that was destined for Venus 60 years ago.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Every object that trespasses on the inner solar system brings with it questions about its origin. Though it is suspected to be a chunk of rock from some far-flung region of space, no one ever really found out what ‘Oumuamua is made of, and while 31/Atlas may be a comet, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb hypothesized about the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft. Now, Loeb thinks the newest target of interest could also be a technosignature—one from Earth. 

Object Arjuna 2025 PN7, named for the Arjuna asteroid belt, was detected by the Pan-STARRS survey as far back as 2014, but it was so faint that it went unnoticed by astronomers until now. Researchers Carlos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos of the Complutense University of Madrid published a recent study exploring the possibility of it being a quasi-moon. The Arjuna belt is made up of over a hundred asteroids in Earth-like orbits, quasi-satellites that move along with our planet but are not gravitationally bound to it, as opposed to mini moons that are gravitationally captured and orbit Earth temporarily. 

“This ‘Arjuna' object has, by definition of a quasi-satellite, an orbital period of a year…resulting in its extended presence close to Earth, despite following a heliocentric orbit,” Loeb and colleague Adam Hibberd said in a study recently submitted for publication.

Loeb and Hibberd propose that the Arjuna object is actually a relic of a defunct civilization. That civilization would be the Soviet Union, which sent a failed mission to Venus in April 1964. This was the era when the Soviets were already vying to put the first boot prints on the Moon while also sending spacecraft to Mars and Venus. The Zond-1 probe didn't quite make it. En route to Venus, it was forced to use its rocket engine to give it more of a boost and later needed a course correction. There were operation errors and glitches in communication with the probe when its pressurized orbit compartment began to leak. It ended up depressurizing, and communication blacked out.

Hibberd's models of interplanetary mission trajectories from the 1960s singled out Zond 1 as the candidate spacecraft most likely to be the mystery object. These models showed that 2025 PN7 fell into a quasi-satellite orbit around the time of the Zond 1 launch. Its closet approach to Venus occurred in July of 1964, the same time that Zond 1 was supposed to arrive at its destination. Its heliocentric longitude, or the angular distance between a celestial object and the Sun, evolved over the path that the probe would have taken if it survived, and both Zond 1 and 2025 PN7 have similar levels of brightness.

“For every such trajectory, the spacecraft positions and velocities were compared against those of 2025 PN7, in order to ascertain whether this object could be associated with the mission in question,” Hibberd and Loeb said.  

The Zond 1 hypothesis will need spectroscopic backup. If measurements of its light spectrum could at least reveal its surface composition, that may give away whether it is a piece of outdated technology, as opposed to being another asteroid. What is problematic about declaring the identity of 2025 PN7 to be Zond 1 is that it flew closer to the Sun than was predicted based on its trajectory. 

So could the Arjuna object actually be what remains of Zond 1? Loeb and Hibberd remain skeptical but want their research out there, suggesting that if 2025 PN7 is not the probe itself, it could be the discarded upper stage of the rocket that launched it.

Researchers at North Carolina State University have identified a clear connection between the extent of cockroach infestations in homes and the amount of allergens and bacterial toxins known as endotoxins found indoors. The team discovered that when pest control successfully reduced cockroach numbers, both allergen and endotoxin levels dropped sharply. These results indicate that eliminating infestations may significantly improve indoor environmental health by cutting down harmful biological pollutants.

Endotoxins are fragments of bacterial cell walls that are released when bacteria die. Because cockroaches consume a wide range of materials, they host a diverse gut microbiome. Previous studies have shown that these insects shed large quantities of endotoxins through their droppings. Although humans and household pets can also produce endotoxins, the researchers found that a major portion of those detected in household dust originated from cockroach feces.

""Endotoxins are important to human health, as inhalation of these components has been shown to provoke allergic responses,"" said Coby Schal, the Blanton J. Whitmire Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and co-corresponding author of the study. ""Past surveys in U.S. homes found endotoxin levels much higher in homes with self-reported evidence of cockroaches; that association is stronger in low-income homes than in single-family homes.""

How the Study Was Conducted

The research took place in multi-unit apartment complexes in Raleigh, North Carolina. Scientists measured the scale of cockroach infestations alongside concentrations of allergens and endotoxins in each home. To establish baseline readings, both settled and airborne dust samples were collected before any treatment began.

The findings revealed that infested homes contained high amounts of endotoxins, with female cockroaches producing roughly twice as much as males.

""Female cockroaches eat more than males, so more endotoxins are shed from their fecal matter,"" explained Madhavi Kakumanu, an NC State research scholar in Schal's lab and co-corresponding author of the paper. She noted that kitchens typically contained more endotoxins than bedrooms, since they provide abundant food sources for cockroaches.

Testing Pest Control's Effectiveness

The infested apartments were split into two categories: untreated homes and those that received professional extermination to remove cockroaches. Researchers also included a control group of residences with no infestation. Dust and insect samples were collected again at three and six months.

Homes that remained untreated consistently showed high levels of both allergens and endotoxins throughout the study. In contrast, most units that underwent extermination were cleared of cockroaches and showed substantial reductions in both allergens and endotoxins.

""When you eliminate cockroaches, you eliminate their allergens. Small decreases in cockroaches don't lower allergen levels because the remaining live cockroaches deposit more allergens,"" Schal said. ""Endotoxins significantly decreased in homes where cockroaches were eliminated. This paper shows that the cockroach is the most important depositor of endotoxin in infested homes.""

Kakumanu added, ""We also saw that allergens and endotoxins can be airborne.""

Next Steps: Exploring Health Effects

Schal noted that future research will look at how cockroach allergens and endotoxins interact in animal models of asthma, such as mice.

""There exists the implication that asthma can be worse due to interactions between allergens and endotoxins,"" he said. ""We want to see if that is the case in mice.""

The research was published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global. Co-authors include NC State's Richard G. Santangelo, Zachary C. DeVries from the University of Kentucky, and Jeffrey Siegel from the University of Toronto.

Key Points

Breakthrough Reveals How Viruses Outsmart Human Cells

A team of Australian scientists has uncovered how certain viruses manage to seize control of human cells, a finding that could lead to the next generation of antivirals and vaccines.

The research, led by Monash University and the University of Melbourne and published in Nature Communications, explains how the rabies virus can manipulate a wide range of cellular activities despite producing only a few proteins.

Scientists believe this same mechanism could also be at work in other deadly pathogens, including Nipah and Ebola viruses. If so, the discovery could pave the way for new treatments that block these viral strategies.

How Viruses Do So Much With So Little

Co-senior author Associate Professor Greg Moseley, head of the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute's (BDI) Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory, described the remarkable efficiency of viruses.

""Viruses such as rabies can be incredibly lethal because they take control of many aspects of life inside the cells they infect,"" Associate Professor Moseley said. ""They hijack the machinery that makes proteins, disrupt the 'postal service' that sends messages between different parts of the cell, and disable the defenses that normally protect us from infection.""

He explained that scientists have long puzzled over how viruses with such limited genetic material could be so powerful. ""Rabies virus, for example, has the genetic material to make only five proteins, compared with about 20,000 in a human cell,"" he said.

The Key: A Shape-Shifting Viral Protein

Co-first author Dr. Stephen Rawlinson, a research fellow in the Moseley Lab, said the team's work offers a long-sought answer.

""Our study provides an answer,"" he said. ""We discovered that one of rabies virus's key proteins, called P protein, gains a remarkable range of functions through its ability to change shape and to bind to RNA.""

""RNA is the same molecule used in new-generation RNA vaccines, but it plays essential roles inside our cells, carrying genetic messages, coordinating immune responses, and helping make the building blocks of life.""

Taking Over the Cell's Inner World

Co-senior author Professor Paul Gooley, who leads the University of Melbourne's Gooley Laboratory, said the viral P protein's ability to interact with RNA allows it to shift between different physical 'phases' within a cell.

""This allows it to infiltrate many of the cell's liquid-like compartments, take control of vital processes, and turn the cell into a highly efficient virus factory,"" Professor Gooley said.

Although this research focused on rabies, he noted that similar tactics may be used by other deadly viruses, including Nipah and Ebola. ""Understanding this new mechanism opens exciting possibilities for developing antivirals or vaccines that block this remarkable adaptability,"" he added.

Rethinking How Viral Proteins Work

Dr. Rawlinson said the findings challenge how scientists have traditionally viewed multifunctional viral proteins. ""Until now, these proteins were often viewed like trains made up of several carriages, with each carriage (or module) responsible for a specific task,"" he said.

""According to this view, shorter versions of a protein should simply lose functions as carriages are removed. However, this simple model could not explain why some shorter viral proteins actually gain new abilities. We found that multifunctionality can also arise from the way the 'carriages' interact and fold together to create different overall shapes, as well as forming new abilities such as binding to RNA.""

A New Perspective on Viral Adaptability

Associate Professor Moseley said that the ability of the P protein to bind RNA allows it to move between different physical 'phases' inside the cell.

""In doing so, it can access and manipulate many of the cell's own liquid-like compartments that control key processes, such as immune defense and protein production,"" he said. ""By revealing this new mechanism, our study provides a fresh way of thinking about how viruses use their limited genetic material to create proteins that are flexible, adaptable, and able to take control of complex cellular systems.""

This study involved Monash University, the University of Melbourne, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Australian Synchrotron), Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP), and Deakin University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists uncover the secret triggers of ‘impossible' earthquakes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251104094144.htm","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 02:39:11 GMT","

Earthquakes in places like Utah (USA), Soultz-sous-Forêts (France), and Groningen (the Netherlands) seem puzzling to scientists because, according to geological theory, they shouldn't be possible. In these regions, the shallow layers of the Earth's crust are thought to behave in a way that strengthens faults when they begin to move. Textbooks suggest that this strengthening effect should prevent earthquakes from happening at all. Yet, tremors still occur in these supposedly stable zones. Researchers from Utrecht University set out to understand why. Their findings, recently published in Nature Communications, reveal that faults which have remained inactive for millions of years can accumulate extra stress over time. Eventually, that built-up pressure may be released in a single event. This insight is crucial for identifying safer areas for technologies such as geothermal energy extraction and underground energy storage.

""Faults can be found almost everywhere. Faults in the shallow subsurface are usually stable, so we do not expect shock movements to occur along them,"" explains Dr. Ylona van Dinther, who led the study. Yet, surprisingly, seismic activity does take place within the first few kilometers beneath the surface -- precisely where the ground is considered most stable. These shallow earthquakes are often linked to human activities such as drilling, extraction, or fluid injection. The question, then, is why faults that normally grow stronger when they move can suddenly weaken and slip, releasing energy as an earthquake.

Inactive faults and slow healing

Many human-induced earthquakes occur along ancient, inactive faults that have not shifted for millions of years. Although these faults remain still, the surfaces where the rocks meet slowly ""heal"" over time, becoming stronger. This gradual strengthening creates additional resistance. When that resistance is finally overcome, it can cause an abrupt acceleration along the fault. That acceleration produces an earthquake, even in regions that geological models label as stable.

Because areas like these have no long-term record of seismic activity, local communities are often unprepared. Buildings and infrastructure are not designed to handle the shaking. ""Furthermore, these earthquakes take place at a depth where human activities occur, in other words, no more than several kilometres deep. That is considerably less deep than the majority of natural earthquakes."" This shallowness means that such quakes can cause more noticeable and potentially damaging ground movement.

One-time events that stabilize over time

Interestingly, the Utrecht team found that these earthquakes are one-off events. Once the accumulated stress is released, the fault settles into a new, more stable state. ""As a result, there is no more earthquake activity at that spot,"" says Van Dinther. ""This means that, although the subsurface in such areas will not settle immediately after human operations stop, the strength of the earthquakes -- including the maximum expected magnitude -- will gradually decrease."" When a fault strengthens as it moves, its broken sections can slide more easily past one another afterward, acting as natural barriers that prevent larger earthquakes from forming. This means the overall risk can be revised downward, since the potential for stronger quakes diminishes once the fault has slipped.

Implications for sustainable subsurface use

The research has significant consequences for how we use and manage the Earth's subsurface. It shows that even in regions considered geologically stable, earthquakes can occur under certain conditions -- but only once per fault. After the initial event, the area tends to become more secure. Understanding how faults behave, how they ""heal,"" and what causes them to accelerate or slow down is essential for minimizing seismic risks associated with geothermal energy, carbon storage, and similar technologies. With new computational models, Utrecht University researchers are already working to refine these predictions and improve how one-time earthquake risks are communicated.

Engineers at the University of Delaware have uncovered a new way to connect magnetic and electric forces in computing, a finding that could pave the way for computers that run dramatically faster while consuming far less energy.

Tiny Magnetic Waves Generate Electric Signals

In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the university's Center for Hybrid, Active and Responsive Materials (CHARM), a National Science Foundation-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, report that magnons -- tiny magnetic waves that move through solid materials -- are capable of generating measurable electric signals.

This discovery suggests that future computer chips could merge magnetic and electric systems directly, removing the need for the constant energy exchange that limits the performance of today's devices.

How Magnons Transmit Information

Traditional electronics rely on the flow of charged electrons, which lose energy as heat when moving through circuits. In contrast, magnons carry information through the synchronized ""spin"" of electrons, creating wave-like patterns across a material. According to theoretical models developed by the UD team, when these magnetic waves travel through antiferromagnetic materials, they can induce electric polarization, effectively creating a measurable voltage.

Toward Ultrafast, Energy-Efficient Computing

Antiferromagnetic magnons can move at terahertz frequencies -- around a thousand times faster than magnetic waves in conventional materials. This exceptional speed points to a promising path for ultrafast, low-power computing. The researchers are now working to verify their theoretical predictions through experiments and to investigate how magnons interact with light, which could lead to even more efficient ways of controlling them.

Advancing Quantum Material Research

This work contributes to CHARM's larger goal of developing hybrid quantum materials for cutting-edge technologies. The center's researchers study how different types of materials -- such as magnetic, electronic, and quantum systems -- can be combined and controlled to create next-generation technologies. CHARM's goal is to design smart materials that respond to their environments and enable breakthroughs in computing, energy, and communication.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Most Americans don't know alcohol can cause cancer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251105050722.htm","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:44:45 GMT","

Key Findings

Many Americans Unaware of Alcohol's Cancer Risk

New research from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that public understanding of the connection between alcohol and cancer remains surprisingly low in the United States. Despite decades of scientific evidence, more than half of American adults (52.9%) were unaware that alcohol affects cancer risk.

The findings, published October 30 in JAMA Oncology, reveal that only 37.1% of adults recognized that drinking alcohol raises cancer risk, while 1% believed it actually lowers it. The study also noted that individuals who had consumed alcohol recently, or who thought cancer was not fatal or preventable, were more likely to say that alcohol has no influence on cancer risk.

Lead author Sanjay Shete, Ph.D., professor of Biostatistics and Epidemiology and Betty B. Marcus Chair in Cancer Prevention, called the results alarming. ""It's concerning that people who drink alcohol are the ones most likely to believe it has no effect on cancer risk,"" Shete said. ""Given people's beliefs play a critical role in whether they choose healthier behaviors, we need to work on correcting these misperceptions, which could be essential to reducing the growing burden of alcohol-related cancers.""

Researchers examined what influences how people view alcohol and cancer risk, noting that health-related behaviors and beliefs strongly affect whether individuals make informed choices. The study found that certain demographic and behavioral traits were linked to greater misunderstanding of alcohol's effects.

Current cigarette smokers, Black individuals, those with lower levels of education (below a college or high school level), and people who do not believe cancer can be prevented were more likely to say they did not know alcohol contributes to cancer risk.

Alcohol's Proven Role as a Carcinogen

The World Health Organization classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, the same level of risk as tobacco, asbestos, and radiation. Alcohol consumption has been tied to at least seven types of cancer, including breast, liver, and colorectal cancers. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), drinking alcohol accounts for about 5.5% of all new cancer cases and 5.8% of all cancer deaths worldwide.

Researchers suggest that correcting misinformation could help more people follow alcohol consumption guidelines, including those endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General in his 2025 advisory, potentially reducing preventable cancer-related deaths.

The analysis drew on data from nearly 7,000 adults aged 18 and older (mean age 48) who participated in the 2024 Health Information National Trends Survey. Among respondents, 48.4% were female, 60.7% identified as white, 17.5% as Hispanic, and 11% as Black. Over half reported drinking alcohol within the past month, and almost 10% had a personal history of cancer.

Participants were asked, ""In your opinion, how does drinking alcohol affect the risk of getting cancer?"" They could choose from four responses: ""decreases the risk of cancer,"" ""has no effect on the risk of cancer,"" ""increases risk of cancer,"" and ""don't know.""

This research was supported by the National Cancer Institute (P30CA016672) and the Betty B. Marcus Chair in Cancer Prevention. A complete list of authors, disclosures, and funding sources is available in the full JAMA Oncology article.

A research team at the University of Missouri has made a discovery that could transform how glaucoma is detected and treated. Glaucoma, a major cause of irreversible blindness in older adults, often goes undiagnosed until significant vision loss has already occurred. Scientists are now closer to identifying a biomarker that may allow doctors to detect the disease much earlier and develop new ways to protect the eye.

Glaucoma occurs when retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons become damaged. These delicate nerve cells, located at the back of the eye, carry visual information to the brain. Once they deteriorate, vision loss begins. Current therapies mainly reduce pressure inside the eye, but none effectively protect RGCs from harm. This gap in treatment highlights the urgent need for neuroprotective strategies that can preserve these critical nerve cells.

Searching for Biomarkers and Protective Treatments

Pawan Singh, a researcher at Mizzou's School of Medicine, is dedicated to finding both biomarkers that reveal glaucoma early and therapies that safeguard the optic nerve. His team recently discovered that glaucoma patients have lower levels of two naturally occurring molecules, agmatine and thiamine, in the clear fluid at the front of the eye compared with individuals without the disease. These small molecules, known as metabolites, may serve as early indicators that can be detected through testing.

""In several cases, people do not find out they have glaucoma until they are older and their eye pressure is elevated,"" Singh explained. ""Our long-term goal is to see if doctors could one day do a simple blood test to check for these biomarkers. If they can, hopefully they will be able to catch the disease much earlier, before vision loss occurs, so patients can receive treatment sooner.""

Promising Clues for Future Treatments

Beyond diagnosis, the discovery offers hope for new therapies. Singh's pre-clinical research suggests that agmatine and thiamine may help protect RGCs and maintain visual function, offering neuroprotective potential. These molecules could eventually be developed into treatments, possibly in the form of eye drops or supplements, that slow or prevent vision loss from glaucoma.

""Mizzou's impressive research infrastructure and our collaborative team help make this research possible,"" Singh said. ""While more work needs to be done, the eye doctors I have spoken to here at Mizzou are very excited about this research, so I am proud and hopeful for the future.""

The findings were published in Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science under the title ""Metabolomic profiling of aqueous humor from glaucoma patients identifies metabolites with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential in mice.""

Building on their landmark efforts to create cell-type atlases of adult brains using single-cell and spatial genomics technologies, researchers in the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) have unveiled their next endeavour, to create comprehensive and multimodal cell-type atlases of the developing human, mouse and non-human primate brains.

Expanding cell-type atlases to include developing human, mouse and non-human primate brains using multimodal genomics.

A large consortium of researchers has mapped how brain cells establish diverse identities throughout neurodevelopment and across species.

Recent studies integrating multi-omics data with cell atlases across development for brains of humans and model organisms are revealing conserved and divergent patterns of brain development at the molecular and cellular levels, and linking these to complex behavioural and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

A high-resolution transcriptomic and epigenomic cell-type atlas of the developing mouse visual cortex from embryonic to postnatal development is presented, providing a real-time dynamic molecular map associated with individual cell types and specific developmental events.

Long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons, which diversify extensively after birth in the cortex and striatum, but show limited postnatal changes in the septum, preoptic area and pallidum.

Paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling are used to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, including cell types with key roles in physiological and social behaviour functions have been identified.

3D brain atlases enable spatial data integration across studies. Here, the authors present the Developmental Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D multimodal atlas from embryonic to adult ages for cell type mapping through brain development.

Tripotential intermediate progenitor cells are responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes in the human neocortex.

A study describes chromatin accessibility and paired gene expression across the entire developing human brain during the first trimester in the context of gene regulation and neurodevelopmental disease.

An analysis of cell-type diversity in brain samples from a variety of mammalian species, both during development and in adult animals, reveals that the TAC3 initial class of striatal interneurons is conserved across placental mammals and is homologous to Th striatal interneurons in rodents.

Nano et al. introduce a pipeline to generate meta-atlases of the human brain from existing single-cell datasets and extract gene modules linked to cell fate specification. Perturbing these programs in human cortical chimeroids validated their roles in cell type specification.

Lineage tracing in human tissue samples from gestational weeks 16 to 24 provides insight into lineage relationships between cortical cell types and shows a switch in progenitor output from glutamatergic to GABAergic neurons.

BARseq interrogates the expression of 104 cell-type marker genes in 10.3 million cells over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres to reveal the role of peripheral inputs on cortical area development.

A tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain from postnatal day 0 to P21 reveals that layer-specific projection neurons have a role in coordinating axonogenesis and myelination.

Spatial transcriptomic approaches often lack single-cell resolution and read coverage. Here, we introduce spatial ISOform sequencing (Spl-ISO-Seq) which optimizes the capture of long, exonic molecules. This technology reveals developmentally-regulated cell-type and region-specific splicing patterns.

Chinese researchers are more likely to lead projects with the UK and Europe than the US. Credit: Dai Bin/Xinhua/Alamy

The number of Chinese scientists taking on leadership roles in international science projects is growing rapidly. They now lead more than half of all research projects with the United Kingdom, and are expected to lead an equal number of projects with Europe and with the United States in the next couple of years, according to a study1 published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last week.

Hongjun Xiang, a physicist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, says the projections are consistent with what he has observed in the country, particularly in fields such as physics and engineering. But China needs to strengthen its leadership capabilities in disruptive basic research, “as Nobel-level original breakthroughs remain rare”, he adds.

To understand how scientific leadership is changing, researchers analysed authorship data from nearly six million scientific publications. The team analysed ‘author contribution' statements on journal manuscripts, in which each author's role is described. When such statements weren't available, the team developed a model that could predict leadership roles based on author experience, citation histories and the ideas researchers brought from their previous work, says James Evans, a co-author and computational sociologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois.

Researchers who conceived, designed and guided the project or offered mentorship were classified as leaders; first-year students, people providing tech support and those performing experiments under direction were considered followers. 

From there, Evans and his colleagues devised two parameters to assess the changes in scientific leadership in bilateral partnerships. Lead share describes the number of people in leadership roles from a given country. Lead premium is the ratio of leaders to followers on the paper.

The team found that China's lead share in US–China collaborations rose from 30% in 2010 to 45% in 2023. China's lead premium, however, is progressing more slowly. Chinese scientists still occupy supporting roles in many of these projects, says Evans. They are more likely to lead projects when they work with groups in the United Kingdom and Europe, he adds.

According to the research, in 2019, China's lead share reached parity with the United Kingdom's; it is likely to be on par with Europe lead share by 2025–27 and the US lead share by 2027–28. In some crucial technology areas, such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and energy, Chinese leadership is further behind and is expected to catch up to the United States by 2030.

Xiang says that, in the development of core technologies, such as semiconductors, the country faces significant ‘chokehold' challenges, including the US government's ban ban on NVIDIA AI chips sales to China since 2022. China's dependency on US tech can not be easily overcome, as it is rooted in decades of deep scientific research, says Xiang. “Addressing these structural imbalances is the key to our journey from being a big science country to a truly strong one, and continued international collaboration remains vital for this endeavour,” Xiang adds.

But Evans says the findings upend the assumption that the United States can shut China out of global scientific opportunities by not collaborating with its researchers. Some US lawmakers want restrictions on research collaborations with Chinese institutions that work with the country's military. Simulations show that “if the US were to stop collaborating with China on projects related to critical technologies — such as space, artificial intelligence or quantum computing — it would prove to be very costly for the US”, he says. 

Evans says that US–China collaborations, particularly in fields such as artificial intelligence, are more likely to be successful than work done separately.

Future antibody therapies could target H5N1 avian influenza virus (green).Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library

Researchers are increasingly developing antibody therapies to treat infectious diseases. Therapies are being designed to reduce the severity of infections such as bird flu, and cure chronic conditions such as HIV. Synthetic antibodies could also make vaccines for diseases such as COVID-19 more effective.

Antibodies are part of the immune system's defence against infection. Scientists produce synthetic versions by combining B cells from mice and human cell lines. Most approved antibody drugs are for cancers and autoimmune diseases. 

Monoclonal antibodies are also widely used in antiviral therapies to treat severe infections caused by Ebola, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2, says Runhong Zhou, who studies immune responses at Hong Kong University. But past efforts to develop antivirals for avian influenza have not been as successful because the virus undergoes mutations that make treatment less effective, he adds. Antibody drugs for COVID-19 have also become less effective over time for the same reason.

For H5N1 avian influenza, Zhou and his colleagues have developed an antibody that has two targets: the stem region of proteins on the surface of the virus and receptors on a person's cells. In cell-based experiments, they found that the antibody neutralized multiple live strains of the bird flu virus and was superior to a model monoclonal antibody — which targets only one specific antigen — at stopping viral particles from attaching to or entering cells. Their results suggest that targeting the virus stem and host receptors at the same time “is a good strategy to enhance antibody efficacy”, Zhou says, who was among the teams presenting their findings in this field at the Pandemic Research Alliance International Symposium in Melbourne last week. But it is still unclear how long the protection will last, or whether antibody treatment can induce mutations in the virus that allow it to evade the immune system.

Hsiang Hong, a medical student at Columbia University in New York City, is also part of a team using antibodies for H5N1. He says that he and his colleagues are developing a panel of monoclonal antibodies that target multiple parts of the H5N1 virus to track how it evolves over time and identify potential treatments that can target several variants of the virus.

Antibodies could also boost the efficacy of other treatments, such as vaccines, which need to be updated because most viruses mutate frequently as they evolve.

Zhiwei Chen, an immunology researcher at the University of Hong Kong, says antibodies that can bind to highly conserved parts of SARS-CoV-2 could help vaccines to stay effective even as the virus mutates. Chen and his team have identified several areas of the SARS-CoV-2 particle surface that do not change when the virus undergoes mutation. They have also found that several antibodies that target these highly conserved areas were effective at neutralizing different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, variants of SARS-CoV-2 and some coronaviruses found in pangolins and bats.

Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause, typically affecting individuals aged 50–60 years and leading to death within a decade1,2,3. It is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) composed of fibrillar α-synuclein (aSyn)4,5,6,7,8, the formation of which shows parallels with prion propagation9,10. While fibrils extracted from brains of individuals with MSA have been structurally characterized11, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned12, and their ability to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B13,14, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice15—suggesting direct relevance to MSA—but lacks scrutiny at the atomic scale. Here we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Notably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from patients with MSA11. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B. Our findings identify 1B as a synthetic pathogen capable of self-replication in vivo and reveal structural features of 1B and 1BP that may underlie MSA pathology, offering insights for therapeutic strategies.

MSA is characterized by the rapid invasion of the brainstem, the cerebellum and/or the basal ganglia by intracellular inclusions filled with fibrillar aSyn4,5,6,7,8. These inclusions appear in neurons and in oligodendrocytes (OLs), particularly within the myelinated bundles of the white matter16,17,18. The latter inclusions are called GCIs and are specific to MSA. They are observed only rarely in other sporadic α-synucleinopathies1,2. The phenomenon of a step-by-step progression that characterizes brain invasion by GCIs, and the speed at which the GCIs induce the death of neurons in myelinated tracts1, has led to the notion that MSA may obey a molecular mechanism analogous to that governing the intracerebral diffusion of pathogenic prions9,10. According to this hypothesis, the specific aSyn fibril strain found in GCIs has a central role as both initiator and propagator of the pathology9,10.

aSyn fibrils in GCIs were first observed in situ4,5,6,7,8, and were extracted and described using electron microscopy (EM) more than 25 years ago19,20. Such fibrils, extracted using the detergent sarkosyl, were characterized at high resolution using cryo-transmission EM (cryo-EM)11 but, to date, it has not been demonstrated that they can self-replicate like prions or induce the formation of GCIs in animal models. The hypothesis was put forward12 that unknown cofactors might be required for the replication of these extracted assemblies.

In parallel to the extractive approach11, three synthetic aSyn fibril strains were obtained from recombinant aSyn, and these fibrils could self-replicate in vitro without the need for an external cofactor and induce GCIs in mice. Chronologically, the first strain was a non-helical double-filament fibrillar assembly (ribbons) composed of monomers of human aSyn, capable of inducing GCIs, but only in rats overexpressing human aSyn concomitantly21. The second strain corresponded to mouse synthetic aSyn fibrils, which could induce the delayed appearance of GCIs in non-transgenic mice22. Finally, the third case concerned a fibril strain that some of us isolated and characterized (strain 1B), formed of human recombinant aSyn and causing the rapid appearance of GCIs in interfascicular OLs of wild-type (WT) mice15. In contrast to the aSyn fibrils extracted from patients with MSA, a high-resolution structure of these types of synthetic aSyn fibrils was lacking. This prevented the comparison of these fibrils to the atomic models obtained from patients to understand the structural basis of their ability to induce GCIs.

Here we report the structural characterization of aSyn fibrils of strain 1B at a resolution of 1.94 Å, and compare them to the aSyn filaments extracted from the brains of 1B-injected diseased mice in which GCIs formed (1BP, resolved at 3.8 Å). The marked structural similarity between 1B and 1BP demonstrates that a conformational templating and replication process is indeed taking place in vivo and that it is responsible for fibril growth and inclusion pathology buildup. Furthermore, the structural analogy of the 1B and 1BP fold with the human MSA fold found in patient 5 of the seminal study of Goedert's group11 suggests that a similar conformational replication process underlies MSA in humans.

1B fibrils present a typical rod-like compact appearance with a width compatible to the intertwining of two protofilaments13 and a left-handed helicoidal twist (Extended Data Fig. 1a). We observed in our founder experiments that 1B had the ability to seed a particularly strong aSyn pathology in neuronal cultures (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and in vivo in mice13,14. In this early work, we found that the pathology induced by 1B at early timepoints was made of Lewy neurites, neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) and, notably, neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs)13,14. Together with GCIs and glial nuclear inclusions (GNIs), NIIs constitute a key feature of MSA pathology, that is, they are distinctive for MSA compared with Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), in which NIIs are absent23,24. This very cytopathological feature led us to investigate the possibility that the synthetic 1B fibrils could represent an MSA-like fibril strain. Using a directed anatomical approach and later timepoints, we observed that, 6 months after intracerebral inoculation, 1B was indeed capable of also causing the appearance of GCIs in the anterior commissure (AC) of WT mice15, that is, in a major myelinated tract containing densely packed rows of interfascicular OLs. The time course and the prominence of the GCI pathology seeded in this tract supported the notion that, like in MSA24,25, the aSyn pathology seeded by 1B fibrils originated in neurons and was secondarily propagated to OLs15.

After 24 months, a proper invasion of the posterior limb of the AC and of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) by GCIs was observed (Fig. 1a–e), while IBA1+ microglia did not particularly cluster around aSyn inclusion pathology (Fig. 1c,d). Confocal three-dimensional (3D) volume reconstructions of affected OLs in the BNST showed the typical flame-like cytoplasmic distribution of phosphorylated aSyn (Fig. 1e). The global distribution of GCIs in full horizontal brain sections from animals euthanized at 1.5, 12 or 24 months after 1B fibril injection in their right caudate putamen (CP) showed generalized spread of GCIs (Fig. 1f (green markers)). This was particularly prominent in the animal euthanized at 24 months: in addition to the AC and to the BNST, GCIs were found bilaterally in deep cortical layers and the subcortical white matter, the CP and unilaterally in the globus pallidus (GP) (injection side), the internal capsule (injection side), the entopeduncular nucleus (injection side), the substantia nigra (SN) pars reticulata (injection side) and the medullary reticular nucleus (contralateral side). A hovering section overview corresponding to Fig. 1a–e is provided in Supplementary Video 1.

Depending on the neuroanatomical structure and the timepoint under consideration, the experimental GCIs shown in Fig. 1f coexisted with a variable load of surrounding neuronal somatic aSyn inclusions (NCIs and NIIs), which represent the forefront of the somatic aSyn pathology at earlier timepoints to progressively make way to a growing population of GCIs, as previously reported15,22 (Extended Data Fig. 2). This is supportive of a neuronal-to-oligodendroglial inclusion transfer as in MSA24,25.

Seeding of GCIs by 1B was dependent neither on the mouse strain nor on the intracerebral injection site. When C57BL/6 mice (instead of 129SV mice) were inoculated with 1B above their right SN, 17 months later, numerous aSyn inclusions could be observed on the right side (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Note the depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons also on the right side of the pars compacta of this mouse (compare with Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Here also, the aSyn inclusions comprised numerous GCIs as demonstrated by co-staining the OL nuclei with SOX10 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b,d,e). They were particularly obvious at the boundary in between the pars reticulata and the pars compacta and were absent on the left side (Extended Data Fig. 3a,c,d,f). IBA1+ microglial cells were also observed but without evident signs of clustering around aSyn inclusions (Extended Data Fig. 3d–f).

Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM)26,27 was used to study inclusions in the brains of C57BL/6 mice. Consecutive brain tissue slices were imaged using fluorescence microscopy to identify inclusions positive for aSyn phosphorylated at Ser129 (hereafter, pS129aSyn). Identified sections were then resin-embedded and heavy-metal stained, and serial ultrathin sections were collected consecutively on glass slides and on EM grids. Glass slides were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to relocalize the pS129aSyn+ cells and stained with Toluidine Blue. The recorded images were correlated with EM images taken on the consecutive grids. We used a mouse of the 1B-injected series corresponding to Extended Data Fig. 3a–f. We imaged 30 pS129aSyn+ inclusions in a region straddling the right GP and CP and followed them throughout the brain tissue by serial sectioning. We could identify fibrillar material and membranous cytoplasmic subcompartments in the pS129aSyn-positive areas. Room-temperature electron tomography analysis of various positions within the IHC-positive regions was used to verify fibrillar morphology, which showed fibrillar morphology in a dispersed, bundled and clustered arrangement (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 4). We additionally verified that the fibrillar material in the pS129aSyn+ IHC regions corresponded to aSyn protein assemblies using immunogold labelling (Extended Data Fig. 5).

The dispersed fibrillar material correlated with the pS129aSyn-positive signal in the IHC image and could be found throughout all observed inclusions in the tissue. Six cells with nuclei of more than 8.5 µm diameter were assumed to be neurons with NCIs, and 16 pathological cells with a nucleus size of below 8.5 µm were assumed to be GCIs in OLs. In many cases, the correlated area consisted of dispersed fibrillar material within a membranous local environment with various vesicular compartments. Fibril bundles could not be observed in all inclusions. If they were present, they varied strongly in length, thickness, curvature and localization within the cell. Measurement of the identified bundles in 23 inclusions throughout 5 brain slices showed an averaged bundle length of 0.81 ± 0.41 µm. In most cases, the bundle length was of a similar size of around 0.62 ± 0.07 µm. In a few exceptional cases, we measured bundles with individual lengths of 1.08 µm up to 3.64 µm (Fig. 1g). Fibrils appeared also in bigger clusters in irregular, chaotic arrangements, with fibrils radiating outward (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Moreover, we could observe the regular proximity or direct contact of different and morphologically distinct cells to pathological ones (Extended Data Fig. 6). The morphology of these cells is reminiscent of cells described as dark microglia in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease28,29, as well as of cells recently described in human post-mortem MSA brain30.

To further challenge the pathogenic impact of 1B using a humanized in vivo model, we inoculated 1B fibrils into hemizygous transgenic M83 (M83+/−) mice expressing human SNCAA53T (encoding A53T aSyn). M83+/− mice have a normal lifespan and do not spontaneously develop fibrillar aSyn inclusions, despite the presence of one copy of the human SNCAA53T transgene9,10. We found that the intracerebral injection of 1B fibrils in M83+/− mice systematically caused their rapid demise in a notably synchronized manner after only 16 weeks (Fig. 2a). Mice at death presented numerous intracerebral aSyn inclusions, in particular in the posterior limb of the AC, in which the presence of Lewy neurite bundles, GCIs and GNIs could be observed (Fig. 2b,c). Non-seeded M83+/− mice of similar age were healthy and showed no intracerebral aSyn inclusions (Fig. 2b). This indicated that, similar to in the two previous WT mouse strains, 1B fibrils were able to also cause the buildup of an inclusion pathology with cytopathological elements typical of MSA in transgenic mice expressing human A53T aSyn.

Source data

Using cryo-EM, we determined the 1B fibril structure at a resolution of 1.94 Å (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7). Fibrils were composed of two identical, twisting amyloid protofilaments in 21 screw symmetry, each comprising a pseudo-Greek-key motif consisting of nine β-sheets. The map resolved residues Gly36 to Lys97, and showed additional density attached alongside the starting sequence from Gly36 to Val40 and reaching towards the inside of the protofilament interface. As that density could not be unambiguously assigned to any side chains, we did not build an amino acid sequence for this stretch. The protofilaments form their longest β-sheet secondary structure from amino acids Val52 to Lys58, which forms the site of the main protofilament–protofilament interaction, stabilizing the protofibril interaction by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The main electrostatic clusters are a positive group formed by Lys43, Lys45 and His50, and a negative group formed by Glu57 and Thr59, flanking the β-sheet (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Moreover, His50 appears to make an inter-rung connection within the same protofilament to the following subunit along the z direction to Lys45 (Fig. 3b). The interaction between His50 and Glu57 causes the protofilaments to arrange in a half-step of the typical helical rise, by binding to the next aSyn subunit of the opposite strand at the 2.36 Å and a resulting twist of 179.52°.

a, Density maps of 1B and 1BP, respectively, visualized at a local resolution range of 1.9–4.8Å. The model of 1B was built within the resolved densities starting from Val37 to Lys97 (indicated). Wrapping around the stretch starting with Val37, an additional density is present on both protofilaments, although at a lower resolution (black arrowheads), which can also be observed at different positions in 1BP. Moreover, the structure of 1BP indicates highly flexible areas that are poorly resolved at those densities and close to the N-terminal region (red arrowheads). b, Side view onto the protofilament interface (only one protofilament is shown), revealing the characteristic rise of the amyloid filament and the inter-rung connection at His50 to Lys47 of the next aSyn subunit (N and N + 1). c, Sequence overlay of 1B (blue) and 1BP (orange). One protofilament is shown as a stick representation, and one is shown with only the backbone. The overlay indicates slight alterations in the overall interface of the fibrils, with an r.m.s.d. of 1.433 Å considering Cα atoms of a single protofilament (Supplementary Table 1). The magnified views of the protofilament interface highlight changes in interaction between side chains.

To identify the conformation of aSyn fibrils in the seeded pathology, we used the fibril purification method previously developed for human MSA brain tissue11. The purification was successful in M83+/− mice with disease 16 weeks after inoculation with 1B. Despite the low yield of material after the extraction procedure, pS129aSyn+ fibrils were observed in negative-stain imaging (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Subsequently, the sample was vitrified for structure determination using cryo-EM.

The extracted material was heterogeneous, with a limited concentration of suitable aSyn fibrils for structure determination. We solved the structure of the extracted fibrils, here termed 1BP, out of 40 micrographs (around 0.1%) to a resolution of 3.8 Å (Fig. 3a). 1BP fibrils are composed of two identical protofilaments of which the fold is highly similar to the 1B fibril seeding them (overall root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of one protofilament: 1.433 Å), confirming a prion-like templated misfolding mechanism that underlies inclusion formation in this mouse model. At the same time, an instance of strain adaptation can be observed at the interprotofilament interface, which spans from Val52 to Lys58 in 1B but is shifted by one amino acid in 1BP, where it spans from Gly51 to Glu57. This shift, which we suppose is driven by the A53T mutation expressed by M83+/− mice, brings the side chains in the 1BP steric zipper that point towards each other into adjacent positions—as in the case of Thr53 and Val55 (Fig. 3c)—increasing the distance between Cα atoms in the backbone of the two protofilaments by more than 2 Å compared with 1B. As a result, the intercalation of small hydrophobic side chains observed in 1B is lost in 1BP, but hydrophobic interactions between opposing protofilaments are still maintained.

The fundamental organization of a single protofilament of 1B shows similarities not only to 1BP but also to already published structures as well, mainly the patient-purified MSA fibrils11 (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 6XYQ), the corresponding amplification12 (PDB: 7NCK), the H50Q variant31 (PDB: 6PEO) and the WT and 1–121 aSyn variants31,32 (PDB: 80QI and 6H6B) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). The superimposition of these structures to 1B highlights differences in the positioning of Ile88 and Phe94. The region, which was previously reported as the C-pocket and acting as the binding site for thioflavin-T (ThT)33, is identical in arrangement for a subset of structures and particularly in MSA fibrils (PDB: 6XYQ and PDB: 7NCK) and the H50Q variant (PDB: 6PEO). This is notable because, like the 1B fibrils, the H50Q fibrils (PDB: 6PEO) are also ThT negative31. Consequently, the inaccessibility of the Ile88 pocket seems important to account for the ThT negativity of 1B fibrils13,14 (Fig. 4a).

a, The conformation of one protofilament of 1B with surface volume representation. The structural comparisons of single protofilaments with a similar fold are summarized with the respective r.m.s.d. values in Supplementary Table 1. b, Magnified view of the arrangement of the C-pocket on the example of 1B (left; PDB: 9EUU) and 1–121 aSyn (right; PDB: 6H6B) and the arrangement of the N-pocket on the example of 1B (left; PDB: 9EUU), 1–121 aSyn (centre; PDB: 6H6B) and ThT-bound (grey) aSyn (right; PDB: 7YNM). c, The full modelled sequences with transparent surface volume, as well as a ribbon representation with stick representation of Tyr39, Lys45, Glu46, His50, Ile88 and Phe94 for all compared structures. The open or closed state of either the C- or N-pocket are indicated by the green and red arrows, respectively. Structural similarities are also given as r.m.s.d. values in Supplementary Table 1.

Moreover, the other ThT-binding pocket located at the N terminus (N-pocket)33 of the fibrils also shows a modification compared with the structure of other ThT+ fibrils. In the 1B structure, Tyr39 is shifted so that it faces Thr44 and Glu46. As a consequence, Tyr39 is not available for interaction with ThT in the N-pocket. Note that a similar conformation of the N-pocket with a shifted Tyr39 presumably preventing ThT binding is also observed in the amplified MSA fibrils (PDB: 7NCK)12 and the H50Q mutation (PDB: 6PEO), again consistent with the parallel observation that seed amplification products templated on MSA brain extracts or on MSA cerebrospinal fluid are ThT negative34.

Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that closure of the ThT-binding pockets at the surface of the fibrils can explain the phenomenon of ThT invisibility and, at the same time, define the pathophysiological specificity of 1B, 1BP and MSA fibrils.

Besides regions involved in ThT binding, comparison with the other aSyn fibril folds also indicates the near-identical arrangement of the H50Q variant to the 1B structure, with the exception of the His50 inter-rung side-chain orientation due to the point mutation. Whether this orientation is important and confers specific MSA-like properties to 1B is unclear, especially as the >3 Å resolutions of PDB structures 6XYQ and 7NCK do not allow for conclusions on its existence in the MSA fibrils.

The 1B fibril structure also shows an outer, non-identified density stretch interacting with Gly36 to Val40 (Fig. 3a), a feature that is also present in fibrils amplified from MSA (PDB: 7NCK), in H50Q fibrils (PDB: 6PEO) and in 1BP fibrils where poorly resolved densities flank the N terminus (Fig. 3a). This is important, because these outer stretches in 1B block access of the disaggregase complex effector-component HSC70 to its binding site at the N terminus of the fibrils, therefore most likely preventing their disassembly and clearance35. This structural feature might therefore represent a reason for the acute in vivo seeding ability of 1B14.

Despite repeated attempts, we were not able to recover enough fibrils from the brains of WT mice seeded with 1B for cryo-EM analysis, most likely because the inclusions are much less numerous than in 1B-injected M83+/− mice. We therefore used the conformation-specific amyloid probe h-FTAA36 to characterize the GCIs seeded by 1B directly in WT mouse brain sections without extraction and to also compare them with the inclusions present in MSA (and DLB) post-mortem brain tissue sections. Indeed, in agreement with previous work37, we observed a clear-cut difference between the signature of GCIs in MSA and that of Lewy bodies in DLB using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of h-FTAA (Extended Data Fig. 9). Using this in situ approach, we observed that the signature of the MSA inclusions was similar to that of the 1B brain inoculum in our mouse experiments and even closer to the signature of the inclusions seeded by 1B (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3). This was also in good agreement with the fact that the inclusion pathology seeded by 1B appeared positive to the MSA-specific silver impregnation staining technique of Gallyas38, further suggestive of a structural analogy between 1B, 1B-seeded fibrils in WT animals and MSA fibrils in GCIs in human brain tissue sections (Extended Data Fig. 11). This is the same conclusion that we drew from the cryo-EM structural comparisons of 1B with 1BP and MSA fibrils that were extracted from brain tissue (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1).

Finally, given the marked similarity between 1B, 1BP and MSA filaments, we sought to determine whether 1BP raised in transgenic animals could still trigger MSA-like neuropathology in WT animals, as synthetic 1B does. To address this question, we faced the challenge of the very low yield of the sarkosyl-based purification protocol for extracting 1BP from 1B-seeded diseased mice—a yield that is insufficient to obtain the amount of intact fibrils required for in vivo reinoculation experiments. To overcome this limitation, we instead used a tenfold dilution of a total brain homogenate from a 1B-seeded diseased mouse as the inoculum, without any purification step. We also focused on early post-injection effects (6 weeks) to maximize the likelihood of detecting a seeded synucleinopathy driven by trace amounts of 1BP fibrils delivered by the inoculum (that is, 2 μl of tenfold-diluted whole-brain homogenate). Our results indicate that the amount of 1BP contained in the inoculate reached a critical value sufficient to seed anew an inclusion pathology in WT mice with the formation of NCIs, NIIs, GCIs and GNIs (Fig. 5), similar to what is observed when using synthetic 1B fibrils as seeds13,14,15.

Diluted crude brain homogenates were prepared from prematurely dying M83+/− mice injected 4 months earlier with 1B fibrils. These homogenates were injected into the right CP of WT 129SV mice. After 6 weeks, the mice were euthanized and the brains were processed for horizontal sectioning and immunofluorescence neuropathology. a–c, aSyn inclusions were revealed with anti-phosphorylated aSyn (EP1536Y, green) antibodies, the nigrostriatal tract with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, red) antibodies and nuclei with DAPI (white). a, One animal is shown with four sections spanning the nigrostriatal tract dorsoventrally. The green dots annotate aSyn inclusions (Lewy neurites, NCIs, NIIs, GCIs and GNIs). b,c, Close-up views of the different inclusion types annotated in a. d,e, Further examples of MSA-specific aSyn inclusions seeded by 1BP-containing homogenates. The sections were stained with TH (turquoise, shown only in d), SOX10 (red, OL marker) and pS129aSyn (#64, green) antibodies, and DAPI (white, shown only in e). Images are from the right SN. d, Four dopaminergic neurons (TH-positive cytoplasms) and four OLs (SOX10-positive nuclei) are visible (DAPI omitted for clarity). Three MSA-typical inclusions are present: two NIIs and one GNI. e, Among eight cells, four OLs aligned in a row and one solitary OL are visible; one OL harbours a nuclear inclusion (pS129aSyn, GNI). As control, diluted homogenates from spontaneously dying homozygous M83+/+ mice were used. Although these brains contain aSyn inclusions, they are not MSA-type, and their homogenates did not induce inclusion pathology in recipient WT mice (not shown). Scale bars, 3 mm (a) and 10 µm (b–e). 3D reconstructions and corresponding videos of selected inclusions are provided in Supplementary Videos 2–6.

Given the structural similarity of the synthetic 1B seed (which does not undergo any sarkosyl purification before cryo-EM analysis) and of 1BP (which does go through this detergent-based purification step before cryo-EM), we can deduce that the extraction procedure has no substantial impact on the structural arrangement of 1BP, which is essentially acquired by templating. Moreover, consistent with the notion that non-extracted 1BP and 1B have similar structures, the pathology seeded by brain homogenates containing 1BP is identical to the one seeded by synthetic 1B.

Together, this indicates that the 1B strain characteristics are encoded in the pseudo-Greek-key motif of the 1B/1BP fold rather than in the unattributable densities specifically observed in either 1B or in 1BP after adaptation. It also indicates that the widening and the sliding of the protofilament interface acquired in 1BP do not impinge on the MSA-like pathology-inducing characteristics of 1B/1BP.

This is in agreement with the observation that the seeding of inclusions by 1B in cultured neurons is insensitive to mutations affecting residues located at the protofilament interface (H50Q, G51D, A53T and A53E) and, instead, it is abrogated by the mutation E46K, which disrupts the Glu46–Lys80 salt bridge latch that is necessary for the stabilization of the pseudo-Greek-key motif in the 1B fold (Extended Data Fig. 12). Notably, the differential impact of the various aSyn mutations on the replication of 1B that we report here is similar to what was reported previously for MSA ‘prions'39,40.

In conclusion, the unattributed densities in 1B and 1BP, as well as the interface adaptations observed in 1BP, do not appear to have a large role in the pathogenic activity of 1B/1BP. In other words, the fold kernel shared by 1B, 1BP and MSA filaments is probably necessary and sufficient to induce both MSA and MSA-like neuropathologies.

The fold kernel of 1B, which is templated with the highest fidelity in 1BP, forms the closed N- and C-pockets (Supplementary Table 1). As previously discussed, such closure accounts for the ThT invisibility of both 1B13,14 and the amplified MSA filaments34. This is particularly relevant given that ThT invisibility is also observed in two other synthetic fibril assemblies of unknown structure, both of which were reported to seed GCIs in vivo21,22,41.

It is therefore tempting to speculate that closed N- and C-pockets are also present in these latter fibrils, further supporting the idea that, within the fold kernel shared by 1B, 1BP and MSA filaments, the closure of the N- and C-pockets represents the minimal common structural determinant responsible for the induction of both MSA and MSA-like pathology.

Here we present the structures of aSyn fibrils 1B as well as of their in vivo seeding product 1BP. Indicative of a high-fidelity conformational replication process, the structures present a high similarity and can perpetuate MSA-like pathology through passage in humanized and WT mice.

This study provides evidence of a protein-only replication process occurring in vivo and evidenced at a resolution of 3.8 Å. The templating fidelity of the synthetic 1B seeds, both in vitro and in the mouse brain, is important given the difficulty of efficiently amplifying MSA brain extracts with structural preservation12. Although we cannot rule out the presence of additional fibril polymorphs different from 1BP in the 1B-inoculated mouse model that may have arisen through secondary nucleation and are undetectable by cryo-EM, the robust propagation of the 1B protofilament fold provides strong support for a prion-like templating mechanism.

This notion is strengthened by our observation that brain homogenates containing 1BP can trigger in WT mice the same MSA inclusion pathology as the one seen after 1B injection, indicating that untemplated secondary nucleations, if any, do not have a substantial role in the MSA pathology seeded by 1B. Instead, the kernel common to 1B and 1BP, here termed the MSA kernel, defines through a templated replication the strain characteristics of the fibrils. This MSA kernel is shared in one of the two protofilaments of MSA fibrils extracted from patient 5 in the seminal study11, as well as the MSA fibrils resulting from the in vitro amplification of the same patient's sample12. To date, it was not possible to purify the fibrils naturally occurring in homozygous M83+/+ mice to compare them with the templated structure of 1BP using cryo-EM. However, we observed that brain homogenates from dying M83+/+ mice were not capable of eliciting any synucleinopathy when injected into the brain of WT mice like it is the case for 1BP-containing brain homogenates (see also Fig. 5 legend). This suggests that either the fibrils in the brains of spontaneously dying M83+/+ mice are a different polymorph, or the fibril titre is too low for stable transmission. Notably, the templating fidelity of the MSA kernel between 1B and 1BP is most pronounced in two particular regions—the N- and C-pockets. These two regions are of particular interest because they define the binding sites for the amyloid probe ThT33, but are closed and not accessible to the dye in the MSA kernel. Our data suggest that structural features of aSyn fibrils—specifically closed N- and C-pockets—are related to their ThT invisibility and their seeding properties, in particular their ability to seed GCIs. This is consistent with the fact that the three synthetic fibril assemblies that have been reported to induce GCIs in mice and rats are all weak ThT binders, and that the fibrils amplified from MSA patient brain samples and CSFs34 are ThT negative as well.

This collectively points to a major pathophysiological role of C- and N-pocket closure with direct relevance to MSA.

In the MSA kernel, the specific binding site around the C-pocket of Ile88 is closed by forming a lever with Phe94, mainly caused by the outward orientation of Ile88. Compared with other aSyn fibril structures with an open C-pocket, in 1B/1BP, the inner hook of the pseudo-Greek-key motif along the stretches of Val74 to Phe94 is shifted by one amino acid position starting at Ala85. As a result, Ala85 points outwards at the most prominent position of the inner hook, which causes a consequential inversion of sidechain positioning for the remaining sequence. In 1B/1BP, this causes Ser87—a known modification site for fibril inhibition by O-Glc-N acylation42 or by phosphorylation43—to be inaccessible and Ile88 to be positioned outwards, undergoing a connection with Phe94 and therefore closing the C-pocket.

Enforcing the post-translational modification of Ser87 or forcing open the C-pocket using small molecules might therefore represent promising means to derail the templating process during fibril growth, and force fibril elongation to take place on a modified template which has lost part of the MSA kernel. This would presumably not prevent fibril growth but could perhaps impinge on the acute replicative and toxic properties of MSA fibrils and slow down disease progression.

The closed N-pocket is a shared characteristic of the 1B and 1BP structures, and this was also observed in the amplified MSA filaments from patient 5 (ref. 12). However, fibrils extracted from patients with MSA11 did not share the closed N-pocket conformation (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). Whether this points to a dispensable pathogenic role of N-pocket closure remains to be determined.

Finally, we note that the ability of crude brain homogenates from patients with MSA to seed pathological inclusions in WT mice has, to our knowledge, not been reported to date. This may be due to a lack of systematic investigation, or it may suggest that the fibrils present in human MSA brain samples are intrinsically less aggressive than 1B or 1BP fibrils. The latter would explain why human MSA brain extracts trigger little MSA-like pathology in M83+/− animals9. If so, the higher infectivity of the 1B/1BP strain could result from the specific structural features not shared with patient-derived fibrils. Notably, these include (1) a closed versus open N-pocket; (2) the pseudosymmetric arrangement of two identical protofilaments in 1B/1BP, as opposed to the asymmetric fold of two distinct protofilaments in MSA fibrils; and (3) additional, unattributed densities in 1B and 1BP, which—although distinct—may obscure chaperone clearance sites in both. The relevance of these structural differences remains to be determined. Regardless of the precise mechanism underlying the high seeding efficiency, it is important to emphasize that, in the absence of previous structural knowledge of synthetic or patient-derived α-synuclein fibrils, such materials should be handled with extreme caution.

Taken together, this study demonstrates the existence of a synthetic aSyn fibril strain that is capable of inducing MSA-like pathology in WT mice and replicates in M83+/− mice through a protein-only templating process. The structures of the fibril seeds and of fibrils formed in vivo highlight the similarity of 1B and MSA fibrils, and postulate a link between fibrillar structure, assembly, mechanism of prion-like seeding and spreading, as well as animal-to-animal transmission.

Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pT7-7 aSyn WT vector43 from Addgene, (plasmid 36046) and plated onto a Luria broth (LB) agar plate containing ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and 1 g l−1 glucose. A preculture in 5 ml of LB medium was inoculated with one clone and incubated at 37 °C under 200 rpm shaking for 4 h. Cells from the LB preculture were recovered by centrifugation (1,000g, 10 min) and used for inoculating 200 ml of LB medium. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C under 200 rpm shaking and then diluted in 2 l of culture. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside during the exponential phase, evaluated at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. Cells were collected after 5 h of culture at 30 °C by centrifugation at 7,000g and 4 °C for 20 min (JLA 8.1000, Beckman Coulter), and the pellet was kept at −20 °C until purification.

The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.2) with protease inhibitor tablets (cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche)) and sonicated at 50% maximum energy, 30 s on and 30 s off for three rounds with a probe sonicator (Q-Sonica). The sonicated pellets were centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min, and the supernatant was saved. The pH of the supernatant was then reduced to pH 3.5 using HCl, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 min and then centrifuged at 60,000g for 30 min. The pellets were discarded. The pH of the supernatant was then increased to pH 7.4 with NaOH and then dialysed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mM NaCl buffer before loading onto a 75 pg HiLoad 26/600 Superdex column equilibrated with the same buffer on the ÄKTA pure system. Monomeric fractions were collected and concentrated if needed by using the Vivaspin 15R 2 kDa cutoff concentrator (Sartorius Stedim). Purification fractions were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) Tris-tricine 13% dying with ProBlue Safe Stain. The protein concentration was evaluated spectrophotometrically on the basis of the absorbance at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 5,960 M−1 cm−1. Quantification of the preparations using the Pierce chromogenic LAL kit indicated a low endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) residual value of 0.03–0.06 EU μg−1 of recombinant protein.

Solutions of monomeric aSyn at 4 to 5 mg ml−1 in saline (H2O, 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.40) were sterilized by filtration through 0.22-μm Millipore single-use filters and stored in sterile 15 ml conical Falcon tubes at 4 °C. Sterilized stock was then distributed into safe-lock Biopur individually sterile-packaged 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes as 500 μl aliquots and were seeded with 1% of 1B strain fibrils13,14,15. The tubes were cap-locked and additionally sealed with parafilm. All of the previous steps were performed aseptically in a particle-free environment under a microbiological safety laminar flow hood. The samples were loaded in a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf) in a 24-position 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube holder equipped with a heating lid. The temperature was set to 37 °C with continuous shaking at 2,000 rpm for 4 days. 1B templating of the fibrillization products was quality-checked using the fibrilloscope13,14,15.

Before intracerebral injections, 1B aSyn fibril stocks (4 mg ml−1) were distributed in cap-locked, sterile 0.5 ml PCR tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sonication was performed at 25 °C in the Bioruptor Plus water bath sonicator (Diagenode) equipped with thermostatic control and an automated tube carousel rotator. The sonication power was set to high, and 10 cycles of 30 s on followed by 10 s off were applied. In agreement with our previous quantifications14, over 80% of the fibrils were 50-nm long or less after application of this protocol (not shown).

Adult 129SV (intrastriatal injections), C57BL/6 (nigral injections) and transgenic M83 (hemizygous, intrastriatal injections) mice were housed in a temperature-controlled (22 °C) and light-controlled environment under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle with forced ventilation (humidity below 50%) and with access to food and water ad libitum. All of the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU) for care of laboratory animals. The study design was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Bordeaux, of the ANSES/Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d'Alfort/Université Paris-Est Créteil and of the University of Salento, and authorized by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research and by the Italian Ministry of Health (APAFIS 33147-2021091711598830 v6, APAFIS 37712-2022061615206629 v8, 0013178-P-17/05/2019). The mice (aged 6–8 weeks) unilaterally received 2 μl of sonicated aSyn fibrils 1B (4 mg ml−1) by stereotactic delivery at a flow rate of 0.4 µl min−1, and the pipette was left in place for 5 min after injection to avoid leakage. Delivery was performed within the right striatum (coordinates from bregma: anteroposterior (AP), −0.1; lateral (L), +2.5; dorsoventral (DV), +3.8), or above the right SN (coordinates from bregma: AP, −2.9; L, −1.3; DV, −4.5). WT mice (n = 20) and transgenic M83 hemizygous mice (n = 28) injected with either PBS, 1B fibrils or brain homogenates were euthanized after 6 weeks, 17 months, 24 months or when reaching the humane end points defined as death regarding the transgenic M83 mice, and were transcardially perfused with either Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 at 4 °C, or with cacodylate buffer 0.1 M with 1 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were subsequently postfixed in the same fixative. For standard neuropathology, the brains were paraffin embedded, and 10-µm-thick sections were cut using a rotative microtome (Leica). The sections of interest were deparaffinized and processed for epitope retrieval: the slides were immersed in citrate buffer pH 6 (Dako Agilent Technologies) and placed into a pressure cooker (Bio SB) at 114–121 °C for 10 min. After a cooling period of 20 min, the slides were washed twice for 5 min in PBS at room temperature. The slides were then processed for simple or double immunofluorescence using the following primary antibodies diluted at 1:500, or their combinations: EP1536Y (Abcam) or pSyn#64 (Wako) for detecting pS129aSyn-positive inclusions; LB509 for detecting human aSyn (Abcam, mouse monoclonal); anti-SOX10 (Abcam, rabbit monoclonal) for detecting OL nuclei; EP1532Y and anti-TH raised in chicken (anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, Abcam) for detecting the nigrostriatal tract; and anti-IBA1 (Abcam) for detecting microglia. DRAQ7 or DAPI were used to image the nuclei. The AlexaFluor-coupled secondary antibodies were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Alexa 488, 568 and 674). The sections were acquired using a Pannoramic slide scanner (3D HISTECH, MM France) in epifluorescence mode, and multichannel fluorescence optical sections of the samples were performed (thickness, <0.8 µm) using either a Zeiss CD7 platform of a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a spectral detector, 488, 561 and 633 nm laser lines, a motorized xy stage and a mixed stepping motor/piezo z controller. The objective was ×40, and the z step size was set to 0.5 µm to produce stacks of 15 to 20 z planes. The pinhole was set to 1 airy unit. For 3D reconstructions and volume rendering/animations (corresponding to 360° tilt series of composite maximum pixel projections images), raw three-channel z-stack images were processed offline using Icy44 (v.2.4.0.0).

Timed inbred-pregnant C57BL/6JOlaHsd (aSyn-knockout) female mice were received from Envigo 2 days before initiation of the primary culture. The pregnant mouse was euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the aSyn-knockout embryos (embryonic day 18) were surgically extracted and cold-euthanized. Cortices were collected from eight of them, pooled and dissociated enzymatically and mechanically (using a neural tissue dissociation kit, C Tubes and an Octo Dissociator with heaters; Miltenyi Biotech) to yield a homogenous cell suspension pool of eight individuals. The cells were then plated at 20,000 per well in 96-well plates (Corning, BioCoat poly-d-lysine imaging plates) in neuronal medium (MACS Neuro Medium, Miltenyi Biotech) containing 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin, 0.5 mM alanyl-glutamine and 2% NeuroBrew supplement (Miltenyi Biotech). The cultures were maintained under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. The medium was changed by one-third every 3 days, until 30 days in vitro (DIV). In such cultures, and under control conditions, neurons represented approximately 85 to 95% of the cell population; thus, for simplicity, they are here referred to as neurons. After 7 DIV, vehicle and sonicated 1B aSyn fibrils were added at a final concentration of 10 nM equivalent monomeric concentration. When relevant, neurons were infected at DIV 10 with AAV (adeno-associated virus) particles (multiplicity of infection, 1,000) carrying the cDNA of aSyn and its variants under the control of the human synapsin promoter, as previously described14. High content analysis (HCA) was performed after fixation and double immunofluorescence staining with the conformation-dependent SynF1 antibody (mouse monoclonal, BioLegend) and the human aSyn-specific MJFR1 antibody (rabbit monoclonal, Abcam) as previously described on images acquired at ×20 using the generic analysis module of an Incucyte S3 (Sartorius) system with Top-Hat segmentation14. For quantifications, the signal integral of the segmented areas in each field of view was recorded. Primary neuronal cultures from C57BL/6 embryos physiologically expressing endogenous mouse aSyn and not transduced with any AAV vector (Extended Data Fig. 1) were produced and analysed similarly but after fixation at DIV 24 and after revealing pS129aSyn with EP1536Y and human aSyn with LB509 antibodies.

The CLEM protocol was performed as previously described26,27. In brief, sections (thickness, 20–40 µm) were cut from perfused mouse brain on a vibratome (Leica VT1200). Immunolabelling against aSyn pathology allowed for the identification of immunopositive sections to be used for further processing with EM. For this, the sections were incubated overnight with a primary EP1536Y (Abcam) antibody at 4 °C followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody staining together with DAPI for cell nuclei identification. Fluorescence images were acquired using the Leica Thunder Tissue Imager equipped with the K8 fluorescent camera. Chosen sections with strong aSyn pathology were prepared for EM by post-fixing in reduced 2% osmium, thiocarbohydrazide and 2% osmium tetroxide, followed by contrasting in 2% uranyl acetate and lead aspartate treatment at 60 °C. The sections were dehydrated with an increasing acetone gradient, before infiltration with EMBED 812 resin for final flat embedding. The hardened sections were imaged again using light microscopy and the sections were overlayed with the overview fluorescence map by using identifiable tissue features. Regions of interest were marked and the coordinates used for laser dissection. The resulting blocks were laser cut using the Leica LMD7 system and glued onto a resin block. Serial sectioning with an ultra-microtome (Leica UC7) produced 120–200-nm-thick tissue sections that were alternatingly collected on EM grids (slot and hexagonal grids) or glass slides. The glass slides were further processed for IHC and Toluidine Blue staining.

Light-microscopy images were acquired at ×40 magnification and correlated to each other for the generation of an image overlay of pathology signal (IHC) and high-contrast tissue morphology (Toluidine Blue). The resulting overlays were then correlated to low magnification (×640 nominal magnification) EM overviews for cell identification by using identifiable tissue features both in the LM and EM images. The identified pathology was finally imaged and merged at high magnification in a tile acquisition series. For EM image acquisition, a Thermo Fisher Scientific Talos F200C with a CETA camera or a CM100 (Phillips) with a TVIPS F416 camera were used. Light-microscopy and EM images were adjusted for brightness and contrast where necessary.

EM grids with tissue sections were placed on a droplet of etching solution (1% periodic acid in water, Sigma-Aldrich), with the sections facing down, for 2.5 min. The grids were washed three times for 2 min in double-distilled H2O, then washed twice for 2 min in washing buffer (stock solution of 10% BSA, Aurion, which was 1:50 diluted in double-distilled H2O), and blocked in blocking solution (Aurion) for 5 min to reduce non-specific binding. The grids were then incubated with primary antibodies (EP1526Y, Abcam, 1:50 diluted in washing buffer) for 60 min, washed 6 times for 2 min in blocking buffer and then incubated in a solution of gold nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm (protein A gold, Aurion, 1:50 diluted in washing buffer) for 90 min. They were washed three times for 2 min in blocking solution, three times for 2 min in washing buffer and four times for 1 min in double-distilled H2O. Finally, the grids were post-stained in 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min and washed three times for 10 s in double-distilled H2O. The sections were imaged using a transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Talos L120C), operated at an operating voltage of 120 kV, and images were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Ceta camera.

Gold particles were detected automatically in the recorded EM images, using FIJI45, by applying a difference-of-Gaussian filter (sigma1 = 10 nm, sigma2 = √2 × sigma1). The resulting image was binarized with a manually selected threshold. Particle detections with an area smaller than 25 nm2 and a circularity (4π × area/perimeter2) below 0.8 were excluded from analysis. The local density of gold was calculated as the decadic logarithm of the sum of a pixel's distance to the 15 closest neighbouring gold particles. The gold particle detection was implemented as a FIJI macro and the density calculation as a Python notebook.

Electron tomography data were collected using the Tomography software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with multisite batch acquisition on the Thermo Fisher Scientific Talos F200C system with tilt series covering −60° to +60° in 2° steps. Tomograms were reconstructed using IMOD46 and filtered with a non-local-means filter with Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Amira v.2021.2). For segmentation, nuclear membranes, fibrils and other membranous parts were manually annotated and traced throughout the tilt-series using Amira. Every few slices, the respective feature of interest was selected by drawing directly onto the image and then interpolated to generate an accurate 3D volume. The final volume was visualized directly in AMIRA.

Extraction of the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of a transgenic M83+/− mouse brain 16 weeks after inoculation with 1B was done using the same procedure as was previously published for fibrils purified from a patient with MSA11. In brief, brain tissue was homogenized in 20 vol. (v/w) extraction buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose and 1 mM EGTA. Homogenates were brought to 2% sarkosyl and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After a 10 min centrifugation at 10,000g, the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl g−1 extraction buffer and centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min. The supernatants were diluted threefold in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 10% sucrose and 0.2% sarkosyl, and centrifuged at 166,000g for 30 min. Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 100 μl g−1 of 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.

A total of 3 µl of non-diluted sample was applied to 100 mesh Ni grids with formvar support (Electron Microscopy Sciences) that were glow-discharged at 15 mA for 60 s. After a 10 min incubation time, the grid was blotted, washed three times for 5 min with incubation solution (0.2% BSA-c/PBS; Aurion) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of pS129aSyn antibody (EP1536Y, Abcam, ab51253) diluted 1:100 in incubation solution. The grid was washed six times for 5 min and incubated for 2 h in a solution containing gold nanobeads (diameter 6 nm) coupled to an anti-rabbit antibody (Aurion), diluted 1:50 in incubation solution. After washing six times for 5 min in incubation solution and three times for 5 min in PBS, the grid was immersed in 1% uranyl acetate for 40 s, blotted and air-dried. The grid was imaged on the Talos transmission electron microscope at an operating voltage of 200 kV (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cryo-EM grids were prepared using the Leica GP2 plunge freezer in a BSL-2 environment at room temperature. Quantifoil 300-mesh gold grids were glow-discharged in air for 90 s. Grids were prepared using 3 µl of 1:1 and 1:2 diluted fibril samples in preparation buffer (H2O, 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.40) and vitrification by rapid freezing in liquid ethane. The grids were screened for the presence of non-clustered fibres and high-resolution images were acquired with an automated EPU (v3.10) setup on the Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios G4 electron microscope equipped with a cold-FEG 300 kV electron source and a Falcon4i camera. In total, 11,879 dose-fractionated videos (EER) were collected with a total dose of 40 e− Å−2 at a pixel spacing of 0.66 Å at the sample level. A defocus range of between −0.8 μm and −1.8 μm was used during the acquisition.

The sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of a transgenic M83+/− mouse brain was diluted 1:3 in Tris-HCl, 50 mM, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and 2.5 µl was applied to a Quantifoil 300-mesh gold grid, coated with an additional 5-nm-thick carbon layer. The grid was not glow-discharged. Then, 30 s after applying the sample, the grid was blotted from the front side for 6 s and plunge-frozen at room temperature and 80% humidity in a Leica GP2 plunge freezer. A total of 42,812 exposures was collected on the Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electron microscope equipped with a cold-FEG 300 kV electron source and a Falcon4i camera. The total dose applied per video (EER) was 50 e− Å−2 and the pixel spacing was 0.732 Å. A defocus range of between −0.8 μm and −2.2 μm was used during the acquisition.

All the subsequent image processing and helical reconstruction was carried out in RELION (v.4.0)47 (Extended Data Fig. 13). The recorded videos were gain-corrected, motion-corrected and dose-weighted using RELION's own implementation of MOTIONCOR. The raw EER files were dose-fractionated to a total of 32 frames (1.23 e− Å−2 per frame). After CTF estimation using Ctffind (v.4.1)48, the aligned averages that had an estimated CTF resolution of better than 5 Å were selected, resulting in a total of 11,879 micrographs. aSyn fibres were picked manually as start-to-end helical segments and extracted with an interbox distance of 19 Å. Several rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed to exclude suboptimal 2D segments from further processing. The four best classes were selected and binned four times to re-extract the segments with a bigger box size encompassing the entire helical crossover. Clearly visible twisted class averages containing the entire crossover were used to generate initial de novo models using the relion_helix_inimodel2d program. The most likely twist was estimated from a crossover distance measured from 2D class averages and corroborated with the direct measurements from micrographs.

The helical segments (105,496) from the entire dataset were then re-extracted with a 600 pixel box size (binned by 2) comprising about 40% of the crossover. Exclusion of the suboptimal classes after 2D classification resulted in 64,889 particles. Multiple rounds of 3D autorefinement were carried out to optimize the helical twist and rise, and to check for the correct symmetry operators. This was validated from the reconstructions showing clear separation of β-strands along the helical axis. Imposing a 21 cork-screw symmetry (pseudo two-fold symmetry) yielded the clear separation of β-strands when compared to C1 and C2 symmetries. A 3D classification without image alignment was further performed to exclude the segments that gave suboptimal 3D volumes. This resulted in a final 51,272 particles. These were finally re-extracted at a 512 pixel (unbinned) box size and subjected to 3D autorefinement, followed by CTF refinement. Further iterations of Bayesian polishing coupled with CTF refinement yielded a map at 1.94 Å. The maps were sharpened using the standard post-processing procedure in RELION with an ad hoc B factor of 21 Å2.

The atomic model for the backbone of the core of the 1B fibrils encompassing residues 34 to 95 was built de novo using Coot49 (v.0.9.8.96) Initially, three β-rungs were modelled in coot and were refined in real-space in PHENIX45 (v.1.21.2) Finally, these chains were extended to 9 β-rungs per protofilament and refined in tandem with phenix.real_space_refine and in coot to improve the Ramachandran and Geometric statistics. NCS and secondary structural restraints were included during the iterative refinement process.

As most of the 42,812 collected videos did not contain any fibrillar material, they were first imported into cryoSPARC50 (v.4.7.0), motion corrected and manually inspected using a manually_curate_exposures job. After manual inspection, 156 videos with intact, twisting fibrils were selected for further processing in RELION447. They were dose-fractionated in RELION's MOTIONCOR implementation with 24 frames per fraction, corresponding to a dose of 1.28 e− Å−2 per frame, and CTF-corrected using Ctffind (v.4.1)48. Fibrils were found to cluster into three morphological groups (Extended Data Fig. 8). Manual picking was done in three rounds, using 209, 7 and 40 videos for the three respective groups. After extraction with binning of 2 and an inter-box distance of 14.4 Å (3 asymmetrical units), several rounds of 2D classification were applied. One of the three morphological groups (40 videos) yielded 2D classes for which a clear twist and monomer separation was visible, while the other two morphological groups did not yield any interpretable result.

Using the 2D class averages of the one usable group, a de novo initial model was generated using relion_helix_inimodel2d. Particles were re-extracted with a box size of 800 and a binning of 2 and, after multiple rounds of 2D classification, 1,913 particles were retained for a 3D classification job with 1 class and the de-novo inimodel2d reconstruction as initial model. When a fibril backbone was visible, the regularisation parameter (T) was gradually increased to 12 over the course of 50 iterations, and the result was used for a 3D refinement with a tau2 fudge factor of 2 to search for the optimal helical rise and twist. After CTF refinement and postprocessing, a 3D map at a resolution of 3.8 Å was obtained.

To build the 1BP atomic model, one β-rung of the 1B model was fitted into the 1BP density using a rigid-body fit in ChimeraX51 (v.1.10.1), followed by a jiggle-fit and all-atom refinement in Coot49 (v.0.9.8.96). Position 53 was mutated into a threonine and the model was extended to five β-rungs, which were refined together in phenix.real_space_refine (PHENIX v.1.21.2). After refinement, the outer two β-rungs were removed in Coot. NCS and secondary structural restraints were included during the iterative refinement process.

h-FTAA was synthesized and purified as previously described36 and paraffin-embedded sections of 1B-injected WT mouse brains (129SV) and regions from human donor brain samples were stained with h-FTAA and processed for immunofluorescence against pS129aSyn (EP1536Y) for the inclusions or against human aSyn (LB509) for the 1B inoculate and counterstained with the nuclear marker DAPI as previously described37. To confirm previous observations regarding the ability of h-FTAA to discriminate between Lewy bodies and GCIs using FLIM37, human brain samples from one individual with MSA and one individual with DLB were obtained from the repository of the University Hospital of Bordeaux (CRB-BBS). Participants or a legal representative had given informed written consent for collecting and using clinical and post-mortem data, and mandatory regulatory approval for post-mortem brain tissue use was obtained from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESR AC-2024-6715, DC-2024-6714). FLIM was performed on the Leica SP8 WLL2 confocal microscope on an inverted stand DMI6000 (Leica Microsystems), using the HCX Plan Apo CS2 ×63 oil NA 1.40 objective. This microscope was equipped with a pulsed white-light laser 2 (WLL2) with freely tuneable excitation from 470 to 670 nm (1 nm steps) and a diode laser at 405 nm. A FALCON module enabled us to perform FLIM measurement based on the time correlated single photon counting technique. The FLIM analysis was done using phasor plot representation of the data and was focused on pS129aSyn-positive inclusions37 or LB509-positive regions in the case of the 1B inoculate. Similitude analysis was performed using the Jaccard index52. For Gallyas silver impregnation, mouse brain sections were processed as previously described38 using a commercial Gallyas staining kit (Morphisto).

1B aSyn fibrils were deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica disk and left to adhere for 15 min in a humid chamber at room temperature. The sample was rinsed and imaged in saline buffer solution (H2O, HEPES 20 mM, NaCl 100 mM, pH 7.4). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging was performed using the Dimension FastScan setup (Bruker) operating in PeakForce Quantitative Nano-Mechanics (PF-QNM) mode in liquid at room temperature, using sharp SNL-C probes (Bruker, Silicon tips on silicon nitride cantilevers), with a nominal spring constant of 0.24 N m−1, a resonance frequency of 56 kHz and a nominal tip radius of 2 nm. Fibrils were imaged with a peak force frequency of 1 kHz, a scan rate of 0.5 Hz and a constant setpoint force of 500 pN. Image analysis was performed using Nanoscope analysis (Bruker).

For all experiments/conditions without quantitative analyses, the images shown were representative of at least three independent observations. In all other cases, statistical analyses data were presented as means ± s.d. or as otherwise stated in the figure legends, and were performed using GraphPad Prism (v.9). The numbers of independent samples as well as the statistics tests used are indicated in the figure legends for each experiment. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was determined based on our previous publications. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, although this was not tested. Data assignment, organization and collection were randomized. Data collection and analysis were not performed blindly. No animals or datapoints were excluded from the analysis.

a. Topographical (Height Sensor) and nano-mechanical mapping (Derjaguin-Müller-Toporov (DMT) Modulus, log representation) of 1B fibrils using AFM in liquid. Right panels: fibril height values (see cartoon for definitions) for n = 103 measurements (plot population statistics descriptors as shown in plot inset), and left twist periodicity for n = 12 fibrils. Scale bars = 240 nm. b. Examples of early “seeding junctions” between 1B and the nascent seeded inclusions in neuronal processes two weeks post seeding (arrowheads = seeding junctions). 96-well pooled primary cultures of cortical neurons from 8 wild-type mouse embryos (C57BL/6) were challenged at day-in-vitro 7 (DIV7) with 10 nM 1B fibrils (equivalent aSyn monomer concentration). The neurons were fixed two weeks later at DIV24 and both the 1B input fibril remnants (red) and the seeded aSyn inclusions (green) were revealed. Indeed, we took advantage of the fact that synthetic 1B is made of human aSyn and thus that it can be specifically recognized by LB509 which is a human aSyn-specific antibody. Mouse aSyn is LB509 negative. The seeded inclusions were revealed contemporary using EP1536Y against pS129 aSyn. This allowed us to observe many seeding junctions in the neuronal processes (arrows). Note that in a majority of images, and in agreement with early reports, the seed (1B in our case) is not phosphorylated, and that the growing seeded inclusions are instead pS129Syn-positive. At later time points 1B seeds get overwhelmed and are no longer discernible in the mass of the seeded inclusions (not shown). The disappearance of the 1B seeds is even faster in vivo (within a few days, not shown). (scale bars = 10 µm).

Source data

Depending on the neuroanatomical structure and the time point under consideration, experimental GCIs (blue) coexisted with a variable load of surrounding neuronal somatic aSyn inclusions (NCIs & NIIs, both in red), which represent the forefront of the somatic aSyn pathology at earlier time points to progressively make way to a growing population of GCIs. The brain sections are the ones shown in Fig. 1f and were stained with DAPI for nuclei, Sox10 to identify the oligodendrocytes, and EP1536Y for pS129Syn. All the inclusions were manually annotated according to these 3 markers. Anatomical quantification regions were as follows: Am: amygdala; ACa: anterior limb of the anterior commissure; ACp: posterior limb of the anterior commissure; BN: bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; CX: cortex; St: caudate putamen (striatum); SN: substantia nigra. In agreement with visual perception, the neuronal inclusions peak at 12 months in the Caudate putamen (St) and the Amygdala (AM) to decrease at 24 months, while the GCIs suddenly increase in the posterior limb of the Anterior Commissure at 12 months, and then in most of the other brain regions. Note that NIIs form especially early (at 6 weeks) in the SN and the AM, then in other regions at 12 months, to eventually disappear but in the AM at 24 months. The mean number of GCIs in all regions at 24 months is significantly increased compared to the 2 other time points (Mean ± SD of the regions shown together with the individual region inclusion number values, * = one-way ANOVA p < 0.05: p = 0.0462 for 6w/24 m, p = 0.0278 for 12 m/24 m).

It was previously reported that FLIM of h-FTAA can be used in histological brain sections to differentiate the aSyn fibrils populating Lewy bodies (LBs) from those populating GCIs in MSA37. These findings established h-FTAA as a conformation-sensitive amyloid probe capable of discriminating distinct aSyn fibril strains in human brain sections via FLIM37. In agreement with these previous observations, FLIM of h-FTAA allowed us to derive fibril strain-specific phasor plot signatures directly on brain tissue sections. Using this approach, we confirmed that h-FTAA FLIM could indeed discriminate the pS129Syn-positive inclusion pathology of MSA vs. DLB (a: h-FTAA intensity images - pS129Syn not shown) and used the disease-specific hotspots in the respective FLIM phasor plots to define 2D quantification gates (b,c) (α, β: MSA-specific; χ: DLB-specific). The fluorescence lifetime of the gated pixels is shown in d for respectively GCIs (26,6 million inclusion pixels gated) and LBs (3.3 million inclusion pixels gated). In agreement with previously published data37, the distribution histograms make it clear that the majority of pixels belonging to LBs are characterized by a fluorescence lifetime which is in the nanosecond range, while those populating GCIs show an approximately halved fluorescence lifetime with 2 distinguishable populations. Scale bar = 20 μm.

The phasor plot gates discriminating GCIs and LBs described in Extended Data Fig. 9 were applied in the phasor plots of the intracerebral 1B fibril inoculate (positive to the anti-human aSyn antibody LB509, not shown), still observable in the CP of wild-type mice 24 h after injection (a, from left to right: h-FTAA intensity image, corresponding phasor plot with gates and quantifications, distribution of gated pixels in image) or in the plots characterizing the inclusions that formed in neurons and OLs during the 16 months following 1B injection (pS129Syn-positive, not shown) (b). The number of inclusion pixels quantified by FLIM and gated in α, β, and χ was >106 in each case, and the distribution of the pixel population in the phasor gates α+β, and χ was eventually used to score the similarity of the different fibril inclusion types (Supplementary Information Table 3).

a. 96-well pooled primary cultures of cortical neurons from 8 aSyn-KO mouse embryos were challenged or not at day-in-vitro 7 (DIV7) with 10 nM 1B fibrils (equivalent aSyn monomer concentration), and infected or not with AAV-aSyn or AAV-E46K aSyn at DIV11. The neurons were fixed at DIV30 and the aSyn inclusions revealed using the conformation-dependent antibody SynF1 (red); three immunofluorescence fields of views (FOVs) imaged in a test well for each condition, illustrate: (i) the absence of SynF1and human aSyn signal at DIV30 in the absence of endogenous aSyn (aSyn-/- line, left column), (ii) aSyn inclusion seeding by 1B in conditions of aSyn expression (aSyn -/- + 1B line, middle and right column), and (ii) a minor inclusion seeding when E46K aSyn is expressed instead of wild-type aSyn (aSyn -/- + 1B line, right versus middle column). b. High Content Analysis of the experiment shown in (a) and extended to a series of aSyn mutants based on 18 FOVs from 6 wells for each condition. Mean ± SD as well as individual values are plotted for each condition The AAV-aSyn condition was doubled to document robustness. Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post-hoc Dunn's test for multiple comparisons indicates that E46K aSyn is the only mutation reducing inclusion seeding by 1B (p = 0.0001). In the AAV-only conditions, human aSyn deriving from AAV infection was quantified using the human aSyn-specific antibody MJFR1 (no endogenous mouse aSyn is present in these neurons). The results were compared with the same test and post-hoc test combination as before, which indicated the absence of statistically significant differences in terms of levels of expression driven by the different AAVs. In particular, no statistically significant difference existed between AAV wt aSyn and AAV E46K aSyn in terms of expression levels, indicating that the difference seen with SynF1 after seeding with 1B was not due to a lesser expression of E46K aSyn. Scale bar = 100 μm.

The background colour represents data preprocessing (grey), binned processing (green), and unbinned processing (yellow). 1. During data acquisition the first 1'334 micrographs (Electron Event Recordings) were processed during the session, to assess the quality of the dataset on the fly. 2. The remaining 19'636 micrographs were processed after the data acquisition had completed and were later introduced to the dataset at step 6 and 11 respectively. 3. For initial analysis manually traced fibril segments were extracted with a box size of 600px, binned to 300px. 4. From the full dataset selections were made based on the estimated CTF resolution to reduce the amount of manual screening of the full dataset. As such two groups were analysed: Add values. Manual picking of particles was done in parallel to the processing of the extracted particles from 3. 5. Initial 3D-Classification was done with a featureless cylinder as a low-pass filtered reference volume. 6. The first set of additional particles from the full data set was introduced to the processing. 7. The full particle batch was cleaned by multiple rounds of 2D classification and was subsequently refined to 2.66Å with a reference volume from the previously obtained 4.95Å structure from the initial screening. 8. With a well-aligned structure, the data was transitioned to unbinned processing, and the respective particles were re-extracted. 9. The second set of additional particles from the full dataset was extracted at the unbinned box size. No further manual selection of the full dataset was made. 10. After transitioning to the unbinned box size the refinement was redone on the 2.66Å structure. 11. All particles are joined together for the final processing. 12. The structure was subjected to Refinement and PostProcessing with intermediate steps of Polish and 13. CTF refinement until the final high-resolution structure was obtained. 14.

A r.m.s.d. of less than 1 Å suggests high similarity in the structural conformation. Supplementary Table 2: cryo-EM data collection, refinement and validation statistics. Supplementary Table 3: in situ comparison of 1B inoculate, 1B-seeded inclusions, GCIs in MSA and LBs in DLB using h-FTAA FLIM analysis of human and WT mouse brain tissue sections. Inclusion pixels quantified by FLIM and gated in α, β and χ in Extended data Fig. 10 (>106 in each case) were used for comparison of inoculate and inclusions. For each condition, the percentage of the inclusion pixel population situated in the phasor gates α + β (MSA specific) and χ (DLB specific) (Extended data Fig. 9) was used to score the similarity of the different fibril inclusions types using the Jaccard similarity index52. Similarity matrix analysis demonstrates that both the input 1B fibrils and the resulting inclusions seeded in WT mice exhibit a high degree of conformational similarity which is shared with the MSA fibrils, and distinct from the DLB ones. Colour code: green, similar; yellow, dissimilar.

As a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) activates heterotrimeric G proteins by opening the Gα α-helical domain (AHD) to enable GDP–GTP exchange, with GDP release representing the rate-limiting step1,2. Here, using pharmacological assays, we show that agonist efficacy correlates with decreased GDP affinity, promoting GTP exchange, whereas antagonists increase GDP affinity, dampening activation. Further investigating this phenomenon, we provide 8 unique structural models and 16 cryogenic electron microscopy maps of MOR with naloxone or loperamide, capturing several intermediate conformations along the activation pathway. These include four GDP-bound states with previously undescribed receptor–G protein interfaces, AHD arrangements and transitions in the nucleotide-binding pocket required for GDP release. Naloxone stalls MOR in a ‘latent' state, whereas loperamide promotes an ‘engaged' state, which is structurally poised for opening of the AHD domain and subsequent GDP release. These findings, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, identify GDP-bound intermediates and AHD conformations as key determinants of nucleotide exchange rates, providing structural and mechanistic insights into G protein activation and ligand efficacy with broad implications for G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology.

Among the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), MOR stands out as one of the most clinically important, and is extensively targeted for pain management3,4. However, the high abuse liability and association with life-threatening side effects of MOR-targeting agonists has made addressing these concerns a priority in current drug development strategies5,6,7. Several modulators are available to treat opioid overdose, with naloxone as the therapeutically most widely deployed example8. It is commonly considered an antagonist, whereas some previous literature has demonstrated low efficacy partial agonist activity9,10,11. Partial agonists have generally emerged as promising candidates for achieving safer therapeutic profiles, over conventionally used MOR agonists12. However, the ability to design ligands with customized efficacy is limited by an incomplete mechanistic understanding of how different levels of agonism are transmitted intracellularly.

Opioid agonists regulate signalling by binding to opioid receptors, which primarily signal through Gi/o-type G proteins. MOR-mediated signalling involves an interaction with the G protein that promotes the transition of the G protein from its inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric form (Gαβγ) to an active state, in which GTP replaces GDP and the complex dissociates into GTP-bound Gα and Gβγ subunits. The rate-limiting step in this process is the release of GDP from the Gα subunit, which is tightly bound under resting conditions1,2. Following activation, the subunits then engage downstream effectors to propagate signals such as adenylyl cyclase inhibition and potassium channel stimulation. In the Gα subunit, nucleotide binding, exchange and GTP hydrolysis are governed by conserved structural motifs at the interface between the Ras-homology domain (RHD) and AHD. Motifs on the RHD that coordinate nucleotides include the TCAT motif in the β6–α5 loop and the P loop on α1, which binds the nucleotide phosphates. On the AHD, Switch I together with αE and αF provide extra coordinating contacts. Receptor-induced extension, rotation and translation of the α5 helix into the receptor are proposed to destabilize nucleotide binding, facilitating GDP release13.

In GPCR pharmacology, ligands are classified on the basis of their mode and extent of modulation of downstream signalling, a property known as efficacy: antagonists block activation, full agonists produce maximal activation, partial agonists yield submaximal responses and superagonists yield supramaximal responses, relative to a reference agonist14. A central question in GPCR pharmacology therefore concerns how different levels of ligand efficacy are linked to conformational states of the receptor–G protein complex. Although a variety of models have been proposed in the literature, the varying capacity of agonists to activate heterotrimeric G proteins has been linked to decreasing GDP affinity, increasing GTP affinity or a combination thereof2,15,16,17,18. In the past, several groups have reported a direct correlation between the efficacy of GPCR agonists and a corresponding decrease in GDP affinity at the cognate G protein16,17,19,20,21. Further, single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy and double electron–electron resonance experiments at MOR described a correlation between ligand efficacy and GDP release rates, by modulating the equilibrium of nucleotide-bound receptor–G protein complex states18,22. In summary, GDP-bound states have a critical role in G protein activation. However, high-resolution structural snapshots of these intermediate states have thus far been lacking, limiting our mechanistic understanding of GPCR signalling. Here we report pharmacological assays, single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, confirming that efficacy is indeed correlated with GDP release rates, which are modulated by the stabilization of specific conformational states.

To investigate the contradictory description of naloxone efficacy, we initially performed in vitro signalling assays. We deployed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensors monitoring the status of the G protein heterotrimer23,24 (TRUPATH), receptor–G protein (RG-BRET)23,25, the ONE-GO toolkit26 and a cyclic AMP (cAMP) biosensor (GloSensor) as a downstream signalling assay. In these assays, we used the inverse agonist alvimopan, naloxone, partial agonist mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, the reference full agonist (d-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol)-enkephalin (DAMGO) and the superagonist loperamide (Lop). Naloxone fell within the range of efficacies between alvimopan and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, unequivocally confirming partial agonist activity in all assay systems, ranging from 10% to 30% (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). To confirm partial agonism of naloxone at MOR, we conducted radioligand binding experiments using [³H]naltrexone, a close chemical analogue of naloxone, which showed a decrease in binding affinity with increasing concentrations of GDPβS (Ki 0.35 nM → 27.2 nM, Extended Data Fig. 1e). This is in agreement with pioneering work that showed that opioid agonist binding is negatively affected by the presence of nucleotides, although naloxone binding was shown to be unaffected by nucleotides in these studies27.

Next, we tested the hypothesis linking ligand efficacy to nucleotide binding affinities by adopting the RG-BRET assay23. In this assay, which we coined ‘nuc-BRET', we detect nucleotide dose-dependent changes in BRET signal, as a proxy of nucleotide affinities. To minimize the competition with endogenous nucleotides, we permeabilized cells expressing MOR–Rluc8 and Gαi1β1γ2–GFP2 with digitonin, and hydrolysed nucleotides using apyrase. Next, we carried out a nucleotide dose–response experiment, using non-hydrolysable nucleotide derivatives (GDPβS and GTPγS, Extended Data Fig. 2a–g). MOR in the apo state showed a GDPβS half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 57 ± 14 nM (GTPγS 3.8 ± 0.18 nM). Confirming the effect of agonists on decreasing GDP affinities, we observed a roughly 30-fold increase in GDPβS EC50 of 1.7 ± 0.7 µM with loperamide (GTPγS 25 ± 4.4 nM). Alvimopan increased the affinity below the apo condition with GDPβS EC50 of 14.7 ± 10 nM (GTPγS 4.1 ± 0.73 nM), all remaining compounds showed a detectable decrease, including naloxone with GDPβS EC50 of 89 ± 8.5 nM (GTPγS 3.9 ± 0.36 nM), mitragynine pseudoindoxyl with GDPβS EC50 of 150 ± 39 nM (GTPγS 2.0 ± 0.64 nM) and DAMGO with GDPβS EC50 of 0.7 ± 0.16 µM (GTPγS 11.6 ± 4.1 nM). All agonists had a modest but consistent negative effect on GTP affinities. These findings provide a clear link between ligand efficacy and GDP affinities. To further validate our findings in the cellular context, we performed experiments with intact cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). We observed the same overall trends, however, signal changes for alvimopan and naloxone were too small to interpret, probably due to the competition with endogenous nucleotides.

Average cytoplasmic concentrations are estimated at 50 µM of GDP and 500 µM of GTP28, suggesting a constant competition pressure between the two nucleotides. We next adopted our nuc-BRET assay to mimic this competition, with increasing concentrations of GDPβS (0 µM, 0.01 µM, 0.1 µM and 1 µM), while determining GTPγS EC50s. The EC50 for GTP in the apo condition ranged from 2.9 ± 0.68 nM to 13 ± 2.0 nM, alvimopan 4.5 ± 0.58 nM to 39 ± 5.3 nM, naloxone 3 ± 0.89 nM to 17 ± 3.9 nM, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl 5 ± 0.82 nM to 12 ± 3.55 nM, DAMGO 8.7 ± 2.4 nM to 16 ± 5.1 nM and loperamide 26 ± 5.9 nM to 45 ± 6.02 nM. Although all conditions showed some degree of competition, GTP binding was only minimally affected in the agonist bound state and was more affected in the presence of an inverse agonist (Extended Data Fig. 2e), suggesting that inverse agonists act by enhancing the competition between the two nucleotides. Finally, we show a clear inverse correlation between signalling efficacies across all signalling assays and the respective GDPβS EC50s (R2 = 0.86, Extended Data Fig. 2h).

To gain mechanistic insights into GDP affinity modulation, we next turned to single particle cryoEM experiments (Extended Data Figs. 3–6). On the basis of our nuc-BRET experiments, we speculated that we would be able to capture GDP-bound MOR–Gi complexes, using wild-type receptor and G protein sequences. To prepare GDP-bound specimens, we incubated nucleotide-free complexes bound to either naloxone or loperamide, before grid freezing with 100 µM GDPβS for 1 h on ice (‘re-bound GDP'). Our rationale for this protocol (‘re-bound GDP') is based on a rich history of experimental approaches in GPCR pharmacology. Given that GDP release and binding are thought to be reversible18,29,30, many experimental strategies begin with nucleotide-free complexes, followed by the supplementation with GDP, to investigate the role of GDP-bound GPCR–G protein complexes. These include radioligand binding27,31, [35S]GTPγS binding15,32, single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy21,22, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry33,34, BRET assays35,36 and structural biology experiments37. To validate our findings, we also performed control experiments with GDP present at all times during the purification (‘constant GDP'), as outlined below (Extended Data Fig. 6). We confirmed that cellular concentrations of Mg2+ had no detectable effect on GDP affinities, while significantly improving GTP affinities (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g) and, hence, omitted Mg2+ from our biochemical preparations of GDP-bound MOR–Gαi complexes.

Using a single particle cryoEM pipeline, we obtained six conformational states along the MOR activation pathway. Among these, we observed four distinct GDPβS-bound states, obtained from the respective specimen (Fig. 1a), providing structural snapshots of the initial steps of G protein engagement and activation. We named these states latent, engaged, unlatched and primed, between which we observed a series of conformational rearrangements showing a progressive decrease in the number of GDP-coordinating residues (Fig. 3b). In addition, to obtain data points before G protein coupling and after nucleotide release, we determined an inactive MOR (3.4 Å) and a nucleotide-free MOR–Gi structure (3.0 Å). Considering underlying mechanisms of ligand efficacy, throughout the article, we are describing a detailed comparison between: (1) naloxone ‘latent' (3.8 Å), (2) loperamide ‘engaged' (3.2 Å), (3) loperamide ‘unlatched' (3.2 Å) and (4) loperamide ‘primed' (2.9 Å). Starting with this series of structures, we also performed extensive MD simulations.

The initial engagement between inactive MOR and GDP–Gαi1β1γ2, occurs through a unique interface. Unlike all previously determined structures, the G protein is rotated by 60°, relative to the receptor (Fig. 2a–c), and is engaged through all three intracellular loops (ICLs): ICL1 with Gβ1 (Fig. 2d), ICL2 with the αN helix associating with R24 (Fig. 2e), compared with R32 in the nucleotide-free state (Fig. 2g), ICL3 interacts extensively with the α5 helix (Fig. 2f).

An initial step in G protein activation is breaking of the ‘hydrophobic core' of the Gα subunit, formed between the α5, β2–β3 and α1. This occurs during the extension of α5 into the receptor core and has been linked to GDP release13 (Fig. 3c,d). ICL3 shows contacts with several motifs that are part of, or connected to, this hydrophobic core (Fig. 2f). Comparing the latent state G protein to the receptor-free GDP–Gαi1β1γ2 (PDB: 1GP2), we observe important differences. In contrast to GDP–Gαi1β1γ2, the C-terminal α5 helix in the latent state, is extended and fully resolved (Fig. 2a). The four terminal residues protrude into the detergent micelle, and engage with the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane (TM) helices TM5 and TM6. The terminal F354 is surrounded by TM6 residues R2756.28, R2786.31, R2826.35 (superscript values indicate Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering for GPCRs38), as well as T2816.34, which all have a critical role in coordinating the conserved DRY motif39, indicative of a regulatory role of this interaction (Fig. 2f).

Specifically, the translation of the α5 helix towards the receptor core, and a partial retraction of the TCAT loop. d, Overview of the hydrophobic core of Gαi, including α5 helix, TCAT loop, α1 and α3, highlighting conformational changes across three conformational states (engaged, unlatched, primed), and most importantly translation and rotation of α5, resulting in retraction of the TCAT loop, and rearrangement of β6. e, αF transition and α1 movement across latent, engaged and primed states, required for GDP release. f, Successive change in relative angle between Gα and Gβ subunits. g, Comparison of SwI, P loop and SwIII across states. h, Nucleotide-binding pocket, highlighting rearrangements of E43 and R178 from a closed ‘seatbelt' conformation in GDP–Gαi1β1γ2 (PDB ID 1GP2) to latent state. i, Nucleotide-binding pocket, highlighting R178 protruding towards Mg2+ binding pocket in the engaged state, compared with GTP-bound Gαi1 (PDB ID 1GIL). j, α1, TCAT and P loop transitions towards the nucleotide-free state.

The most intricate aspect of the latent interface is between ICL3 and key motifs of the Gαi heterotrimer (Fig. 2f). ICL3 and TM6 protrude into the cleft between Gαi and Gβ1. It is lined by residues R265, M266, S268, K2716.24, interacting with residues on the α5 helix, αN helix and D261 (Fig. 2f). Our MD simulations confirm that the receptor–G protein interface observed in this latent state is stable, showing a similar total number of interacting residues as the nucleotide-free-state interface, but fewer average numbers of contacts (Fig. 2j). To validate this binding interface, we carried out mutagenesis experiments of residues that are unique to the latent versus engaged/‘active-like' state (Fig. 2k). Most of these tested mutants showed reduced ligand efficacy, confirming that this state has a physiological role in signalling.

Compared with GDP–Gαi1β1γ2, many backbone and side-chain interactions between the G protein and GDP remain intact in the latent state, including E43-T48 (P loop), K270, E272, L273 (β5/αG), C325-T327 (TCAT loop) of the RHD and D150-S151 (αD-αE loop), R176 (αF) and R178 (SwI) of the AHD (Extended Data Fig. 7b,h). However, we see a significant overall decrease of backbone (29 to 19) and side-chain (58 to 45) interactions. These are, in part, explained by a partial or complete loss of side-chain contacts of E43 (P loop), D150 (αD-αE loop) and N269 (NKxD) (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Conversely, residues R176 (αF) and R178 (SwI) gain side-chain interactions (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7b,h). Binding of receptor-free Gβγ to Gαi1, promotes hydrogen bond formation between E43 and R178, stabilizing a ‘seatbelt'-like conformation that occludes the nucleotide-binding pocket and may hinder GDP release40 (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 7a,g). In the latent state, E43 loses this interaction, whereas R178 coordinates the phosphate groups of GDP, analogous to the GDP-bound monomeric Gαi41 (Fig. 3h) and the scFv16-bound GDP–Gαi heterotrimer structure42. This transition was also predicted to be required for GTP binding and hydrolysis43. Furthermore, D150 loses most of its non-polar contacts with the ribose and the guanine groups (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7b,h). The above rearrangements in the latent structure suggest a potential nucleating point for GDP release, and the initiation of the AHD opening. Confirming this hypothesis, although four MD trajectories closely resemble receptor-free GDP–Gαi1β1γ2, we observed transient AHD opening (Extended Data Fig. 8k and Supplementary Video 1).

On transitioning to the ‘engaged' state, the G protein undergoes an extension of the α5 helix by 14 Å, rotation by 60° around its longest axis, translation towards MOR by 6 Å and sinks into the RHD by 3 Å (Fig. 3d,e), resulting in an interface identical to the nucleotide-free state. At the same time, MOR shows all classical features of activation. These include the opening of TM6, accompanied by canonical conformational rearrangements in microswitch motifs. These rearrangements are accompanied by the disruption of critical G protein–nucleotide contacts and displacement of the conserved F336 from its hydrophobic pocket formed by β2, β3 and α1, altering the network that stabilizes GDP binding (Fig. 3). The engaged state remains in a closed AHD conformation, although showing a rotation relative to the RHD by 13° towards αN, and straightening of αA (Fig. 3a,e). Within the nucleotide-binding pocket, this state shows a partial retraction of the TCAT loop, whereas the C325 hydrogen bond with GDP remains intact (Fig. 3b,j). On its translation towards the receptor, F334 on α5 points towards the TCAT loop, and H322 on β6 remains pointing towards the Gαi C terminus (Fig. 3c,d). The α1/P loop moves towards TCAT by 1.2 Å, and continues on this trajectory throughout the next conformational states. Coinciding with the AHD rotation, we observe interesting conformational changes. The R176 rotamer on αF tilts up by 20° towards TCAT. D150 on αE loses the remaining hydrophobic contacts with GDP, whereas the only remaining AHD residue interacting with GDP is S151 (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7c,i). Furthermore, it results in a reconfiguration of the SwI motif. SwI is partly open and splays towards α1, resulting in a rotation of R178 by almost 90°. The guanidinium group of R178 now occupies the cavity that forms the Mg2+ pocket (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1GIL, ref. 44) (Fig. 3i) resulting in an ionic interaction with D200 from β3 and the β phosphate. This R178 conformation remains stable across all five MD trajectories (Extended Data Fig. 8k). Overall, we observe a loss of backbone (19 to 18) and side-chain (45 to 34) interactions with GDP (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7c,i). Given that the SwI coordination of GDP is critical for maintaining a closed AHD conformation, the rearrangements observed in this transient state probably initiates AHD opening. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that three MD trajectories resulted in a transient opening of the AHD and one trajectory showed complete opening (Extended Data Fig. 8c,h,k and Supplementary Video 1).

The unlatched state adopts a dynamic AHD, analogous to previous nucleotide-free-state MOR–G protein structures. Despite a series of conformational changes around the nucleotide-binding pocket, we observed an unambiguous density for GDP (Fig. 1c). Residues F334 and H322 each undergo a rotamer flip, where F334 now points towards the Gαi C terminus, whereas H322 points towards TCAT. This is indicative of the final transition of the TCAT towards its fully retracted form, coinciding with the opening of the AHD (Fig. 3a,d,j). The transition also results in a loss of all residues from the AHD and SwI, including S151, R176 and R178. Furthermore, we observe a release of P loop backbone interactions of S44 and G45 with GDP (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7d,j). As a consequence of these losses in coordination (18 to 10 backbone, 34 to 22 side chain, 8 to 4 hydrogen bonds), GDP moves out of its pocket by roughly 2 Å (Extended Data Fig. 7d,j). α1 further moves towards α5, replacing hydrophobic contacts with polar interactions from the displaced β6–α5 loop (Fig. 3d,e,j and Extended Data Fig. 7d,j). The terminal two residues of α1, I56 and H57, involved in the hydrophobic core, disorder as a result of the AHD opening (Fig. 3d,e). The helix moves towards α5, identical to nucleotide-free, and Q52 supports the TCAT loop (Fig. 3e). One interesting observation is that the loop T128-E130 on Gβ1, which is poorly resolved in previous states40, now shows a well resolved density, with a retracted conformation relative to the latent and engaged states, in response to AHD opening (Extended Data Fig. 9e–h). In our MD simulations, the unlatched state shows the most heterogeneous mixture of AHD conformations, ranging from fully open to fully occluded. In the open AHD trajectories, we observed the guanine group release, while the nucleotide remains bound through its phosphate groups (Extended Data Fig. 8i,k and Supplementary Video 1). This overall heterogeneity could explain the disordered AHD density in this cryoEM reconstruction, whereas transiently occluded states may limit GDP release.

The next transition shows an ordering of the open AHD, in which the linker and the AHD are well resolved and lined against the Gβ1 subunit. Two key residues in this interaction are R134 and R137 of Gβ1, which coordinate the AHD. The connected β strand (βD2) is translated and rotated, relative to the ‘inactive' G protein states with a closed AHD (latent and engaged) (Extended Data Fig. 9e–h). This movement is required for the reorientation of R134. This loop conformation is also stabilized by scFv16, which could explain its ability to stabilize nucleotide-free complexes42 (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Within the nucleotide-binding pocket, the AHD opening results in a retraction of αF towards Gβ (Fig. 3a,e), resulting in increased dynamics of α1, which is further confirmed in our MD simulations (Extended Data Fig. 8e,k). AHD dynamics are markedly reduced compared with the ‘unlatched' state, indicating stable coordination by Gβ1. Confirming our hypothesis that the primed state shows the lowest affinity for GDP, our MD trajectories show the most heterogeneity for GDP (Extended Data Fig. 8j). In four trajectories, the guanine group is ejected, leaving the nucleotide bound only through phosphate interactions, and in one case, the nucleotide fully dissociates (Supplementary Video 1).

The last observed rearrangement towards the nucleotide-free state is a collapse of the P loop and its contraction by 4 Å, hampering GDP binding (Extended Data Fig. 7f,l). Within the G protein heterotrimers, we see a clear trend comparing the relative angle between the Gαi and β subunit, which progressively becomes flatter from the receptor-free to nucleotide-free state, with an overall change of roughly 15° (Fig. 3f). This finding is consistent with the ‘lever arm' hypothesis for receptor-dependent G protein activation45,46.

Comparing these cryoEM structures, we observed unambiguous densities for naloxone and loperamide in eight of our ten maps. A distinguishing feature between antagonists and agonists at opioid receptors is the relative elevation at which ligands bind within the orthosteric binding pocket47,48,49. Antagonists are consistently observed with a ‘shallow' pose compared with agonists. In agreement with this, naloxone binds in a shallow pose within the receptor, in our two ‘inactive' MOR conformations (Fig. 1e) compared with all subsequent states (Fig. 1d). By contrast, loperamide shows no significant movement in the orthosteric binding pocket, probably because our high-resolution loperamide-bound intermediate states all include ‘active-like' receptor conformations (Fig. 1e,f). Overall, although the observed changes are subtle, they show a correlation of the ligand binding pose with the coordination of GDP.

Finally, as outlined above, our main protocol for determining the structure of GDP-bound complexes involves initially depleting the complex of nucleotides, followed by supplementing with GDP (‘re-bound GDP'). To rule out any potential artefacts in the resulting reconstructions, we purified GDP-bound Gαi heterotrimers in complex with naloxone-bound or loperamide-bound MOR (‘constant GDP'). In contrast to our ‘re-bound GDP' protocol, we kept 200–500 μM GDP in all purification buffers (Extended Data Fig. 6a). These complexes readily withstood purification and yielded three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions consistent with each of the above-described states. In agreement with our hypotheses, the naloxone-bound ‘latent' and the loperamide-bound ‘open AHD' conformation, provided by far the highest resolution reconstructions. In summary, these findings strongly support the validity of our original approach and proposed mechanisms (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).

Here, we provide conformational snapshots along the initial steps of the MOR–G protein activation pathway, shedding light onto fundamental mechanisms of MOR pharmacology. We see a direct correlation between the ligand binding pose and conformational states of the G protein, before GDP release. In the ‘inactive' receptor conformation, naloxone adopts a shallow pose within the orthosteric binding pocket, whereas in the ‘active' conformation, both naloxone and loperamide engage significantly deeper within the pocket (Fig. 1d–f). This, in turn, suggests that ligands of increasing efficacy preferentially stabilize receptor conformations that facilitate nucleotide exchange47,48,49. We determined the structure of a latent MOR–G protein complex, capturing an early interaction state. Unlike previous structures, MOR interacts with the G protein through all three ICLs. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggested ICL1 dynamics increase on agonist binding, whereas full TM6 rearrangement requires the presence of a G protein50. Next, we determined an ‘engaged' state structure of a GDP-bound ternary complex, with a fully extended α5 helix and a closed AHD. Our MD simulations show that the AHD is, however, transiently open in most trajectories (Extended Data Fig. 8c and Supplementary Video 1). The existence of this state indicates that α5 extension, AHD opening and GDP release occur sequentially, rather than simultaneously. We also captured two states with open AHDs (‘unlatched' and ‘primed'), representing steps immediately before GDP release. Our MD results for the unlatched state, with a highly dynamic AHD, suggests that random collisions with the RHD may occlude GDP release. Finally, the primed state suggests a ‘trapdoor-like' mechanism, in which the retraction of the AHD leads to a concomitant retraction of the αF helix, resulting in the most dynamic GDP coordination observed across all states (Extended Data Fig. 8j,k). In one ‘primed' MD trajectory, this culminated in the ejection of GDP. Additionally, one ‘unlatched' MD trajectory gradually adopts a ‘primed' conformation, which also results in GDP release (Supplementary Video 1). As an ‘open AHD' conformation was observed in all of our GDP-containing specimens, it suggests that this state might be more prominent than previously considered. The existence of the four GDP-bound intermediate states also suggests that GDP binding, under our experimental conditions, is reversible and does not necessarily lead to the dissociation of the ternary complex.

Our data indicate a model in which efficacy correlates with overcoming the rate-limiting step of G protein activation, GDP release, by shifting the equilibrium of receptor conformations (Fig. 4). Antagonists and partial agonists stall MOR–Gi complexes in the latent state, which probably shows relatively low GDP release rates, as most coordinating interactions remain intact (Fig. 3b). The agonist loperamide, however, readily progresses into the engaged state, which is structurally configured for AHD domain opening and subsequent GDP release, while reducing the likelihood of GDP rebinding (Fig. 4). As a result, more complexes stabilized by loperamide show lower GDP affinity, than those stabilized by naloxone. Nevertheless, we observed ‘open AHD' states (engaged, unlatched and primed), even in our ‘constant GDP' protocol, which suggests that these can indeed rebind GDP and are, under our experimental conditions, stable. Together, these findings demonstrate that GDP release is governed by the ligand through a modulation of the conformational landscape spanning inactive, latent, engaged, unlatched and primed states. Extending our framework, we propose that inverse agonists act by predominantly stabilizing the latent state, which could explain why, unlike agonists, MOR antagonist binding is unaffected by the presence of nucleotides27,51, analogous to our recent findings at KOR25. At present, we foresee a linear model for conformational rearrangements required for G protein activation, but it is possible that the observed states are connected through a variety of additional pathways. Although we cannot rule out that ligand binding might have any effect past the nucleotide-free state, we see no improvement in GTP binding affinities (Extended Data Fig. 2b). In fact, we see a decrease in GTP affinity for the superagonist loperamide, which further suggests that the primary mechanism of action for agonists is nucleotide release.

Our data support a model in which efficacy is primarily driven by the transition from a signalling-silent ‘latent' state to an ‘engaged' state. This transition results in a hallmark ‘active-like' MOR conformation and an extended α5 helix, despite the AHD remaining closed. The engaged state is structurally primed for subsequent AHD opening, which is essential for GDP release. Stabilization of the latent state probably reduces nucleotide exchange rates, approximating basal activity seen in receptor-free GDP–Gαi1β1γ2, whereas progression through downstream states accelerates GDP release, thereby enhancing G protein activation.

Our findings are complementary to single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy studies18,22 that showed that ligand efficacy correlates with changes in the equilibrium between ‘preactivated' G protein (GDP-bound) MOR conformations, and fully ‘active' conformations. Furthermore, our observed structures closely resemble recently described conformational states of MOR–Gαi complexes, post-GTP binding52. Our GDP-bound latent state closely resembles ‘G-ACT-2/3', engaged ‘G-ACT-1' and primed ‘primed'. The study observes highly similar conformational changes, including global rearrangements such as comparable MOR–G protein interfaces, accompanied by a gradual closure of the AHD. The only significant difference is that we do only observe subtle changes within SwII and no dissociation between subunits (Fig. 3g). However, it is not surprising that GDP release closely mimics conformational changes and states, required for GTP binding.

In summary, the present study sheds light on MOR ligand efficacy by revealing that ligands can stabilize distinct proportions of conformations, resulting in varying degrees of nucleotide exchange. It underscores the critical value of high-resolution structures of nucleotide-bound GPCR–G protein ternary complexes, offering experimental insight into intermediate conformations that underlie G protein functional selectivity at a level of structural detail that is not achievable by any other method. Given the observation of functionally selective intermediate states giving rise to specific pharmacological outcomes, this model may prove more broadly applicable across the GPCR superfamily.

Alvimopan, naloxone, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, DAMGO and loperamide were purchased from Cayman Chemicals and MedChemExpress. Detergents were purchased from Anatrace. The radioligand [3H]naltrexone (specific activity 48.19 Ci per mmol) was generously provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program. All other general laboratory reagents and chemicals were purchased from Millipore Sigma, unless otherwise stated.

For recombinant protein expression, full-length human MOR was subcloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector with an N-terminal Flag, 10xHis-tag and thermostabilized b562RIL (ref. 54) along with a C-terminal TwinStrep tag55 and an extra 10xHis-tag. Both N-terminal and C-terminal tags are flanked by HRV-3C protease cleavage sites to allow tag removal. For the G-protein-free ‘inactive' MOR structure, two point mutations M264L and K2696.24R in ICL3 were incorporated, to allow Nb6 binding56.

For all BRET assays, transient transfections of wild-type full-length human MOR were performed using the pcDNA 3.1(−) vector in human embryonic kidney 293F (HEK293F) mammalian cells. These receptor constructs were expressed under the cytomegalovirus promoter and included an N-terminal haemagglutinin signal peptide followed by a Flag tag. For TRUPATH24 and GloSensor assays, the MOR construct was untagged and contained no fusion elements. In the RG-BRET assay, Rluc8 was fused immediately after the C terminus of the wild-type MOR construct.

In TRUPATH assays24, a tricistronic vector encoding Gαi1, Gβ1 and Gγ2 was used, in which GFP2 was fused to the N terminus of Gγ2 and Rluc8 was inserted after residue G90 of the Gαi1 subunit23. For RG-BRET assays, a Gαi1β1γ2 construct was used with GFP2 fused to the N terminus of Gγ2. The pOZITX-S1 plasmid, used as a control in these assays, was obtained from J. Javitch (Addgene plasmid no. 184925).

HEK293F cells were cultured in FreeStyle293 Expression Medium (Gibco) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and shaking at 110 rpm. For transfections, cells were seeded 1 day before and transfected at a cell density of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml using polyethyleneimine (PEI) with a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:2. For RG-BRET assays, MOR–Rluc8 and Gαi/Gβ1/Gγ2–GFP2 constructs were transfected at a 1:2 ratio. TRUPATH BRET assays used MOR and Gαi1–Rluc8/Gβ1/Gγ2–GFP2 transfected at a 1:1 ratio. When pOZITX-S1 was used, Gαi/Gβ1/Gγ2–GFP2 and pOZITX-S1 plasmids were transfected at a 1:1 ratio. For MOR–Gαi-mediated cAMP inhibition assays, cells were cotransfected with wild-type human MOR, along with a split-luciferase-based cAMP biosensor (GloSensor, Promega) at a 1:1 ratio.

For experiments with intact cells, cells were washed with assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1× HBSS) and transferred to white-bottom 96-well plates. For permeabilized cell assays, collected cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer KPS (140 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM KEGTA and 20 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.2). Cells were permeabilized using 10 μg ml−1 high-purity digitonin (GoldBio) and treated with apyrase (2 U ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich), optionally with increasing GDPβS concentrations, then transferred to 96-well plates containing the respective ligand in ligand buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1× HBSS, 0.1% BSA) or KPS for permeabilized cells.

Steady state BRET measurements were performed using a PHERAstar FSX multimode plate reader (BMG Biotech). BRET2-specific filters were used: emission 410 nm (80 nm slit) and emission 515 nm (30 nm slit). Coelenterazine 400a (5 μM; Nanolight) dissolved in NanoFuel Solvent was added to all wells immediately before measuring with Rluc8. Raw netBRET signals were calculated as the emission intensity at 515 nm divided by the emission intensity at 410 nm, with no normalization or further data treatment applied to reported results.

Each assay was conducted in at least three biologically independent (separate transfection) experiments, on different days, with all data points measured in triplicate. EC50 and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated in GraphPad Prism 10 (v.10.6.0) by fitting the raw netBRET results from each experiment, followed by non-linear regression using the equations: y = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(\(1+{10}^{({\mbox{logEC}}_{50}-x)}\)) and y = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(\(1+{10}^{(x-{\mbox{logIC}}_{50})}\)).

At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1× HBSS, pH 7.4) and plated into 96-well white cell culture plates at a density of 200,000 cells in 90 μl per well. Ligands were prepared as 3× solutions in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1× HBSS, pH 7.4). Media was aspirated and cells were incubated with 30 μl per well of drug buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1× HBSS, pH 7.4), followed by addition of 30 μl of 3× drug solutions for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells then received 30 μl of luciferin (Goldbio, 4 mM final concentration) supplemented with isoproterenol (100 μM final concentration) to stimulate production of endogenous cAMP through β2 adrenergic Gs activation, and were incubated in the dark at room temperature. After 15 min, luminescence intensity was quantified using a PHERAstar FSX multimode plate reader (BMG Biotech). Data were plotted as a function of ligand or nucleotide concentration and analysed using log (ligand or nucleotide) versus response in GraphPad Prism (v.10.6.0).

Radioligand binding assays were conducted using membrane fractions from HEK293F cells transiently expressing human wild-type MOR. For membrane preparation, cell pellets expressing human wild-type MOR and Gαi1-Gβ1-Gγ2 at a 1:1 ratio were gathered and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl supplemented with 2 mM AEBSF, 14 μM E-64, 1 μM leupeptin and 0.3 μM aprotinin). Cells were dounce homogenized and centrifuged at 175,000g in two rounds to obtain membrane fractions. Membrane protein concentration was determined to be roughly 4 mg ml−1 using a Bradford assay (Pierce). Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.

Competition binding assays were setup in 96-well plates containing membrane fractions diluted to 0.15 mg ml−1, along with [3H]naltrexone at 2 nM and a ‘cold' naltrexone dose (100 µM–10 pM), all prepared in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 0.1% BSA and 100 µM Bacitracin). Competition reactions were incubated for 1 h and terminated by vacuum filtration onto cold 0.3% PEI-soaked GF/A filters, followed by 3 rounds of washing with cold 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.50). Counts were read using a Microbeta2 plate reader (PerkinElmer) for 1 min per well. Results were analysed in GraphPad Prism v.10.6.0, and the inhibitor constant (Ki) was determined using the ‘One site - Fit Ki' model equation: logEC50 = log(\({10}^{\mbox{log}{K}_{i}\times (1\,+\,\mbox{RadioligandNM}/\mbox{HotKdNM})}\)), y = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(\(1+{10}^{(x-{\mbox{logEC}}_{50})}\)).

Recombinant expression of the pFastBac1-MOR constructs was carried out in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Gibco). Recombinant baculovirus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 5 to Sf9 cells cultured at a density of 3–3.5 × 106 cells per ml in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems) supplemented with 1% (v/v) production boost additive. To enhance receptor surface expression and improve protein yield, 10 µM naloxone was added during protein expression. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 27 °C with shaking at 100 rpm, then collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS and stored at −80 °C until further use.

For membrane preparation, frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, with protease inhibitors: 2 mM AEBSF, 14 μM E-64, 1 μM leupeptin and 0.3 μM aprotinin). The suspension was homogenized using a glass dounce homogenizer and further treated with hypertonic buffer (hypotonic buffer + 1 M NaCl). Membranes were harvested by ultracentrifugation at 150,000g for 45 min at 4 °C. This washing and centrifugation process was repeated 2 more times, with 10 μM naloxone included in the final 2 washes. Final membrane pellets were homogenized in purification buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 10 μM naloxone) supplemented with 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C.

For protein solubilization, membranes were thawed in the presence of 2 mg ml−1 iodoacetamide and diluted in 2× solubilization buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% w/v lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) and 0.1% w/v cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS)) and incubated for 8 h at 4 °C. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 150,000g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with M2 anti-Flag affinity resin (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.001% LMNG, 0.0001% CHS and 10 μM naloxone). Protein was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 200 μg ml−1 DYKDDDDK peptide (GenScript). The eluate was concentrated and used for complex formation with Nb6M or heterotrimeric G proteins.

Wk6 Escherichia coli (American Type Culture Collection) were transformed by heat shock with the Nb6 plasmid56,57 and grown overnight in starter cultures containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. These cultures were used to inoculate 2 l of Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and grown at 37 °C with shaking until log phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) between 0.5 and 1) was reached. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), and cultures were incubated overnight at 28 °C. Cell pellets were gathered by centrifugation, washed with PBS and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

For purification, Nb6-containing pellets were thawed and resuspended in TES buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20% w/v sucrose) at 15 ml per litre of culture, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and incubated on an orbital shaker at 4 °C for 1 h. An extra 30 ml per litre of 1:4 diluted TES was added, followed by another 45 min of incubation at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 30 min and the clarified supernatant was passed through a 0.45-µm filter. The filtered solution was supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and loaded onto a Ni-NTA affinity column prechilled to 4 °C.

The column was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM imidazole) and Nb6M was eluted with buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled, concentrated, supplemented with 10% glycerol and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Chemically competent E. coli C43 cells were transformed by heat shock with the NabFab plasmid58. A starter culture in Terrific Broth medium was inoculated and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. These cultures were used to inoculate 2 l of Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and grown at 37 °C with shaking until log phase (OD600 between 0.5 and 1) was reached. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and cultures were incubated overnight at 28 °C. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

For purification, thawed cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, DNaseI, and protease inhibitor cocktail) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was heat-treated at 63–65 °C for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Protein G column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. NabFab was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid and directly applied to a Resource S cation exchange column equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0). The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A, and NabFab was eluted using a 0–100% gradient of buffer B (50 mM sodium acetate, 2 M NaCl, pH 5.0). Eluted protein was dialysed overnight into 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and concentrated to 3 mg ml−1 for complex formation.

Wild-type Gαi1 was co-expressed with Gβ1 and γ2 subunits in Sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems). Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells per ml and infected with P1 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 10:5 (Gαi1:Gβγ). After 48 h of incubation at 27 °C with shaking at 100 rpm, cells were gathered by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold PBS and stored at −80 °C until use. Gαi1βγ heterotrimers were purified using established protocols59,60. Frozen pellets were thawed and homogenized in hypotonic buffer containing 10 µM GDP and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, followed by centrifugation at 100,000g. The resulting pellet was solubilized for 90 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1% sodium cholate, 0.05% DDM, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM imidazole, 10 µM GDP and protease inhibitors. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 150,000g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA resin and eluted with buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The protein was concentrated using a 50-kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrator (Amicon) and further purified through anion exchange chromatography using a 1 ml HiTrap Q FF column (Cytiva).

The scFv16 single-chain antibody fragment was expressed in Sf9 cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells per ml with baculovirus infection at a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 72 h, culture media was collected by centrifugation at 1,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pH of the media was adjusted to 7.5 using 1 M Tris, followed by the addition of 1 mM NiCl2 and 5 mM CaCl2 to precipitate chelators. The precipitate was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g. The clarified supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin for 3 h, washed with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, 0.00075% LMNG and 0.000075% CHS, and eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. The purified scFv16 was concentrated to roughly 10 mg ml−1 and stored at −80 °C.

Purified MOR–naloxone was incubated with Gαiβγ heterotrimer at a 1:1.2 molar ratio for 1 h at room temperature. Apyrase was then added to catalyse hydrolysis of GDP (for ‘re-bound GDP' and nucleotide-free specimen). For the nucleotide-free MOR structure, scFv16 was added at 1.2 molar excess. For the ‘constant GDP' samples, the specimen was not treated with apyrase, and instead supplemented with 200 μM (naloxone) or 500 μM (loperamide) GDP in all subsequent purification buffers. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 90 min. The complex was subsequently purified with an extra round of Flag resin, to separate from excess G protein by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column equilibrated with buffer containing 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 μM naloxone, 0.00075% LMNG and 0.000075% CHS. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated and immediately used for cryoEM studies. For the inactive MOR structure, purified MOR was incubated with Nb6M and NabFab in molar excess of 2:1, incubated on ice overnight and finally purified by size-exclusion chromatography, with identical conditions described above.

MOR–Nb6–naloxone, MOR–Gi–naloxone, complexes in LMNG or CHS micelles were used immediately after concentrating the monomeric size-exclusion chromatography peak to 1–2 mg ml−1 using a 50-kDa cutoff Amicon concentrator. For cryoEM grid preparation, 3 µl of purified protein complex was applied to freshly glow-discharged UltrAuFoil 1.2/1.3 300 mesh grids (Quantifoil), blotted for 2.5–4 s at 95% relative humidity and 4 °C, then vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). For the ‘re-bound GDP' samples, the purified specimen was incubated with 100 µM GDPβS for 1 h, before grid freezing. For the ‘constant GDP' samples, the purified specimen was further supplemented with 500 μM GDP (naloxone) and 1 mM GDP (loperamide) and incubated before grid freezing.

Micrographs were collected using an aberration-free image shift data collection scheme (four images per hole) with EPU data acquisition software (version 2.0) on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 300 keV. The microscope was equipped with a K3 direct-electron detector and post-BioQuantum GIF energy filter using a 20 eV slit size (Gatan). Images were collected with a total exposure time of 1.8 s, total dose of 55–60 e−/Å2 and defocus ranging from −1 µm to −3 µm.

Motion correction of micrograph videos was carried out using MotionCor2 (ref. 61). All subsequent data processing steps were performed using the software package cryoSPARC62 (v.4.7.1; Structura Biotechnology) (Fig. 1, Extended Data Figs. 3–6 and Supplementary Tables 1–3), using established protocols. For naloxone-bound complexes, a total of 30,264 (MOR–Nb6), 45,722 (‘re-bound' MOR–Gi–GDP), 17,742 (‘constant' MOR–Gi–GDP) and 32,514 (MOR–Gi–nucleotide-free) micrographs were preprocessed through patch contrast transfer function estimation (default parameters), and micrographs with average contrast transfer function resolution estimates above 4 Å were discarded. For loperamide-bound complexes, 22,868 (re-bound MOR–Gi–GDP) and 22,146 (constant MOR–Gi–GDP) micrographs were collected and preprocessed similarly. An initial round of processing was carried out on a subset of the data (roughly 5,000 micrographs), using the reference-free Blob picker (140 Å particle diameter) routine, followed by two-dimensional (2D) classification until 2D classes with clearly distinguishable transmembrane domain (TMD) densities were obtained. Ab initio reconstruction of these 2D classes was performed to obtain a 3D model used for template-based picking and 3D reconstructions of all three full datasets (Extended Data Figs. 3–5). Particle picking on the entire dataset (20 Å reference low pass) was followed by extraction with a box size of 128 pixels (bin 4; 512 pixels uncropped box size). Three to four rounds of 2D classification were performed to obtain homogenous 2D classes with distinguishable TMD densities (Extended Data Figs. 3–5), after which particles were re-extracted (bin 2, box size 256). Further 2D classification was used to separate complexes with ‘open' or ‘closed' AHD conformations, followed by multiclass ab initio reconstructions of each particle subset. The resulting 3D volumes were used to perform several rounds of heterogeneous refinement, on the re-extracted particle stack resulting in segregation of particles into five classes. A combination of ab initio reconstruction, non-uniform refinement and 2D classification was performed on particle subsets corresponding to MOR–Gi complexes. Finally, local refinements with a manually created mask around the TMD, masking the micelle and the heterotrimeric G protein yielded the final reconstructions of maps ranging between 2.8 Å and 3.8 Å. The final ‘focused' maps were merged in Chimera for subsequent model building and refinement.

Refinements were based on PDB ID 1GP2 (Gαi1 protein heterotrimer, GDP-bound)40, PDB 7UL4 (MOR–Nb6-alvimopan)56 and PDB 8EF6 (MOR–Gi-DN-morphine)47, for which residues in the sequence were reverted to the respective wild-type Gαi. The ordered AHD conformation for the ‘primed' state was modelled after rhodopsin PDB ID 6CMO (ref. 63). The models were fitted into the density map in UCSF Chimera (version 1.17.3)64 and manually adjusted to fit the density map in COOT (version 0.9.2)65. Subsequently, the generated model was automatically refined in phenix.real_space_refine66,67 (version 1.21.2) and manually adjusted in COOT (version 0.9.2)65, for several iterations. The final geometry validation statistics including clashscore and Ramachandran analysis were calculated by MolProbity68. The final refinement statistics were generated using the ‘comprehensive validation (cryoEM)' function in phenix (version 1.21.2)67.

For our MD simulation, we deployed GROMACS v.2024.5 (ref. 69) using CHARMM36 all-atom force-field parameters and topologies70,71. Ligand force-field parameters and topologies for naloxone and loperamide were generated using the Ligand Reader & Modeler tool available through the CHARMM-GUI webserver. The starting conformations of these complexes were obtained from the corresponding cryoEM structures determined in this study. MOR, Gi and MOR–Gαi heterotrimers (GDP) in the respective state were embedded in a lipid bilayer consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol with ratio DPPC:DOPC:CHL 0.55:0.15:0.30, referencing simulations performed on GPCRs72. The missing Gαi1 AHD in the unlatched structure was manually modelled using the latent and primed structures as a template, placing the AHD roughly at its halfway point, with structure regularization and torsion angle optimization carried out using phenix. The N-terminal Gly of Gα was myristoylated, while Cys3 of the same chain was palmitoylated. In Gγ, the C terminus was capped using N-methylamide, as well as geranylgeranylation of Cys68. The palmitoyl group was also added to Cys172 of MOR. Initial membrane coordinates were assigned by the Positioning of Proteins in Membranes server through the CHARMM-GUI interface73. Systems were solvated in TIP3 water molecules, and Na+, Cl−, Mg2+ ions were placed in the systems to obtain 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2. The box size was determined on the basis of the protein extent of each model (xy from 80 Å for the inactive MOR–naloxone to 120 Å for MOR–Gαi1 complex, z 160 Å).

All systems underwent initial energy minimization for 50,000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm and a 100 kJ mol−1 nm−1 threshold, followed by equilibration simulations for a total time of 10 ns. The equilibration was performed in the NVT ensemble followed by the NPT ensemble for 6 steps (time step of 1–2 fs) with V-rescale thermostat at 303.15 K and Parrinello–Rahman barostat at 1 atm. Five separate replicates of production runs were subsequently performed for 1 µs each under NPT ensemble with Parrinello–Rahman barostat at 1 atm and V-rescale thermostat at 303.15 K, with random assignment of velocities. Simulations were executed on the graphical processing unit clusters at the Center for Advanced Computing of the University of Southern California. MD trajectory analysis was carried out using the GROMACS analysis toolkit, the MDTraj software package74 and MDCiao75.

For BRET2 nucleotide competition results, log transformed EC50 values were analysed using one-way analysis of variance within each drug group. For comparisons between only two groups, unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests were performed to compare each condition. A significance threshold of α = 0.05 was applied for both one-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test analyses. Statistical significance is denoted by asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; NS indicates not significant. EC50 values are reported as the mean ± s.d. across three independent replicates.

PyMol v.3.1.6.1 (ref. 76) (Schrödinger), UCSF Chimera v.1.17.3 (ref. 64), UCSF ChimeraX v.1.9 (ref. 77), ChemDraw Professional v.22.2.0 (PerkinElmer), GraphPad Prism v.10.6.0 and Adobe Illustrator 2021 v.29.7.1 were used to create all illustrations and figures. All reported root mean-square deviation values were calculated using the align command in PyMol, with either global alignment of the receptor or Gαi RHD. All netBRET data are plotted as ratios of the raw emission data, without baseline correction, normalization or any other data treatment.

Immune system control is a principal hurdle in cancer evolution. The temporal dynamics of immune evasion remain incompletely characterized, and how immune-mediated selection interrelates with epigenome alteration is unclear. Here we infer the genome- and epigenome-driven evolutionary dynamics of tumor-immune coevolution within primary colorectal cancers (CRCs). We utilize a multiregion multiomic dataset of matched genome, transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling from 495 single glands (from 29 CRCs) supplemented with high-resolution spatially resolved neoantigen sequencing data and multiplexed imaging of the tumor microenvironment from 82 microbiopsies within 11 CRCs. Somatic chromatin accessibility alterations contribute to accessibility loss of antigen-presenting genes and silencing of neoantigens. Immune escape and exclusion occur at the outset of CRC formation, and later intratumoral differences in immuno-editing are negligible or exclusive to sites of invasion. Collectively, immune evasion in CRC follows a ‘Big Bang' evolutionary pattern, whereby it is acquired close to transformation and defines subsequent cancer-immune evolution.

Tumors are shaped continuously by interactions with their environment, especially by the ongoing ‘war' with the immune system. Neoantigens—new peptides originating from somatic mutations—may elicit immune recognition, but tumors ultimately evade immune elimination by immune-editing (losing antigenic mutations), immune-escape (for example, hampering antigen presentation), immune exclusion (manipulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) to limit immune presence) or a combination of these mechanisms1. Immune evasion is unlikely to be a binary on/off trait, but rather a continuous phenotype modulated by the strength of the contribution of these factors. Immunotherapies aim to re-engage the immune system in its war against cancer; thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying immune evasion is paramount for treatment success.

Colorectal cancers (CRCs) generally display a relatively active immune microenvironment with substantial tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes2. About 15% of CRCs are mismatch repair (MMR) deficient (MMRd), which is associated with a higher neoantigen burden, enhanced immune presence3,4 and good response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies; however, up to 30% of MMRd CRCs do not respond5. MM proficient (MMRp) CRCs harbor a lower mutation burden than MMRd CRCs and ICB treatments are ineffective6, indicating that immune evasion in MMRp tumors probably occurs through mechanisms alternative to those targeted by current ICB drugs. Nonetheless, immune infiltrate is prognostic for CRC7, indicating a central role for the immune system in CRC evolution. Indeed, most MMRp cancers carry (several) putative clonal neoantigen mutations8 and, whereas only a subset of these might be sufficiently presented9, they may still be capable of T cell activation10,11,12.

Immune evasion through genetic means (for example, mutations that hamper immune recognition of neoantigens) is common in CRCs4,13. Our previous mathematical modeling found that escape is essential for MMRd CRC development, and is a crucial step in MMRp CRC formation when immune surveillance is stringent4,8,14. The role of the epigenome in modulating tumor antigenicity has received less attention: somatic changes in chromatin organization are known to contribute to the cancer immunophenotype, but their impact on immune escape and editing have not been completely assessed15,16,17. In seminal studies from the TRACERx consortium18,19, promoter hypermethylation has been identified as mechanism of neoantigen silencing in lung cancer20. Analogously, closing chromatin may lead to repression of antigen expression, meaning that immune selection could strongly shape a cancer's epigenome architecture.

Previous analyses relied on bulk sequencing data from superficial tumors, and so were probably unable to detect subclonal and heterogeneous immune evolutionary dynamics that could be associated with disease spread. Further, the invasive margin—the cancer region in direct contact with normal tissue—is probably a main determinant of overall immune evasion/elimination, but has rarely been studied directly because it is typically fixed for diagnostic purposes and unavailable for research21,22. In summary, spatial heterogeneity in CRC immuno-editing and escape remains incompletely characterized.

Here we explore the interplay between immune evasion and the epigenome, highlighting a role for chromatin architecture in suppressing expression of neoantigens and antigen-presenting machinery in CRC. We characterize immune evasion (microenvironment restructuring and genetic immune escape) at the individual tumor gland-level, exploring intratumor heterogeneity within and across different morphological contexts. We leverage our existing multiregion multiomic sequencing (matched genome, transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling) of 495 single glands (representing 29 CRCs) from our previously published Evolutionary Predictions in Colorectal Cancer (EPICC) study15,23. We supplemented this with newly generated data that combines targeted neoantigen sequencing and highly multiplexed TME profiling of 82 microbiopsies representing distinct tumor-associated regions from a subset of 11 EPICC cases, including lymph node metastases and distant normal mucosa.

We analyzed the immune landscape of 29 CRCs at single tumor gland resolution, using multiomic (whole-genome sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)) analysis of fresh frozen (FF) single glands, coupled with high-depth panel sequencing (PS) and cyclic immunofluorescence24 (CyCIF) imaging of matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies. The collection and processing of FF samples have been described previously15,23 (Fig. 1a). We obtained diagnostic FFPE blocks from 11 patients with MMRp stage III CRCs and lymph node metastasis. We microdissected small regions representing superficial tumor, invasive margin and lymph node deposits (Fig. 1a) and sequenced genomic regions associated with the immunopeptidome25 (Methods). In a subset of these regions, we visualized 22 proteins that identified immune cell types or regulatory receptor expression (Supplementary Table 2) using CyCIF (Methods). In total, we assembled sequencing data from a total of 495 FF and 82 FFPE biopsies from 29 patients (median of 15 FF and eight FFPE biopsies per patient) with concurrent CyCIF analysis of eight patients.

a, Overview of sample collection (middle), processing and analysis of FF (left) and FFPE (right) biopsies. b, Neoantigen burden, synonymous mutation burden, immune dNdS and immune escape mutation overview of all FF–WGS samples, ordered by average neoantigen burden and MMR status. Error bars depict CIs for immune dNdS estimates, truncated at 3.5. c, Neoantigen burden, immune dNdS and immune infiltrate overview of all FFPE–PS samples, ordered by average neoantigen burden.

In both whole-genome- and panel-sequenced biopsies, we predicted the antigenicity of each somatic mutation using NeoPredPipe26. We defined the (proportional) neoantigen burden of each biopsy as the number of mutations present that gave rise to at least one strong-binding, cancer-specific mutated peptide, normalized to the total burden of protein-changing mutations. For samples with sufficient mutations, we quantified immune selection using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations in the immunopeptidome (immune dNdS) using SOPRANO25 (Fig. 1a; Methods).

In FF–WGS samples, we characterized candidate immune escape alterations: single nucleotide variants (SNVs), frameshifts and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in HLA genes, high-impact alterations in other antigen-presenting genes (APGs; see Methods for list) and high expression of PD-L1 or CTLA-4 (as measured by RNA-seq). Samples with a LOH, frameshift, stop-gain alteration or several SNVs in APGs, or with overexpression of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 were labeled ‘escaped,' whereas samples with a single SNV or moderate PD-L1/CTLA-4 expression were labeled ‘potential escape' (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1).

Neoantigen burden, immune dNdS, genetic immune escape alterations and immune markers each showed high interpatient but moderate intrapatient variability (Fig. 1b,c). As expected, total mutation burden was correlated strongly with the number, but not the proportion of antigenic mutations; immune dNdS values showed a reversed, albeit highly uncertain relationship with proportional burden (Extended Data Fig. 2). MMRd cancers (n = 6) had significantly higher mutation load than MMRp cancers (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b; median synonymous burden 307 versus 18; median total neoantigen burden 292 versus 23, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test P < 10−16) and all carried clonal high-impact immune escape alterations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). Overall, immune escape alterations were detected in 14 of 29 cancers; these were clonal in 8 cases and subclonal in 6 (all MMRp; Extended Data Fig. 1).

We showed previously that somatic chromatin accessibility alterations (SCAAs) evoked genome-wide rewiring of transcription factor (TF) binding that altered interferon signaling, suggesting suppression of immune signaling through epigenetic regulation15. We therefore examined the role of the epigenome in enabling immune escape by looking for SCAAs associated with APGs (Methods) in 25 CRCs. We detected a total of 45 SCAAs, all in promoter regions upstream of these APGs. Of these 34 APGs, 21 (62%) had at least one SCAA and 9 of 25 (36%) of patients had at least one APG affected by a SCAA. Notably, 42 (93%) of the SCAAs were losses of accessibility, significantly different than expected based on the genome-wide distribution of SCAAs (P = 0.025; Methods). None of the SCAAs co-occurred with somatic mutations in those genes (Fig. 2a). This exclusivity could indicate that mutations are more likely to be found in expressed genes or that SCAAs are an alternate route to antigen presentation disruption.

In b, d and e, markers indicate OR estimates with error bars showing the corresponding 95% CI. Significant P values from unadjusted two-sided Fisher's exact tests are indicated above each bar. In c, f and g, cancers are colored according to their immune escape status (same color key applies), and P values from two-sided paired Wilcoxon-tests are indicated on top of each panel.

We explored predicted TF binding sites within SCAA-loss APG promoter regions. A total of ten ATAC-seq peaks in these promoters showed recurrent somatic loss (present in more than one patient), associated with eight distinct APGs. We found ten TFs that bound more than two of these regions (Methods), most notably NFIC, which had binding sites in the silenced promoter of all eight recurrently SCAA-affected APGs (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Although these TFs had a high number of binding sites genome-wide, they were enriched for APG-SCAA-loss site binding (one-sided Fisher-test P = 0.042). Furthermore, they covered several APG promoters, whereas other TFs targeted few APGs (for example, ZNF32 bound only the ERAP2 SCAA-loss sites; Supplementary Table 1). Except for CTCFL and TBPL2, these TFs were expressed in most RNA sequenced samples, confirming their relevance in CRC.

Examining gene expression of SCAA-loss APGs, we observed that ERAP2 (SCAA-loss in three cancers and three adenomas), had considerably lower expression in the affected cancers than in normal tissue (mean variance stabilizing transformation (VST) count = 6.8 versus 7.9) and in unaffected cancers (mean VST count = 8.1; Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). However, we did not observe a systematic decrease in expression across all gene–patient combinations (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Looking more broadly, chromatin accessibility of promoters (quantified as ATAC-seq counts per million reads, regardless of somatic status) showed a positive correlation with gene expression across all genes (Spearman correlation, R = 0.12; P < 10−16), which was more pronounced in genes with low average expression (gene group 4 in ref. 23; R = 0.19). We suggest SCAAs generally impact gene expression but, due to their permissive (not directly causative) nature, the effect(s) may not always manifest. However, chromatin changes may contribute to phenotypic plasticity by extending or restricting the range of accessible gene expression states.

Motivated by our previous findings that gene expression in CRCs shows high plasticity23, we examined the heritability of APG expression (Supplementary Note) using phylogenetic signal analysis27,28. Strong or recurrent phylogenetic signal correlated with subclonal HLA LOH and subclonal differences in the pattern of open chromatin in cancer C559 (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). However, the generally low level of phylogenetic signal (only in 17 of 297 gene–cancer combinations evaluated), combined with high intratumor heterogeneity confirms that the expression of APGs is plastic, similar to most genes.

We examined whether epigenome reorganization preferentially silences neoantigens, (that is, epigenetic immuno-editing). We collated the chromatin accessibility of all genetic loci where a protein-changing mutation was detected. Neoantigens were enriched in genes where SCAAs tended to close chromatin (Fisher's exact test odds ratio (OR)(neoantigen and SCAA loss) = 1.46 (1.05–2.03); Fig. 2b), and this observation was also true on the individual cancer level (P = 0.017; Fig. 2c). SCAA loss enrichment was significant in MMRd cancers (Fisher's exact test OR(neoantigen and SCAA loss) = 1.52 (1.03–2.27)) but not in MMRp—the latter probably due to lack of power, as the distribution of neoantigens and SCAA-loss-affected mutations was not different between MMRp and MMRd cancers (χ2-test P = 0.37). We also found that significantly more SCAA losses were associated with neoantigens than with nonantigenic SNVs (P = 0.0085; Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Next, we examined transcriptional expression of neoantigens. We compared the proportion of neoantigens to nonantigenic protein-changing mutations falling within specific genes, and found that genes with high and consistent expression (groups 1 and 2 of ref. 23; Supplementary Note) were depleted significantly of clonal, but not subclonal, SNV neoantigens (Fisher's exact test OR(neoantigen and in group 1) = 0.73 (0.54–1.00) and OR(neoantigen and in group 2) = 0.75 (0.60–0.94); Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4b–d). Frameshift neoantigens showed similar patterns (Extended Data Fig. 4e–h), suggesting clonal neoantigens are typically found in genes with low and/or variable expression.

We also examined allele-specific expression of neoantigens. Clonal neoantigens were significantly less likely to be expressed (Fisher's exact test OR(neoantigen and not expressed) = 1.53 (1.03–2.30)) than non-antigenic clonal SNVs (Fig. 2e), and this was also true on the level of individual cancers (Fig. 2f). Subclonal mutations showed no significant difference; however, this could have been due to lack of power, as downsampling clonal mutations to similar numbers also eliminated the previously observed difference (only 3 of 50 downsampled clonal datasets significant). Further, neoantigen silencing was more widespread within a cancer (observed in more biopsies from that cancer) than silencing of nonantigenic SNVs (Fig. 2g). Overall, around 50% of neoantigens were found to be transcriptionally immuno-edited, with the exception of C516—a highly escaped Lynch syndrome-associated MMRd cancer (Extended Data Fig. 1). After exclusion of this cancer, we confirmed transcriptomic silencing of neoantigens in all (Fisher's exact test OR(neoantigen and not expressed) = 2.07 (0.99–4.40), OR(clonal neoantigen and not expressed) = 2.88 (1.2–7.0)) and MMRp cancers (OR(clonal neoantigen and not expressed) = 3.7 (1.1–14.3)).

Collectively, we observed that (clonal) neoantigens are enriched in genes with low expression and/or in regions of closed chromatin and are further depleted through allele-specific expression modulation. All these processes of postgenetic immuno-editing are likely to have an underlying somatic epigenetic mechanism.

We next examined how the structure and composition of the TME contributed to immune evasion. Quantitative analysis of CyCIF data showed that overall tumors were significantly depleted of immune cells (Fig. 1c). The fraction of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was significantly lower in superficial tumor and in the invasive margin than in adjacent normal mucosa (P = 3 × 10−5 and P = 3 × 10−3, respectively; Fig. 3a) and CTLs were more distant from epithelial cells in tumor-containing regions than in normal mucosa (P < 10−16); Fig. 3b,c). CTL–tumor cell distance was highest in superficial tumor regions. Further, CTLA-4-expressing FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells), associated with an immune-suppressive function, were enriched in all tumor regions compared to normal mucosa (P = 0.012, P = 0.01 and P = 6 × 10−3 for superficial tumor, invasive margin and node; Fig. 3d), consistent with previous reports29.

Points in a and d correspond to individual ROIs. The P value of the mixed-effects model incorporating Patient as a random effect is indicated at the top of a and d.

We confirmed that lymphocyte infiltration was reduced in superficial tumor samples compared to adjacent and distant normal mucosa, using deep-learning-based cell classifier analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining30 (P = 1.5 × 10−6, P = 1.6 × 10−3, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 5; Methods). However, the total lymphocyte count in the invasive margin and lymph node deposits was similar to that observed in normal samples, indicating specific depletion of CTLs at invasion.

We next examined the evolution of genetic immune escape alterations. Clonal immune escape mutations were detected in 8 of 29 CRCs (Figs. 1b and 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1) with three cancers (C518, C524, C548; Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1) carrying multiple HLA alterations on independent branches of their phylogenetic tree. This parallel emergence suggests strong selection for immune escape31. Minor subclones with immune escape alterations (alteration present in less than 25% of samples from a tumor) were detected in a further four cases (C537, C543, C547, C559; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). Two HLA mutations (in C524 and in C537) were also confirmed in the invasive margin of matched FFPE–PS samples.

Points in e–h correspond to ROIs/biopsies and the P value of the mixed-effects model incorporating Patient as a random effect is indicated at the top of each panel.

We found that alterations with the highest predicted impact on immune evasion (based on previous studies) were mostly shared across the whole tumor or several spatially distinct regions, meaning that they were early evolutionary events. For example, beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) mutations were all clonal (n = 4; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 1), and matched RNA-seq revealed significantly decreased B2M expression in these cancers, confirming the impact of these mutations (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Similarly, mutations in NLRC5 and RFXAP—essential factors in the MHC class I enhanceosome32 that reduced expression of class I MHC genes (HLA-A, -B and -C; Extended Data Fig. 6b)—were also shared across several regions. HLA LOH, a common immune escape mechanism shown to be more impactful than HLA mutations33,34, was also clonal or near-clonal in four out of five cancers with HLA LOH (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 1). In contrast, probably low-impact (SNV) mutations in APGs showed the highest variability within tumors: we detected eight HLA SNVs and five SNVs in other APGs that were unique to a single gland or tumor region. We suggest that these alterations probably confer only limited disruption to neoantigen presentation and are weakly selected.

To examine the timing of immune evasion during initial cancer formation, we evaluated neoantigens and immune escape variants in 25 glands from eight colorectal adenomas (CRAs), including an advanced cancer-adjacent MMRd adenoma from patient C516. We note that these adenomas were not the precursor to the CRC, evidenced by the very few shared CRA-CRC mutations. No adenoma glands carried immune escape mutations, with the exception of the advanced CRA in C516 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Further, CRAs had significantly lower proportional neoantigen burden than CRCs (Fig. 4e; Methods), indicating that immune surveillance is more active or effective in CRAs than in CRCs. The two MMRp CRAs detected adjacent to MMRd CRCs did not bias this observation, as it was reiterated in MMRp-only samples (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Therefore, we suggest that immune escape occurs at the outset of, or early during, CRC outgrowth.

We measured how the presence and extent of genetically or epigenetically driven immune escape correlated with immune selection and infiltration. In MMRp CRCs, we observed a trend for lower overall neoantigen burden (Fig. 4f) in genetically escaped regions, especially when compared to cancers with only epigenetic alteration, although this trend was not significant when accounting for same-patient biopsies through a mixed-effect model (Methods). Noteworthy was that C524 and C548—cases with parallel evolution of HLA alterations—had biopsies with immune dNdS <1 (stringent immuno-editing) suggesting past stringent immune surveillance could have led to selection for these HLA alterations (Fig. 1b). Partially escaped CRCs also had an intermediate overall proportional neoantigen burden, with immune dNdS values below 1, indicating immuno-editing (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

In the matched CyCIF data, PD-1+ cells, VISTA+ cells and CD163+ cells, which are known to mediate T cell exhaustion35 and promote tumor growth, were enriched in partially escaped cancers (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), indicating a TME with impaired immune elimination ability. Fibroblasts were more abundant in escaped cancers, while CTLs and Treg cells showed no difference by escape status (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Epigenetically escaped cancers (without genetic escape), when compared to nonescaped biopsies, showed an enrichment of CD68+ cells (macrophages) and CD45RO+ cells (memory T cells), suggesting an association between SCAA-loss of antigen presentation and the TME. Using RNA-seq data, we explored the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway, often modulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts and associated with T cell exclusion. We observed a trend for higher fibroblast TGFβ signature (F-TBRS36) in partially and epigenetically escaped samples, and that TGFβ receptor 2 (TGFBR2) had significantly higher expression in escaped cancer biopsies than nonescaped or partially escaped ones (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). These findings suggest that genetically escaped cancers were subject to strong selection during early development, before expansion or gaining subclonal escape.

We also assessed the intratumor distribution of neoantigens (Supplementary Note) and found that significant depletion in variant allele frequencies (VAFs)—associated with immune selection—was restricted to escaped MMRp cases (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test P = 0.012; Extended data Fig. 8a–c), and neoantigens were as likely to be shared between samples from a tumor as nonantigenic mutations (Extended Data Fig. 8d–f). These data are indicative of relatively uniform immune selective pressures across large tumor regions.

We sought to further explore intratumor heterogeneity in genetic immuno-editing using our spatially resolved gland-level samples. We examined the correlation between histological region and neoantigen burden in comparison to the presence/absence of immune escape and other gland-to-gland tumor-intrinsic difference. The genetic similarity of samples correlated with the physical/phylogenetic distance between samples (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Multivariable regression (Methods) showed that the vast majority of neoantigen burden variation was explained by patient-specific effects and progression status (CRA versus CRC), with negligible contribution from other variables (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9c). Patient-specific effects also dominated over the histological location of the sample (superficial, invasive edge or node) (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9d). Using the immune dNdS measure in place of neoantigen burden gave analogous results (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). This was also true when clonal and subclonal mutations were considered separately, and when tumors were stratified by immune escape status (Extended Data Fig. 9g–i).

Circles denote the estimated coefficients, with whiskers showing 95% CIs. A significant P value from the multivariable regression is indicated in a. Patient-associated coefficients are represented by the range of coefficients estimated, shown in light purple. c,d, Proportional neoantigen burden (c) and immune dNdS (d) in FF–WGS biopsies with subclonal immune escape. Values have been normalized by the average of all deep-sequenced biopsies phylogenetically close to the escaped biopsy (Extended Data Fig. 1). Points correspond to individual biopsies and cancers are depicted in different colors. P values from two-sided one-sample t-tests against the null hypothesis of mean = 1 are shown at the top of each panel.

We analyzed the impact of subclonal immune escape by comparing neoantigen burdens between mutated and unmutated phylogenetically close regions in cancers with subclonal immune escape mutations (Extended Data Fig. 1; Methods). Subclonal escape was not associated systematically with higher normalized neoantigen burden or immune dNdS values, with the exception of HLA-mutated biopsies in C543 that did carry a higher antigenic burden (Fig. 5c,d). These data confirm that subclonal escape had, at most, a modest effect on the intensity of immuno-editing.

To confirm that results were not dependent on the clonal neoantigen burden, we performed downsampling of clonal SNVs and repeated the multivariate regression against proportional neoantigen burden (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods). In most cases we still did not observe significant differences between subclonally immune escaped and phylogenetically related regions.

We next focused on immuno-editing and TME structure in FFPE–PS samples, to identify spatially diverse determinants at the invasive margin and lymph node deposits. We mapped association between TME components and immuno-editing through a multivariable analysis extending Fig. 5b, where we included key infiltrates identified in our previous analyses (Extended Data Fig. 10a). We found that CTLs and CD163+ macrophages and CTLA-4+ Treg cells showed an association with neoantigen burden. When categorizing lymphocytes as tumor-infiltrating, adjacent or distant37, we observed that invasive margins had a higher ratio of infiltrating lymphocytes compared to the superficial tumor (Fig. 6a), although this observation could not be reproduced in CyCIF images, probably due to reduced sample size. CyCIF revealed that the proportion of PD-L1+ tumor cells (probably repressive of T cell activity) was significantly higher at the invasive margin than in superficial tumor (Fig. 6b). These results imply heightened immune surveillance at the invasive margin that is then reduced in node deposits.

Points in a, b and e correspond to ROIs/biopsies and P value of the mixed-effects model incorporating Patient as a random effect is indicated at the top of b.

We sought additional evidence of heightened immune surveillance at the invasive edge by deriving 15 cellular neighborhoods38 (CNs), from our CyCIF data (Supplementary Methods and Extended Data Fig. 10b). The fraction of cells belonging to CN3 (highly enriched for PD-L1+ cells, including PD-L1+ epithelial cells) was significantly higher in invasive margin and node deposits than in superficial tumor, while CN10 (also with general enrichment for PD-L1+ cells) was present at similar proportions in all tumor-associated regions (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d).

PD-L1+ tumor cells were dispersed within PD-L1+ neighborhoods, even within single tumor glands (Fig. 6c), suggesting high plasticity in PD-L1 expression. We examined colocalisation of CTLs and PD-L1+ cells and found that PD-L1+ epithelial cells were significantly closer to CTLs than PD-L1− epithelial cells, with the closest PD-L1+–CTL relationship observed in the invasive margin (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). Nonepithelial cells expressing PD-L1 were also enriched in the invasive margin, as well as in node deposits (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Moreover, PD-L1+ cells were mixed uniformly with (cognate) PD-1+ cells in the invasive margin and node, whereas they often showed exclusion in superficial tumor and normal tissue (Fig. 6e). These observations suggest that CTL surveillance is heightened at the invasive edge and PD-L1 expression may arise as an adaptive response to it.

In matched genomic data, we explored immune selection signal within the invasive margin samples specifically. We observed that these samples contained candidate highly immunogenic neoantigens at lower VAFs than nonimmunogenic mutations (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test P = 6 × 10−4; Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Depletion of neoantigens was most prevalent within small subclones (0.05 < VAF < 0.1, P = 2 × 10−4; Fig. 6f). On the other hand, no neoantigen VAF depletion was observed in superficial tumor or node deposits (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c), or for low-antigenicity neoantigens (Supplementary Fig. 2d), in agreement with our earlier finding that sample location was not associated with systematic differences neoantigen elimination. Therefore, it appears that enhanced immuno-editing occurs as a variable ongoing process at the point of invasion, affecting primarily very small subclones (~100 cells) of increased immunogenicity.

In this work, we mapped the interplay of epigenetic, genetic and microenvironmental processes that collectively establish immune evasion and shape tumor-immune coevolution in CRC. Our analyses indicate that immune evasion processes are part of the ‘Big Bang' that forms CRCs39, which then specifies the immunogenicity of the whole cancer.

We found that SCAAs contribute to downregulation of neoantigen-carrying genes and genes associated with antigen presentation. We identified several TFs as potential regulators of APGs through SCAA losses. Notably, NFIC binding sites covered all SCAA-affected APGs, although its functional validation as an experimental target for immunomodulation in CRC is necessary. Promisingly, NFIC has recently been indicated in immunotherapy response in a subgroup of lung cancer patients, where its silencing led to an immune escaped phenotype40.

We found that immunogenic alterations are depleted preferentially in transcription through (so far uncharacterized) epigenetic mechanisms, especially relevant for the control of clonal neoantigens that immune selection probably acts upon41,42. Our results align with previous observations that epigenetic and environmental factors play a substantial role in determining cancer prognosis, immune sensitivity and response to immunotherapy20,43,44,45. Consequently, mapping the epigenome could identify patients with lower/higher potential for immunotherapy response; large cohort studies are required. Feasibly, drugs modifying the epigenome or selected TF activity could have a profound impact on neoantigen presentation and potentially synergize with immunotherapeutic drugs. This will require future work on epigenetic target validation in patient-derived co-culture model systems such as organoids46.

Although there is heterogeneity in the neoantigen burden and composition of the immune microenvironment, we observed that clonal features are most important for determining immunogenicity. We found that the acquisition of immune tolerance happens before or during early carcinoma expansion, as microenvironmental remodeling was prevalent throughout all tumor-associated regions, coupled with high-impact immune escape genetic alterations and epigenetic processes to ensure reduced neoantigen presentation and immune activation. This results in a ‘Big Bang' tumor-immune coevolution where pre-expansion somatic alterations and TME features determine the clonal neoantigen burden of these cancers and set the trajectory of evolution, with ongoing (subclonal) selection forces playing only a weak role. This is in agreement with our previous work that also highlighted a shift in immunogenicity before carcinoma expansion14. Collectively, these data suggest that CRC are no longer engaged in an ‘all-out war' with the immune system after initial expansion. We found that ongoing ‘battles' of cancer-immune interaction are limited to small localized subclones along the invasive margin of MMRp CRCs, where we presume that there is a large change in immune microenvironmental composition and hence more pronounced immuno-editing. These subclones are characterized by an intricate interplay of higher CTL infiltration, depletion of subclonal neoantigens and PD-L1+ expression, painting the picture of an ‘ongoing skirmish' between active immune and cancer cells. However, we did not observe any variation associated with subclonal immune alterations within the superficial tumor, confirming that the tumor bulk is not shaped by such ongoing battles.

Overall, our work indicates the acquisition of immune escape and/or an immune excluded microenvironment is part of the ‘Big Bang' necessary for early carcinoma expansion in CRCs. We observe that epigenetic, transcriptomic and microenvironmental mechanisms add a layer of regulation to the immunogenomic profile of CRC cells, allowing further adaptation through both hereditary and plastic means. Our findings suggest evaluating and targeting of epigenetic machinery and TME reorganization as a new way to stratify patients and potentially enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.

Our FF–WGS samples were comprised of processed data from previous sequencing experiments of our evolutionary predictions in CRC cohort, which has been described in refs. 15,23. All patients gave informed consent in writing for collection of their materials to the UCLH Cancer Biobank (Research Ethics Committee approval 15/YH/0311). All investigators were blinded to patient data related to outcome, and all clinicopathological information.

Our FFPE–PS samples originated from 11 stage III microsatellite-stable cancers with lymph node metastases from the same cohort, 9 of which are shared with FF–WGS samples. FFPE sections were cut in the following order: H&E-1 (5 μm), 5 × 8 μm for laser capture microdissection, H&E-2 (5 μm), 8 × 5 μm for CyCIF, H&E-3 (5 μm). The H&E slides from each FFPE block were digitized using the NanoZoomer S210 or S60 (Hamamatsu). Images were reviewed using NDPViewer software (v.2.9.29).

Regions of interest (ROIs) were identified as single glands or clusters of small adjacent glands (microbiopsies) from superficial, invasive margin or lymph node deposits. Superficial regions were defined as cancer regions adjacent to or contiguous with normal mucosa. The tumor–normal interface was identified where possible, and the invasive margin was defined as the region within 500 μm either side of the tumor–normal interface (with an overall extent of ~1 mm).

ROIs were microdissected using PALM MicroBeam Laser Microdissection (Zeiss). DNA was extracted using the High Pure FFPET DNA Isolation Kit (Roche). Extracted FFPE DNA was repaired using the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix. Postrepair, whole-genome libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with unique molecular identifier (UMI) adapters ligated onto DNA molecules.

PS on FFPE samples was carried out using a custom targeted panel designed by L. Zapata and manufactured by Twist BioSciences, focusing on regions encoding the immunopeptidome and antigen-presenting related genes. The immunopeptidome was defined as the set of the human nine-mers that bind strongly to one of the top 70 HLA alleles, was confirmed T cell positive in IEDB and were derived from a gene with mean expression of more than one fragments per kilobase million pancancer. The final list of these immunopeptidome loci can be obtained from: https://github.com/luisgls/SOPRANO/blob/master/immunopeptidomes/human/allhlaBinders_exprmean1.IEDBpeps.unique.bed.

The Twist Target Enrichment Protocol was used to hybridize probes from the this custom panel with prepared libraries. Hybridized targets were isolated and amplified with PCR. Paired-end 50-bp runs were performed on Novaseq S1 (Illumina).

The processing of FF–WGS data was detailed in ref. 15.

For FFPE–PS samples, three sets of fastq reads were aligned to human reference genome build hg38 to generate an unmapped bam using FastqToBam (Fgbio v.1.3.0). Fastq files were then created from this unmapped bam (SamToFastq, Picard v.2.20.3) and aligned to human reference genome build GRCh38/hg38 with Burrows–Wheeler Aligner package BWA-MEM v.0.7.17. Alignment data from the outputted bam from this step were merged with data in the previously generated unmapped bam (using the MergeBamAlignment function of Picard v.2.20.3). The merged bam file was then used as input for GroupReadsByUMI (Fgbio v.1.3.0). ‘Adjacency' was used as the strategy for grouping so that errors were allowed between UMIs, but only when there was a count gradient. The allowable number of edits/changes between UMIs was set to 1, and minimum mapping quality to 30 (default).

Consensus sequences were called from reads with the same unique molecular tag (CallMolecularConsensusReads) and filtered using FilterConsensusReads to exclude consensus sequences with fewer than two contributing reads, mask consensus bases with quality less than 30, accept a maximum raw-read error rate across the entire consensus read of 0.05, accept a maximum error rate for a single consensus base of 0.1 and accept a maximum fraction of 0.2 for no-calls in the read after filtering.

The filtered reads were then re-aligned to GRCh38/hg38, and variant calling was performed using Mutect2 (v.4.1.4.1) with a bed file specifying regions of the genome covered by the targeted panel. Normal samples from adjacent muscle were used as matched normal for variant calling. The resulting vcf files were merged for each patient and passed to Platypus (v.0.8.1.1) for multiregion variant calling.

Variant calls were filtered to retain mutations within certain filtering criteria and adequate support for the variant, as described in ref. 15. The same filters were used for both FF–WGS and FFPE–PS samples, except for requiring at least five and at least eight reads covering each site in FF–WGS and FFPE–PS samples, respectively.

FF–WGS samples sequenced at shallow depth were genotyped and fitted on phylogenetic trees using the method described in ref. 15.

Raw RNA-seq read counts were normalized and converted using DESeq2 as described in ref. 15. The code for reproducing RNA-seq processing can be found at https://github.com/JacobHouseham/EPICC_transcriptome. Raw counts were converted either to transcript per million (TPM) values or processed counts following VST, see ‘2.gene_expression_normalisation_and_filtering.Rmd' within the above repository. TPM values were used to assess expression levels of genes (for example, to establish constitutively expressed genes), while VST values were used for between-sample comparison of a particular gene.

HLA-A, -B and -C haplotyping was performed using polysolver47 (v.1.0) on FF–WGS samples, by running shell_call_hla_type with default settings. As ethnicity information was not available, we used ‘Unknown' for all samples. To increase coverage, we used merged bam files created from all sequencing files from a given cancer. For validation, we also performed haplotyping on merged bams formed of normal (blood or normal colon tissue) samples and compared the predicted haplotypes. The predicted haplotypes had a high concordance, with haplotypes predicted using all samples providing one more heterozygous haplotype than normal-only haplotypes in 6 of 30 cases. Based on the average homozygosity across CRCs (as seen in TCGA CRC samples8), we accepted the more heterozygous set of alleles predicted to define their set of HLA alleles. For all HLA alterations, we confirmed that the alterations are called independent of which haplotyping calls were used.

For FFPE–PS samples we used the calls derived from matched FF–WGS samples. For the two patients where this was not available, we performed haplotyping on adjacent normal mucosal samples following the same steps as described above.

Somatic mutations in the HLA locus were predicted using polysolver47 (v.1.0). The mutation detection script of polysolver (shell_call_hla_mutations_from_type) was run on matched tumor–normal pairs to call tumor-specific alterations in HLA-aligned sequencing reads using MuTect (v.1.16). In addition, Strelka248 (v.2.9.10) was run independently to detect short insertions and deletions in HLA-aligned with increased sensitivity. Both single nucleotide mutations and frameshift alterations passing quality control were annotated by shell_annotate_hla_mutations. Based on this annotation, a mutation in the HLA locus was called if a mutation passed all quality filters and introduced either a missense/nonsense change or was located at a splice site. In addition, we also identified second-tier mutations in unfiltered MuTect files that were detected in insufficient reads to pass quality control, but the exact same nucleotide change was clearly detected in another biopsy of the same tumor, allowing detection in samples with low purity or sequencing coverage.

LOH at the HLA locus was predicted using LOHHLA33 and sequenza49. First, we evaluated the allele-specific copy number as predicted by sequenza (v.2.1.2) at the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C loci. Samples with a predicted minor allele copy number of 0 (for example, 2:0, 3:0) were labeled as candidate LOH. Then, we ran LOHHLA with the polysolver-generated haplotype files and matched tumor–normal pairs as input. A type I allele of a patient was annotated as ‘allelic imbalance' (AI) if the associated P value was lower than 0.01. Alleles with AI were labeled as LOH if the following criteria held: (1) the predicted copy number of the lost allele was below 0.5 with confidence interval (CI) strictly below 0.7; (2) the copy number of the kept allele was above 0.75; (3) the number of mismatched sites between alleles was above 10.

HLA LOH was identified by both methods independently in 18 deep-sequenced samples. HLA LOHs called by only one of the methods were inspected manually. Of LOHHLA-exclusive calls, two were found to be false positives and four were identified as AIs with a minor allele copy number of 1. Of sequenza-exclusive calls, one region showed clear LOH and got classified as HLA LOH; six samples showed similar CN pattern but were missed by LOHHLA due to low purity—as adjacent low-pass sequenced samples showed CN = 1 in the HLA region, we also classified these as HLA LOH. In addition, 25 regions had allelic imbalance detected by LOHHLA that were also confirmed in sequenza to have a CN state of 2:1 or 3:1.

We assembled a list of genes involved in class I type MHC presentation, by using the KEGG pathway ‘antigen processing and presentation' and MHC I pathway specifically. The following genes were considered: TAP1, TAP2, IRF1, NLRC5, TBK1, PSME3, PSME1, ERAP2, ERAP1, HSPBP1, CALR, B2M, PSME2, PSMA7, CANX, CIITA, TAPBP, CREB1, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSPA2, HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA6, HSPA8, IFNG, NFYA, NFYB, NFYC, RFX5, RFXANK and RFXAP. Then, we evaluated the expression of each gene within our cohort and filtered out genes that were not clearly expressed (≥10 TPM) in at least 5% of samples.

Then, we called evaluated the mutations called in these genes following. Only mutations with at least moderate predicted impact were called.

We predicted neoantigens from somatic mutation calls and patient-specific HLA haplotypes using NeoPredPipe26 for both FF–WGS and FFPE–PS samples. We defined neoantigen burden in a sample as the number of (unique) mutations giving rise to at least one strong-binding (rank <0.5) neoantigen. We focused our analysis on SNV neoantigen burden, unless stated otherwise. We also computed the total protein-changing mutation burden, and used this value to obtain the proportional neoantigen burden for each sample, that is, what percentage of mutations that has the potential to create a neoantigen does actually lead to strong-binder neoantigens.

We assigned clonal/subclonal categories to all mutations (independent of neoantigen status) based on their presence/absence in all available deep- or panel-sequenced sample of a given cancer. As the targeted genome region, sequencing strategy and sample types were different, we created separate mutations lists of FF–WGS and FFPE–PS samples. For FF–WGS samples, mutations present in all sequenced cancer biopsies were denoted as clonal and all other mutations (absent in at least one biopsy) as subclonal. For FFPE–PS samples, mutations present in all biopsies were deemed clonal, and mutations absent in at least two biopsies were denoted as subclonal.

Immune dNdS was computed using SOPRANO25, with somatic mutation files and personalized immunopeptidome files derived specifically to HLA haplotypes. First, the ratio between dNdS inside (ON-target dNdS) and outside the immunopeptidome (OFF-target dNdS) was computed and corrected for 192-trinucleotide context. Then immune dNdS was computed as the ratio of ON-to-OFF dNdS to correct for technical artefacts that could bias dNdS as computed in OFF-target regions. Samples without any ON- or OFF-target synonymous mutations were excluded from the analysis. In total, immune dNdS estimate was available for 61 FF–WGS and 41 FFPE–PS samples.

To compute immune dNdS separately, we first filtered somatic mutation files to only contain mutations annotated as clonal, then repeated the above procedure on these files.

We identified SCAAs by comparing purity-corrected and copy number-corrected ATAC-seq peak calls of cancer regions (per cancer) to a pool of normal glands15. For immune escape genes, we filtered SCAAs for those located in promoter or enhancer regions associated with a gene from the list detailed in ‘Mutations in antigen-presenting associated genes.' Each SCAA was labeled as loss (fold change of cancer compared to normal < −1) or gain (fold change of cancer compared to normal > 1).

To evaluate the observed number of SCAA losses, we repeated the analysis 200 times with a set of 25–40 randomly chosen genes and computed the number of SCAA losses and gains. We derived a P value as the number of random samples we observed a value more extreme than for APGs.

For neoantigen SCAA loss analysis, we filtered SCAA calls to obtain only losses located in promoter regions (within 1,000 bp of the transcription start site of a gene). Each SCAA loss was annotated by the gene to which they were proximal. As most SCA alterations were found to be clonal, we defined SCAA losses on the cancer level.

We then evaluated for each protein-alteration mutation within a cancer whether the gene it is in had an associated SCAA loss or not. For each cancer, we computed the proportion of mutations (both for neoantigens and for nonantigenic mutations) that were classified as downstream of a SCAA loss. Similarly, for each SCAA loss in a given cancer, we evaluated whether it was upstream of a protein-changing mutation and, if so, within each cancer, we counted the number of SCAA losses upstream of neoantigen/nonantigenic mutations.

We used the TF binding sites obtained from curated human TF motifs in ref. 21, also available as part of the processed Mendeley dataset (‘Data availability').

We examined the list of ATAC-seq peaks that showed statistically significant somatic loss in at least one cancer (27 peaks, representing 20 unique APGs). We then filtered this set to peaks with loss in more than one patient (recurrent SCAA losses), leading to a total of ten genomic regions associated with eight APGs. We identified TFs that are predicted to bind to these regions as those with a binding site in <1,000 bp distance of a given peak, using the distanceToNearest function of the GenomicRanges package in R. We selected for plotting ten TFs that bound more than two of the regions (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

For each SNV detected in FF–WGS samples, we quantified the number of reads in the matched RNA-seq data supporting the mutation using bam-readcount (v.1.0.1)50. For a mutation to be classified as expressed in a sample, we required three or more RNA reads overlapping the position to support the variant base. For a mutation to be classified as not expressed (that is transcriptionally edited), we required more than ten overlapping reads, with zero supporting the variant. We chose the threshold of more than ten so that the probability of misclassifying a mutation present at a true allele frequency of 0.25 or higher was <5%. Mutation–sample pairs that did not qualify for either of these categories were left blank to signify insufficient evidence.

For each cancer, we computed the proportion of mutations that had evidence of transcriptional editing (present in WGS but not expressed in RNA-seq) in at least one sample. Similarly, for each mutation in a cancer, we computed the number of samples that expressed that mutation and the number of samples that (confidently) did not express it. We excluded mutations that had sufficient evidence for expressed/not status in fewer than two samples. We used the median proportion of biopsies with evidence of editing to derive a single value per cancer per mutation type.

Sections were cut from diagnostic FFPE blocks sampled at resection. H&E slides pre- and post-laser capture microdissection (LCM) and post-CyCIF were scanned using the NanoZoomer S210 slide scanner (Hamamatsu). Representative sections were selected for annotations, which were drawn on pre-LCM H&E slides as first choice in most cases. Annotations included: all tumor (on a slide); the tumor–normal interface; any deposits of cancer within nodes; and adjacent normal mucosa (within 5 mm of superficial tumor) and normal mucosa further away (>5 mm away from tumor).

Annotations were made using the NDPViewer software (v.2.9.29). The tumor–normal interface was expanded by 500 μm on either side to identify the invasive margin. Images with annotations were analyzed using a digital cell classifier, which uses deep learning methodology modeled on a spatially constrained neural network architecture51. The model first detects cells through predicted location of cell nuclei, then classifies them as: normal epithelial, cancer epithelial, fibroblast, lymphocyte, neutrophil, macrophage, endothelial. Absolute counts are calculated for each annotated region. For each annotation, number of cells were normalized to the total number of epithelial cells to obtain per epithelial cell counts.

In addition, we used a further classifier37 to class all tumor-associated lymphocytes as infiltrating, adjacent or distant based on proximity to tumor cells.

ROIs that matched the cancer glands/microbiopsies used for LCM were identified using the H&Es pre-LCM and post-LCM and extended by an additional 1 mm at the edges. All CyCIF sections were 5 μm thick. The maximum separation between the LCM slides and the CyCIF slide was 10 μm.

The protocol was based on previous methods from ref. 24. Full details of fluorescent antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Image and statistical analysis of CyCIF images is detailed in Supplementary Methods.

All statistical analyses were carried out in R (v.4.4.2). All comparisons between pairs of samples were carried out using two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum test, without additional adjustment of P values, unless stated otherwise. In all figures, visual elements of the boxplots correspond to the following summary statistics: center line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, 1.5× interquartile range.

To account for multiple samples originating from the same patient, we used a mixed-effects model implemented with the R package lme4 (v.1.1.36). We incorporated Patient as a random effect and the tested variable (for example CRA/CRC) as a fixed effect affecting the intercept into the mixed-effects model. The significance of the fixed effect was evaluated by comparing this ‘full' model to one with only random effects, using ANOVA. The P value of this test (Pr(>Chisq)) is reported as P(fixed effect).

We created 2 × 2 contingency tables by counting mutations that are neoantigens/nonantigenic and (1) in a gene in the given gene group or not; (2) in a consistently expressed gene or not; (3) in a gene with somatically closed promoter or not or (4) not expressed (missing) in at least one sample or not. Fisher's exact test was used to compute the OR and CIs on these tables. The above steps were repeated separately on clonal and subclonal mutations alone.

Multivariable regression models were constructed using the functions betareg (for proportional burden) and lm (for immune dNdS). Sample type (gland/bulk for FF–WGS and superficial tumor/IM/node for FFPE–PS), tissue type (adenoma/cancer), immune escape (escape/weak-escape/no-escape) and patient were encoded as categorical variables; purity as a continuous variable. For Extended Data Fig. 10, sample type and patient were encoded as categorical variables and all immune infiltrate values handled as continuous variables (unit: number per epithelial cell). Results were visualized using the plot_summs function from the package jtools, omitting the full list of coefficients assigned to patients (as well as sample type for Extended Data Fig. 10a) to make the visuals easier to interpret. Instead, on Fig. 5a,b, the smallest and largest patient-associated coefficients were identified and plotted to highlight the range of coefficients.

You've probably read plenty of recent news stories about how San Francisco is a failed city. Our infrastructure is crumbling, our streets are scary, our social fabric is torn and frayed. Most of that stuff is false. Yes, San Francisco has issues, but they're the same problems nearly all US cities are facing as they struggle to reorient themselves to our new, post-pandemic economic reality. The “doom loop” narrative that's often repeated in the national press is a gross exaggeration.

The truth is that San Francisco is thriving. We are at the epicenter of the machine intelligence revolution, as the forces of change draw tech wizards, entrepreneurs, and VC megabucks into our city like a neodymium magnet. Our counterculture roots are still sprouting, and the reigning ethos is one that encourages free thinkers to blaze their own trail.

The city is small and walkable—just 49 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides—and rich with natural green spaces. It's diverse, with thriving Asian, Pacific Islander, and Latin American communities. It's also a mecca for queer folks and a sanctuary for trans and nonbinary young people. It will spoil you with culture, mild weather, and positively killer views from the tops of the famously abundant hills.

If you're coming to town for a job interview, a conference, a VC pitch tour, a new job, or if you're just here to soak up the vibes, this is where to go, what to do, and how to find your people.

417 Stockton Street, (415) 400-0500

You'll find this entry in the Palisociety hotel chain on the edge of Union Square, tucked between the mouth of the Stockton tunnel and SF's massive flagship Apple store. The recently renovated historic building is brimming with old-timey charm (including the 110-year-old Otis elevator, one of the oldest in the city) but has modern conveniences, like the fact that concierge requests are made and resolved over text message. The Pali is also affordable; a single queen room is rarely over $150. On the second floor is the spacious and chill Bar Maritime, which features a knockout menu of nautical-themed craft cocktails and small plates. The full-service Maritime Boat Club restaurant in the back, with a seafood-focused (but vegetarian-friendly) seasonal menu, also shouldn't be missed. Top destinations in nearby neighborhoods—the bustling restaurants of Chinatown and the lively bars and nightclubs of North Beach—are 10 to 20 minutes away on foot. A short walk in the other direction leads you to the Moscone Convention Center and the corporate offices south of Market street in the SOMA district.

545 Post St, (415) 563-0303

On the opposite side of Union Square, you'll find this boutique hotel that takes its inspiration from San Francisco's history as a rock music hub. Yeah sure, Led Zeppelin is British, but you'll find plenty of Janis, Jerry, Sly, and Carlos on the walls and in the overhead speakers here. On-site amenities are abundant—24-hour game room; decent burgers in the bar; solid fitness center; and goodie bags for pets, who are welcome—and the location is close to the Mid-Market district that Uber, Reddit, and countless tech companies call home. The Moscone Center and the Salesforce tower are each a 20-minute walk. A wide selection of rooms are available, from simple queens for around $200 to deluxe suites at $350 and up, but even the queen rooms are spacious and funky … in a Summer of Love-via-Urban Outfitters sort of way.

Nearby: Union Square is filled with big-name retailers, but San Francisco's theater district unrolls just steps to the west. There you'll find traditional Broadway-style musicals, as well as the Warfield Theater, which hosts national headliners like TV on the Radio, Garbage, and Earl Sweatshirt. There's good food on every block, but highlights are Hinodeya Ramen on O'Farrell Street, the Sudanese Arabic menu at Z Zoul Cafe, and two-Michelin-starred fine dining at Sons & Daughters. Try for a walk-in seat at the bar at Kin Khao, currently in the running for the best Thai food in SF with a cocktail menu that will make you lose feeling in your extremities. Get your Guiness on at Johnny Foley's, one of the nicer Irish pubs in the city. And in addition to that giant Apple store, the five-story Macy's, and all the high-end boutiques ringing Union Square, the city's first Nintendo store just opened on the same corner Tippi Hedren walks across in the opening shot of The Birds.

181 3rd Street, (415) 777-5300

This high-rise is a favorite of visiting tech execs and conference attendees, as it's right across the street from the sprawling Moscone Center, where the Dreamforce, Workday Rising, and Microsoft Ignite conferences all take place. Rooms are well appointed with accessible workspaces, calming views of the afternoon fog creeping over Twin Peaks, and prices at around $350 to $550 most weeknights. (Prices go up the weeks of the big conferences.) The gym looks like something out of a Paul Verhoeven movie but has plenty of cardio machines. This branch of Marriott's W chain is a popular venue for corporate meetings, with 17 large event rooms on the lower floors, including a breezy indoor-outdoor terrace.

Nearby: If you're looking for a more luxurious stay, try the St. Regis Hotel just two blocks up 3rd Street toward downtown. Rooms there start around $700. This corner of SOMA is rich with cultural institutions; the SFMOMA and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts are on the same block of 3rd Street as both hotels. Food is also abundant: Try Lao Table for Southeast Asian fare and Delarosa Downtown for solid pizza and pasta. The Grove is a good spot for a straightforward soup-salad-sandwich lunch, and also the best spot in the area for grab-and-go breakfast. For cocktails, try the subterranean Local Edition, the library-like Novela, and the charmingly old-school House of Shields.

12 4th Street, (415) 348-1111

Staying in SOMA but venturing a little further west, we recommend this handsome hotel at the corner of 4th and Market streets, right across the street from the boarding zone for the world-famous Powell Street cable car. Zelos has a chic and fashionable vibe, with large and bold artwork on display everywhere, even the rooms. Pets are welcome, and the fitness center has Peloton bikes. Rooms with king beds start at a little over $300 a night. The hotel's restaurant, Dirty Habit, serves a sort of maximalist take on California cuisine, but the real draw is the 640-plus-bottle selection of whiskies. If you can't decide which tipple to sip, go for one of the curated whiskey flights.

Nearby: Other hotels in the area we'd recommend are the InterContinental and the Marriott Marquis. Both are comparable in price to the Zelos. Food is abundant around here. Meatheads need to try the burger at Marlowe, a 15-minute stroll down 4th Street. We wouldn't recommend venturing further west than 7th street—things get dicey after dark—but if you head toward 6th, you'll find fantastic Vietnamese food. Tin Vietnamese is modern and fresh, and Miss Saigon is some greasy, flavorful goodness with an atmosphere that can be best described as Santa's Electric Acid Garden. For happy hour, go to The Harlequin in Mint Plaza or try Press Club, one of the better wine bars in downtown SF. The Powell Street cable car will take you on a fairy-tale ride up and over Russian Hill (right past OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's megamansion) and all the way to Fisherman's Wharf, where you can watch the sea lions, watch the tourists, and watch your wallet.

San Francisco is awash in coworking spaces; it's the land of the startup, after all. There are plenty of WeWorks and established coworking brands—especially downtown and in Mid Market—but here are some spots we recommend you try first.

272 Capp Street

This isn't your typical desks-and-chairs coworking space. Noisebridge is a community of makers, hackers, DIY advocates, and hands-on tinkerers of all stripes. To get in, go to the door on a side street in the Mission District, ring the bell, then wait a few minutes (really, maybe several minutes) for one of the volunteer members to welcome you. Inside you'll find desks, workbenches, Wi-Fi, tools, and fabrication equipment, all free to use. If you're looking for a place to hone your 3-D printed prototype, breadboard a circuit for your next hardware demo, or sew some LEDs into your Burning Man outfit, Noisebridge is the place. Queer-friendly, scrappy, and a little punk rock, it's the spot where you'll find your inspiration.

595 Pacific Avenue, plus two more locations

If you're sticking around for a week or two, check out one of the three Canopy spaces in the city. They're very comfy, with office furniture by Herman Miller and August, and the perks are plentiful. Canopy's business model is geared toward longer stays; you pay by the month, either for your own desk ($1,100) or for a space at the community table ($700). If you're just in town for a week or two, the best deal is the Hybrid membership: $445 for any 10 days per month. Small conference rooms and boardrooms are also available.

1540 Market Street, (415) 463-3998

This brightly appointed, quiet-but-lively space in SF's Mid Market neighborhood is the best spot to go if you just need a desk for a day or two. Memberships for longer stays are available, but a day pass is just $25, and you get a discount if you buy a three-day pass. Anchor has a tidy kitchen, private phone booths, free printing, and even a podcast studio.

Ferry Building, 1, Suite 201

Ascend to the top floor of SF's historic waterfront Ferry Building to find Shack15. Expansive, exclusive, and always bustling, the space is just as much of a social hub as it is a coworking space. There are two large rooms, one is quiet and filled with desks, the other is more social. Evening events range from book readings to DJ sets to yoga sound baths. It's a members-only club, but you can apply for a day pass or ask a member to bring you as a guest for a day. The crowd is generally well connected and well funded by VC cash; keep your pitch deck handy.

The city's café culture isn't as robust as New York or Portland, but we do have excellent coffee and comfortable spots where you can work all day. Just know, some coffee shops purposely eschew Wi-Fi and disable their electrical conduits to keep remote workers from lingering. Most, however, will welcome you with open arms as long as you keep buying refills—and keep tipping generously.

181 Fremont Street, 7th Floor (415) 375-5984

This café is nestled in a building right next to Salesforce Park, a funky urban green space on the roof of the city's big bus terminal next to the city's tallest skyscraper, the Salesforce Tower. It sounds odd, but the vibe is more “verdant sun-dappled oasis” than “roof deck with coffee shop.” Andytown is a local roaster with several locations around the city, and the coffee drinks here are excellent. This location has plenty of indoor seating, some outdoor seating, and good Wi-Fi.

3049 20th Street

Situated in the heart of the neighborhood where all of the city's AI companies have set up camp, Atlas has been around since well before the Web 1.0 boom. Low-key and spacious with indoor tables and a covered patio, the café serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so it's open until the early evening—an anomaly in a city where coffee shops close at 3 pm. The food is tasty; try the grilled Cubano, the smoked trout sandwich, or one of the many vegan options.

375 Valencia St., (415) 935-0604

If you just need a clean, well-lighted place to work and you don't need Wi-Fi, visit Four Barrel, one of our many roastery-cafés, and among the best in SF. The coffee drinks are supplemented by delicious pastries, and the tasting bar near the front door often pours rare single-origin roasts. The parklet out on Valencia street, with ebikes and driverless robotaxis whizzing by, is a popular spot for informal two-person meetings.

945 Market Street, (415) 619-4195

OK, so hear me out. Saluhall is the food court connected to (and run by) the city's Ikea. But it's not all Swedish meatballs. No, there are tacos, burgers, noodles, and all manner of food options from local vendors, including excellent craft coffee on the first floor. The Wi-Fi is solid, and the space is big and open, with two floors of tables that are never too crowded. Power outlets are relatively easy to find. One thing you won't find is a quiet atmosphere; bring headphones.

102 South Park, (415) 829-3082

This worker-owned spot is the social hub and spiritual heart of South Park, the neighborhood where Twitter, Instagram, Dropbox, Strava, and countless other San Francisco startups got off the ground. (It's also home to WIRED; our office is nearby, and Centro is a favorite of our staff.) Seating is limited during the lunch rush but plentiful in the mornings and afternoons. The Wi-Fi is solid and free, and the food is excellent; try the salade niçoise.

San Franciscans love to argue about what our most important culinary export is, be it cioppino, sourdough, or the Gibraltar. Around here the verdict is clear: It's the Mission burrito. These gut-busting, foil-wrapped cylinders are made with a flour tortilla that's steamed to give it an extra stretchy pliancy—all the better for filling it with carne asada, al pastor, or tofu ranchero. This style of burro was born in the Mission District (hence the name) so that's where you should go to get one. Our recommended spots are Taqueria Can-Cun, Taqueria El Buen Sabor, Pancho Villa Taqueria, La Corneta Taqueria, and Papalote. All are within the 10 blocks that make up the heart of the Mission, and all have excellent meat and veggie options. (Vegans should try the Veggie California at El Buen Sabor.) Don't skip the aguas frescas.

New Yorkers love to spout off about how their city has the best pizza in the US. You absolutely should ignore them; any seasoned traveler knows you can get phenomenal pizza in almost every big city. San Francisco serves up world-class wood-fired pies at A 16, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, Pizzeria Delfina, and Il Casaro. Flour + Water Pizzeria in North Beach is also worth a trip just to try the Calabrian-chili-infused Bomba Margarita, which pairs perfectly with a slice or five of burrata pizza. For thick focaccia style pizza, try Golden Boy or Cellarmaker. For perfect East Coast–style slices, stop in at The Pizza Shop in the Mission—it's the best slice in the city.

One in five San Franciscans has Chinese ancestry, and our large Chinese and Chinese American population means we have some truly outrageous choices for Chinese cuisine. Most of the best spots are in Chinatown (SF's is the oldest in the country) and in the avenues out by the Pacific ocean. Among the Chinatown hot spots, House of Nanking is a perennial favorite serving Hunan dishes, Taishan Cuisine is the place to go for Cantonese, and Spicy King has killer Sichuan fare. The fine dining at Mister Jiu's is divine, and the relatively new Four Kings is already an upscale favorite among locals. We recommend securing reservations for both, but it's still worth trying for a walk-in seat. For Chinese food in the avenues, point your Waymo to Clement street in the Richmond district. There, you'll find the fast-casual Mamahuhu, the newly opened Dumpling King, and the fiery Sichuan fusion craziness of Spices II.

The Bay Area's history as a hippie mecca is long gone, but the current culture of healthy living, farm-fresh produce, and tech-based meat alternatives is thriving. As such, we're stacked with forward-thinking vegetarian and vegan places. The most accessible of the bunch is Wildseed, an entirely plant-based restaurant in the Marina serving California cuisine with an excellent wine program. Its fast-casual sister restaurant near city hall, Rad Radish, has mostly the same menu. For Chinese fare, try Enjoy Vegetarian, which makes everything on the menu without garlic or onions and still manages to blow the doors off with flavor. For vegan Japanese, we recommend Cha-Ya, a casual spot in the Mission, and the fancier Shizen (also in the Mission) for vegan izakaya and sushi. Vegan ramen is abundant, but the best bowls are at Ramewell and Menya Kanemaru Golden Ramen. And we'd be remiss if we didn't also point you to Greens, one of San Francisco's foundational vegetarian restaurants that's been serving refined market-fresh dishes for over 40 years.

777 Valencia St., (415) 551-5157

It used to be a funeral hall, and now it's a music venue. The Chapel hosts midsize touring acts of all stripes in its 500-person-capacity concert hall. The photogenic wood paneling and 40-foot arched ceiling will be instantly recognizable on your Reels. The bar Curio occupies the front of the space and has an outdoor patio with live jazz, acoustic music, and the occasional DJ set.

2665 Mission Street, (415) 829-3082

This nonprofit venue operates out of the historic Grand Theater and hosts a full calendar of technology-forward cultural events. Check in to find performances, gallery shows, lectures, concerts, literary events, workshops on making music and digital art, and the occasional full-blown IDM rave that flexes the theater's blistering sound system. The annual Gray Area festival takes place in September.

2 Fort Mason, (415) 561-6582

This truly handsome bar is also the community space and social hub of the Long Now Foundation, a local nonprofit that encourages artists, technologists, and policymakers to think about not just the next few years or decades of civilization but also the next few millennia. Such heady conversations about the distant future are right at home in this library-like space—check out the giant mechanical model of the solar system opposite the bar—and all that grand thinking is fueled by one of the more creative cocktail menus in the city.

547 Haight Street, (415) 863-2276

With 54 taps, two casks, and dozens of bottles, cans, and crowlers on the menu, Toronado is a beer drinker's paradise. Check the tap list to see what's currently pouring. It's a restrained, occasionally surly place where the staff brooks no bullshit, so stay patient and cordial and you'll be fine. It's also a cash-only establishment; bring bills and tip generously.

2937 Mission Street, (415) 814-3779

If you prefer a cozy, softly lit place to kick back on a couch and have some maniacally good cocktails, head to Evil Eye. The bar program has creative takes on crowd pleasers like negronis, old-fashioneds, and palomas, as well as adventurous detours like El Gruño: mezcal, bitter fernet, ancho reyes chili liqueur, strawberry shrub, and ginger beer. Balance it out with deviled eggs, togarashi popcorn, and an Impossible burger. Evil Eye also has a playable Xenon pinball machine; released in 1980, it's the first talking pinball game, and features sound effects and voices by synth pioneer Suzanne Ciani.

3158 Mission St., (415) 282-3325

Visit one of the centers of SF queer culture at this LGBTQ+ owned and operated dive bar on the border of the Mission District and Bernal Heights. El Rio has it all: karaoke nights, salsa dancing, line dancing, punk shows, burlesque, indie rock matinees, DJ nights, and poetry readings. The giant back patio rages on both sunny afternoons and chilly nights; it's the perfect spot to enjoy a super-strong margarita or an ice-cold can of Tecate while you make new friends.

Great Hwy, (415) 831-2700

The city's newest park is a 2-mile stretch of coastline on the city's western edge. It used to be the Great Highway, a four-lane thoroughfare for cars, but the city closed it down to auto traffic and opened it up to walkers, runners, cyclists, kids, doggos, and all manner of living beings. It's still fun when it's foggy and windy, which is often. But when the sun breaks through and the deep blue Pacific ocean stretches out to forever, it's absolutely glorious.

Dolores St &, 19th St, (415) 831-2700

The weather at the beach is often a bit of a gamble, so San Franciscans in search of a reliable place to sunbathe, picnic, and party head to Dolores Park. Sitting right on the border of the Castro and the Mission, these six square city blocks of grassy hillside make up the town square for the city's young professionals. It's crowded on weekends, but that's what Find My is for. Bring a blanket, pack some snacks, and don't forget your hoodie; the cold creeps in as soon as the sun dips behind Twin Peaks to the west.

San Francisco is marked by seven massive hills (and many smaller ones), all of which deliver shockingly beautiful views to anyone up for a climb. Create your own peak experience by taking an urban hike up and over Nob Hill. It's the best way to see the city. Starting at Union Square, go straight up Powell street. You'll find the historic Grace Cathedral at the top. From here, you can see the Golden Gate, Alcatraz, the downtown skyline, Potrero Hill, and Twin Peaks—the full panorama. Head downhill to the north to end up at Fisherman's Wharf and Fort Mason, or descend to the west to Polk Street for oysters at Swan.

Yes, it's probably the most touristy thing on this list, but if you're a seasoned cyclist—or even just an OK one—it's a super fun way to spend a weekend morning. Rent a bike in the Haight-Ashbury district, or just grab a Lime or a Bay Wheels-Lyft ebike, and head toward the ocean. JFK Drive runs the 3-mile length of Golden Gate Park, and the eastern half is closed to car traffic, so you can slow your roll as you check out the public art installations or stop and play one of the upright pianos along the route. The western half of the ride is more untamed and scenic—keep an eye out for the bison—and it ends with a tulip garden, a restored windmill, and the sandy breakers at Ocean Beach. Stop at Andytown for a coffee just north of the park entrance, then ride home.

Everyone has an inner monologue. When you're commuting on the train, riding a bike, or in the shower, chances are you're thinking about the day ahead, tasks you need to do, or maybe just mulling over a conversation you had the night before. Much of this stays in our brains, soon to be forgotten or pushed away when the train comes to the station. But what if you could have it all subtly recorded in one place, ready for you to digest later on?

That's what a new company called Sandbar envisions for Stream Ring, an AI-powered smart ring. The company emerged out of stealth today after two years of development, led by cofounders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong. Both previously worked at CTRL-Labs and later at Meta when Mark Zuckerberg's company acquired the neural interface startup. It has raised $13 million in venture funding.

The hardware is Stream Ring, a smart ring you wear on your index finger. Raise your hand and talk into the ring, and you can even whisper into it in crowded areas if you don't want others to hear. It doesn't save any audio of your interactions with the ring; instead, much like many of the AI-powered wearables in the market right now, it transcribes your words into text, which you can access in the Stream app.

“We think of this as the mouse for voice because it solves a lot of the challenges of a voice interaction at once,"" Fahmi tells me in a nondescript office space in Manhattan. ""We mostly imagine it phone away, earbuds in—this allows you to interact immediately with no wake word.”

There's a capacitive sensor on the flat edge of the ring, and a tap-and-hold lets you record your thoughts without being interrupted by an AI assistant. If the assistant responds to you, a simple tap on the sensor will cut it off. The hardware will be waterproof at launch, so you won't have to worry about using it in the rain or on sweaty days.

The Stream also doubles as a media controller, meaning you can tap it once to play or pause music, double-tap for the next track, or swipe for volume control. If, for some reason, Sandbar goes under and its AI backend goes offline, at least you're left with a very expensive media controller, rather than hardware that quickly turns into electronic waste. At present, there are no health-tracking features like those on most smart rings today.

The Stream Ring is available for preorder today in silver ($249) or gold ($299). You can get a ring-sizing kit to determine your size. Each purchase includes three months of Stream Pro, a subscription service that offers unlimited notes and chats, and access to the company's early features. After the trial period, you'll have to pay $10 per month. There is a free tier, though you'll be limited in what features you can access and how many interactions you can make. Sandbar expects to ship the ring in the summer of 2026. You'll need the ring to access the app, though Fahmi says that could change in the future.

The idea is you can talk to the Stream Ring about anything. Ask it what ingredients are needed for a Kerala chicken curry recipe, and it'll give you the answers based on results from the web. You can then ask it to put all of those ingredients into a shopping list, so you can have it ready when you enter a grocery store. Now imagine you're at the grocery store—ask the ring to remind you of what you need, and ask it to cross items off as you place produce into your basket. You'll feel some haptics from the ring as acknowledgment; no screen needed.

Fahmi describes Stream as a tool that sits between a notes app and an AI chatbot. “Stream is what we call a self-extension that's meant to feel like you're talking to yourself to help you build ideas,” he says. “Maybe you're curious about something, or you're planning a meeting you're going into, or you're thinking through the narrative of something you want to write—you can just kind of riff back and forth. At any time, if you want to save something into a note, you can ask Stream to put it into a note, and it'll organize those.”

Stream is powered by several popular large language models, opting for whatever is best suited for the task at hand. There's a mix of on-device processing on the ring, some processing on your connected smartphone, and some in the cloud.

When the AI assistant talks back to you, it'll sound eerily like your own voice—just like your inner monologue. During setup, you'll be asked to say a few phrases, and the app will process that data and generate a voice that sounds very similar to your own. (This is powered by generative AI models from ElevenLabs.) I tried this out, and it indeed sounded like me, just slightly off—a bit deeper than my already-deep voice—which Fahmi says is intentional. There will be other voices you can choose if you don't want to hear a weird version of yourself.

You can use it to simply ask a question as you would run a Google Search. (During my demo, the ring didn't have real-time internet access; Fahmi assures me it will have it when the product ships.) In usage so far by a close-knit group with demo rings, Fahmi says there's about 20 percent note-creation, 20 percent single queries, and 60 percent conversation. That means most of the people testing the ring right now are having more back-and-forth conversations with the Stream Ring, whether that's a discussion around the optimal plants to place in the backyard or prepping for a job interview you're heading to.

“For some people, rather than tracking their heart rate, they want to track their thoughts, and this is a particularly powerful tool for that.”

Fahmi says the ring has “all-day” battery life, and there's a nifty little charger you can place the ring on to top it up, though that's a far shorter window than most smart rings that promise multiple days or even a week of run time. That's likely because you're interacting with the Stream Ring far more frequently, and many other smart rings just passively track your health. There'll be a desktop interface to access your notes, the ability to share notes with other people, and create time-based reminders.

“One way that we view this is that it's the lowest friction interface to thought,” Fahmi says. “You can begin to do a lot of interesting things with that, like a running log of things you've eaten, or workouts you're planning. For some people, rather than tracking their heart rate, they want to track their thoughts, and this is a particularly powerful tool for that.”

It's a complicated time for AI chatbots. There's an uptick in people claiming AI psychosis after conversations with ChatGPT. More recently, the company behind the always-listening Friend AI pendant saw its subway ads defaced by New Yorkers. Fahmi doesn't want you to think of the Stream Ring as a friend, but as an extension of yourself. The Stream Ring isn't an always-listening wearable—you decide when you want to talk to it. “You have to be in control; you can't just ambiently record everything,” he says.

To get around the AI fear, as Fahmi calls it—worries that AI is replacing jobs or may erode creativity—is by placing people at the center of control so the machine acts as an extension of your will. People “push on us, they challenge us, they have their own lives; that's the magic of people. Computers should not be that.”

What if you decide to share deeply personal thoughts with Stream and ask it for advice? Fahmi says the company invests heavily in evaluations to simulate synthetic user interactions to modify how Stream responds to certain conversations. The goal is to make Stream's “character” curious, compassionate, and concise with no defining identity; a tool that can answer questions and is emotionally intelligent but ultimately with no will, opinions, or intent of its own. However, the responses will be personalized based on what you've shared with the ring. (You'll be able to inspect and control what is shared.)

“We want you to have autonomy over it,” he says. “We also want to ensure that we're building something wise and good. This is something a lot of the industry is grappling with and trying to thread a needle through. We're on that journey together, and I hope that our approach of it not being a companion or an assistant leads us to an outcome that feels really good.”

Wireless headphones dominate the market, capturing 78 percent of revenue share in 2024. It's hardly surprising given the near monopolization of music streaming, the convenience of being wire-free, and the blissful quiet of active noise cancelling—but if you prioritize sound quality above all else, a dedicated pair of quality wired headphones should still be the priority.

Audiophile headphones focus on sound quality, design and comfort, and little else. Given the technological innovation from brands such as Sony, Apple and Bowers & Wilkins with the best wireless headphones, at-home listening remains a niche slice of the market. But paired with a quality high-resolution audio source and suitably proficient DAC or headphone amplifier these plush, wired, over-ear designs can sound jawdroppingly good.

There are a couple of pairs trying to do it all, most notably the Focal Bathys $849 (9/10 WIRED Recommended), which has a built-in high-quality DAC and headphone jack for wired listening, as well as the ability for wireless Bluetooth playback as well. But the $500 105 Silva aren't trying to please everyone—as open-back headphones (which means they leak music to those around) they are proudly for “at-home” use, but they certainly make staying in a treat.

Founded in 2011 in Baia Mare, Romania, Meze Audio has been quietly building a reputation for high-end, exquisitely finished headphones. Founded by artist and industrial designer Antonio Meze, his first product, the 99 Classics (2015) blended machined solid walnut earcups, all-metal fastenings, luxurious comfort and great audio, for less that the traditional competition.

Nine launches later, including the flagship $3,000 planar magnetic Empyrean II, and Meze's design language—a mix of strong mid-century shapes, elegant curves and modern materials—is instantly recognizable. I wasn't a huge fan of the aesthetic initially, agreeing with WIRED contributor Simon Lucas, who described an earlier pair as, “designed by someone who should have had their pencils taken away a lot earlier in the process.”

But with the launch of the 105 Silva, I think the brand has nailed the design brilliantly, without compromising on audio quality, comfort or brand aesthetic.

With their name translated from the Romanian for forest, the 105 Silva are a pair of easy-to-drive, open-back 50mm dynamic driver headphones, which blend milled walnut, steel, cast zinc alloy, PU leather headband, 3D printed radial grille, and velour earpads. Every component can be taken apart and serviced too, which is rarely the case these days, unless you're spending thousands.

The 105 Silva include a good quality zipped hard case, 1.8m kevlar reinforced, tangle-resistant cable, and a custom 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter with built-in DAC/amp. My early sample didn't have this connector, but I did use the tiny Fiio BTR13 DAC when testing with my iPhone.

Aesthetics aside, Meze has designed a 50mm driver with a titanium-coated semicrystalline polymer and carbon fiber-reinforced cellulose composite. This combination promises reduced resonance, fast response and a sound profile designed to please as many listeners as possible. These are not flat frequency, analytical headphones, but they are detailed, rich and engaging, and a whole lot of fun to listen to.

At 12.5 ounces (350 grams) they're not especially light, but the combination of sprung steel headband construction and plush earcups makes them float. These are some of the comfiest headphones I've ever worn, with plenty of space for my generously proportioned ears. There's also no pressure if I'm wearing glasses, and (Apple, please take note re: Airpods Max) there's no hint of slippage if I dip my head forward. You can wear these cans for hours on end, but as they are open-back cans, don't think for a second they're for your daily commute, unless that involves moving from couch to desk.

With an impedance of 42 ohms, the 105 Silva are easy to drive, and you'll have no issue playing through your phone, but add a DAC or headphone amp in the mix and you will instantly hear the difference. At 112 dB they're sensitive too, and can play loud whatever your source.

Listening to a range of genres in CD quality 16-bit/44.1 kHz and 24-bit/192 kHz hi-res streaming from Qobuz—using the aforementioned mini DAC, the superb Chord Electronics Mojo 2, and sadly now discontinued Audiolab M-DAC+—and I'm impressed and engrossed from the outset.

A play through of The Look by Metronomy, and the organ stabs, bass and percussion are neatly located, with the lead and backing vocals pleasantly balanced. Everything is driving the track forward, and nothing feels lost. The bass is punchy and textured without being overbearing, and sounds best with pacy, rhythmic tracks.

Quieting it down with a demo version of Man in a Shed, and Nick Drake's unmistakable fingerstyle is gloriously realised. It sounds hauntingly live, as if he were playing in the same room. The very rough edits, and earliest reel-to-reel recordings are a little too raw, but document the period beautifully—and the final studio recording had me staring into space.

Next, I listen to Rolling Stones' Sympathy For The Devil (24-bit/192 kHz), and it's hard to know which to concentrate on first—the percussion, the split between left and right channels, the bassline chugging perfectly, the piano driving it all on further. It's always a treat to hear songs you know so intimately, given a fresh burst of life. Hoo-hoo indeed.

The 105 Silva are up against a lot of competition however, not least from within their own company—the cheaper, more portable 105 AER ($400), for example, have the same driver, but offer up a little less warmth. While nowhere near as luxurious, the Sennheiser HD 550S ($280) offer plenty of detail and a neutral sound profile, while the pricier Audeze LCD-2 Classic ($800) have planar drivers, extraordinary realism and vast soundstage.

But at this $500 price, the Meze Audio 105 Silva are a superb pair of open-backed pair of headphones. They can be powered by just about any source, and are beautifully comfortable. And while their price is hardly a pittance, given the premium materials, luxury build, attention to detail and impressive sustainability they feel almost like a bargain. They don't compete with the $3,000 Focal Stellia that I still dream about, but they're not supposed to. These headphones are for the music fan who wants to be indulged and immersed in their favorite artists, rather than for the audiophile who enjoys the pursuit of perfection, instead of just passion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","‘New York City Has Fallen': MAGA Responds to Zohran Mamdani's Victory With a Racist Freak-Out","https://www.wired.com/story/maga-responds-to-zohran-mamdani-victory/","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:52:00 GMT","

MAGA influencers, Republican lawmakers, and conspiracy theorists all responded to Zohran Mamdani's mayoral victory in New York by pushing far-right anti-immigrant and Islamophobic rhetoric and claiming the city had fallen.

Mamdani, who campaigned on progressive issues and identifies as a democratic socialist, will be the youngest New York mayor in over a century. He will also be the city's first Muslim and South Asian mayor. With over 90 percent of the 2 million votes counted on Wednesday morning, Mamdani held an almost 9 point lead over former governor Andrew Cuomo, with Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa trailing far behind with just 7 percent of the vote.

“The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate,” Mamdani said during his victory speech on Tuesday night. “I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.”

It is Mamdani's embrace of New York's immigrants and his own Muslim upbringing that most of the MAGAsphere fixated on, calling him everything from a “a third-world communist” to a “Marxist” and “a jihadi.”

“A third-world communist won in New York because New York is a third-world city now,” right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X. “This is mass migration working exactly as intended. It isn't anymore complicated than that.”

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy, meanwhile posted a screenshot from a 2023 report on the Nyc.gov website that showed around 50 percent of New York households contain at least one immigrant, without adding a comment.

Others suggested that New York's election result would be a harbinger of things to come across the rest of the US. “Democrats in New York City have chosen a true extremist and Marxist, and the consequences will be felt across our entire nation,” speaker of the House Mike Johnson wrote on X. “Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party.""

Many others focused on Mamdani's Muslim faith, pushing Islamophobic conspiracy theories about the future of New York. “America is about to become a very violent country, Mamdani will encourage Muslims to commit political assassinations to acquire power and silence critics,” conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer wrote in one of her many posts about the election on X.

Loomer also slammed billionaire Bill Ackman, who congratulated Mamdani on Tuesday night despite his intense campaign against him over the past few months. “Never congratulate a jihadi,” Loomer wrote in response to Ackman's post. “Mamdani wants you dead because you are Jewish and American.”

Mamdani's campaign promoted religious tolerance and highlighted the fact that he grew up in an interfaith household, where his father was Muslim and his mother was Hindu. Mamdani ran a campaign on making New York affordable for working-class residents, promoting policies including free childcare, a network of city-owned grocery stores, and more to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. “I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,” Mamdani told NBC's Meet the Press in July.

Some compared Mamdani to London mayor Sadiq Khan, who is also his city's first Muslim mayor.

“New York, be afraid, be very afraid,” Dan Wootton, a pro-MAGA influencer based in the UK, wrote on X. “Zohran Mamdani will take you to a very dark place. Just like Sadiq Khan has done to London. The woke MSM are despicable in their celebrations tonight.”

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, speaking on his War Room podcast on Tuesday night, also compared Mamdani to Khan and said the new mayor would make New York the “wokeist city on planet earth,” while describing the new mayor as everything from a “neo-Marxist” to a “jihadist.”

Bannon also suggested that the Department of Homeland Security “denaturalize” Mamdani and “ship him back to Uganda,” where he was born. Mamdani is a dual citizen of the US and Uganda.

Other influencers and politicians claimed disaster for New York. “Mamdani will usher in a crime wave the likes of which New York has not seen since the 1990s,” far-right influencer Jack Posobiec said on Fox News Tuesday evening, citing something TPUSA cofounder Charlie Kirk posted on X earlier this year.

Similarly, Florida representative Randy Fine wrote on X that “New York City has fallen,” adding: “America is next if we don't stop it.” Nancy Mace took a break from posting about her expletive-filled airport tirade to issue a prophecy: “Bread lines about to be a real thing in New York. Congrats.”

In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott echoed the sentiment. “Join me for a moment of silence for NYC,” Abbott wrote on X. “Thoughts & prayers.”

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, hasn't yet responded to Mamdani's victory in his home city. Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech and said, “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.""

Almost simultaneously, Trump cryptically posted on Truth Social: “... AND SO IT BEGINS!.”

Last month, The US Food and Drug Administration approved a new blood test for assisting the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Produced by Roche, Elecsys pTau181 measures the concentration of a specific molecule—a phosphorylated form of the tau protein—in the blood. Tau is one of two proteins, the other being amyloid, that become malformed and accumulate in the brains of patients with certain types of dementia. It is believed that the buildup of these proteins interferes with the communication of brain cells, leading to these patients' symptoms.

The test had already received authorization in July for marketing in Europe and is thus the first early screening system for Alzheimer's for use in primary care settings approved in the planet's two major pharmaceutical markets. It is an opener in what should soon become a crowded field, as there are several other tests in advanced stages of testing and approval.

Elecsys pTau181 looks in the blood plasma for a form of the tau protein that has a phosphate group attached, which is often found in elevated amounts in Alzheimer's patients. This molecule is an indirect marker of the plaques of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles of tau observed in the brains of patients with the disease.

Some other tests have also been approved, though not for early screening. These assess other biomarkers that relate to these two proteins. One test, called Lumipulse and made by the Japanese company Fujirebio, looks at the ratio between another form of phosphorylated tau (pTau217) and a key protein fragment that forms amyloid plaques (amyloid beta peptide 1-42).

The bottom line is that these tests offer clues to the probable presence of amyloidosis in the brain, which then needs to be diagnosed with greater accuracy using more invasive tests, such as a PET (positron emission tomography) scan and cerebrospinal fluid analysis by lumbar puncture, considered the clinical gold standard for diagnosing amyloid pathology in living patients. Even these, however, come with some degree of uncertainty; true diagnostic certainty can only be had with a post-mortem dissection of the brain.

In the past, confirmation of an Alzheimer's diagnosis was not that important, as there were no drugs or therapies that could alter the course of the disease. But with the approval of new Alzheimer's monoclonal antibody treatments, the landscape has changed in the past few years.

To use these medicines, you need a way to confirm which patients can benefit. And since the drugs ideally yield the best results when used early on in the disease's progression, a relatively inexpensive and minimally invasive diagnostic test will be extremely useful. Subjecting all elderly people with suspected symptoms of cognitive decline to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid sampling is impractical, so this is where blood testing for Alzheimer's comes in.

Elecsys pTau181 is the first test to be approved for use as a community-screening tool. The idea is for it to be administered at the primary care level—so, for instance, by a primary care physician or general practitioner. The test has been shown to have a good “negative predictive value”—that is, it is effective at accurately indicating who does not have amyloid disease. In settings where the overall prevalence of amyloid disease is low, a negative result from this test is 97.9 percent reliable. This makes it useful for selecting which patients to put forward for further testing.

The results are similar to those of other tests that have already been approved in recent months, such as Lumipulse from Japan's Fujirebio, which in trials has shown a negative predictive value of about 97 percent.

However, there is an important limitation to note: for all blood tests for Alzheimer's, there tends to be a relatively large proportion of patients (15-30 percent is a common estimate) who fall into a gray area of uncertainty, in which the levels of identified biomarkers do not allow for either a positive or a negative answer.

It's also worth noting that the monoclonal antibodies approved for treating Alzheimer's aren't silver bullets. Trials have shown they can slow the progress of symptoms, but their efficacy is limited—the difference in symptom development between those taking and not taking these drugs is small—while side effects are common and potentially fatal. They are also very expensive. Using a blood test for Alzheimer's to ultimately get a patient onto these treatments only promises to subtly alter, rather than halt, the progression of the disease.

Experts stress the importance of these tests not being used for DIY analysis of cognitive health. While their negative predictive value is good, their positive predictive value is not very high—meaning they produce a lot of false positives—which is why they aren't used alone for diagnostic purposes.

Their positive predictive value falls even further if they are used in the absence of clinical symptoms of dementia. If someone takes one of these tests informally to check up on their brain health, without any symptoms of cognitive decline, they risk receiving a result that will leave them unnecessarily worrying about a condition they don't have.

A few years ago, gaming laptops hit their stride. The Razer Blade 14 was a big part of that. It was impossibly compact, considering the amount of gaming performance it contained, and it set a new standard for powerful, compact gaming laptops.

The Razer Blade 14 is no longer the only option in this regard, but Razer has continued to tweak its design over the years to keep ahead of the competition. With a new OLED panel, a thinner chassis, improved speakers, and the latest hardware, the Razer Blade 14 continues to be one of the most compact gaming laptops you can buy.

The Razer Blade 14 hasn't changed much over the years. The main difference is thickness. It's not as thin as the Razer Blade 16, but it's now 0.62 inches thick, shrunken down from 0.70 inches in the previous generation. This reduction is mostly about looks, as only part of the chassis is thinner. The bottom has a thicker bump under the keyboard to house the PC components, which Razer calls the “thermal hood.” It requires having taller rubber feet to accommodate, which means it looks thicker on the table than it actually is.

Still, it remains impressively portable, and the design looks great. Razer has done a lot of work over the years to avoid dead giveaways that this is a gaming laptop—no gap between the display and the keyboard, no oversized or obvious vents, and no RGB-lit, jagged edges. Just clean, simple lines. If it weren't for the green snake logo on the lid and RGB-backlit keyboard, you'd never know this was a gaming machine. That's important, as the Blade 14 is meant to be a do-it-all laptop for work, school, and games. The fantastic keyboard and touchpad help in that regard. Unfortunately, the audio system still isn't great, even with the new six-speaker setup.

The Razer Blade 14 has a $1,800 MSRP, which gets you the RTX 5060, 16 GB of RAM, and a terabyte of storage. There are only a few other 14-inch gaming laptops out there for direct comparison: the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, HP Omen Transcend 14, and the Asus TUF Gaming A14. Of those, the RTX 5060 version of the ROG Zephyrus G14 is the cheapest, but the Blade 14 is currently on sale for $1,550 as of publication, so it's not far off. (Prices constantly fluctuate.)

Ports here are decent. It has two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB 4 Type-C ports with both Power Delivery and Display Port 2.1, an HDMI 2.1 output, a microSD card reader, and a headphone jack. It doesn't have Thunderbolt 5 like the Razer Blade 16, but using the USB-C port and HDMI port, it can support two external 4K monitors at 144 Hz.

The screen introduces OLED to the laptop for the first time. It's a worthwhile upgrade over the mini-LED panel in previous generations. It features a 2880 x 1800 resolution, which is higher than what you typically see on a gaming laptop. That's especially true on a 14-inch computer, giving it a pixel density of 242 pixels per inch—nearly as sharp as the 14-inch MacBook Pro.

The OLED looks great, but one of the benefits of OLED is HDR in gaming, thanks to the incredible contrast from being able to turn off individual pixels. OLED isn't known for being bright, but lately, that's improved on laptops and external monitors. The OLED display on the Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 10, for example, can be cranked up to over 1,000 nits, creating an impressive HDR effect. The Razer Blade 14, however, only maxes out at 620 nits in HDR and 377 nits in SDR. Because of that, I could hardly tell HDR was even turned on. It's still a pretty screen, and OLED has other benefits over IPS panels, including faster response times, less motion blur, and higher contrast.

Unfortunately, the Razer Blade 14's OLED panel is not as colorful as the one I tested on the Razer Blade 16, with a color accuracy of 1.3 and 86 percent coverage of the AdobeRGB color space. Also, the 120-Hz refresh rate is standard for OLED laptops, but you can get 240-Hz speeds on laptops that use IPS, like the Alienware 16X Aurora, which happens to be a much cheaper device.

The Razer Blade 14's biggest competition is the ROG Zephyrus G14. I haven't tested the latest model yet, but it's a laptop we've liked for years now, and it's on sale often enough for less than the Blade 14. The only real difference is that the Blade 14 uses a more powerful AMD processor, the Ryzen AI 9 365. Not only does it perform better in anything CPU-intensive, such as certain games and creative applications, but it's also a more efficient chip.

That leads to some improved battery life—at least, better than your average gaming laptop. I got 10 hours and 19 minutes in a local video playback test, which is about the most you can expect to get from the device. On the other hand, Asus offers higher-powered configurations of the Zephyrus G14, including one that includes the more powerful Ryzen AI 9 HX.

Bad news: The RAM is no longer user-upgradeable on the Razer Blade 14, so you'll have to configure it up front with what you need. My review unit had 32 GB, but you can also choose either 16 GB or 64 GB. Because it's soldered, the memory speeds are faster. As for internal storage, you still get one open M.2 slot to expand space if you need it, supporting up to 4 TB.

Razer keeps it simple with the rest of the components. All configurations start with 1 TB of storage, as well as the aforementioned AMD Ryzen AI 9 365. From there, you can choose between the RTX 5060 and 5070. Razer does force you to add more storage or memory based on your graphics choice, so you can't configure the RTX 5070 with 16 GB of RAM, for example.

My review unit performed in line with my expectations for this type of gaming laptop. I found that playing at 2560 x 1600 tended to be a good happy medium between sharpness and smoothness, though I'm sure many will happily keep games at 1920 x 1200 to get the best frame rates.

Looking through the results, this performance might not seem too impressive on paper, especially for the RTX 5070, which sits in the middle of the RTX 50-series GPU lineup. And yes, you probably won't be playing many games at the laptop's native resolution. But these were all tested at max graphics presets without upscaling, frame generation, or ray tracing. So, you can absolutely get better frame rates by using a lower preset and adding a dash of Nvidia's DLSS. I easily got smooth frame rates in all of these games without needing to tank the image quality.

To put some things in perspective, the RTX 5070 in the Razer Blade 14 is around 14 percent faster than the RTX 5060 in the Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 10, but if you want the extra VRAM that comes with an RTX 5070 Ti, you'll need to upgrade to the larger Razer Blade 16 or one of the higher-powered ROG Zephyrus G14 models.

All things considered, the Razer Blade 14 doesn't blow me away this year, but standing on its pedigree, it remains one of the best gaming laptops you can buy.

Cybercriminals have weaponized the framework of a relatively new, free, open-source security penetration tool, AdaptixC2, to deliver malicious payloads. Its rapid adoption by bad actors follows an intrusion path impacting similar commercial security toolsets.

Russian-linked threat actors, including ransomware gangs such as Akira and Fog, have adopted the tool for its advanced post-exploitation capabilities and evasion features, according to the preemptive cyber intelligence firm Silent Push. The company released new research on Oct. 30, which triggered an investigation into RalfHacker's GitHub bio, identifying the group as a “MalDev.” Silent Push scans and clusters the internet to generate Indicators of Future Attack (IOFA).

Researchers found several email addresses for GitHub accounts linked to the account's owner, as well as a Telegram channel called RalfHackerChannel, with more than 28,000 subscribers. According to Silent Push, the channel re-shared messages posted on a dedicated channel for AdaptixC2.

First made public in August 2024 by developer RalfHacker, AdaptixC2 is intended for red teaming — a process in which ethical hackers simulate a real-world attack to test an organization's security defenses and identify vulnerabilities.

According to Mayuresh Dani, security research manager at Qualys Threat Research Unit, threat actors are constantly looking for new tooling to bypass security mechanisms. AdaptixC2's free cost and enterprise-grade post-exploitation capabilities available to anyone with an internet connection make it an attractive target for hackers.

“Due to these reasons and rapid ongoing development allowing simple static detection signatures evasion, AdaptixC2 has become a sought-after dual-use tool to be repurposed by threat actors in their campaigns,” he told LinuxInsider.

Dani pointed to the free factor as a driver of AdaptixC2's (short for Command and Control) appeal to legitimate users. The framework offers capabilities that rival commercial tools like Cobalt Strike. Its technical features are extensive, including support for encryption of communications, command execution, credential harvesting, and memory-resident execution via Beacon Object Files (BOFs).

“But unlike Cobalt Strike's $3,500 annual license, AdaptixC2 is free,” he said.

AdaptixC2 is a modular and flexible framework that provides a range of functions for attackers, including fully encrypted communications, multi-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and mechanisms for command execution, credential harvesting, data exfiltration, and persistence, such as DLL hijacking and registry run keys.

Researchers report that attackers are using AdaptixC2 to establish long-term persistence inside target networks. Delivery methods for the malicious payloads include CountLoader malware, associated with Russian ransomware gangs, which delivers AdaptixC2 as a secondary payload.

Attackers also rely on social engineering, posing as help desk staff on Microsoft Teams to convince targets to initiate a remote session, which is then used to deploy AdaptixC2.

Attackers are using AI to generate sophisticated PowerShell scripts that download and execute the AdaptixC2 beacon. This tactic helps attackers exploit the software supply chain. Researchers found the AdaptixC2 agent hidden in malicious packages on the npm.

According to Louis Eichenbaum, federal CTO at breach security firm ColorTokens, AdaptixC2 poses a rising threat that requires updated detection strategies, behavior-based analytics, and proactive threat-hunting.

“Organizations should incorporate AdaptixC2 into adversary-emulation exercises, enhance telemetry to identify covert C2 traffic, and tune security tools for detection of its unique beaconing patterns, multi-protocol communication options, and in-memory payload execution,” he told LinuxInsider.

Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 characterized the framework as modular and versatile, capable of comprehensively controlling affected machines. Unit 42 researchers found that it is used as part of a fake help desk operation to support call scams via Microsoft Teams through an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated PowerShell script.

Cyber experts also described the server component as written in Golang, and the GUI client as written in C++ with Qt for cross-platform compatibility. In recent months, AdaptixC2 has been adopted by various hacking groups, including threat actors tied to the Fog and Akira ransomware operations, as well as an initial access broker that has leveraged CountLoader in attacks designed to deliver various post-exploitation tools.

According to Eichenbaum, AdaptixC2 is attracting significant attention for its rapid adoption by threat actors and its growing role in real-world intrusions.

“Its modular architecture, cross-platform agent support, encrypted communications, and flexible command-and-control channels (HTTP/S, SMB, TCP) make it effective for stealthy persistence and lateral movement,” he said.

Eichenbaum added that security researchers recently observed campaigns leveraging PowerShell loaders, in-memory shellcode execution, DLL hijacking, and registry-based persistence, all of which point to AdaptixC2 infrastructure. Features such as beacon scheduling, kill dates, and support for custom plugins further enhance adversaries' evasion capabilities and operational flexibility.

Jason Soroko, a senior fellow at Sectigo, a comprehensive certificate lifecycle management (CLM) provider, observed that attention is piling up because AdaptixC2 hits three pressure points at once. It is open source and easy to obtain, delivers mature features that rival pricier kits, and is already in the hands of operators tied to active ransomware crews and initial access brokers.

“That mix shortens the time from proof of concept to real intrusions, and the cross-platform design, plus encrypted traffic and built-in managers, make it simple for copycats to plug in and go,” he told LinuxInsider.

The number of reports reflects both risk and incentives, he added. Vendors want to warn customers and ship detections, and they also race to lead the narrative with fresh indicators, infrastructure mapping, and attribution clues.

Palo Alto surfaced the technical core and early use. Kaspersky broadened the lens with threat activity context, and Silent Push tied the public developer persona and community channels to a growing distribution pipeline, he offered.

“Tie that to thousands of subscribers and the chance of rapid weaponization rises, so multiple firms pile on to keep visibility high and to shape how defenders prioritize controls,” Soroko noted.

Eichenbaum suggested that organizations defending against AdaptixC2-enabled attacks can implement five key strategies:

Taken together, these measures help reduce the window of opportunity for attackers leveraging AdaptixC2. The challenge now is maintaining vigilance as the tool continues to evolve and spread across threat communities.

Enterprises are overestimating the reliability of their cloud providers and need to rethink their cloud strategy, according to Sam Barker, vice president of telecoms market research at Juniper Research.

He maintained in a company blog that enterprises over-rely on a single provider for their cloud services, although that may change in the wake of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage last month that disrupted a key database service and led to many services that rely on AWS also to suffer outages, including Disney+, Fortnite, HBO Max, Robinhood, Roblox, Slack, Venmo and Zoom.

“Despite the disruption, Amazon's stock remained relatively stable, suggesting continued investor confidence in the company's long-term market leadership,” Barker wrote. “However, the incident could accelerate demand for multicloud orchestration tools, edge computing, and services that increase the overall resilience of cloud services.”

“Overall, we expect the outage to initiate enterprises to explore new solutions or business models to increase the uptime of their services,” he added.

While recent outages at AWS and Microsoft Azure caused degraded performance and downtime for many organizations, noted Gartner Vice President Analyst Lydia Leong, “These events highlight an important truth: cloud disruptions happen, but they are not evidence that the cloud is inherently unreliable.”

In an article published on the Gartner website, she warned that moving workloads out of hyperscale providers (repatriation) or to smaller sovereign clouds (geopatriation) won't eliminate outage risk. “In fact,” she wrote, “these moves often introduce new risks and may even slow down your recovery when things do go wrong.”

“It's tempting to think multicloud is the answer,” she continued. “But Gartner research shows that pursuing multicloud resilience can cost more than it saves, introducing technical complexity without truly eliminating systemic risk.”

“Cloud outages make headlines because they affect so many people at once, but context matters,” she added. “Every major provider has experienced similar events, from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud Platform. The real differentiator is how well your organization plans for and recovers from inevitable disruption.”

The past few years have shown just how fragile the digital world can be, observed Shawn Michels, vice president of product management at Akamai Technologies, a content delivery network service provider in Cambridge, Mass. “From cloud platform outages to undersea cable cuts, even the most sophisticated systems can experience failures,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“A lot of organizations still assume that because something runs in the cloud, it's automatically resilient, but that's not the case,” he said. “Even the biggest clouds don't have perfect uptime.”

“What separates the best from the rest is how well a system reacts to small failures to prevent a larger outage,” he continued. “You can't stop every component from breaking, but you can design systems to recover so quickly that customers barely notice.”

He added that outages remind us that you can't engineer away all risk. “The most resilient organizations are rethinking their architectures by using phased rollouts, automated rollback capabilities, and continuous observability to make sure problems are caught and contained early,” he explained. “True resilience is as much about culture as it is about technical architecture. It's how people prepare for failure, respond under stress, and learn from every incident.”

While the major hyperscale providers are extremely reliable, they're not equally reliable, contended Rich Mogull, chief analyst at the Cloud Security Alliance, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to cloud best practices. “Enterprises tend to gloss over these differences,” he said.

“For example,” he continued, “AWS rarely has cross-region failures, and when they do, they tend to be limited. You can largely plan around this potential. Azure, by comparison, is more likely to experience global failures due to how their infrastructure is designed.”

Enterprises absolutely overestimate cloud reliability, often assuming that global cloud infrastructure is inherently immune to downtime due to redundancy, maintained Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company, in Newark, Del.

“In reality, redundancy mitigates risk, but it doesn't eliminate it,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Even hyperscalers like AWS or Azure operate in a complex web of dependencies across regions, zones, and third-party services. An issue in one layer — like identity federation, DNS propagation, or load balancer routing — can still ripple out and break critical functionality, even if core compute nodes are up.”

“What's critical for enterprises to internalize is that cloud outages are inevitable, not hypothetical,” he said. “The question isn't if, but how often and how prepared your organization is.”

“The AWS outage in June 2023, for example, disrupted everything from banking portals to hospital systems — not because AWS lacked redundancy, but because enterprises hadn't built their apps to withstand regional or service-specific degradation,” he added.

“The day that there are clouds that have a 100% uptime is the day when all problems in this world are eliminated,” declared John Strand, of Strand Consulting, a consulting firm with a focus on telecom, in Denmark.

“Right now, everyone — and especially hyperscalers — is building tons of new data centers across the world,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The size and complexity of these centers is exploding, and when that happens, the risk of something going wrong increases. I'm sure that many of these problems will be eliminated over time, while new problems will arise.”

Enterprises don't overestimate cloud reliability; they just misread what it really means, contended Sergiy Balynsky, vice president of engineering at Spin.AI, a cybersecurity company that specializes in protecting SaaS applications from ransomware, data loss, insider threats, and compliance risks, in Palo Alto, Calif. “The cloud isn't a silver bullet,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It's a shared responsibility model.”

He noted that the AWS outage illustrates that perfectly. “Cloud providers offer highly resilient building blocks — regions, availability zones, failover mechanisms — but it's up to the enterprise to design for resilience and continuity,” Balynsky explained.

“That's exactly what Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and strong architecture or SRE practices are for. BCP and SRE teams plan for failure, spread the risk, and keep critical systems running during outages. Relying on a single region or skipping redundancy isn't a provider failure. It's an architectural oversight,” he said.

If a customer is concerned about reliability, they can hedge their concerns by duplicating what they do in one region in another region, noted David Stone, director in the office of the CISO for Google Cloud.

“Customers can absolutely design in resiliency by using different data centers in other regions, deploying it into different zones in those regions, and being able to build out that architected framework, even to the point where they can build out applications spanning multicloud environments for resiliency,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Srini Srinivasan, founder and CTO of Aerospike, a real-time NoSQL database company in Mountain View, Calif., added that cloud providers offer a variety of capabilities that allow any enterprise to deliver extremely high availability. “I mean like four nines,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“There is no reason that, using any of the existing cloud provider features and capabilities, an enterprise cannot achieve that,” he said. “The fallacy people have is that the cloud provider will solve everything for them.”

However, Aykut Duman, a partner in the digital and analytics practice at the global strategy and management consulting firm Kearney, pointed out that during the AWS outage, despite deploying workloads across multiple availability zones, organizations experienced complete downtime due to a DNS resolution failure that disrupted core services such as DynamoDB and EC2.

“This incident revealed that reliability depends as much on workload architecture and distribution as it does on provider infrastructure,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Enterprises often assume redundancy at the provider level guarantees uptime, but resilience must be deliberately engineered at the application level.” “Enterprises overestimate cloud reliability, because they often equate cloud scale with invulnerability,” he said. “While hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google offer impressive uptime, no system is immune to failure.”

“Enterprises tend to underestimate how complex interdependent cloud services are, and how quickly cascading failures can occur across distributed systems,” he continued. “Reliability is high, but not absolute. The recent AWS outage exposed the misconception that cloud-native automatically means resilient.”

Seattle-based Zuper, which provides software for companies with field workers, is getting into the smart-glasses game with the release of Zuper Glass, an AI-powered product built for skilled tradespeople.

Zuper Glass is designed for a range of professionals, including roofers, electricians and plumbers. The voice-activated glasses use AI to help workers capture photos or record video, perform inspections, and communicate safely while keeping their hands free.

The glasses are integrated with Zuper's mobile app, syncing in real time to Zuper's software platform, which handles work order management, dispatching, scheduling, proposals, payments, customer communications, and more.

Wearable technology and the advent of smart glasses has reached some of the largest companies, including Amazon, which unveiled augmented reality glasses for delivery drivers last month. The Seattle-based tech giant said the glasses are a tool to improve safety and the driver's experience.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has billed his company's AI-powered smart glasses as “the ideal form factor for personal super intelligence.”

Founded in 2020, Zuper is led by CEO Anand Subbaraj, a former Microsoft leader. The 210-person company has offices in Seattle and India.

“Zuper Glass is a breakthrough in how field work gets done and how it will evolve in the future,” Subbaraj said in a news release. “It is inspired by the people who do this work every day — technicians, roofers, and field teams whose hands are full, whose focus matters, and whose safety comes first.”

Zuper raised a $32 million Series B round led by Seattle-area VC firm FUSE in December 2023.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Robert Trumbull on Nov 5, 2025 at 7:30 amNovember 4, 2025 at 9:29 pm

Editor's note: This column was written by Robert Trumbull, a Seattle-based author who writes about the ethics of tech. 

It's clear that Amazon and Microsoft are operating from the same playbook. 

While surely a number of factors are at play here for both, it's equally clear their recent layoffs are, at least in part, a direct consequence of their embrace of AI. 

The layoffs this year were, Microsoft ultimately acknowledged, intimately related to its “capital investments” in this area. Amazon, for its part, has claimed its layoffs are not AI-driven yet, but it is reportedly making longer-term strategic decisions regarding staffing with the benefits of “advanced technology” in mind. 

The current workforce reductions then appear to presage the ways in which Microsoft's own AI products and its stake in OpenAI, taken together with Amazon's adoption of AI and robotics, will quite simply enable employers across industries to employ and pay fewer human workers.

Thus, the question of Big Tech's role in a broader displacement of workers due to the rise of AI is now coming up perhaps even earlier than we anticipated. 

The question before us, then, is what exactly ought we to expect of these companies in this transition? What ought we to ask of them in this process, in terms of what would be right in their relationship to their community — here at home in the Seattle area specifically — insofar as it's this same community that enabled them to become what they are in the first place?

Now, even apart from their corporate philanthropy activities, the contributions Microsoft and Amazon have made to the region up to now are no doubt considerable. As they have grown and flourished, so too have wages earned by employees made their way into innumerable schools, community organizations, and charities in the Seattle area, enabling them to thrive. 

And it's not just wages earned we ought to factor in here. As local people, culture, and compensation expert Matt Shaw of Headwall Solutions pointed out to me recently, Microsoft and Amazon's success has also benefited many in our region who hold shares in the companies (a large number of which, naturally, would have been employees at some point). Stock market success for both, then, has equally contributed to securing admirable outcomes in the Seattle area. 

Following this general line of thinking, one might be tempted to simply draw the conclusion that they are already contributing everything they ought to. By doing what's best for business even when that involves painful workforce reductions, so the logic would go, it is actually serving many, many people in the larger web of entities connected to it. 

This would be the essentially libertarian view one sees being advanced in discussions in Silicon Valley at the moment (that is, when the discussions aren't just completely off the rails and about the Antichrist). On this view, everything works out best when a company acts completely independently in a free market. And to be sure, it would not be hard to find philosophical justifications for this view. 

To take just one, particularly salient and well-known example, the American philosopher Robert Nozick offers an exposition of this position by developing what he calls an “entitlement theory.” Writing in the 70's, Nozick argued that the only principle of economic justice that truly respects freedom is one in which “whoever makes something, having bought or contracted for all other held resources used in the process…is entitled to it.” It follows, then, that they are equally entitled in turn to whatever that something is worth. 

The example he uses to illustrate this principle is that of a famous basketball player: if one player gets paid significantly more than their teammates because they are of much higher value, well then that is just what they are entitled to by virtue of their acquired skill, popularity, and so on. Something like a teamwide, socialist distribution of generated wealth would unnaturally trample on the star player's entitlements. And while Nozick is talking about an individual's earnings, it's not much of a leap to extend this principle to a conglomeration of individuals organized in a business, which we call a corporation.

This view is the one, by all apparent evidence, Amazon embraces. After the city of Seattle tried to implement new taxes on large employers meeting a certain payroll threshold, Amazon later moved employees to the Eastside and designated Bellevue as part of its “Puget Sound HQ.” 

But up until now, Microsoft has cultivated a slightly different position. Consider its “Microsoft Elevate Washington” initiative aimed at providing free access to AI tools and training to public schools and community and technical colleges. The program stems, according to Microsoft President Brad Smith, from a commitment to the company's home base: “A big part of what we're doing,” he has said, “is investing in our home.” This commitment to investing locally represents a tacit acknowledgement from Microsoft of just how much external entities and communities support and facilitate corporate success.

But at a moment when Microsoft is quite possibly more profitable than it has ever been, it may actually be quite fair to ask for, even to expect, more — the view Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell recently endorsed. 

Notably, as the state has taken measures to increase taxes, Microsoft, through Smith himself, has pushed back, threatening between the lines to move elsewhere if that can decrease its tax burden. But it's not just through Smith that Microsoft is fighting increased contributions to state coffers — it also donated more than $1 million to a political action committee aimed at killing precisely such measures. This push represents a marked departure from Microsoft's general ethos under Bill Gates, who advocated for increased taxes for the wealthiest Washingtonians and businesses. 

Thus, we have in hand some sense of what more Microsoft and Amazon could do (particularly as it relates to payroll and wealth taxes) and the knowledge that there is at least some precedent for a serious willingness to pitch in even more. This is the view that, by most measures, the majority of Washingtonians hold. 

Viewed from this angle, the “investment” in the region referenced above — which seems to set Microsoft apart — begins to appear in a slightly different light. Because this investment will equally produce a return for Microsoft. Widespread AI education preps the next generation of Microsoft workers in Washington to contribute to the company's success in precisely the ways it believes will serve it. 

But if we take seriously the contention that the public sphere in the region has, in holding up its end of the “making the region hospitable to tech workers” bargain (most obviously through providing quality public education), enabled Microsoft and Amazon to achieve success over time, then we also ought to take seriously the idea they ought to contribute to broader collective efforts in which the real ROI is just the flourishing of the region and its communities full stop. It deserves serious consideration at a moment when the precise degree to which Washingtonians will continue to share in Big Tech's success in the region is increasingly unclear.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Bothell, Wash.-based Portal Space Systems has added another spacecraft to its product line: a rapid-maneuverability vehicle called Starburst, which takes advantage of technologies that are being developed for its more powerful Supernova satellite platform.

Starburst-1 is due to star in Portal's first free-flying space mission with live payloads a year from now, starting with a launch on SpaceX's Transporter-18 satellite rideshare mission. Portal says the mission will demonstrate rendezvous and proximity operations, rapid retasking and rapid orbital change for national security and commercial applications.

Starburst is designed to bring maneuverability to missions that rely on constellations of small satellites, an approach known as proliferated space architecture. Such an approach is already being used for commercial constellations including SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper, and the concept is also gaining traction for national security applications.

Portal says Starburst and the larger Supernova platform will share many manufacturing processes and core systems, including the thrusters being developed for Supernova's reaction control system. Like Supernova, Starburst will use heated ammonia as a propellant.

“Our strategy is to deliver what customers need now and accelerate what they'll need next,” Portal CEO Jeff Thornburg said today in a news release. “Starburst gives operators a maneuverable bus that supports proliferated architectures in the orbit that matters to them. Supernova brings the trans-orbital reach. Flying Starburst-1 in 2026 lets us field capability quickly and advance the shared systems that raise confidence for Supernova's 2027 debut.”

Starburst-1 is to be deployed into a sun-synchronous orbit for a one-year primary mission. Portal's target for on-orbit maneuverability is 1 kilometer per second of total delta-v, which translates to a change in velocity amounting to more than 2,200 mph.

The ESPA-class spacecraft will carry two hosted payloads: a stereo video monitoring system provided by California-based TRL11; and a superconducting magnetic actuator provided by New Zealand-based Zenno Astronautics. Zenno plans to demonstrate the magnet technology that it has developed for satellite positioning and precision interactions between satellites.

In an email, Thornburg told GeekWire that “the Starburst-1 mission is completely funded by Portal to reduce risk and prove capability for our customers ahead of future contracted missions.” Portal plans to offer Starburst for customer missions starting in 2027.

Clean energy startup ExoFusion today announced it has received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy through its Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) program. 

The FIRE award will support research into the use of liquid metal walls in fusion generators and will be led by Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory with ExoFusion co-founder and chief science officer Michael Kotschenreuther spearheading one of the project's initiatives. 

ExoFusion launched in 2022 and is jointly based in Bellevue, Wash., and Austin, Texas, and bills itself as a boutique fusion company supporting the growing energy sector. 

Its business model includes selling or licensing patents; providing simulations, testing and other design support for fusion technologies; developing new innovations; and fusion commercialization consulting services.

The Pacific Northwest is a hub for the technology, which aims to replicate the reactions that fuel the sun and the stars to create clean energy on earth. Local companies include Avalanche, Zap Energy, Helion Energy, Kyoto Fusioneering and Altrusion in Washington state, and General Fusion in British Columbia.

Three of ExoFusion's co-founders are fusion physics professors at the University of Texas, including Kotschenreuther, senior scientific advisor Swadesh Mahajan, and chief technologist David Hatch. Bellevue-based CEO Romi Mahajan has held leadership for multiple startups and is the son of Swadesh Mahajan.

ExoFusion has been awarded approximately $3 million in grants from sources including DOE's Innovation Network for Fusion Energy (INFUSE) program and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), though some of the money is being issued over time. 

The startup previously raised less than $800,000 in seed funding.

On Wednesday, researchers at Microsoft released a new simulation environment designed to test AI agents, along with new research showing that current agentic models may be vulnerable to manipulation. Conducted in collaboration with Arizona State University, the research raises new questions about how well AI agents will perform when working unsupervised — and how quickly AI companies can make good on promises of an agentic future.

The simulation environment, dubbed the “Magentic Marketplace” by Microsoft, is built as a synthetic platform for experimenting on AI agent behavior. A typical experiment might involve a customer-agent trying to order dinner according to a user's instructions, while agents representing various restaurants compete to win the order.

The team's initial experiments included 100 separate customer-side agents interacting with 300 business-side agents. Because the source code for the marketplace is open source, it should be straightforward for other groups to adopt the code to run new experiments or reproduce findings.

Ece Kamar, managing director of Microsoft Research's AI Frontiers Lab, says this kind of research will be critical to understanding the capabilities of AI agents. “There is really a question about how the world is going to change by having these agents collaborating and talking to each other and negotiating,” said Kamar. “We want to understand these things deeply.”

The initial research looked at a mix of leading models, including GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and found some surprising weaknesses. In particular, the researchers found several techniques businesses could use to manipulate customer agents into buying their products. The researchers noticed a particular falloff in efficiency as a customer agent was given more options to choose from, overwhelming the attention space of the agent.

“We want these agents to help us with processing a lot of options,” Kamar says. “And we are seeing that the current models are actually getting really overwhelmed by having too many options.”

The agents also ran into trouble when they were asked to collaborate toward a common goal, apparently unsure of which agent should play what role in the collaboration. Performance improved when the models were given more explicit instructions on how to collaborate, but the researchers still saw the models' inherent capabilities as in need of improvement.

“We can instruct the models — like we can tell them, step by step,” Kamar said. “But if we are inherently testing their collaboration capabilities, I would expect these models to have these capabilities by default.”

Posted:

The Motion Picture Association (MPA) has sent Meta a cease-and-desist letter demanding that it stop using the term “PG-13,” as first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Last month, Meta announced that teens on Instagram would, by default, only see content that adheres to PG-13 movie ratings. Two weeks later, the MPA sent Meta a cease-and-desist letter, asserting that Meta's claim that content on teen Instagram accounts would follow PG-13 guidelines is “literally false and highly misleading.”

The company states that its movie-rating system can't be compared to Meta's content restrictions, which it says “appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence.”

“The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public's trust in its rating system,” said the letter. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta's automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA's rating system.”

In response to the letter, Meta stated that it hasn't claimed its teen accounts were certified by the MPA or officially PG-13 rated. Additionally, the company says its content restrictions are “guided” by PG-13, rather than directly linked to the MPA. Meta also says its use of the term qualifies as fair use.

The University of Pennsylvania confirmed on Tuesday that a hacker stole university data as part of last week's data breach, during which alumni and other affiliates received suspicious emails from official university email addresses.

“We got hacked,” the message from the hackers read. “We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked),” the message added. “Please stop giving us money.”

While Penn initially told TechCrunch that the email was “fraudulent,” the university has now confirmed the hacker's claim that data was taken during the breach.

“On October 31, Penn discovered that a select group of information systems related to Penn's development and alumni activities had been compromised,” the university wrote in a statement, which was emailed to alumni and shared online. “Penn's staff rapidly locked down the systems and prevented further unauthorized access; however, not before an offensive and fraudulent email was sent to our community and information was taken by the attacker.”

(Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, the hackers sent the message to my personal email three times, each coming from different official @upenn.edu email addresses, including one from a senior Penn staff member.)

The university said that the breach occurred due to a social engineering attack, a hacking technique in which individuals are tricked into handing over sensitive information like log-in credentials, perhaps through phishing or a phone call.

A Penn employee, who we are not naming, as they were not authorized to speak to the press, told TechCrunch that the university requires students, staff, and alumni to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts as a security measure; however, the employee said that some high-ranking officials were granted exemptions to MFA requirements.

TechCrunch asked Penn about these alleged MFA exceptions, and if the university could provide a percentage of MFA adoption among staff. Penn spokesperson Ron Ozio declined to comment to TechCrunch beyond Penn's official data incident page.

As required by law, Penn said it will contact individuals whose personal information was accessed by hackers. The university has not said when these notifications will occur, how many people are affected, or what information was accessed.

The Daily Pennsylvanian reports that the alleged Penn hacker claimed to have taken documents relating to university donors, bank transaction receipts, and personally identifiable information. The hacker said they were financially motivated.

Earlier this year, hackers breached Columbia University, accessing sensitive information about around 870,000 students and applicants, including their Social Security numbers and citizenship status.

Both the Penn and Columbia hacks appear motivated by discontent with affirmative action policies. In the email that the Penn hacker sent to the university community, the hacker wrote, “We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits.” Meanwhile, the Columbia hacker told Bloomberg that they sought to access data from the university to investigate its affirmative action practices.

A raft of voice-based hardware devices have emerged, aimed at companionship, productivity, or personal growth. These include card-shaped devices from Plaud and Pocket; pendants from Friend, Limitless, and Taya; and a wristband from Bee, which is now part of Amazon.

Now, two former Meta employees who worked on interface design have launched Sandbar, a startup that has created a ring called Stream for similar purposes. The company calls the ring “a mouse for voice” because it can take notes, help you interact with an AI assistant, and also let you control music.

Sandbar's CEO, Mina Fahmi, has an extensive background in designing human-computer interfaces. He worked at Bryan Johnson's Kernel and later at smart glasses startup Magic Leap. Kirak Hong, Sandbar's CTO, worked at Google before joining CTRL-Labs, where the duo met. Meta acquired the startup in 2019, and its work eventually led to neural interfaces for the tech giant's smart wearables.

Fahmi said that when large language models started emerging a few years ago, he built an experimental journaling app. However, he found that the app itself became a barrier to capturing his thoughts. Given his experience building hardware interfaces, he began exploring a conversational hardware interface instead.

“A lot of my ideas bubble up when I'm walking or when I'm commuting, and I don't want to pull out my phone to interrupt that moment. I don't want to shout into my earbuds where the world can hear me to talk through an idea. Kirak and I were trying to understand what it would take to actually capture a thought the moment it bubbles up. That's how we came up with Stream,” Fahmi told TechCrunch in an interview.

The ring, designed to be worn on your dominant hand's index finger, has microphones and a touch pad.

In a virtual demo, Fahmi wore the Stream ring on his index finger and recorded his thoughts by pressing and holding the touchpad. By default, the microphone is off, activating only with this gesture. The microphone proved sensitive enough to pick up whispers and transcribe them in the companion iOS app. Other apps like Wispr Flow and Willow similarly allow people to capture their thoughts quietly.

Stream's app includes an AI chatbot that converses with you as you record your thoughts. You can organize these into separate notes that either you or the AI can edit. The app also lets you pinch to zoom out and review what you have discussed over days or weeks. Sandbar has added a personalization layer so the assistant's voice sounds somewhat similar to the user's.

Fahmi said that in crowded spaces, users can wear headphones to converse privately with the assistant. Without headphones, the ring provides haptic feedback when it successfully registers a note, allowing you to add to-dos, take notes, or check items off a grocery list quietly.

Beyond voice functions, the ring's flat surface doubles as a media controller, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust volume. While many headphones offer similar controls, the ring could prove useful when your hands are occupied or you're in transit.

The company is opening up pre-orders for Stream on Wednesday at $249 for the silver version and $299 for gold. Sandbar aims to begin shipping next summer. A Pro subscription tier — free for three months for those who preorder, then $10 per month — offers unlimited chats, notes, and early access to new features.

Fahmi said the company gives users full control over their data at any tier, with encryption both at rest and in transit. He added that Sandbar doesn't believe in walled gardens and plans to support data exports to apps like Notion.

Sandbar has raised $13 million in funding from True Ventures, Upfront Ventures, and Betaworks.

Toni Schneider, a partner at True Ventures, said he had been skeptical of AI devices, as demos he'd seen before Stream weren't impressive.

“I think a lot of people would agree that voice and AI go really well together. And [they also agree] that having a phone or even a laptop to interact with AI is kind of a lot when all you need is voice. So there should be some kind of new form factor out there. We looked at a lot of them, and a lot of them just didn't quite hit the target. When Mina came in and showed us the demo, it made sense to us,” he told TechCrunch.

Competition is fierce in the voice-AI hardware space, with many builders exploring rings as a form factor. Fahmi said he doesn't want Stream to be an assistant or a companion, but rather an interface for users to express their ideas while maintaining full control.

AI hardware has yet to achieve mainstream success. Humane sold to HP, Rabbit is attempting to improve user experience and engagement through software updates, and Friend is trying to leverage user backlash to fuel growth. Sandbar will need to prove that its ring form factor offers genuine convenience and value that pendants, pins, or wristbands cannot.

When Nvidia announced its Rubin series of GPUs in March, it also dropped a bomb: Racks built with the Ultra version of the chip, which is expected to be released in 2027, could draw up to 600 kilowatts of electricity. That's nearly twice as much juice as some of the fastest EV chargers can deliver today.

As data center racks become that power hungry, one of the biggest hurdles will be figuring out how to keep them cool. One startup thinks stacks of metal are the answer.

Alloy Enterprises has developed a technology that turns sheets of copper into solid cooling plates for GPUs and for peripheral chips, the supporting components like memory and networking hardware that account for about 20% of a server's cooling load. 

“We didn't care too much about that 20% when racks were 120 kilowatts,” Ali Forsyth, co-founder and CEO of Alloy Enterprises, told TechCrunch. But now, as racks have hit 480 kilowatts on their way to 600 kilowatts, engineers have to figure out how to liquid cool everything from RAM to networking chips, parts for which there are no solutions available today.

Alloy's approach uses additive manufacturing (building objects layer by layer) to produce cold plates that are capable of squeezing into tight spots while withstanding the high pressures that liquid cooling can demand.

But the startup doesn't use 3D printing. Rather, it takes sheets of metal and forces them to bond using a combination of heat and pressure. It's more expensive than traditional machining, but cheaper than 3D printing.

The result is a cold plate that, for all intents and purposes, is a single block of metal. There's no seam, unlike machined products, and it's solid metal, unlike 3D-printed versions, which can be porous. “We hit raw material properties,” Forsyth said. “The copper is just as strong as if you had machined it.”

Most cold plates are machined, a process that uses tools to carve out features. Because the tools are large, each half of the plate has to be machined separately. The two halves are then sintered together — a process that fuses metal powders using heat — which introduces a seam that could potentially leak under high pressure. Alloy's process, a type of diffusion bonding it calls “stack forging,” makes seamless cold plates. 

Stack forging can also make smaller features, down to 50 microns, about half the width of a human hair, allowing more coolant to flow past the metal. Alloy's cold plates have 35% better thermal performance than competitors, Forsyth said.

Because of the complexities of stack forging, Alloy does most of the internal design. Customers submit key specifications and dimensions, and the startup's software helps translate those into a shape that works for the company's manufacturing process.

In Alloy's factory, rolls of copper are first prepped and cut to size. The features are then cut out using a laser. Parts of the design that the company doesn't want to bond to each other are coated with an inhibitor. When completed, each slice of a cold plate is registered and stacked before heading into a diffusion bonding machine, which uses heat and pressure to press the stacked slices into a single piece of metal.

Forsyth said her company is working with “all the big names” in the data center world, though she wouldn't disclose specifics. 

Initially, the company had designed the technology to work with a widely used aluminum alloy, but as it received more interest from data centers, it ported the process to work with copper, which conducts heat well and resists corrosion. When Alloy announced the product in June, “things just blew up,” Forsyth said.

Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security company Wiz has moved a step closer toward the finish line.

Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said at a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday, as reported by Reuters, that the acquisition had cleared its antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice. Rappaport added that while a milestone, the deal still has a way to go before it officially closes.

TechCrunch reached out to Wiz for more and for more information regarding the timeline to close.

Google initially approached Wiz in 2024 with an offer to buy the startup for $23 billion. Wiz walked away from that offer and Rappaport said, at the time, that he felt the business could grow to be a lot bigger than that.

He was right. Google and Wiz revived acquisition talks in the first few months of 2025, and Google announced it was buying Wiz for $32 billion in March.

Bloomberg initially reported that the deal was under antitrust review in June. The deal is expected to close in early 2026, according to Reuters.

It's pretty impressive that Kosmos can reproduce the conclusions that human scientists came to de novo. Especially when it does so much faster than a human.If the goal is to accelerate scientific discovery, this is what success looks like.

I think parents point is a bit like ""you can't disallow lock picking""; the term ""hole punching"" being used to describe techniques that are intentionally trying to bypass whatever thing others (particularly corporations) try to put in the way, sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for kind of shit reasons.

No. QUIC require TLS. TLS just provides a way to move certificates, but doesn't care what a ""certificate"" actually is. JPEG of your 10m swimming certificate from school? Sure, that's fine.The endpoints get to decide which certificates to accept and in practice in a web browser and many other modern programs that'll be some sort of X.509 certificate more or less following PKIX and on the public Internet usually the Web PKI which is a PKI operated on behalf of the Relying Parties (literally everybody) by the Trust Stores (in practice the OS vendors plus Mozilla for the Free Unix systems) but none of that is defined by QUIC.

Now if he'd stated ""western media covers broadly equivalent events with similar levels of casualties with a bias towards Europe/Western Countries/Western Allies"" then broadly I would agree - African news does tend to take a backseat to events in those regions for likely a whole host of reasons.They covered El-Fasher as well - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgr4qqgdlkjo

Which is double bad since the RSF, the Arab army committing genocide belongs to the same organisation as Hamas does. They are both ""descended"" from the Muslim brotherhood of Egypt, and receive a LOT of support from Arab countries.

Being a decade deep into a tightened border blockade that leaves little hope of a long-term future for Gaza.Netanyahu's coalition getting more and more aggressive with their rhetoric as far as forcibly annexing what remains of the West Bank, rather than merely annexing small portions every year to house more and more settlers.  Repeated open provocations at the Al Aqsa Mosque holy site whenever Netanyahu was feeling politically vulnerable.The US first unilaterally tearing up a treaty to reimpose crippling sanctions, and later inviting the #2 or #3 (depending on how you count) top-ranked leader of Iran, by far the most popular person in the country, to peace talks and then assassinating him when his plane landed.The imminent threat of the Abraham Accords, Israel and the US trying to bribe leaders of regional governments into a coalition against Iran and Palestine.

Around 30,000 rockets and mortars over 20 years, killing 50 Israelis and injuring 2000.This is why Israel has imposed a ""tightened border blockade"". If Gaza stopped attacking, Israel would live in peace with it.

The fate of West Bank Palestinians clearly proves that to be an outright lie.https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/...
Halfway through 2023 at least 156 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli action in the West Bank – more than in the whole of 2022 and the highest yearly total since the end of the second Intifada in 2004. At least 28 children are among those killed and thousands more civilians have been injured.

The fact we even have figures like Ben Gvir in Israeli politics is a result of reactivity in the Israeli public opinion. Any government that promised peace just brought more death and destruction, so now they're trying the other way.

Because sovereign states demanded that it would be an empty shell, and this was accepted because otherwise there would be nothing.For example, the ICC. Nobody can be convicted by the ICC unless their country allows it. And even that is going too far for essentially all countries, even founding member states like South Africa (who explicitly went against UN treaties they signed to protect Al-Bashir and Putin)

Including certain contractual ""standard""(1) agreements which would make some of their higher management _personally_ liable for undue data access even under Cloud act from the US!!!(1) As in standard agreements for providers which store lawyer data, including highly sensitive details about ongoing cases etc.So you can't really trust MS anymore at all, even if personal liability (e.g. lying under oath) is at stack. And the max ceiling for the penalties for lying under oath seem less then what you can run into in the previous mentioned case...You also have to look a bit closer at what it even means if ""the french MS CEO swears they are complying"" it means he doesn't know about non compliance and did tell his employees to comply and hired someone to verify it etc.But the US doesn't need the French CEO to know, they just need to gain access to the French/EU server through US employees, which given that most of the infra software is written in the US and international admin teams for 24/7 support is really not that hard...And even if you want to sue the French CEO after a breach/he (hypothetically) lied he would just say he didn't because he also was lied too leading to an endless goose chase and ""upsi"" by now the French CEO somehow is living in the US.And that is if you ever learn about it happening, but thanks to the US having pretty bad gag orders/secret court stuff the chance for that is very low.So from my POV it looks like MS has knowingly and systematically lying and deceiving customer, including such with highly sensitive data, and EU governments about how ""safe"" the data is even if it lead to personal legal liabilities of management.And I mind to remember that AWS was giving similar guarantees they most most likely can't hold, but I'm not fully sure.

It's been over a decade since the Muppets were on the silver screen, and in the time since, Disney's handling of the esteemed puppet franchise has led to, at best, some mixed results. But with all eyes on some special anniversaries for the series, it looks like the House of Mouse may have big plans for the gang's most prolific, glamorous star.

Update 11/5/2025 11.38am ET: This article has been updated to include additional reporting corroborating Lawrence's remarks.

Speaking on the latest episode of the Las Culturistas podcast, Jennifer Lawrence revealed that she has teamed up with Emma Stone to produce a movie starring The Muppets‘ premiere dramatic queen, Miss Piggy. Lawrence didn't reveal further plot details but noted that Oh Mary! scribe (and incoming One Piece star) Cole Escola was working on the script.

“I don't know if I can announce this, but I'm just going to,” Lawrence said, after recounting a story of how she'd almost starred as Mary Todd Lincoln in a run of Escola's smash-hit Broadway play. “Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie, and Cole [Escola] is writing it.”

io9 has confirmed with sources familiar with the matter that the movie is in the works.

The Muppets last hit the big screen in 2014's The Muppets Most Wanted, and have largely since been pivoted between various TV and streaming series, as well as one-off specials. But with the broader franchise celebrating its 70th anniversary this year since their first appearance on Sam and Friends, and next year's 50th anniversary of The Muppets show, it seems like Disney is trying to make another push into supporting the series again.

Back in September it was reported that Seth Rogen was developing a limited revival of The Muppet Show to celebrate its 50th anniversary next year with pop star Sabrina Carpenter, and more recently at Disney's Walt Disney World resort, after the shuttering of Muppet*Vision 3D, the franchise took over the overlay for the Rock ‘n' Roller Coaster at the park.

Starting on Dec. 10, 14-year-olds in Australia will theoretically not be able to post on the subreddit r/Im14andthisisdeep, nor on any subreddit at all, because Reddit is going to be placed on the country's list of age-restricted social media platforms.

Kick, the livestreaming service, will also be restricted when the ban goes into effect, and a large swath of the social media world becomes unavailable to young people in Australia early next month.

This kind of regulation will look a bit alien to Americans. Australia has an agency called the eSafety Commissioner that serves some of the same functions as the FCC and FTC in the U.S., but with a focus on online platforms. With the stated aim of protecting children from harmful content, the Commissioner's powers were expanded in 2022, in part due to lingering outrage over the Facebook livestreaming of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in neighboring New Zealand, and the subsequent spreading of that footage on many social media platforms, including Reddit.

A preliminary list of social media platforms banned for under-16s was created about a year ago after an investigation by the eSafety Commissioner, and that list keeps growing. It now includes TikTok, X, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, and now Reddit and Kick. According to the Guardian, Roblox, OpenAI's Sora, Discord, Steam, and Twitch are also on the government's radar, and could potentially be banned.

Australia itself isn't designing the technology that makes this ban possible. Per the Guardian, the eSafety Commissioner, Inman Grant, explained at a press conference Wednesday that the platforms themselves have to figure out how to keep users below the age threshold from having accounts, or else they may face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars. Also, the Australian government says it has published guidelines for self-assessment, and expects companies to figure out on their own if they need to ban kids and teens without government intervention.

As Grant put it, “the burden goes back onto the platforms themselves.”

AMD's secret weapon against Nvidia's gaming products isn't another graphics card but a “Max” chip that has the capability to do everything, everywhere, all at once. The company's Strix Halo lineup, headlined this year by the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, may soon find itself the big brother to a few younger siblings sporting similar graphics capabilities at a lower price point—and offering a more budget-conscious option for gamers than any “affordable” GPU available right now.

A supposed low-end Strix Halo chip has popped up on public data from benchmarking software PassMark. VideoCardz first picked up on the supposed leaked specs for an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 388 and a Ryzen AI Max+ 392. The “+” seems to signify whether the chip will have the full Radeon 8060S integrated GPU, which is what makes these chips so good for gaming at resolutions between 1080p and 1440p. Gizmodo has tested the Ryzen AI Max chip on the Framework Desktop and found it to be a miniature powerhouse considering how small and portable that machine can be.

The Ryzen AI Max+ 388 is an 8-core CPU with a 5GHz boosted clock speed, according to the PassMark specs. The AI Max+ 392 could be a more powerful 12-core variant. The Radeon 8060S contains 40 compute units, which indicate the number of core clusters that define its overall performance. A Radeon RX 9060 GPU contains 28 compute units alongside 28 ray accelerators and 56 AI accelerators that will still make it perform better than the current accelerated processing units (APUs) when combined with a separate gaming-ready CPU. Though, in the end, not so much better for the higher price of fielding two components at once.

This year's slate of graphics cards—at least the ones more people could actually afford—showed us how much the low-end GPU market has slowed. The 60-series GPUs were headlined by the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 and AMD Radeon RX 9060. Both packed a minimal 8GB of VRAM, or video RAM, that limited how well they could possibly perform at higher resolutions. Both GPUs were overshadowed by the $430 5060 Ti and 9060 XT variants. Nvidia itself tried to get in front of the RTX 5060's slim upgrades over the previous generation of GPUs by limiting review units and even threatening some reviewers by promising to cut off access to future news and company resources if they didn't limit the scope of their testing.

When you're spending $300 on a GPU, you still expect to see significantly better processing power than anything with CPU and GPU capabilities housed on a single chip, like AMD's APUs. Intel has its own relatively cheap GPUs, including the standout Arc B580 for around $250. But Intel has yet to articulate if it plans to keep making discrete GPUs. Instead, the company promised to detail “the next Arc family” sometime in the future, and believes it can compete with AMD on graphics with its Panther Lake lineup, specifically the 16-core variants with 12 Xe3 graphics cores running under the hood.

PassMark benchmarks also show AMD could be working on at least one new gaming CPUs using its latest Zen 5 microarchitecture, specifically the Ryzen 7 9700X3D. Leakers have also recently claimed AMD could unleash more powerful CPUs like the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and Ryzen 9950X3D2. The best desktop CPU from this year, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, used a 3D V-Cache that makes it able to access memory quicker than normal. It routinely proves to be better for gaming and is combined with a GPU that will necessarily offer better performance.

There are some companies going as far as to promote handheld PCs with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, like the GPD Win 5 that comes packed with an external battery pack (necessary considering the massive power draw of the high-end APU). Then there's the OneXFly Apex, yet another crowdfunded handheld (launching Nov. 9 on Indiegogo) promising the Radeon 8060S graphics performance will squash devices like the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X. I'm more interested in a high-end Panther Lake or Ryzen AI Max+ 388 purring under the hood of any handheld or laptop. If we can see a Ryzen AI Max+ 388 in a sub-$1,000 device, it could offer far better gaming performance in a much sleeker package.

Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin is gearing up for the second launch of New Glenn. The megarocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, no earlier than 2:51 p.m. ET on Sunday, November 9.

New Glenn rolled onto the pad at Launch Complex 38 Tuesday evening and went vertical Wednesday, according to Blue Origin's X account. It has since undergone a successful static fire test in which all seven of its BE-4 boosters performed as expected, operating at 100% thrust for 22 seconds, Blue Origin posted on Thursday.

The heavy-lift launch vehicle is now in the final stages of preparation ahead of Sunday's milestone flight. Here are the three most important things you need to know before liftoff.

It's been nearly 10 months since New Glenn's inaugural flight on January 16. The rocket's upper stage successfully reached orbit—a first for Blue Origin—and deployed the Blue Ring Pathfinder payload. This technology demonstration payload was designed to test the core flight, ground systems, and operational capabilities of the company's Blue Ring orbital transfer vehicle.

One of the primary objectives of this test flight was to recover New Glenn's booster—a key step toward rapid reusability. This did not go according to plan, however. Blue Origin confirmed that the booster was lost “during descent,” meaning it failed to perform a soft, controlled landing on Jacklyn—a barge in the Atlantic Ocean.

A Federal Aviation Administration investigation ultimately determined that the booster failed to relight its engines, Blue Origin confirmed in March. The FAA identified seven corrective measures focused on “propellant management and engine bleed control improvements,” which the company said it was already addressing.

Despite the booster mishap, the rocket's first flight was a huge win for Blue Origin, officially putting New Glenn on the map as a major orbital launch vehicle.

Blue Origin will again try to recover the booster during New Glenn's second flight. Just like last time, the company is targeting a propulsive landing on the barge named Jacklyn in the Atlantic.

Bezos's company is hoping this second booster, named “Never Tell Me the Odds,” will have better luck than the first. If the company can successfully recover and refurbish the booster, it plans to fly it again on its third mission, which will attempt to launch the first Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander. This cargo lander is a stepping stone to a crewed version, which NASA has contracted to deliver the Artemis 5 astronauts to the Moon.

New Glenn will carry another payload during its second test flight, but this time, it belongs to NASA. The megarocket will launch the agency's twin ESCAPADE probes on a journey to Mars.

The Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers mission (try saying that five times fast) “will use two identical spacecraft to investigate how the solar wind interacts with Mars' magnetic environment and how this interaction drives the planet's atmospheric escape,” according to NASA.

The probes were supposed to fly on the first New Glenn launch, originally slated for October 2024, but NASA pulled the probes from the mission due to concerns about launching them on an unproven rocket. On Friday, Blue Origin confirmed that the probes have been loaded into the payload fairing of New Glenn's upper stage.

This $80 million mission raises the stakes for New Glenn's second launch. Not only is it the first NASA mission to Mars since the Perseverance rover launched in 2020, it's also the first multi-spacecraft orbital science mission to the Red Planet.

This test flight will be anything but routine—both NASA and Blue Origin have a lot riding on this launch.

Following significant New Glenn delays, Blue Origin needs to show that it's ready to serve as a deep-space launch provider and that its big rocket is up for the task. The ESCAPADE launch will serve as a crucial test. Should deployment go according to plan, New Glenn could become a viable option for critical NASA science missions and national security contracts.

That said, Blue Origin will still have to compete with other big players, such as United Launch Alliance and Elon Musk's SpaceX, which routinely launches its Falcon 9s and Falcon Heavies—and will soon have a major industry disruptor in Starship.

Continuing to validate the BE-4 engine and achieving a booster recovery will also be key to New Glenn's success. If Blue Origin can hit these milestones on Sunday, it could reshape the heavy-lift launch market, whereas failure would further undermine Blue's readiness to take on the challenges of the increasingly competitive commercial spaceflight industry.

One of the most beautiful and wealthy communities on Lake Tahoe is alerting its residents (among whom are several Silicon Valley billionaires) to a potential poop problem in the local water supply. Incline Village has sent out a public notice warning its residents not to drink the water—at least not before they boil it.

The notice, which was sent out on Monday, notes that the community's water system “experienced an event that resulted in loss of pressure in the distribution system, which may cause backpressure, backsiphonage, or a net movement of water from outside the pipe to the inside through cracks, breaks, or joints in the distribution system that are common in all water systems.”

Unfortunately, the kinds of stuff that can seep into the community's pipes through those cracks and joints are definitely not the sort of thing you want in your drinking water. “Such a system failure carries with it a high potential that fecal contamination or other disease-causing organisms could enter the distribution system,” the notice continues. “These conditions may pose an imminent and substantial health endangerment to persons served by the system.”

“DO NOT DRINK THE WATER WITHOUT BOILING IT FIRST,” the notice warns, with additional instructions on safe procedure.

An official with Incline Village said that there wasn't proof that fecal matter was actually in the water and that the warning was a standard public notice issued under these circumstances. They confirmed there had been an incident with the city's system and encouraged Gizmodo to contact the community's testing lab, which has sampled the water for signs of contamination. Gizmodo reached out to the lab for comment.

The notice sent to residents Monday notes that the water is currently being tested and that results are expected by Thursday. “We will inform you when tests show no bacteria and you no longer need to boil your water.”

In 2021, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison purchased a 16-acre waterfront Hyatt resort in Incline Village for $345 million. David Duffield, who co-founded Workday, also reportedly lives in the area. Andy Bechtolsheim, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, is also said to have lived in Incline as of March of last year. Zuck, who loves drinking water, doesn't seem to have a place in Incline, but he does live nearby, so he should heed the warning if he visits a fellow tech titan in the area.

We recommend the best PC builds for every price point. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you want a computer that meets your exact needs and budget, you need to put it together yourself. When you build a gaming PC, you get total control over the parts, choosing the exact make and model of the motherboard, the case with the look you like, and even the layout of RGB (or non-RGB) fans. You could save time by purchasing one of the best pre-built gaming PCs, but you'll give up control and spend more. By building your own PC from components, you'll likely save hundreds of dollars compared to buying a prebuilt system.

To help you assemble the best PC build for gaming or productivity that you can get, we've created recommended parts lists for every budget: from a super-cheap $500 system to an affordable sub-$1,000 build to a $4,000+ dream machine for those with deep pockets.

Nov 5, 2025: Checked and adjusted prices, swapped out a few items in each of the builds, updated dated passages.Jun 9, 2025: Adjusted all prices.May 27, 2025: Adjusted prices; switched the GPU on $1,000 and sub-$1,500i.May 2, 2025: Adjusted prices on all builds; changed CPU on the sub-$800 build and included a cooler; changed CPU on the $4,000 build.


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Note that our best PC build recommendations are based on our component expertise, market research, and testing of the key components in each build — namely, the CPU, GPU, and SSD. You can find performance details for each of those in our CPU benchmarks, GPU benchmarks, and SSD benchmarks. Because we are trying to hit price points and frequently changing these lists to accommodate price changes, we have not tested all of the parts in each build. Some of the less performance-centric parts, such as the case, motherboard, and PSU, may not have been reviewed.

Intel also launched its Core Ultra ""Arrow Lake"" chips, although we found that they don't offer as much performance for the money as the prior 14th Gen CPUs in gaming (or compared to AMD CPUs), so we're not recommending them for the best PC builds for gaming.

On the GPU front, we have some good news! You can now purchase the latest Nvidia cards from reputable retailers like Newegg. Just a few months ago, you could only find the 5000 series cards on eBay, where scalpers were selling them at a premium. Now you can get these cards, with some available at or near their MSRP.

Also note that we don't include the cost of an operating system, because you can get Windows 11 for free or cheap. Nor do we include the price of peripherals such as the best gaming monitors, best gaming keyboards, or best gaming mouse. And if you've never built a computer before, you should start with our guide on how to build a PC.

Yes, for around $500, you can build a PC with a discrete graphics card. You won't get the fastest GPU around, but you will be able to play games at 1080p with modest settings. That's a big improvement over relying on integrated graphics.

For the graphics card in this system, we're going with AMD's Radeon RX 6500 XT, which is better than the Intel Arc A380 we previously had on this list (and is now sold out). This is a low-end, older card, but it still managed to average 30.6 FPS at 1080p Ultra settings. That rate more than doubled, going up to 65.8 FPS, when we dropped the settings to Medium.

For our CPU, we're going with Intel's Core i3-14100F, which is just under $90 but delivers plenty of pep for the price. This CPU has four cores, all of them performance cores, and a solid boost clock of 4.7 GHz. It comes with a cooler in the box, so you don't have to spend on a third-party option. In our testing, we found that the 14100F was about on par with AMD's Ryzen 5 5600, which costs about $30 more.

To work with our 14100F, we need an Intel 600- or 700-series motherboard. Finding the right balance of features and pricing is critical, and you need to ensure you pick a board that uses the correct type of memory. DDR5 boards can sometimes be $10 cheaper, but then the memory can cost $20 more. Asus' B760M-AYW Wifi D4 II checks off all the boxes for a solid budget motherboard.

Many motherboards at this price don't include Wi-Fi, but the Asus does. You can save some money by selecting a motherboard without Wi-Fi if you only use Ethernet. But if you need Wi-Fi down the line, you'll have to buy a PCIe card or USB-C dongle (see our list of the best Wi-Fi cards), which usually costs between $25 and $40.

We chose the Kingston NV3 for storage. It's an affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD that delivers up to 6,000 MB/s for sequential reads and 5,000 MB/s for sequential writes, which is faster than our previous option for a pittance more. It's not the fastest drive on the market, but it's from a trusted brand and is rated for 320 TBW (terabytes written). That's not a lot these days, but most users will upgrade before they burn the NAND out from too many writes.

We selected 16GB of DDR4-6400 RAM in a 2x8GB configuration for our memory. Again, selecting RAM that is compatible with your motherboard is crucial. The Oloy RAM we chose isn't the flashiest or most well-known brand, but it's inexpensive, and memory has become a commodity item lately, though DDR5 price hikes are on the horizon. Whatever you do, avoid building or buying a gaming PC with less than 16GB of RAM.

Our case is the Cooler Master MasterBox Q300L. Available in black or white, the chassis offers solid build quality for the price, including built-in dust filters, support for up to a 240 mm AIO cooler on the top, and plenty of mesh to allow airflow. It even has a modular I/O panel you can place in six different locations. One small trade-off is that its clear side panel is acrylic rather than tempered glass.

Finally, we need something to power the whole system, and this is an area where we opted to compromise in pursuit of the $500 price point. The $40 500W PSU should be fine for this basic build, which will likely peak at around 200W, but the Thermaltake Smart series isn't exactly highly regarded. The listing mentions Haswell support (circa 2014), and it only has 80 Plus certification, which are clear drawbacks. If you want a quality PSU, check out the Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 600W that costs $20 more. It's an 80 Plus Gold-certified PSU, from a reputable brand, albeit perhaps overkill for a build like this.

If you can stretch your budget from $500 to $800, you can enter a world of gaming performance and productivity that's good enough for more serious 1080p gaming (without ray tracing). Here we're stepping up from a Core i3 to the Core i5-14600KF, which has six performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and 20 total threads, along with a boost clock of 5.3 GHz.

As you can see in the chart below, the 14600KF (listed as the 14600K, but the F model is just the SKU without integrated graphics), was behind some competitors but still turned in solid performance.

 




To go with this Intel processor, we're sticking with the same Asus B760M-AYW Wifi D4 II motherboard as on our $500 build. It uses cheaper DDR4 memory, which saves money; however, with the price increases on outgoing DDR4, we chose to stick with 16GB to keep the final price as close to $800 as possible while keeping focus on a solid graphics card.

Our graphics card at this price point is the AMD Radeon RX 7600, which comes in at around $279. The 7600 has solid performance at 1080p ultra settings, averaging well over that magic 60 FPS we're after. It ranks just above the RX 6650 XT and below the RTX 4060 on our GPU benchmarks hierarchy.

 




For our storage, we're going with the 1TB WD Black SN770. This budget-oriented PCIe 4.0 SSD can't beat top-of-the-line drives like the Samsung 990 Pro or WD Black SN850X, but it delivers strong performance for the money, with sequential read and write speeds of 5,150 and 4,900 MBps, respectively.

 




Power use jumps a little with the new processor and video card, so here we're stepping up to a 700W version of the Thermaltake Smart power supply. It's still a budget unit, but it easily handles the output of the build, even with some headroom. Our case is the Thermaltake Versa H18, a budget-oriented mesh case with a single fan and a tempered-glass window. It's not glamorous, but it keeps close to that $800 budget.

If you can stretch your budget up to around $1,050, you can build a PC with the ability to play games really well at 1080p and competently at 1440p. The best GPU option in this price range right now is the Nvidia RTX 5060, which goes for as little as $299 for the 8GB model. As shown in our RTX 5060 16GB vs RTX 5060 8GB faceoff, there is a compromise with going with less VRAM, so take that into consideration.

 




Our recommended CPU for this build is the AMD Ryzen 7 7600X3D. The 7600X3D is a 6-core, 12-thread CPU with 96MB of L3 cache, making it great for 1080p gaming. Although we went down in core count, the generational upgrades are well worth the change from AM4 and the 5000 series. It also gives you an upgrade path to the 9000 series processors and moves into DDR5. We didn't personally test this CPU, but it's well known that it beats out non-X3D CPUs and all Intel offerings in gaming.

 




To support our Ryzen 5 7600X3D, we're using an ASRock B650M PG Lightning Wifi 6E motherboard. While it is undoubtedly from the budget side, too, it fully supports the suggested processor and offers Q-Flash Plus, which allows you to update the BIOS before you install the CPU. This is helpful for the 9000 series and future-compatible processors that weren't native to the chipset. The Ryzen 7 7600X3D doesn't come with a stock cooler, so we're adding an inexpensive, 240mm AIO cooler to the mix.

With this $1,000 build, we're stepping up to DDR5. We managed to sneak in 32GB (2x16GB) Kingston Fury Beast RGB DDR5-5600. While not the fastest kit around, it's technically the limit for that platform/processor. There's no real need to go faster or increase the capacity at this price point.

Storage on this build is the same 1TB WD Black SN770 from the $800 build. It's not the fastest PCIe 4.0 x4 drive out there, but it delivers strong performance for the money, with sequential read and write speeds of 5,150 and 4,900 MBps, respectively, solid IOPS of 740k/800k reads/writes, and 600 TBW endurance. If we're weak here, it's with capacity, but we'll correct that potential shortcoming in the next build.

 




We're going with the Phanteks XT Pro as our case because it has a high-quality mesh design, room for a 360mm AIO up top, and the ability to support back-connecting motherboards, should you get one in the future. For $20, you can get the Phanteks XT Pro Ultra, which comes with four ARGB fans.

We've updated the power supply for this build to match the new graphics card with its new connector. The new PSU is ATX 3.1 and includes a native PCIe 5.1 cable (12V-2x6) for your GPU. ASRock backs the unit with a 5-year warranty. While not the 10 years some expect from high-end devices, it's more than the 3-year warranty for some of its direct competitors.

With a $1,500 budget, we're moving up to a build that should be brilliant at 1080p gaming, really strong at 1440p gaming, and capable of running ray tracing games well. We recommend going with an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti with 16GB (avoid the 8GB model) at this price point.

The RTX 5060 Ti is more than capable of handling 2K gaming, delivering around 61-62 FPS at 1440p with Ultra settings across 14 games. It can even handle high-FPS/frequency gaming (read 144 FPS/Hz+) at 1080p. You can also look at the Radeon RX 9060 XT, which is as fast as the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but it starts to fall behind at 1440p, and especially when you enable any ray tracing.

 




With ray tracing on at 2K and Ultra settings, those frame rates were a still-playable 51 frames per second. However, consider adding DLSS to further boost those frame rates, as it fell below 60 frames per second.

 




The Ryzen 7 7800X3D is an 8-core 12-thread processor with slightly higher clock speeds (4.7 GHz to 5 GHz). The additional cores and threads help with modern gaming, where a few titles can benefit from more than a 6C/12T configuration.

We're going with the MSI MAG B850 Tomahawk MAX Wifi, one of the best budget AMD motherboards of 2025. It has just about everything you need from the platform, including ample storage options, fast Wi-Fi, and more. Overclocking, PBO, or manual settings are not a concern with the 14+2+1-phase digital VRM design and comprehensive BIOS. It also features built-in Wi-Fi 7, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps), 5 GbE LAN, and BIOS flashback capability for next-generation AMD processors.

For RAM, we chose an affordable 32GB kit from Crucial with a top speed of 6,000 MT/s. It is considered overclocking (for the integrated memory controller) on this platform, but is really the beginning of AMD's ‘sweetspot' for memory speed and cost. If you have a hard wall at $1,500, using the less expensive Kingston Fury Beast from the $1,000 build won't be noticed unless you're counting the frames.

We're opting for one of the best PCIe 4.0 SSDs available, WD's Black SN850X, in a 2TB capacity. In our tests, it was neck and neck with the other top drives, including the SK hynix Platinum P41 and the Samsung 990 Pro. We've finally doubled capacity, and you can have enough space for several AAA games.

 




Our case for this build is the Lian Li Lancool 216. When we reviewed the Lancool 216, we praised its included dual RGB 160 mm front and single 140 mm exhaust fans, excellent cable management, and attractive looks. There's also plenty of room for a top-mounted radiator that's up to 360 mm.

Last but not least, we chose ASRock's Steel Legend SL 750-G power supply. It's 80 Plus Gold (Cybenetics Platinum) and, like the previous ASRock power supply, uses the latest ATX 3.1/PCIe 5.1 standards and includes the native 12V-2x6 cable for the graphics card.

At a current price of $1,979, our high-end gaming PC build should provide enough performance to dominate games at 1080p, run 1440p ultra settings with strong frame rates, and 4K ultra with playable frame rates. The system derives its GPU muscle from an Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti, which is currently available at major retailers for around $750 (aftermarket cards are still more expensive), or at its MSRP. The card is backed by AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which features 8 cores, 16 threads, and a massive 96MB of cache to enhance gaming performance.

In our tests, the RTX 5070 Ti averaged 100.3 FPS at 1440p on our 16-game rasterization test. It also was capable of 61.2 FPS at 4K.

 




The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D offers a superior experience thanks to its 96MB of 3D cache, along with its 8 cores, 16 threads and 5.2-GHz boost clock. Yes, AMD makes the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which has 16 cores, but it costs significantly more.

On our suite of Windows 11 tests, running at 1080p with an RTX 4090 card, the 9800X3D averaged 195 FPS, leading the pack along with the much more expensive Ryzen 9 9950X3D and still way ahead of Intel. If you haven't seen the trend by now, if gaming is your primary use, AMD's X3D offerings dominate Intel in most tests.

 




To cool the CPU, we're using an ID-Cooling FX360 360 mm Cooler. When we tested the FX360, we were impressed by its low noise and excellent cooling performance. It has attractive RGB, too; you get all of that for $73.

We again opted for the MSI MAG B850 Tomahawk MAX WiFi, one of the top budget AMD motherboards of 2025. That may seem odd for a $2,000 build, but it has just about everything you need from the platform, including ample storage options, fast Wi-Fi, and more. So why pay more? If you want to overclock, you can do so with the 14+2+1 phases digital VRM design and comprehensive BIOS. It also comes with built-in Wi-Fi 7, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps), 5 GbE LAN, and BIOS flashback capability for next-gen AMD processors.We retained the previous build's 32GB Crucial kit, which features a top speed of 6,000 MT/s, as it's affordable and falls within AMD's ‘sweet spot' for memory speed and cost. You don't need more than 32GB for gaming, so within this budget, there is little need to step up and pay more.

For the SSD, we're sticking with the WD Black SN850X at 2TB. You really can't do much better without spending a lot more money on a PCIe 5 drive or a 4TB capacity.

For the SSD, we're sticking with the WD Black SN850X at 2TB. You really can't do much better without spending a lot more money on a PCIe 5 drive or a 4TB capacity.

Our case is Hyte Y40, which is a great showcase for our components. It has beautiful wraparound glass that extends from the front to the left side. The case is available in three colors, but we really like it in red.

To power all these high-end components, we're using a Corsair RM750e PSU, which is 80+ Gold certified and fully modular.

Our top-of-the-line build features Nvidia's top-of-the-line GPU, the RTX 5090. It's now available from reputable retailers — no dealing with scalpers required — and prices are now closer to MSRP, but we're still not quite there yet. The cheapest RTX 5090 available at press time was $2,599, which is $600 above the $1,999 MSRP. If you want the best, you're stuck paying a premium these days.

In our tests, the RTX 5090 was fully capable of playing games at 4K with ultra settings and ray tracing enabled. On our 6-game test, it averaged 90.2 FPS, a full 20 FPS more than its predecessor, the RTX 4090.

 




Our CPU is AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which offers faster gaming than any Intel CPU on the market, including the Core i9-14900K or Core Ultra 9 285K. It has a whopping 140MB of cache, thanks to AMD's innovative 3D V-Cache, and it boasts 16 full-power cores and 32 threads, which is more regular cores than the 14900K's eight (to go with 16 E-Cores).

On our tests, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D beat Intel's flagship, the 14900K, by a full 40 FPS on our 1080p suite of gaming tests and even more against the 285K. The last-gen, Ryzen 7 7800X3D is also really good at gaming, but doesn't hit these highs.

 




We're using an Asus ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming Wifi, which comes with built-in Wi-Fi 7, four M.2 slots for storage, and USB4. You can go higher, but there isn't much more to offer hardware-wise. To cool the CPU, we're using a Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL360 Flux, which is relatively affordable at $157 and should do a solid job.

Because we're fattening our budget for this build, we're going with some DRAM that's towards the end of the memory sweetspot of speed, price, and performance. Here we used Patriots' 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5-6400 CL32 Viper Venom. We haven't reviewed this kit, but Patriot is typically a solid brand, and there's typically plenty of headroom if you want to push the limits.We're going with a 4TB Samsung 990 Pro for storage, which has plenty of capacity and is the fastest PCIe 4.0 drive you can buy. Sure, we can go with a PCIe 5.0 drive, but we don't see enough performance gains to justify it, even in this high-end build right now.

 




We decided to go with a case that offers a unique, premium look: the Fractal Design North XL. With its wood-paneled front, this chassis looks more like a mid-century modern piece of furniture than a gaming PC, which is a nice touch. However, it also has a tempered glass side panel, which you can use to show off all of your RGB components (or you can buy it with a solid panel and no window). It also offers excellent thermal performance and plenty of room for additional drives and fans. The XL model can accommodate up to an E-ATX motherboard, giving you plenty of room for future upgrades.

With these high-end components, we don't want to skimp on the power supply, and it makes sense to invest in something that will work with future GPU upgrades. We're going with a full 1,000 watts of power and the Corsair RM1000e. This power supply is Cybenetics Gold certified and fully modular.

Solar power is much more efficient if there's no atmosphere in the way.

Google just announced that it's exploring the idea of putting AI data centers into orbit to take advantage of the sun's solar output for power. According to Google Research, Project Suncatcher aims to have a constellation of solar-powered satellites with Google TPUs that communicate optically. This would allow the company to run a power-hungry data center without requiring the massive infrastructure needed to build one on land.

Power is currently one of the bottlenecks of the AI infrastructure build-out, with companies like Microsoft sitting on GPU inventories because it doesn't have enough electricity for them. It's also causing electricity price hikes all over the U.S., burdening residents with the cost. Tech companies are investing in alternative technologies like small modular reactors and jet engines to solve their future power requirements, while current power supply challenges are quickly changing the makeup of power grids.

Solar power is a clean source of energy that data centers can use for power, but it takes up a lot of space and is subject to the day-and-night cycle and atmospheric conditions. Google suggests that by putting its satellite in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous low-earth orbit (meaning the satellite would orbit the earth's terminator, or the dividing line between day and night), it would be illuminated by the sun nearly 100% of the time. This would allow it to produce about eight times more power than ground-based solar panels, making space-based AI data centers potentially more scalable.

While the initial study has proven the viability of the concept, Google says that it still has significant engineering challenges to overcome. Some of these include developing a wireless link between satellites that can support massive amounts of data, controlling a compact constellation of satellites so that they work in unison and avoid colliding with one another and other orbiting bodies, ensuring the radiation resistance of semiconductors in space, and managing the costs of launching the entire infrastructure into space. The company says that it plans to launch two prototypes in 2027 to test the system and check its viability for machine learning.

Putting AI data centers might help reduce their impact on the electrical supply on Earth, but it also comes with its own set of issues. These include increasing the number of orbiting space junk around our planet and the possible disruption of ground-based astronomical observation, among others. The project is still in its early stages, though, so scientists and researchers have time to consider these things before launching a full-scale constellation in low-earth orbit.

All the Watts you need for a modern high-power gaming rig


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Modern high-end gaming PCs can have some incredibly powerful and electricity-draining components in them, with GPUs like Nvidia's RTX 5090 recommending at least a 1000W power supply to handle transient spikes and sustained power draw. Today at Newegg, you can find a great deal on a new 1000W power supply from ASRock that will save you a cool $50. Swap out that old PSU, or prepare for a new build with a modern power supply upgrade.

In a limited-time deal at Newegg, the ASRock Steel Legend SL-1000G is discounted to just $109 from its original $159 list price. According to the Newegg website, there are fewer than 24 hours to claim this deal, so act fast if you're at all interested in this deal.

The ASRock Steel Legend SL-1000G is an 80-Plus Gold and Cybenetics Titanium-certified power supply using components such as 100% Japanese capacitors. It's a fairly new release and therefore comes with the 12V-2x6 connectors (a dual color design), two of them. The PSU is ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 ready for all the latest hardware components. The Steel Legend SL-1000G features a fully modular cable design, intelligent fan control, a built-in 5V boost function, and a lengthy 10-year warranty.

The ASRock Steel Legend SL-1000G is an 80-Plus Gold and Cybenetics Titanium-certified power supply featuring Japanese capacitors, dual 12V-2x6 connectors, ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 readiness, fully modular cabling, and a 10-year warranty.

We had the chance to review the ASRock Steel Legend SL-1000G 1000W power supply and gave it a 3.5 stars out of 5 rating. We really liked the remarkable 10-year warranty and build quality of the PSU, with the test unit having exceptional efficiency for its class, tight voltage regulation, and full protection features. Our concerns with this PSU were the noise levels under heavy stress, moderate ripple levels, some signs of thermal stress, and generally a lack of standout features. But, at this price point, it's an exceptional value for a high-wattage power supply with these features.

Banning Nvidia's more efficient GPUs comes at the price of power


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Local Chinese governments have begun issuing attractive power incentives and subsidies to Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, according to a new report. Designed to cut energy bills for affected companies, the subsidies are an effort to further curtail the use of foreign chips, such as Nvidia's powerful AI-capable hardware. The incentives are also intended to bolster the local production of Chinese chips and AI processors.

The past year has seen the U.S. and China tussle repeatedly over access to the latest hardware, namely, Nvidia GPUs. On-again, off-again tariffs, trade export blocks, and threats to restrict access to rare earth minerals have ultimately led to China pushing to accelerate the development of its own AI hardware, like GPUs and ASICs for inference and, aspirationally, AI training. To encourage their use, the country has effectively blocked Chinese tech companies from using Nvidia GPUs and pushed them towards domestic alternatives instead.

The only problem is, Nvidia GPUs are at the top of the pile for a reason: they're incredibly fast, and far more efficient than the alternatives from the likes of Huawei and Cambrion. Specifically, Nvidia's GPUs are so far ahead in terms of per-watt efficiency that Chinese alternatives are generations behind, perhaps due to export restrictions on ASML's latest EUV lithography tools, which China doesn't have access to. This means that chips developed natively in the region will lag behind the rest of the world. Despite these limitations, companies such as Huawei continue to make efforts to compete with Nvidia.

Companies like Huawei are developing high-performance chips, clustering them together and pumping them full of additional power, but that makes them less efficient, in turn leading to rapidly rising energy costs.

These rising energy costs have led to grumbling in the Chinese tech industry, so Chinese government officials are looking to sweeten the deal with proposed energy subsidies. Regions like Gansu, Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia, where data centers are heavily concentrated, have begun offering large energy subsidies, cutting bills by as much as 50% in some cases.

The catch is that data centers that use GPUs and chips from foreign manufacturers, like Nvidia, are exempt from the incentives. This plan has the dual benefit for local governments of meeting central party demands, while also helping attract data center production to their region, as local governments compete for contracts.

 




These subsidies are funded by the $50 billion Big Fund III, which China set up to compete with the U.S., in order to bolster its chip design and fabrication industry, thereby bolstering the country's AI efforts. China is ultimately expected to spend close to $100 billion in government investment on accelerating the development of these domestic industries this year.

Across the Pacific, American companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and CoreWeave are all collectively investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, building out enormous data centers and circularly buying each other's services, hardware, and software. Chinese tech companies are looking to compete, although Goldman Sachs has predicted that those companies will ""only"" invest around $70 billion in data centers in 2026.

Despite greater investment in the U.S., it might also be energy which proves the bottleneck. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company is sitting on unused GPUs and AI chips that it can't use because it doesn't have the energy to run them. Elon Musk's xAI has been buying up gas turbines by the thousands and is even trying to import a power station. One thing is clear: massive AI data center buildouts are causing a squeeze in energy supplies across the board. Small, modular nuclear reactors could be one way around the issue, but it's far from a simple, quick solution.

Power may well remain in short supply, even with all the solar coming online around the world. Especially in China, where the country built more solar power in the first half of 2025 than the U.S. has in its entire history. China's advancements in nuclear and hydropower could give it a distinct advantage in the years to come, if energy proves to be a more significant bottleneck for AI than pure compute performance.

Sue  Hughes

 November 05, 2025  

BARCELONA, Spain — In stroke due to basilar artery occlusion, the best technique to use for thrombectomy appears to depend on the underlying etiology of the clot, a new trial suggested.

The Chinese ANGEL-COAST randomized trial compared two different techniques used for endovascular thrombectomy — either contact aspiration or stent retriever — in patients with basilar artery occlusion stroke.

Results showed that using contact aspiration on the first attempt at clot removal achieved higher initial reperfusion rates without increasing the risk for symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or periprocedural complications.

However, this advantage was offset by lower rates of final recanalization and similar procedural duration, resulting in no significant difference in 90-day functional outcomes between the two groups.

Subgroup analyses also suggested that contact aspiration may be more suitable for patients with embolic type clots while the stent retriever may be preferable for occlusions caused by intracranial atherosclerosis.

“Our results do not give a definite answer,” trial investigator Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, told Medscape Medical News.

“A reasonable conclusion would be that for basilar artery occlusion stroke use of contact aspiration for the first pass, and then to switch to a stent retriever for subsequent attempts at removing the clot, may be the best approach,” he suggested.

Nogueira added that he favors contact aspiration for embolic occlusions in the basilar artery but believes patients with occlusions that stem from intracranial atherosclerotic disease are likely to do better with a stent retriever.

The trial results were presented at 17th World Stroke Congress (WSC) 2025.

Contact aspiration and stent retriever are two different techniques used in endovascular treatment of stroke for clot removal.

Contact aspiration involves bringing a catheter into contact with the clot and then using a syringe to aspirate the clot. Whereas with a stent retriever, a stent is introduced with a wire, and the clot is incorporated into the stent mesh and removed.

Operators may have a personal preference as to which technique they use, but it would be preferable for that decision to be determined by individual patient characteristics, Nogueira said.

He noted that while the two techniques have shown similar effectiveness for clot removal in the anterior circulation, data from large observational registries in Western populations suggest that, specifically for basilar artery occlusions in the posterior circulation (PC), contact aspiration may be superior to the stent retriever.

The ANGEL-COAST trial was conducted to investigate this further.

The trial included 340 Chinese patients with stroke caused by basilar artery occlusion who were within 24 hours of stroke onset and had evidence of salvageable tissue (PC Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score > 6).

Patients were randomly assigned to endovascular treatment with either the contact aspiration or stent retriever approach. Operators were required to make at least three revascularization attempts using the assigned thrombectomy technique before switching to another method as rescue therapy.

The aspiration catheter used was manufactured by DEEPIN Technology, Beijing, China, but the size of the aspiration catheter was at the operators' discretion as was stent retriever selection.

The primary outcome was the first pass effect, defined as near-complete recanalization (eTICI 2c/3) after first thrombectomy pass without any rescue treatment. This showed a significant benefit with the contact aspiration approach.

The intention to treat analysis showed near complete reperfusion after the first pass in 43.5% of the contact aspiration group vs 27.4% of the stent retriever group, giving a treatment effect odds ratio (OR) of 2.04 (95% CI, 1.30-3.22; P = .002.)

The per protocol analysis, which included 311 patients, showed an even larger effect, with reperfusion rates at first pass of 49.7% vs 27.2%, giving an OR of 2.65 (95% CI, 1.65-4.24; P < .001).

However, reperfusion rates showed an opposite effect, with near complete reperfusion achieved in 87.6% of the aspiration groups vs 94.0% of the stent retriever group, giving a treatment effect OR of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.21-0.99; P = .046).

Nogueira noted that subgroup analysis showed patients who have underlying intracranial atherosclerotic disease may benefit less from contact aspiration than those who had a stroke caused by an embolic occlusion.

He explained that among patients without intracranial atherosclerotic disease, outcomes with contact aspiration appeared markedly better than with stent retrievers. However, because the trial was conducted in a Chinese population — where intracranial atherosclerosis is more common — this may account for the lack of an overall benefit with contact aspiration in the final reperfusion results.

“In this trial we had a mixed population, and we didn't see a clear result. I think in future we need to separate these two categories of patients and see if we can prove this hypothesis,” he added.

Nogueira pointed out that the fact that this was a Chinese trial may limit the generalizability of the study findings.

“Chinese patients have high rates of intracranial atherosclerosis in basilar artery occlusion stroke which may limit the ability to generalize these findings to other ethnicities. Further large, randomized trials are needed to validate the results of the ANGEL-COAST trial in Western populations,” he concluded.

Commenting on the trial results for Medscape Medical News, Amrou Sarraj, MD, professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, suggested that the results pointed to trying contact aspiration first for basilar artery occlusion.

“These results give the operator multiple possibilities to open the vessel. For basilar artery occlusion it seems worthwhile trying the faster technique of contact aspiration first,” he said.

ANGEL-COAST trial was funded by the grants from the Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases-National Science and Technology Major, National Key R&D Program of China, Beijing Natural Science Foundation, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Hospitals Authority's Ascent Plan. Nogueira reported no relevant disclosures.

Initiating statins within 3 years of diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer was associated with a modest but clinically meaningful 10% lower risk of dying from breast cancer and an 8% lower risk of dying from any cause, a recent Danish registry study suggests.

The researchers calculated that 59 patients would need to take statins to prevent one additional breast cancer death at 10 years.

“Clinically, this means that if a patient is prescribed statins after diagnosis for cardiovascular reasons, there is no reason to stop them — in fact, there may be added benefit,” first author Sixten Harborg, MD, Department of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, told Medscape Medical News.

Harborg added that, “while we are not recommending statins as part of cancer treatment yet, the results are encouraging, especially as we wait for randomized trial data from the MASTER trial,” which is evaluating the addition of the statin atorvastatin to standard adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.

Statins have demonstrated benefits beyond lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular events. The drugs have anti-inflammatory properties and can inhibit cell growth as well as enhance or suppress immune activity. Preclinical studies have suggested that elevated cholesterol may fuel tumor growth in breast cancer, and that statins can inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and mitigate metastasis.

As researchers continued to explore the potential protective effects of statins in breast cancer, a growing body of evidence indicated that statins could reduce the risk for recurrence and improve survival outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

However, physicians often discontinue statins following a breast cancer diagnosis over a “misconception that they are irrelevant in the context of malignant disease,” Harborg and colleagues noted in their paper online, published in JAMA Network Open.

In the current analysis, Harborg and colleagues evaluated the association between post-diagnosis statin initiation and breast cancer mortality using an emulated target trial approach — an advanced statistical method that uses observational data to mimic the design and analysis of a randomized controlled trial.

Using Danish registry data, the researchers identified 66,952 women with stage I-III breast cancer, none of whom had prior invasive breast cancer or had taken a statin within 1 year before enrollment.

To emulate a target trial of statin use after a breast cancer diagnosis, the researchers created a clone of each patient — one assigned to a statin-initiation strategy and one to a nonstatin group — with censoring based on statin use during a 3-year grace period. This cloning approach ensured that both groups were identical at baseline, with censoring rules applied based on whether and when patients started statin therapy within a 3-year window. Participants were followed for up to 10 years or until death, emigration, or deviation from their assigned treatment strategy.

Over a median follow-up of 9 years, 4851 women began statin therapy. During more than 600,000 person-years of observation, 9130 participants died from breast cancer and 19,679 from any cause.

The 10-year risk for breast cancer mortality was lower in statin initiators than in noninitiators — 11.8% vs 13.5% (risk difference, 1.7%). Overall, 59 patients would need to receive a statin to prevent one additional breast cancer death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90).

A similar difference in all-cause mortality was reported among statin users — 23.3% vs 24.5% (risk difference, 1.2%; HR, 0.92).

The survival advantage was greatest in women who started statins soon after diagnosis. Those initiating a statin within 12 months had a 28% lower risk of dying from breast cancer (HR, 0.72) than noninitiators. Similarly, patients who initiated statins within 24 months after diagnosis had a lower risk for breast cancer mortality (HR, 0.83) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.87).

The statin benefit was consistent across most subgroups, including those with node-positive breast cancer, those with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-negative tumors, as well as those receiving different combinations of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or endocrine therapy.

The findings are “intriguing” and point to the “potential” role for statins in patients with breast cancer, said Naomi Y. Ko, MD, MPH, medical oncologist and section chief of the breast oncology program at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City, who wasn't involved in the research.

While it's “certainly plausible” that statins can improve breast cancer outcomes, Ko said, “the challenge with the study is that the group that had the statins already had better prognosis, given that they had smaller tumors and lower grade tumors. Those characteristics alone would give them an improved prognosis.” 

Ko highlighted the need to individualize statin use among patients. If, for instance, a patient is on a statin with an indication of high cholesterol, “I will support her taking those medications,” Ko said. Additionally, because aromatase inhibitors can raise cholesterol levels, it's important to check cholesterol levels after starting these drugs and if there is an indication to start a statin, “I support it.”

Overall, the study helps increase awareness of the possible benefits of statins among patients with early breast cancer, but “I certainly would need to see more research before I would support universal treatment with statins for all breast cancer patients,” Ko said.

The study was supported by Aarhus University, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Director Michael H. Nielsens Memorial Grant, Fabricant Einar Willumsens Memorial Grant, Astrid Thaysens Grant for Medical Research, Eva and Henry Frænkels Memorial Grant, ESMO Merit Travel Grant Award, and the Danish Cancer Society.

Adding glucocorticoids to standard care within 48 hours of hospital admission reduced the risk for death in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in low-resource settings and was safe as an add-on to conventional therapy.

“In our trial involving patients who were hospitalized with CAP in a low-resource setting, the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause than standard care,” the authors of the study wrote.

“For clinicians, it offers hope that glucocorticoids, an inexpensive, accessible intervention, can save the lives of African patients with pneumonia. For policymakers, it highlights the necessity of ensuring safe, equitable implementation,” the authors of a linked editorial wrote.

The study was led by Ruth K. Lucinde, MMed, Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Program, Kilifi, Kenya. It was published online on October 29, 2025, in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The main limitation was the enrollment of a heterogeneous patient group because of limited diagnostic and treatment resources. Broad eligibility that did not consider pneumonia severity and prognostic factors at baseline may have biased the results toward the null. Additionally, the open-label design, unavailability of data on time to steroid initiation, and use of oral rather than intravenous formulations may have affected outcomes and limited the study's generalizability.

The study was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust; the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with additional support from the Science for Africa Foundation. Two authors disclosed receiving grants or contracts from Gilead Sciences, ViiV Healthcare, the National Institute for Health Research, and the Wellcome Trust, as well as having other financial ties with GlaxoSmithKline and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corporation.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who took tofacitinib for 6 months had increased lower limb and thigh muscle volume, a small prospective study found.

“Tofacitinib is associated with an increase in leg muscle volume, possibly through suppression of inflammation-induced muscle loss. This study suggests a novel role for tofacitinib in the treatment of sarcopenia,” experts wrote in an accompanying editorial.

This study was led by Joshua L. Bennett, PhD, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It was published online on October 15, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

The increase in muscle volume cannot be definitively attributed to tofacitinib therapy because of the single-arm nature of the study. The small sample size, absence of a control group, and high tender joint count limited the power to detect changes in muscle strength and function. Nutritional assessments were not included in this study.

This study was funded by an Investigator Initiated Research Grant from Pfizer. Some authors disclosed receiving funding, reimbursement for travel and conference registration, speaker honoraria, research grants or support, consultancy fees, and support for conference attendance; participating in advisory‑board roles; and having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies.

Venerated for more than a century in Venezuela, Dr José Gregorio Hernández was officially canonised on Sunday, October 19, in St Peter's Square, Vatican City.

It was one of Pope Francis's final official acts before his death earlier this year. On February 24, from his hospital bed in Rome, Pope Francis had formally granted sainthood to Hernández, the Venezuelan physician revered since the early 20th century. His successor, Pope Leo XIV, presided over the canonisation mass, marking the culmination of a century-long wait for Venezuelans.

Although the Catholic Church waited until 2025 to officially recognize the man known across Latin America as the “doctor of the poor,” Hernández has long been regarded as a saint in Venezuela. Streets and hospitals bear his name, murals of his likeness adorn the walls of Caracas, Venezuela, and many Venezuelans keep devotional images of the gentle-faced physician, with his neatly trimmed moustache and signature hat, in their homes. In hospital corridors across the country, doctors and patients alike pray to Hernández in moments of desperation. Numerous miracles have been attributed to him not only in Venezuela but throughout South America.

Born on October 26, 1864, in a small village in the Andes mountains, Hernández completed part of his medical studies in Europe. Between 1888 and 1891, he studied in Paris and Berlin, learning modern medical techniques from leading scientific minds of the Belle Époque.

Upon returning to Venezuela, he became a professor of histology and introduced the advanced medical methods he had mastered abroad. He is believed to have been the first Venezuelan scientist to use a microscope. He also founded the country's first bacteriology laboratory and published about 15 scientific papers.

Despite his contributions to science, Hernández became best known for his religious devotion and humanitarian compassion, which endeared him to Venezuela's poor. Twice he sought to join monastic life but had to withdraw because of health issues. Instead, he devoted all his free time to caring for those in need.

He was known for carrying a small medical bag on his rounds: Those who could pay for a consultation slipped money into it, and those who could not simply took what they needed. “He possessed a kind of knowledge that no academy can teach: the science of being loved,” one of his colleagues said.

During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, he was on the front lines, tending to the sick and destitute.

His sudden death on June 29, 1919, at age 54, embodied the selflessness that defined his life. After leaving a pharmacy where he had purchased medicine with his own money for a poor patient, he was struck by a vehicle and killed. His death sparked national mourning, and thousands attended his funeral. “Before the coffin of José Gregorio Hernández, we all felt the desire to be good,” wrote Venezuelan novelist Rómulo Gallegos.

Since then, public devotion to Hernández — now Saint Hernández — has never waned.

The first formal petitions for Hernández's canonisation were submitted to the Vatican in 1949. Decades later, when Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela in 1996, about five million people, ie, nearly 20% of the country's population, signed a petition urging his sainthood.

Under canon law, sainthood requires at least two confirmed miracles attributed to the individual after death. The first miracle linked to Hernández occurred in 2017, when a young Venezuelan girl who had been shot in the head during a robbery survived without any neurological damage, a recovery that astonished surgeons. Her mother had prayed to Hernández for help, and the Catholic Church officially recognised the event as a miracle.

Three years later, in 2020, Pope Francis beatified Hernández, further strengthening Venezuelans' devotion to the physician known as the “doctor of the poor.” His remains were moved to a reliquary in the Church of La Candelaria in Caracas, and 160 additional reliquaries containing fragments of his bones were distributed across the country for veneration.

A second miracle followed in 2022, when a Venezuelan woman living in Miami was inexplicably cured of a terminal illness, again attributed to the intercession of Hernández.

For Venezuela's 28 million citizens, this recognition elevated Hernández — now Saint Hernández, the first saint in the nation's history — to a lasting symbol of faith, compassion, and healing.

On every October 26 since his death, masses are celebrated across Venezuela in his honour. But this year, the faithful venerated not only a national hero but an official saint.

A commonly prescribed antibiotic could help reduce the risk of some young people developing schizophrenia, new research suggests. 

Experts found that patients of adolescent mental health services who were treated with the antibiotic doxycycline were significantly less likely to go on to develop schizophrenia in adulthood compared with patients treated with other antibiotics. 

Experts say the findings highlight the potential to repurpose an existing, widely used medication as a preventive intervention for severe mental illness. 

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that typically emerges in early adulthood and is often associated with hallucinations and delusional beliefs. 

To better understand potential ways of preventing the condition, researchers from the University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with the University of Oulu and University College Dublin, applied advanced statistical modelling to large-scale healthcare register data from Finland. 

The team analyzed data from more than 56,000 adolescents attending mental health services who had been prescribed antibiotics. They found that those treated with doxycycline had a 30–35 per cent lower risk of developing schizophrenia than peers who received other antibiotics. 

The researchers hypothesized that the protective effect could be linked to doxycycline's impact on inflammation and brain development. 

Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used to treat infections and acne. Previous studies suggest it can reduce inflammation in brain cells and influence synaptic pruning – a natural process where the brain refines its neural connections. Excessive pruning has been associated with the development of schizophrenia. 

Further analyses showed that the lower risk wasn't simply because the young people may have been treated for acne rather than having infections, and was unlikely to be explained by other hidden differences between the groups. 

As many as half of the people who develop schizophrenia had previously attended child and adolescent mental health services for other mental health problems. At present, though, we don't have any interventions that are known to reduce the risk of going on to develop schizophrenia in these young people. That makes these findings exciting. 

Because the study was observational in nature and not a randomised controlled trial, it means we can't draw firm conclusions on causality, but this is an important signal to further investigate the protective effect of doxycycline and other anti-inflammatory treatments in adolescent psychiatry patients as a way to potentially reduce the risk of developing severe mental illness in adulthood.""

New research from Moffitt Cancer Center shows that RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibition can directly block tumor growth and activate the immune system, offering the first targeted approach for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer with limited treatment options beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors. Results from the study were published in Cancer Immunology Research. It shows the potential for durable responses, laying the groundwork for future clinical trials and a possible new standard of care. 

What makes NRAS-mutant melanoma so difficult to treat compared to other types of melanoma? 
Unlike patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, who can benefit from multiple FDA-approved targeted therapy combinations, people with NRAS-mutant disease have no such options. The standard of care currently relies on immune checkpoint inhibitors, which work well for some patients but not for all. Many either fail to respond or eventually develop resistance. For this group, once immunotherapy stops working, treatment options are extremely limited. That's why developing a targeted therapy for NRAS-mutant melanoma has been such an important and unmet need in the field. 

How does daraxonrasib (RMC-6236) or its preclinical counterpart RMC-7977 actually work inside the body? 
RAS proteins act as powerful molecular switches that drive cancer growth. Mutant RAS is stuck in the ""on"" position, continuously signaling the tumor to grow, survive and evade immune attack. Daraxonrasib is part of a new class of drugs designed to target the active, or ""on,"" form of RAS, something researchers have struggled to achieve for decades. By binding to active RAS proteins (NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS), these drugs block the downstream MAPK signaling pathway that fuels tumor growth. This not only causes cancer cells to stop dividing and die but also makes the tumor more visible to the immune system. 

What role did the immune system play in the treatment responses observed in this study? 
The immune response turned out to be critical. Treatment with the RAS inhibitor led to a surge in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the key immune cells that recognize and kill tumor cells. It also reduced populations of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which normally help tumors evade the immune system. In laboratory experiments, when these T cells were depleted, the drug was no longer able to eliminate tumors. This tells us that the drug is not just acting directly on the cancer but is also working hand-in-hand with the body's immune defenses to achieve durable responses. 

Were there any patients involved in this study, and if so, what kinds of results did they experience? 

Two Moffitt patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma were treated as part of an early clinical trial of daraxonrasib. One patient experienced a complete response, meaning no detectable tumor remained on scans, while the other had a partial response with significant tumor shrinkage. This is a landmark moment because it's the first evidence that an RAS inhibitor can work in this specific group of melanoma patients. If these early findings hold up in larger trials, this could represent the first targeted therapy ever developed for NRAS-mutant melanoma. 

What are the next steps before this therapy could be more widely available to patients? 
Daraxonrasib is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial, which primarily focuses on establishing safety, tolerability and optimal dosing. Once this phase is complete, the drug will need to move into phase 2 and 3 trials to evaluate its efficacy in larger, more diverse patient groups. If it demonstrates meaningful and durable benefit with manageable side effects, it could eventually lead to FDA approval and a new standard of care. But it's important to note that this process takes time, and these next stages will be essential for confirming the promise we're seeing now. 

This study was supported in part by Revolution Medicines and the Melanoma Research Alliance.

New antivirals and vaccines could follow the discovery by Australian researchers of strategies used by viruses to control our cells.

Led by Monash University and the University of Melbourne, and published in Nature Communications, the study reveals how rabies virus manipulates so many cellular processes despite being armed with only a few proteins. 

Researchers believe other dangerous viruses like Nipah and Ebola may also work the same way, possibly enabling the development of antivirals or vaccines to block these actions.

Co-senior author Associate Professor Greg Moseley, head of the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute's (BDI) Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory, said the ability of viruses to ""do so much with so little"" was perhaps their most remarkable skill.

""Viruses such as rabies can be incredibly lethal because they take control of many aspects of life inside the cells they infect,"" Associate Professor Moseley said. ""They hijack the machinery that makes proteins, disrupt the 'postal service' that sends messages between different parts of the cell, and disable the defences that normally protect us from infection.

""A major question for scientists has been: how do viruses achieve this with so few genes? Rabies virus, for example, has the genetic material to make only five proteins, compared with about 20,000 in a human cell.""

Co-first author and Moseley Lab research fellow Dr. Stephen Rawlinson, of the BDI's Moseley Lab, said understanding how these few viral proteins performed so many tasks could unlock new ways to stop infection.

""Our study provides an answer,"" he said. ""We discovered that one of rabies virus's key proteins, called P protein, gains a remarkable range of functions through its ability to change shape and to bind to RNA.

""RNA is the same molecule used in new-generation RNA vaccines, but it plays essential roles inside our cells, carrying genetic messages, coordinating immune responses, and helping make the building blocks of life.""

Co-senior author Professor Paul Gooley, head of the University of Melbourne's Gooley Laboratory, said by targeting RNA systems, the viral P protein could switch between different physical 'phases' inside the cell.

This allows it to infiltrate many of the cell's liquid-like compartments, take control of vital processes, and turn the cell into a highly efficient virus factory.

Although this study focused on rabies, the same strategy is likely used by other dangerous viruses such as Nipah and Ebola. Understanding this new mechanism opens exciting possibilities for developing antivirals or vaccines that block this remarkable adaptability.""

Professor Paul Gooley, Head of the University of Melbourne's Gooley Laboratory

Dr Rawlinson said the study should change how scientists think about multifunctional viral proteins. ""Until now, these proteins were often viewed like trains made up of several carriages, with each carriage (or module) responsible for a specific task,"" he said.

""According to this view, shorter versions of a protein should simply lose functions as carriages are removed. However, this simple model could not explain why some shorter viral proteins actually gain new abilities. We found that multifunctionality can also arise from the way the 'carriages' interact and fold together to create different overall shapes, as well as forming new abilities such as binding to RNA.""

Associate Professor Moseley said this RNA binding allowed the protein to move between different physical 'phases' within the cell.

""In doing so, it can access and manipulate many of the cell's own liquid-like compartments that control key processes, such as immune defence and protein production,"" he said. ""By revealing this new mechanism, our study provides a fresh way of thinking about how viruses use their limited genetic material to create proteins that are flexible, adaptable, and able to take control of complex cellular systems.""

Economist Vivian Ho has been researching the U.S. health care system for four decades. These days, she's focused on what she thinks are the biggest burdens on the average American: runaway hospital prices and rising health insurance premiums.

She has developed a strategy for addressing high insurance premiums — one that's based on giving patients reliable information about how much they, and their insurer, would have to pay for care. The system is already working in Massachusetts. Could it be a model for the rest of the country?

Ho explains to Dan Weissmann, host of ""An Arm and a Leg,"" why she thinks this approach could help curb high prices and how listeners can help prove it by sharing their medical bills.

Dan Weissmann @danweissmann Host and producer of ""An Arm and a Leg.""

Previously, Dan was a staff reporter for Marketplace and Chicago's WBEZ. His work also appears on ""All Things Considered,"" Marketplace, the BBC, ""99 Percent Invisible,"" and ""Reveal,"" from the Center for Investigative Reporting.

Note: ""An Arm and a Leg"" uses speech-recognition software to generate transcripts, which may contain errors. Please use the transcript as a tool but check the corresponding audio before quoting the podcast.

Dan: Hey there-

Vivian Ho is a health economist at Rice University and the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. And since early 2024, she's been giving talks at… HR conferences. Which is not a typical gig for an economist.

Vivian Ho: Um, yes. Economists don't usually do that. We love to go talk at our own conferences.

Dan: But she's been eager to spread a pretty big message.

Vivian Ho: There's a potential to save workers, um, you know, and employees a lot of money.

Dan: And a few weeks ago, she sent me an email asking for help with what she's trying to do: 

She's wants folks to send her hospital bills for a study she thinks could be part of saving people a lot of moneys. She wondered if I'd encourage people to pitch in.

And honestly, I wanted to say yes before I even really knew anything specific about the study.

I should say: Vivian Ho has been a donor to this show. That's actually how I met her and learned about her work. And became kind of a fan. 

Over the last few years, she's been digging up and publishing evidence we need, to push back against the way health care keeps getting more and more expensive.

This is stuff a lot of us suspected, to say the least — stuff reporters have documented examples of — but she's demonstrated they're actual trends, not one-offs. 

For instance: When nonprofit hospitals make big profits — and they often do - they call them surpluses- they don't generally use that money to help patients, by giving more charity care to reduce people's bills. 

In one study, she compared hospital finances in the early 2010s and near the end of the decade. As the decade was ending, she found nonprofit hospitals were a LOT more profitable than they'd been before. 

And they'd gotten a lot richer, with like seventy percent more cash in the bank than they'd had earlier. 

But they were actually giving out less charity care. 

 She told me she ran that down after she got help understanding a big set of data that helped her see what hospitals actually do with their money- and started to poke around in it.

Vivian Ho: I say, well, I'm just gonna go have a look at, you know, one of the local hospitals and see what it says and then I pull it up and I go, oh wow.

Dan: She took a peek at one hospital's ""fund balance"" — that's non-profit speak for an institution's savings, like for a rainy day. 

Vivian Ho: The fund balance for one of the hospitals across the street from Rice University is five and a half billion dollars. And so, you know, then it's like, well, I need to take a closer look at this.

Dan: Here's a couple things she found: That fund balance — the ""rainy day fund"" — was enough to run the hospital for more than two years. And it runs a healthy profit margin. 

And her study showed when she zoomed out: This is not a one-off. Among hospitals that do well, it's the norm.

And this kind of data — this kind of EVIDENCE of how things work, of who benefits, and how much, from the totally unfair and unaffordable prices we're all up against — it's ammunition. 

Vivian Ho is looking for people to share their hospital bills with her, in order to build up her arsenal of information . 

She's got a strategy in mind for how to deploy that information to save a lot of people a ton of money. It's interesting.

And: I have no idea if this specific strategy will pay off.

But here's what I do think: ?If we're going to fight against the greed and exploitation that make our health care system so unhealthy — so deadly — we're gonna need all the fighting power we can get.

So, I've sent Vivian Ho a hospital bill. And at the end of this episode I'll encourage you to do the same. 

This is An Arm and a Leg — a show about why health care costs so freaking much, and what we can maybe do about it. I'm Dan Weissmann. I'm a reporter, and I like a challenge. So the job we've chosen here is to take one of the most enraging, terrifying, depressing parts of American life, and bring you a show that's entertaining, empowering and useful.

Dan: Vivian Ho has been a health economist for like 40 years. And you could say she has mixed feelings.

Vivian Ho: Health economists, they work on so many different things and they are all important and interesting. But I do think the issue of the cost of healthcare and the cost of health insurance premiums is the biggest problem putting a burden on the average American citizen. And I don't think as a profession that we spend enough time on that basic issue. I feel kind of - well, it does make me quite sad because here I am, I've worked in this career for this entire time, and things aren't getting better. They're actually getting much worse.

Dan: And that, she says, is why she does things like go to HR conferences these days. She's got the motivation and she's got the freedom to do it. 

Vivian Ho: So I'm super lucky. I've got tenure at Rice and you know, I'm a member of National Academy of Medicine. I've sort of achieved everything that I wanted to achieve, and now it's, it's all about, well, what can we do?

Dan: She's decided to go after what she now sees as the biggest problem. Not the ONLY problem, but the biggest driver in prices that only seem to go up more every year.

Hospital systems are consolidating — gobbling each other up. So they get more bargaining power with insurers. They get higher prices without necessarily delivering more value.

Which isn't what economists always expect. Bigger can mean better, more efficient. That's what Vivian Ho used to expect.

Vivian Ho: I started this whole research agenda sort of 10-15 years ago, and I thought bigger was going to be better. I thought because of economies of scale and that if you allowed hospitals to acquire physician practices, there would be less duplication of services, you'd save money. But then the problem is there's no mechanism that forces a provider to pass any savings onto the consumer. So there may be economies of scale, it's just you and I as consumers aren't able to enjoy any of those benefits.

Dan: That's something we've talked about on this show. Like a lot. But what Vivian Ho has been able to demonstrate is: At this point, the average profit margins for hospitals — including ""non-profit"" hospitals — are actually higher than average profit margins for insurance companies.

Vivian Ho: There's plenty of rural hospitals and smaller hospitals that lose money, but net, when you average on just how much profits the consolidated systems are making and you add them up all over the country, it's much higher than what you get for the total profits of insurers.

Dan: Which isn't to say that insurance companies don't have a BIG role to play in our suffering. 

Vivian Ho: Insurers are, in many ways, not doing what they should be for customers. Certainly the show demonstrates that in many ways and that they are earning high profits. I've just looked at the data and concluded that the hospitals are earning much higher profits than the insurers are, and that's where we've gotta focus our attention. 

Dan: I mean, there's so much to unpack there, right? One is, wow, the hospitals are earning higher profits than insurance companies, and the insurance companies, by and large, are publicly traded entities that answer to shareholders. And the majority of hospitals in the United States are, as far as the IRS is concerned not-for-profit entities.

Vivian Ho: Exactly. We've been doing research lately that unfortunately shows that our not-for-profit hospitals behave a lot like for-profit companies.

Dan: So, okay, how do we get at that? 

Vivian Ho: Oh, uh, how do we change the behavior of what's going on? 

Dan: Yeah.

Vivian Ho: Yeah. So…

Dan: Here's Vivian Ho's game plan. It's complicated, and I'm not in a position to say, ""this'll totally work"" — but there's a lot that's worth knowing here.

Especially this:

When Vivian Ho talks to business executives or HR managers, she brings out another set of data. And this is data that's only become available in the last few years. 

Insurers now have to show what they pay hospitals. Not the sticker price, the negotiated price.

So, Vivian Ho's talk includes a slide showing some details from three Houston hospitals. Blue Cross pays one of them about 22 thousand dollars for spinal fusion surgery. Another one gets 66 thousand — three times as much.. 

And the slide shows: That math is similar for other procedures. 

Vivian Ho: Employers didn't realize how different the prices could be at their local hospitals. They thought, you know, anyone would think, oh, the prices couldn't be that different. And now that some of the data is starting to make it out there, it's becoming clear you really could save a lot of money.

Dan: I mean, you MAYBE could — if you could give your workers a good reason to go to the hospital that charges less.

Vivian Ho has a model for how that could work. It's — based in part on a story I call Once Upon a Time in Massachusetts. 

That's next.

This episode of An Arm and a Leg is produced in partnership with KFF Health News. They're a nonprofit newsroom covering health issues in America. Their reporters do amazing work. They win all kinds of awards every year. We're honored to work with them. 

So, here's our story — Once Upon a Time in Massachusetts — straight from the story's author.

Elena Prager: I am Elena Prager. I'm an assistant professor of economics at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester.

Dan: And while doing her dissertation, she came across a very unusual set of data. 

Elena Prager: I was like, wow, goldmine.

Dan: Here's the story: Massachusetts has an agency that basically runs employee health benefits for all state employees, and a lot of local-government workers too.

And once upon a time — starting in 2010- they tried something unusual. 

Elena Prager: Possibly because they were lucky, possibly because they were smart, they designed their health insurance plans - at least when it came to hospital care - based everything on copays. And what that means is that you are given a dollar number. Let's say $250 or $500 and like that's it. That's the number. If you go to hospital A, you pay 250, you go to hospital B, you pay 500. The end.

Dan: Which is totally different from how we're used to looking at hospitals, right? I mean, regular insurance plans typically say, ""You'll pay like 10 percent, or 20 percent or 30 percent of whatever the total bill turns out to be."" 

Elena Prager: And the patient is left scratching their head being like, well, how do I know what the total bill is gonna be? Even if the hospital tells me something. Like, what if something goes wrong with the anesthesia? They have to call in an extra specialist. There's a complication. More stuff gets done. Like it's very, very hard to, for a patient and even really a provider, to predict in advance what's gonna be done to them and therefore what the price is going to be.

Dan: So there's no way for me to take price into account if I need to go to the hospital.

But Once Upon a Time in Massachusetts, there was. It was a co-pay. Whatever insurance plan you were on, it worked the same way:

Go to hospital A — where prices are generally higher — your copay might be five hundred dollars.

Go to hospital B — that charges the insurance plan less for stuff — you'd pay two-fifty.

And Elena Prager found the data that showed what happened next.

Long story short, she found that over three years, patients started using lower-priced hospitals more often. Patients saved money, and so did the health plan. 

And actually, Massachusetts still runs its health plans this way, but- 

 Vivian Ho doesn't think other employers can just get their insurance companies to adopt this same model. 

VIVIAN HO: It's actually a fair amount of work.

DAN: Work for the insurance company. Doing the math to figure out which tier is which, and what the copays would be.

Vivian Ho: and of course it gets the hospitals really upset.

Dan: The folks in Massachusetts had a ton of leverage that most employers don't have: 

Elena Prager says they represented a huge chunk of the insurance market like a twelfth of it. Enough business that it was worth insurance companies' while to put in the work.

But now, Vivian Ho has her eye on a couple of new services that are promising to do something similar.

One is actually a subsidiary of everybody's favorite insurance company: United Healthcare. They make an app called Surest.

Surest Ad: It's easy to shop for a vacation rental or your next flight, but when it comes to something like healthcare, not so easy. That's why Surest is a health plan, designed to be simple with clear upfront costs.

Dan: Here's how Vivian Ho describes the mechanics of this kind of app.

Vivian Ho: Doctor tells you you need to go get an MRI, you punch an MRI, the app knows where you live, and it says, here's a list of providers where you can go get an MRI. And then if you go to this particular place, there's no copay and there's actually no deductible, and then if you go to this MRI place, well, you know, there's gonna be a $25 copay or a $50 copay. Yeah. Isn't that kind of mind blowing?

Dan: I tell her: That sounds like I would want that if I trusted that the place that costs my employer less is, you know, gonna take good care of me.

Vivian Ho: Right. Well that's why I'm trying to get funding to do an analysis to look at the spending and quality implications of using one of these apps.

Dan: That is: Do people using these apps end up choosing lower-cost providers? AND: Do they get good care when they do?

Vivian Ho wants to study that. But first she needs to study something else. 

Vivian Ho: All of these apps and price shopping applications, they all depend on having the correct data. Now, the insurers are required to disclose this information by federal rules. It is slowly coming out. It's not all there yet, but no one's actually looked to see whether it's accurate.

Dan: Oh.

Vivian Ho: So there's been a lot of focus on, is the price there or is it not there, but not is it the price that the patient is actually getting billed.

Dan: And this is why Vivian Ho wants our hospital bills. 

Because: Whether or not one particular strategy is gonna pan out, the data itself contains ammunition. One hospital gets paid twice as much as the ones across the street? 

I mean, that's information I want out in the open, and getting put to use. 

But that information can only be useful if we know the data is accurate. And right now, there's no way to know. 

Insurers are publishing big data sets, but how do we *know* somebody at the insurance company didn't just go to Chat GPT and say, ""Make me a giant spreadsheet with these fields on it?""

Vivian Ho says if she has enough ACTUAL bills — a thousand would be good, three thousand would be great — she can check. 

Actually, even better: She wants your itemized bill and, if she can get it, the paperwork you get from your insurance company about what they paid. The thing that says ""This is not a bill."" It's an ""explanation of benefits"" — or EOB for short.

And, she recognizes, this isn't a TINY ask.

Vivian Ho: I realize it's time consuming. It does, you know, because you gotta sit down. It's like, what's my password and log in, and then you've gotta, you know, find one of these EOBs.

Dan: Oh, and you've gotta cover up all your personally identifying information.

Vivian Ho: We don't wanna see your your name and address and so, you know, it takes time to you, you can sort of print these out and use a Sharpie and cross them out.

Dan: It does sound like a huge drag, but I'm here to tell you: I did it. And it took me maybe five minutes.

I don't know how Vivian Ho's specific strategy will play out, and honestly, neither does she.

Vivian Ho: You know, I am going at this at sort of like many different angles.

Dan: Yeah.

Vivian Ho: So just trying to raise people's awareness of there are huge price differences. This is, this is what it takes to address the issue. 

Dan: If you've gotten a hospital bill in the last year or so, and you've got five minutes — maybe set a note on your calendar for when you DO have five minutes? — I'd love it if you gave this a shot. 

Grab a sharpie, fire up your printer, dig up your login. Print out a bill and an EOB, scratch out your identifying information, take a picture on your phone — wow, this is sounding long, but honestly, it took me five minutes — so do those things, and send the images to [email protected]. 

Vivian Ho's got researchers standing by.

Coming up on this show: We're gonna take some time as the year ends, to look at some things that DIDN'T suck in 2025. 

Which basically means: Places where state governments stepped in to protect us from ripoff prices. Which, it turns out, happened! 

News archive 1: Oregonians burdened by medical bills may soon get a break on their credit scores.

News archive 2: New law aimed at protecting Maine consumers from the impacts of medical debt goes into effect.

News archive 3: Tonight Indiana governor Mike Braun signs 10 health care-related bills into law.

Dan: Happened enough that it'll take more than just one episode to give you a good sample.

That's next time on An Arm and a Leg.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","USC researchers map genetic architecture of the human corpus callosum","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251104/USC-researchers-map-genetic-architecture-of-the-human-corpus-callosum.aspx","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:36:00 GMT","

For the first time, a research team led by the Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) at the Keck School of Medicine of USC has mapped the genetic architecture of a crucial part of the human brain known as the corpus callosum-the thick band of nerve fibers that connects the brain's left and right hemispheres. The findings open new pathways for discoveries about mental illness, neurological disorders and other diseases related to defects in this part of the brain.

The corpus callosum is critical for nearly everything the brain does, from coordinating the movement of our limbs in sync to integrating sights and sounds, to higher-order thinking and decision-making. Abnormalities in its shape and size have long been linked to disorders such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson's disease. Until now, the genetic underpinnings of this vital structure remained largely unknown.

In the new study, published in Nature Communications, the team analyzed brain scans and genetic data from over 50,000 people, ranging from childhood to late adulthood, with the help of a new tool the team created that leverages artificial intelligence.

We developed an AI tool that finds the corpus callosum in different types of brain MRI scans and automatically takes its measurements.""

Shruti P. Gadewar, co-first author of the study and research specialist at the Stevens INI

Using this tool, the researchers identified dozens of genetic regions that influence the size and thickness of the corpus callosum and its subregions.

""These findings provide a genetic blueprint for one of the brain's most essential communication pathways,"" said Ravi R. Bhatt, PhD, co-first author of the study and a post-doctoral scholar at the Stevens INI's Imaging Genetics Center. ""By uncovering how specific genes shape the corpus callosum and its subregions, we can start to understand why differences in this structure are linked to various mental health and neurological conditions at a molecular level.""

The study revealed that different sets of genes govern the area versus the thickness of the corpus callosum-two features that change across the lifespan and play distinct roles in brain function. Several of the implicated genes are active during prenatal brain development, particularly in processes like cell growth, programmed cell death, and the wiring of nerve fibers across hemispheres.

""This work demonstrates the power of using AI and large-scale databases to uncover the genetic factors driving brain development,"" said Neda Jahanshad, PhD, associate professor of neurology and senior author. ""By linking genetics to brain structure, we gain critical insight into the biological pathways that may underlie psychiatric and neurological diseases.""

Notably, the study found genetic overlap between the corpus callosum and the cerebral cortex-the outer layer of the brain responsible for memory, attention, and language-as well as with conditions such as ADHD and bipolar disorder.

""These connections underscore that the same genetic factors shaping the brain's communication bridge may also contribute to vulnerabilities for certain disorders,"" Jahanshad added.

Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI, emphasized the broader implications of this research. ""This study is a landmark in understanding how our brains are built. It not only sheds light on normal brain development but also helps us identify new avenues for diagnosing and potentially treating disorders that affect millions worldwide.""

The researchers have made their new AI-based tool publicly available to accelerate future discoveries. The software, developed at the Stevens INI, uses advanced machine learning to identify and measure the corpus callosum from MRI scans automatically. This approach allows scientists to analyze brain structure at an unprecedented scale and level of precision, reducing years of manual work to just hours.

The Stevens INI has become a global leader in applying artificial intelligence to neuroscience, developing tools that are freely shared with the research community. By combining massive datasets with cutting-edge computational methods, the institute is transforming how scientists study brain health and disease.

""Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing brain research, and Stevens INI is at the forefront of that revolution,"" said Toga. ""By pioneering AI tools and making them widely available, we're empowering scientists around the world to unlock new discoveries about the brain far faster than ever before.""

In addition to Bhatt, Gadewar and Jahanshad, the study's other authors include Ankush Shetty, Iyad Ba Gari, Elizabeth Haddad,Shayan Javid, Abhinaav Ramesh, Elnaz Nourollahimoghadam, Alyssa H. Zhu, Christiaan de Leeuw, Paul M. Thompson, and Sarah E. Medland.

A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham shows that patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCI) are at a higher risk of developing a myriad of chronic health problems, regardless of age, location of the injury and prior health status. Their results are published in JAMA Network Open.

The journey doesn't end when patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries leave the hospital or rehab. Programs should be implemented to identify patients at risk so that we can better manage their chronic care and address health issues that put patients at higher risk of death.""

Saef Izzy, MD, FAAN, FNCS, corresponding author, neurologist, Department of Neurology at Mass General Brigham

Izzy reported that patients with TSCI were returning to the clinics with conditions such as hypertension, stroke, depression and diabetes, but it was unclear how common these conditions were among people with TSCI. While more immediate complications from TSCI-such as difficulty breathing, uncontrolled blood pressure, and heart rate problems-are well known few studies have looked at long-term health consequences for these patients.

With this in mind, researchers evaluated the long-term risk of cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions in patients with TSCI, comparing rates to a control group of people who had not sustained this type of injury. Using data from Mass General Brigham and the University of California (UC) Health System, the researchers analyzed hospital-based registries from January 1996 to January 2024. The study included 1,038 patients with TSCI from Mass General Brigham and 1,711 patients with TSCI from UC. Over a follow-up period of up to 20 years, the researchers documented the incidence of chronic conditions and death in the patient group. These data were used to compare outcomes with matched control subjects without spinal cord injury.

Compared with controls, patients with a history of TSCI had significantly higher risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, and diabetes, along with other neurologic and psychiatric conditions. TSCI was associated with an increased risk of death, even in previously healthy patients.

This study relied on established medical codes to identify patient conditions. While there is a strong correlation between codes and new diagnoses, the authors note that they excluded patients with pre-existing conditions, which means their results may be more applicable to individuals who were healthier at the beginning of the study period. This could mean that the results underestimate how common chronic conditions are among patients who have had a TSCI.

""These findings highlight the need for proactive and multidisciplinary long-term care strategies,"" Izzy said. ""Future studies are needed to identify effective interventions to reduce the burden of chronic disease among patients who have had a TSCI.""

Research on human brain organoids (HBOs) is directly challenging how biobanks and biomedical institutes recruit volunteers. That is what a new study by Japanese researchers in Frontiers in Genetics concludes after finding that the Japanese public overwhelmingly rejects the common practice of broad consent when their donated cells could be used to create HBOs. This attitude jeopardizes recruitment and calls for an alternative form of consent that follows the project-specific consent model.

Researchers can culture donor-derived cells in the laboratories to create three-dimensional, self-organizing structures that closely mimic human brain development. These are known as HBOs. While they offer unprecedented insight into neurological diseases, the technology is not without ethical issues.

HBOs are fraught with controversy, because it is believed with future research that they will develop the capacity to think and have consciousness. It is not unreasonable to conclude that donors could not have imagined this possibility when consenting to donate their cells to science.""

Tsutomu Sawai, one of the authors of the study, Hiroshima University Professor (Special Recognition) 

Currently, donors typically provide broad consent, agreeing to have their cells used for a wide range of future experiments, including those not possible at the time of donation.To test public attitudes towards HBO research, Sawai and his colleagues conducted a survey on HBOs recruiting over 300 Japanese residents. Notably, they found that more than 90% of participants were unaware of HBOs prior to the survey.After an explanation about this biological technology, the team asked the participants for their willingness to donate cells under the current broad consent model. The public response suggested a need for change: nearly three-quarters of respondents expressing serious hesitation or outright refusal, with 36% outright refusing to donate their cells under broad consent and another 37% saying their willingness would depend on specific conditions, such as the purpose and ethical use of the cells. Only 15% were willing to give broad consent after learning about HBOs.An analysis of the reasons for this reluctance indicates that for morally complex areas of research, donors prioritize understanding the purpose, potential benefit, and ethical safeguards of the research, as well as the trustworthiness of researchers, before volunteering their cells. These findings are consistent with interviews and workshops on HBOs taken in European countries and the US, making this a global challenge for current practices in cell donation.

To maintain public trust and a vital donor pool, the study concludes that organizations relying on volunteers offering cell samples should adopt project-specific consent for ethically sensitive research topics.""This consent empowers the donors with the decision only after fully understanding the details of the research,"" Hiroshima University Contributing Associate Professor Masanori Kataoka said. ""Importantly, it respects the moral view of the donor, which we believe is more likely to encourage donations.""

A hidden structure inside the cell is rewriting how scientists understand leukemia. Beneath the microscope, what looked like disorder turned out to follow a simple physical rule – one that connects several major mutations behind the disease.

In new research from Baylor College of Medicine, scientists have discovered that different genetic drivers of leukemia use the same secret compartments inside the cell nucleus to keep cancer growing. The finding points to a shared physical target that could inspire new kinds of treatments.

The work reshapes a long-standing view of how a common leukemia begins and offers a fresh way to design therapies that strike a single weakness shared across distinct genetic forms of the disease.

Leukemia starts when mutations in blood-forming cells disrupt the balance between growth and differentiation. Patients with entirely different genetic changes show strikingly similar patterns of gene activity and can respond to the same drugs.

What invisible thread could make so many mutations behave the same way?

To find out, the Riback and Goodell labs at Baylor joined forces. Dr. Joshua Riback, an assistant professor and CPRIT Scholar who studies how proteins form droplets through a process known as phase separation, teamed with Dr. Margaret “Peggy” Goodell, Baylor's chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and a pioneer in understanding how blood stem cells give rise to leukemia. Together, they set out to follow the physics hidden inside cancer's chemistry.

Then came the moment of clarity. Graduate student Gandhar Datar, co-mentored by Riback and Goodell, peered into Riback's high-resolution microscope and saw something no one expected: leukemia cell nuclei shimmered with a dozen bright dots – tiny beacons missing from healthy cells.

Those dots weren't random. They contained large amounts of mutant leukemia proteins and drew in many normal cell proteins to coordinate activation of the leukemia program. The dots were new nuclear compartments formed by phase separation, the same physical principle that describes why oil droplets form in water. The team named this new compartment, “coordinating bodies,” or C-bodies.

Inside the nucleus, these C-bodies act like miniature control rooms, pulling together the molecules that keep leukemia genes switched on. Like drops of oil collecting on the surface of soup, they appear when the cell's molecular ingredients reach just the right balance.

Even more surprising, cells carrying entirely different leukemia mutations formed droplets with the same behavior. Although their chemistry differs, the resulting nuclear condensates perform the same function, using the same physical playbook.

A new quantitative assay developed in the Riback lab confirmed it. These droplets are biophysically indistinguishable – like soups made from different ingredients that still simmer into the same consistency. No matter which mutation started the process, each leukemia formed the same kind of C-body.

It was astonishing. All these different leukemia drivers, each with its own recipe, ended up cooking the same droplet, or condensate. That's what unites these leukemias and gives us a common target. If we understand the biophysics of the C-body, its general recipe, we'll know how to dissolve it and reveal new insights for targeting many leukemias.”

Dr. Joshua Riback, assistant professor and CPRIT Scholar

The team confirmed the finding across human cell lines, mouse models and patient samples. When they tweaked the proteins so they could no longer form these droplets – or dissolved them with drugs, the leukemia cells stopped dividing and began to mature into healthy blood cells.

“Seeing C-bodies in patient samples made the link crystal clear,” said co-author Elmira Khabusheva, a postdoctoral associate in the Goodell lab. “By putting existing drugs into the context of the C-body, we can see why they work across different leukemias and start designing new ones that target the condensate itself. It's like finally seeing the whole forest instead of just the trees.”

“By identifying a shared nuclear structure that all these mutations depend on, we connect basic biophysics to clinical leukemia,” added Goodell. “It means we can target the structure itself – a new way of thinking about therapy.”

“Across every model we studied, the pattern was the same,” Datar said. “Once we saw those bright dots, we knew we were looking at something fundamental.”

The discovery of C-bodies gives leukemia a physical address a structure scientists can now see, touch and target. It provides a simple physical explanation for how different mutations converge on the same disease and points to treatments aimed at dissolving the droplets that cancer depends on – like skimming the fat from a soup to restore its balance.

This finding sets up a new paradigm for linking droplet-forming disease drivers into shared, generalizable therapeutic targets, revealing that just as distinct mutations in leukemia converge on the same condensate, other diseases, such as ALS, may each assemble their own biophysically indistinguishable droplets governed by the same physical rules.

The discovery was made possible through collaboration between the Riback and Goodell labs at Baylor College of Medicine and international partners including the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC), the Trond Mohn Foundation and the Norwegian Cancer Society.

The study, led by Gandhar Datar and Elmira Khabusheva, appears in the journal Cell.

The study is the largest of its kind in this population, and is published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health. It was led by scientists at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and University College London, with support from the BHF Data Science Centre at Health Data Research UK.

Our whole-population study during the pandemic showed that although these conditions were rare, children and young people were more likely to experience heart, vascular or inflammatory problems after a COVID-19 infection than after having the vaccine - and the risks after infection lasted much longer.""

Dr. Alexia Sampri, Principal Author, University of Cambridge

The research team uncovered these findings by analyzing linked electronic health records (EHRs) for nearly 14 million children in England under the age of 18 between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2022, covering 98% of this population. During this period, 3.9 million children and young people had a first COVID-19 diagnosis. And 3.4 million had a first COVID-19 BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine, the main vaccine used in 5-18-year-olds during the study period.

All personal information that could identify individuals had been stripped away, and approved researchers accessed this data entirely within the NHS England Secure Data Environment (SDE), a secure data and analysis platform.

The study looked at short- and long-term risks of rare complications including arterial and venous thrombosis (clots in blood vessels), thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets in the blood), myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue respectively), and inflammatory conditions after COVID-19 diagnosis or vaccination.

After a first COVID-19 diagnosis, risks of the five conditions studied were highest in the first four weeks and, for several conditions, stayed higher for up to 12 months, compared to children and young people without or before a diagnosis.

In contrast, after COVID-19 vaccination, the team only saw a short-term higher risk in myocarditis or pericarditis in the first four weeks, compared to children and young people without or before vaccination. After that, the risk returned to the same level as the start of the study period.

Over six months, the research team estimated that COVID-19 infection led to 2.24 extra cases of myocarditis or pericarditis per 100,000 children and young people who had COVID-19. In those who were vaccinated, there were only 0.85 extra cases per 100,000 children and young people.

Previous research showed that children and young people diagnosed with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing conditions like myocarditis, pericarditis, and thrombocytopenia, compared to their peers who hadn't had a COVID-19 diagnosis.

While many studies show that COVID-19 vaccines can help children to avoid severe illness and hospitalization, some also report rare cases of myocarditis in young people shortly after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for mRNA-based vaccines.

However, there hasn't been any research directly comparing the longer-term risks of both COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccinations in children and young people until now.

Co-author Professor Pia Hardelid, UCL and National Institute of Health and Care Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, said:

""Parents and carers have faced difficult choices throughout the pandemic. By building a stronger evidence base on both infection and vaccination outcomes, we hope to support families and healthcare professionals to make decisions grounded in the best available data.""

Co-author Professor Angela Wood, University of Cambridge and Associate Director at the BHF Data Science Centre, said:

""Using electronic health records from all children and young people in England, we were able to study very rare but serious heart and clotting complications, and found higher and longer-lasting risks after COVID-19 infection than after vaccination. Whilst vaccine-related risks are likely to remain rare and short-lived, future risks following infection could change as new variants emerge and immunity shifts. That's why whole-population health data monitoring remains essential to guide vaccine and other important public health decisions.""

Co-author Professor William Whiteley, University of Edinburgh and Associate Director at the BHF Data Science Centre, said:

""Parents, young people, and children need reliable information to make decisions about their health. Data from hospitals and GP practices are an important part of the picture because tell us all what has happened to people looked after in the NHS. Here we have shown that during the pandemic, risks of myocarditis and inflammatory illnesses were low for children and young people, and that they were less after COVID-19 vaccination than after COVID-19 infection.""

The rates of bloodstream infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria will increase substantially across Europe in the next five years, driven largely by aging populations, according to a new paper published November 4th in the open-access journal PLOS Medicine by Gwenan Knight of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, and colleagues.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health crisis. To effectively target interventions and track progress toward international goals, accurately estimating how the AMR burden will change over time is necessary.

In the new study, researchers analyzed data from more than 12 million routine blood tests for bacterial infection susceptibility in 29 European countries between 2010 and 2019. They used these data to generate incidence rates of these infections and predict how rates of drug-resistant bloodstream infections may change through 2050, accounting for projected population changes.

The researchers found that bloodstream infection rates are predicted to increase, with varying burdens by country and by bacteria-antibiotic combination. Rates are expected to rise more in men than women across six of the eight bacteria studied, and are projected to increase more dramatically in older age groups (74+ years) while stabilizing or declining in younger populations. Models that don't account for age and sex may miss a large part of the future burden, especially among men and older adults, the authors note. Even with strong public health interventions, achieving a 10% reduction in resistant infections by 2030 (aligned with UN targets) was only possible for about two-thirds of bacteria-antibiotic combinations, the study concluded.

Gwenan Knight adds, ""Our study shows that the future burden of drug-resistant infections won't be uniform-there will be substantial differences between countries, as well as across age groups and between sexes. We see the steepest increases in incidence projected in older age groups, particularly the over 65s, meaning that simply preventing further rises in resistant bloodstream infections would already be a major public health achievement."" 

""What I found most interesting was bringing together different strands of data to show the bigger picture. Age and sex are still rarely considered in antimicrobial resistance projections, yet they make a real difference to who is most affected. Combining these factors with demographic and infection trends really highlighted how challenging it will be to reverse the steady rise in bloodstream infections across Europe."" 

Coauthor Catrin Moore states, ""This is a fantastic step forward in understanding the way that age and sex will influence the burden of drug-resistant infections in different European countries in the coming years. This will help us design intervention studies focusing on the populations most at risk in the future to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with drug resistant infections.""

Recently, a team led by Academician Hongjie Zhang, Researcher Shuyan Song, Associate Researcher Pengpeng Lei, and Dr. Ran An at the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed an innovative strategy to construct a series of biodegradable cesium nanosalts. These nanosalts activate anti-tumor immunity by inducing pyroptosis and metabolic intervention. The nanosalts induce ion endocytosis in tumor cells using a Trojan horse strategy, disrupting intracellular ion homeostasis, causing a surge in osmotic pressure, and ultimately triggering pyroptosis. Cesium ions (Cs+) can inhibit the ion channel activity of sodium/glucose cotransporters, hindering glucose transport. The introduction of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) not only amplifies pyroptosis but also initiates immunogenic ferroptosis. The multiple effects of the nanosalts lead to the release of damage-related molecular patterns, thereby activating a robust anti-tumor immune response. The article was published as an open access research article in CCS Chemistry, the flagship journal of the Chinese Chemical Society.

Nanosalts, as an important branch of excellent tumor therapeutic agents, deserve full recognition for their value. Nanosalts can bypass ion pumps/channels and enter cells via plasma membrane endocytosis. Due to their high water solubility, nanosalts gradually dissolve and release ions. When these ions accumulate to a certain concentration, they disrupt ion homeostasis. Simultaneously, due to the reverse osmotic gradient formed across the plasma membrane, these ions are trapped inside the cell, leading to a sharp increase in osmotic pressure. The resulting cell lysis is not only a physical process but also involves the pyroptosis-mediated pathway. Cell swelling and cytoplasmic efflux release large amounts of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultimately triggering a strong inflammatory response that reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, causing its regression. Once recognized by phagocytosis-related receptors, DAMPs can promote antigen presentation, induce widespread immune cell infiltration, and activate anti-tumor immune responses.

However, compared with other nanomaterials, the library of nanosalts is still not rich enough, and many soluble electrolytes have not yet been nanoscaled. Developing novel preparation strategies and expanding the library of nanosalts, especially nanosalts with ion-interference therapeutic functions, is particularly important for addressing the challenges of treating malignant tumors.

In this study, the authors achieved the directed synthesis of cesium-based nanosalts and used cesium bromide nanosalts as a proof-of-concept to conduct research on pyroptosis-based tumor immunotherapy. The main highlights of this work include: 1) the development of a novel method for synthesizing cesium-based nanosalts, allowing for wide-range control of nanosalt size; 2) the nanosalts utilize a ""Trojan horse"" strategy to overcome ion channel barriers, delivering ions into the cell via endocytosis, inducing a surge in osmotic pressure and triggering pyroptosis, releasing DAMPs, and activating a systemic anti-tumor immune response; 3) Cs+ can interfere with the plasma membrane potential, inhibiting glucose uptake by affecting the function of sodium/glucose cotransporters, thereby disrupting tumor metabolic homeostasis; 4) the dietary nutrient DHA not only enhances the pyroptosis effect but also induces immunogenic ferroptosis, forming a dual synergistic therapeutic mechanism; and 5) the anti-tumor immune response of the nanosalts was systematically verified through in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating their significant ability to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis.

In summary, this work successfully constructed a biodegradable cesium-based nanosalt system, developing a remarkable anti-tumor immunotherapeutic agent. Through liposome encapsulation technology, the pyroptosis inducer DHA was successfully loaded while simultaneously regulating the ion dissolution and release rate, forming a complete therapeutic system. This nanosalt overcomes ion channel limitations, employing a ""Trojan horse"" strategy to induce ion endocytosis in tumor cells, disrupting intracellular ion homeostasis, triggering an osmotic pressure surge, and leading to pyroptosis. DHA not only enhances the pyroptosis effect but also induces a synergistic effect of ferroptosis. Intracellularly released cesium ions interfere with the function of sodium-glucose cotransporters, inhibiting glucose uptake and thus disrupting metabolic balance. Under the synergistic effect of multiple pathways, a large amount of DAMPs are released, successfully activating the in vivo anti-tumor immune response. On the one hand, it promotes the maturation of lymph node dendritic cells, mediating downstream immune responses by regulating T cell proliferation; on the other hand, it drives a large infiltration of immune cells, effectively inhibiting tumor proliferation and metastasis. This study confirms that nanosalts are highly promising anti-tumor agents, and the development of next-generation nanosalts provides a reliable pathway for efficient tumor treatment.

These results were published as a research article in CCS Chemistry. Academician Hongjie Zhang, Researcher Shuyan Song, Associate Researcher Pengpeng Lei, and Dr. Ran An from Changchun Institute of AppliedChemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences are the corresponding authors, and Pengye Du is the first author.

University of Queensland researchers have captured the first high-resolution images of the yellow fever virus (YFV), a potentially deadly viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that affects the liver.

They've revealed structural differences between the vaccine strain (YFV-17D) and the virulent, disease-causing strains of the virus.

Dr. Summa Bibby from UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience said despite decades of research on yellow fever, this was the first time a complete 3D structure of a fully mature yellow fever virus particle had been recorded at near-atomic resolution.

By utilizing the well-established Binjari virus platform developed here at UQ, we combined yellow fever's structural genes with the backbone of the harmless Binjari virus and produced virus particles that could be safely examined with a cryo-electron microscope.

The particles of the vaccine strain had a smooth and stable surface layer, while the particles of the virulent strain had bumpy uneven surfaces.""

Dr. Summa Bibby from UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience

The differences change how the body's immune system recognises the virus.

""The bumpier, irregular surface of the virulent strains exposes parts of the virus that are normally hidden, allowing certain antibodies to attach more easily,"" Dr Bibby said.

""The smooth vaccine particles keep those regions covered, making them harder for particular antibodies to reach.""

Yellow fever is a major public health concern in parts of South America and Africa and with no approved antiviral treatments, vaccination is the primary means of prevention.

Professor Daniel Watterson said the discovery provides crucial new insights into yellow fever biology and opens the door to improved vaccine design and antiviral strategies for it and other orthoflaviviruses.

""The yellow fever vaccine remains effective against modern strains and seeing the virus in such fine detail lets us better understand why the vaccine strain behaves the way it does,"" Professor Watterson.

""We can now pinpoint the structural features that make the current vaccine safe and effective.

""The findings could even inform future vaccine design for related viruses like dengue, Zika and West Nile.""

The research was published in Nature Communications.

An Osaka Metropolitan University team has used stem cells extracted from adipose, the body's fatty tissue, to treat spine fractures in rats similar to those caused by osteoporosis in humans. These cells offer the advantages of being easy to collect, even from elderly individuals, and causing little stress to the body, suggesting a non-invasive way of treating bone diseases.

Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become brittle and prone to fractures. Due to the aging of the population, the number of patients in Japan is estimated to exceed 15 million in the near future. Among osteoporosis-related fractures, compression fractures of the spine, known as osteoporotic vertebral fractures, are the most common type of fracture and pose a serious problem, leading to a need for long-term care and a significant decline in quality of life.

Stem cells taken from adipose tissue (ADSCs) are a possible solution to this problem. These cells are multipotent, meaning that they can be differentiated into many different cell types. Forming ADSCs into three-dimensional spherical clusters, known as spheroids, has been reported to enhance their ability to repair tissue. When these spheroids are pre-differentiated toward bone cells, their capacity to promote bone healing is enhanced.

An Osaka Metropolitan University-led research team involving Graduate School of Medicine student Yuta Sawada and Dr. Shinji Takahashi focused on ADSCs for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The ADSCs were developed into bone-differentiated spheroids and combined with β-tricalcium phosphate, a material widely used for bone reconstruction, to successfully treat rats with spinal fractures.

Bone regeneration and strength were significantly improved in rats transplanted with the complex. They also found that the genes involved in bone formation and regeneration were also activated.

This study has revealed the potential of bone differentiation spheroids using ADSCs for the development of new treatments for spinal fractures. Since the cells are obtained from fat, there is little burden on the body, ensuring patient safety."".

Yuta Sawada, student, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University

""This simple and effective method can treat even difficult fractures and may accelerate healing,"" Dr. Takahashi added. ""This technique is expected to become a new treatment that helps extend the healthy life of patients.""

The study was published in Bone & Joint Research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","UCLA experts call for individualized heart monitoring in breast cancer survivors","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251104/UCLA-experts-call-for-individualized-heart-monitoring-in-breast-cancer-survivors.aspx","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:47:00 GMT","

As breast cancer survival rates continue to climb - 4.3 million women in the U.S. are currently living with a history of the disease and in the next 10 years that number is expected to rise by another million - heart health has become an increasingly important part of survivorship care. 

Certain breast cancer therapies, while lifesaving, can also place stress on the heart, raising important questions about who might benefit from closer monitoring.

But does every breast cancer survivor need to see a cardiologist?

A new editorial published in JAMA Oncology and led by UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center investigators Patricia Ganz, MD, a distinguished professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and Eric Yang, MD, director and founder of the UCLA Cardio-Oncology Program, says the answer is more nuanced than many might expect. 

""Current cardio-oncology guidelines recommend cardiac imaging during and immediately following systemic cancer therapies in breast cancer and other malignant neoplasms, but long-term surveillance with these approaches has not been evaluated and evidence-based guidelines are lacking,"" the UCLA authors write. Biomarker tests, such as B-type natriuretic peptide, show promise, but their usefulness in cancer survivors remains uncertain. 

Some breast cancer therapies, including anthracycline chemotherapy and HER2-targeted drugs like Herceptin (trastuzumab), are known to stress the heart in certain patients. For years, doctors have monitored patients during treatment to catch early signs of heart dysfunction.

However, it's unclear how long survivors should continue to be monitored once treatment ends, and whether all survivors would benefit from seeing a cardiologist.

In the editorial, Dr. Ganz and Dr. Yang evaluated a study that introduced a new tool to help pinpoint which breast cancer survivors face the highest chances of developing heart failure or cardiomyopathy in the decade following treatment. The team created a risk calculator using real-world clinical data from more than 26,000 breast cancer patients within an integrated health care system in Southern California.

The findings revealed that while certain breast cancer treatments, including anthracycline chemotherapy and HER2-targeted drugs, did increase risk, most women do not go on to develop serious cardiac disease. Instead, the strongest predictors had less to do with cancer and more to do with overall health.

Most women 65 years and older included in the study were at high risk of heart disease, independent of cancer therapy. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and a history of heart disease contributed more to a woman's long-term heart outlook than the chemotherapy regimen did. 

The authors also found that cancer treatment alone rarely pushed younger women into a high-risk category, with few women younger than 40 at the time of diagnosis at increased risk, suggesting that routine long-term cardiac imaging for all survivors may not be warranted.

""It depends!"" said Dr. Ganz and Dr. Yang. 

Women who may benefit from seeing a cardiologist include those who received higher-risk chemotherapy, developed heart issues during treatment, are older or have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, or report symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue or swelling.

Instead of blanket heart screening for every survivor, the editorial highlights the importance of essentials: controlling blood pressure, managing cholesterol, maintaining a healthy weight and knowing early warning signs of heart disease.

For most survivors, regular visits with a primary care clinician, combined with an oncologist's input, may be sufficient. 

""What all breast cancer survivors need is access to primary care that focuses on prevention or management of established cardiac risk factors, as well as regular clinical assessment of their functioning,"" wrote Dr. Ganz and Dr. Yang. ""With attention to cardiac prevention and control, heart failure/cardiomyopathy is less likely to occur.""

A recent study from Houston Methodist sheds light on how Alzheimer's disease may contribute to larger health issues by hijacking the body's ability to regulate its metabolism. Researchers have discovered that along with the negative effects an Alzheimer's diagnosis brings, the disease can also sabotage messages between nerves and blood vessels in fat tissue, which can worsen heart and metabolic conditions such as stroke, heart disease and diabetes.

The first-of-its-kind research, ""Alzheimer's disease disrupts intra-adipose neurovascular contact,"" appears in the Journal of Lipid Research and highlights a previously underexplored aspect of Alzheimer's: its potential to cause dysfunction of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system extending beyond the brain. Led by Stephen Wong, Ph.D., the John S. Dunn Presidential Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Engineering, the study was conducted by his team at Houston Methodist, including key contributors Li Yang, Ph.D., a research associate, and Jianting Sheng, Ph.D., an assistant research professor of computational biology and mathematics in radiology.

Utilizing three-dimensional imaging and focusing on body fat in mouse models, the study's high-resolution images provide a groundbreaking visual perspective revealing how the disease changes the structure of nerve and blood vessel bundles. These include the sympathetic nerves and blood vessels which play a critical role in regulating fat metabolism through hormonal and neural signaling.

By disrupting the connection between the nervous system and fat tissue, the disease may impair the body's ability to manage energy.""

Li Yang, Ph.D., research associate

This disturbance could help explain why individuals with Alzheimer's often experience issues such as stroke, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and other health troubles alongside cognitive decline.

""These insights open new avenues for research into how treating or preventing autonomic dysfunction might improve overall health outcomes for people with Alzheimer's,"" said Wong and Sheng.

Sam Coffey is a woman of many talents, as we learn in this giggle-filled and thoughtful episode of the U.S. Soccer Podcast.

Straight from October camp with the U.S. Women's National Team, the USWNT and Portland Thorns midfielder talks about the team's preparations heading into next year's qualifying matches for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup in Brazil (0:30) and how she saw this young group come together to earn back-to-back wins against Portugal on Oct. 26 (where Coffey scored a late goal) and New Zealand on Oct. 29. 

Then, host and former Thorns teammate Meghan Klingenberg asks Coffey about her distinctive, on-field style (4:20) which features an iconic scrunchie and tucked-in shirt, and how she defines joy (10:00). Coffey shares the pride she feels being part of a family of artists and creators and how that inspired her many, many hobbies outside of soccer (17:00), including playing piano (36:19). Finally, the two end their conversation on a positive note with reflections on their friendship.

SETUBAL, Portugal – A combined team of U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team players (born in 2007) and U.S. Under-18 Youth National Team players (born in 2008) drew host Portugal, 3-3, in a wild back-and-forth match to conclude the trip to Europe.

Portugal scored first in the 36th minute before the USA tallied twice in the final five minutes plus stoppage time of the first half to take a 2-1 lead into the break. The teams then combined for three goals in a six-minute span in the middle of the second half with Portugal equalizing, the USA taking the lead and then Portugal equalizing again.

Portugal midfielder Carolina Tristao started the scoring, looping a shot over U.S. goalkeeper Josie Biehl to give her side the lead.

Audrey McKeen, who scored the game-winner in the 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland on Oct. 25, then equalized in the 40th minute and put the USA ahead in the first minute of stoppage time to complete her brace.

Portugal forward Matilde Nave tied the game in the 60th minute, running onto a through ball up the middle before finishing, but just three minutes later, Kimmi Ascanio put the USA ahead on a header from an Anna Babcock cross.

The lead was short-lived as just two minutes after Ascanio's goal, Portugal's Cristina Fernandes finished her one-on-one chance for the final scoreline.

For Ascanio, who had seven goals in 19 caps at the U-17 level, this was her first international goal with the U-19s. McKeen upped her U-19 international goal total to three in just two caps.

The USA outshot Ireland 12-7, but Portugal found the net on three of its four shots on goal.

Of the 20 players called up for this roster by U-19 WNT head coach Carrie Kveton, 12 were born in 2008 and eight were born in 2007.

The roster for this trip featured one professional player in Ascanio, one amateur player from the USL Super League in defender Alexa Strickler of Fort Lauderdale United FC and five college players: goalkeeper Lizzie Thornton from Wake Forest, defender Ella Bard from Louisville, midfielders Olivia Belcher and Paige Thompson, both from Alabama, and midfielder Adia Symmonds from Mississippi State. The remainder of the roster represents 11 different youth clubs.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2006, are age-eligible for next year's 2026 FIFA Women's U-20 World Cup in Poland, meaning all 20 players in camp are training and playing for a shot at that tournament.

The camp is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Heather O'Reilly and Jeff Kassouf react to Trinity Rodman's knee injury ahead of the USWNT camp. (2:17)

The group of players that will lead the U.S. women's national team at the 2027 Women's World Cup is coming into focus.

Head coach Emma Hayes had said prior to the recent October window that the group she called up would likely be the one she sees most ready to contribute on the road to World Cup qualifying. That young, inexperienced squad got battle-tested in a surprising 2-1 loss to Portugal on Oct. 23.

Hayes learned plenty from that game, and the ensuing victories over Portugal (in a rematch) and New Zealand -- more than she would have in a comfortable victory for the USWNT. But her dilemma remains, and thus returns our USWNT big board for the first time in months with its usual question: If the World Cup started today, who would make the roster?

For this exercise, players with long-term injuries or absences would not make the squad. Nobody (including this writer) is betting against forwards Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson reclaiming their starting roles after maternity leave, for example, but to borrow a phrase from Hayes, you can only work with who is available right now.

The timing of our latest exercise also adds an interesting, real-life wrinkle that Hayes could face in 18 months: Does she bring defender Naomi Girma or forward Trinity Rodman to the World Cup despite lingering injuries because they are that exceptionally talented?

Hayes has rotated and experimented heavily this year, and she reiterated recently that even players who are household names might still go play with the under-23s or even the under-20s if eligible. That makes our job harder than ever, with tiers two through four somewhat interchangeable.

We've followed Hayes' lead in trying to narrow down the names on this list (even those on the bubble and the outside) after expanding it far and wide in the spring. Here's how we define our categories:

Tier 1: Locks. Clear first-choice players who are contending for a starting role.

Tier 2: In the squad. Not necessarily starters, but substitutes and players on the bench available to go into games.

Tier 3: On the bubble. Players who have received call-ups at the senior level or with the U-23s, but who aren't necessarily making a 23-player roster.

Tier 4: Outside looking in. Players who have received call-ups at the senior level or with the U-23s, but who aren't necessarily making a 23-player roster.

- Kassouf: Why are USWNT players leaving the NWSL for Europe?
- NWSL playoff Power Rankings: Does anyone stand a chance vs. K.C.?
- USA 3-1 Portugal: Moultrie & Co. get Hayes' team back playing 'the USA way'

Locks:  Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Claudia Dickey

In the squad: Mandy McGlynn

On the bubble: Casey Murphy, Jane Campbell

Outside looking in: Aubrey Kingsbury, Mia Justus, Liz Beardsley, Leah Freeman, Neeku Purcell

USWNT goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce speaks about her experience with Man United playing in their first ever UEFA Women's Champions League campaign.

Tullis-Joyce is probably still the favorite to be the new No. 1, although Dickey continues to have something to say about that both for Seattle Reign FC and in her recent starts with the USWNT. Either way, they are both on the plane to Brazil for the World Cup.

McGlynn looks like the third goalkeeper right now, although Murphy's looming move to Boston Legacy FC could get the former No. 2 -- and once presumptive starter -- back in the picture.

For as much uncertainty as there is around who will start and whether they are ready, the trio of keepers who would make the cut right now isn't in question based on Hayes' recent decisions.

Locks: Emily Fox, Avery Patterson

In the squad: Lilly Reale

On the bubble: Gisele Thompson, Izzy Rodriguez

Outside looking in: Crystal Dunn, Evelyn Shores, Quincy McMahon

Emily Keogh believes Emily Fox is ""getting better"" as Arsenal prepare for the new WSL season vs. London City Lionesses.

Fox is a Ballon d'Or shortlisted, UEFA Women's Champions League-winning fullback. After that, Hayes is still figuring things out.

Patterson looks like the odds-on favorite to start opposite Fox right now. The 23-year-old is a dynamo at fullback when she gets forward and combines in the attack. Reale has been largely impressive in her limited time at the senior level thus far. Thompson still might have the most long-term upside of anyone, but she needs more reps at senior level.

Dunn, who was the standout fullback at the 2019 World Cup and owned the position for the USWNT for so long, has struggled to earn playing time at Paris Saint-Germain and hasn't gotten the call from Hayes recently.

Locks: Emily Sonnett, Jordyn Bugg

In the squad: Emily Sams, Naomi Girma

On the bubble: Tara McKeown, Kennedy Wesley, Eva Gaetino

Outside looking in: Kayla Sharples, Jayden Perry

Would Hayes take Girma to the World Cup even if the defender were 80% healthy? I am going with an emphatic ""yes,"" especially given how Hayes glows about her. The 25-year-old has struggled with multiple calf injuries since joining Chelsea in January, and she is only just getting back onto the team's gameday rosters, but she remains the best defender on the USWNT.

Bugg is likely her long-term partner in the position, and another defender who Hayes admires. The 19-year-old is pushing for playing time, and a senior World Cup this early in her career would provide invaluable long-term experience.

Sonnett is the lone healthy veteran on the squad, one who Hayes leans on regularly -- especially with Tierna Davidson still sidelined.

McKeown continued to show progress this NWSL season for the Washington Spirit as a forward-turned-center-back, and Emily Sams is a steady presence despite not always getting a lot of playing time.

Locks: Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, Lily Yohannes, Lindsey Heaps

In the squad: Claire Hutton

On the bubble: Jaedyn Shaw, Lo'eau LaBonta, Croix Bethune, Sam Meza

Outside looking in: Korbin Shrader, Riley Jackson, Taylor Huff, Sarah Schupansky, Abi Brighton, Gia Corley

Lianne Sanderson speaks after Lily Yohannes' performance for OL Lyonnes vs. St. Pölten in the Women's Champions League.

Clarity is emerging for the present and future of the USWNT's midfield. Yohannes plays beyond her years, Coffey is the ever-reliable soul of the squad, and Lavelle is back to being a ""magician,"" as Hayes recently described her.

Heaps is the team's captain and remains among its most tactically savvy players, but there is more competition than ever in the middle of the park. Hayes' biggest dilemma over the next 18 months is figuring out her best combination in midfield. Changing any one player disrupts the balance of the entire triumvirate, as recent games showed, and those answers will become more pressing by the day as 2027 nears.

Shaw is back in form, but progress won't be linear and she is still reintegrating into the squad. A notable change from the past window was the absence, both from the senior and U23 teams, of Shrader (nee Albert), who was part of the 2024 Olympic gold-medal winning team and who is off to a strong start with OL Lyonnes since her summer move from Paris.

And yes, that is longtime Germany youth international Gia Corley on the outside looking in. She joined the U.S. U23 camp in October as a quietly intriguing addition.

Locks: Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson

In the squad: Trinity Rodman

On the bubble: Ally Sentnor, Emma Sears, Michelle Cooper, Olivia Moultrie, Yazmeen Ryan

Outside looking in: Mia Fishel, Emeri Adames, Riley Tiernan, Maddie Dahlien, Jameese Joseph, Pietra Tordin

The Futbol W crew discuss how Catarina Macario's form last season will play a huge part in nailing down a starting place in Chelsea's midfield.

Just like Girma, we ask: Are you bringing Rodman to the World Cup if she has even a shot at playing? Yes. Yes, of course you are.

The extent of Rodman's sprained MCL is still a mystery, but we've been led to believe she could be available for the NWSL playoffs, which begin this weekend. And yes, some of us are old enough to remember the 2016 Olympics, when the logic of bringing a not-fully-fit superstar on the roster backfired. But in that case, Megan Rapinoe expedited recovery from a torn ACL, and the roster was only 18 players. This is a 23-player roster (maybe 26 by the time the tournament arrives) and Rodman has a sprained MCL. Rodman is a game changer the USWNT needs -- especially with Wilson and Swanson also absent.

Realistically, everyone outside of Macario and Thompson is on the bubble, but we have to make some tough choices. So, let's do it, shall we?

Goalkeepers: Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Claudia Dickey, Mandy McGlynn

Defenders: Emily Fox, Avery Patterson, Lilly Reale, Emily Sonnett, Naomi Girma, Emily Sams, Jordyn Bugg, Tara McKeown

Midfielders: Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, Lily Yohannes, Lindsey Heaps, Claire Hutton, Jaedyn Shaw

Forwards: Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson, Trinity Rodman, Ally Sentnor, Olivia Moultrie, Michelle Cooper

Uncertainty in defense, compounded by Girma's injury, would lead Hayes to take perhaps one more player from that group than she might like to. Sams helps add versatility, as does McKeown as both an improving center back and a late-game Swiss Army knife if the USWNT is trailing and needs a result.

Our decision to include Rodman -- and gamble on Shaw staying in form, as we think Hayes would right now -- also further squeezes the forward group, with Emma Sears and Yazmeen Ryan becoming the two most difficult cuts. Both have been bright in spurts and yes, Sears just scored a hat trick against New Zealand. But Moultrie scored a brace against Portugal, and Hayes has some tough choices to make. Moultrie is also versatile and potentially gives the USWNT a different look up top to alter tactics beyond the ""turn-and-burn"" wingers against different opponents.

Not only will the names on this roster change over time, but so will the balance of positions as some newer players establish themselves and as longtime starters return to fitness. But if Hayes' roster was due at FIFA's desk by the end of today, this is how it might look: inexperienced and experimental but talented and filled with potential.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","NWSL Playoffs Power Rankings: It's KC Current vs. the Rest of the Field","https://www.si.com/soccer/nwsl-playoffs-power-rankings-kc-current-vs-the-rest","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:21:41 GMT","

The 2025 National Women's Soccer League regular season is in the books. For eight teams, now comes the playoffs. The big dance. Crunch time.

In a single-elimination quarterfinals, semifinals and final, there is plenty of room for upsets along the way. After all, only twice in the last five years has a No. 1 seed lifted the Shield trophy and then gone on to win the championship trophy as well (North Carolina Courage in 2019 and Orlando Pride in 2024).

When evaluating the eight teams, there is a clear favorite, a presumed No. 2 and then it really feels like it is anyone's guess how to rank those final six teams. While 19 points separate the No. 1 seed from the No. 2 seed, just four points separate the No. 3 seed from the No. 8 seed. Outside of the favorites, this is a very jumbled field.

MARK YOUR CALENDARS, IT'S QUARTERFINALS TIME ⏰Presented by @madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/n4lo5QzR9V

Here are your NWSL power rankings ahead of the 2025 playoffs.

This one is easy. No contest. The Kansas City Current have been far and away the best team in the NWSL this season, boasting the best statistics for goals scored and goals conceded. They will be primed to sweep the playoffs, especially with home advantage in the quarterfinals and the semifinals (should they advance). 

Of course, there is some doubt surrounding this team because of the fitness of Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga, who suffered a hip injury against the Houston Dash a little over two weeks ago. If Chawinga isn't ready for the playoffs, then who will score the goals and lead the defensive press?

Making matters worse is Bia Zaneratto limping out of the Current's final regular season game of the season, too. General manager Caitlin Carducci has done an admirable job of assembling a deep roster, but now Kansas City will be tested with attacking starters missing.

It will certainly please manager Vlatko Andonovski to see Nichelle Prince and Haley Hopkins come off the bench and make an impact as they did last weekend.

NICHELLE'S FIRST GOAL OF THE SEASON‼️With an assist from Haley Hopkins, @nichelleprince7 finds the back of the net for her 15th career regular season goal 👏@NWSL | #KCBABY pic.twitter.com/NhzL235jBM

Despite clinching the No. 2 seed with two weeks to spare, it hasn't been the most straightforward season for the Washington Spirit. A constant stream of injuries, both big and small, to key players has meant that manager Adrian González has named an unchanged XI just once this season. The only thing constant in Washington has been rotation. 

But again, like the Current, the Spirit boast one of the highest-quality rosters in the NWSL and has weathered the storm of absences throughout 2025. A knee injury will almost certainly keep Trinity Rodman out of the quarterfinals, but the emergence of Sofia Cantore as an international star has helped to limit the loss.

The Spirit will also benefit greatly from playing at home at “Rowdy” Audi Field. This team has plenty of motivation after losing the NWSL championship final last year. And those fans will be key to igniting that extra drive to go deep into the playoffs.

Another team without its biggest star heading into the playoffs. Barbra Banda has been ruled out of the playoffs already, and the Orlando Pride's goals have declined from 1.4 per game with Banda to 1.1 without.

One solution was manager Haley Carter acting swiftly to break the transfer record and bring in Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle from UANL Tigres for $1.5 million. Ovalle has adjusted somewhat well to the NWSL and has notched one goal and two assists in her first eight games.

Even with a regression from last year's record-breaking shield and championship-winning season, the Pride remain one of the most organized and consistent off-ball teams in the NWSL. There may not be quite as much flair, but the experience in this group is unmatched. 

Probably one of the hardest teams in the NWSL to figure out. In 2025, the Portland Thorns had major availability issues and leaned on a young core of players to make a surprising climb up the standings to third place. 

In 20-year-old Olivia Moultrie's career season, with eight goals and the most key passes in the NWSL (55), she has exploded back into the U.S. women's national team. Meanwhile, 24-year-old Reyna Reyes has quietly become a force in the air at both ends of the pitch and in one-on-one defensive situations. 

Earlier this season, the Thorns went 10 matches undefeated at home, and home advantage will be a big bonus in the quarterfinals. However, the lack of clinical finishing could hold the Thorns back from taking out elite teams in high-pressure knockout games.

It's all about momentum for Racing Louisville. The Kentucky club is tied for the longest active undefeated streak in the NWSL (five games, tied with the Orlando Pride) and will head into the postseason with morale at an all-time high. Especially as this is the first playoff run in team history.

By no means the most talented roster in the NWSL, Racing advanced to the playoffs through grit, hard work and a very clear identity created by manager Bev Yanez. Louisville will hustle and grind the opposition down, pressing high and looking to capitalize on set pieces. 

The @RacingLouFC fans waited a long time for this moment.  #NWSL pic.twitter.com/kobXZlsDFN

A month or so ago, Gotham were one of the most exciting teams in the NWSL. After four wins in five matches, the blockbuster arrival of Jaedyn Shaw was combined with the return of Rose Lavelle. The midfield was singing. Finally, Gotham looked like the team they were meant to be. 

But now, Gotham have closed out the regular season with four winless games and are struggling with the loss of top scorer Esther González to injury. One of the most inconsistent teams in the league, Gotham have a high ceiling but a low floor. Fans will be hoping that the errors that led to seven goals being conceded in the last three games have been cleaned up come the quarterfinals.

Gotham will be their usual unpredictable selves and look to cause an upset on the road. Just the way they like it. 

It feels like a long time ago that the San Diego Wave were riding high as one of the best teams in the NWSL. Since the summer break, the Wave has won just three of 13 matches, having won seven of 13 in the first half of the year. 

The Wave had the highest expected goals (xG) minus goals scored (+6.2) of any team in the NWSL, which either shows their shooting has been incredibly good or they have been rather lucky. As the luck has run out, the mirage of just how good the Wave are has dissolved. 

It will be interesting to see how teams set up against Wave and their possession-heavy style. No team averaged more possession in 2025 than the Wave (59.5%). But, in the NWSL, counter-attacking and thriving in transition is often what rules the day.

The Seattle Reign enter the playoffs as the weakest attacking team on paper. The Reign rank last of the eight playoff teams for goals (32), xG (24.3), progressive passes (762), shots (222) or xG against (39.3). 

Laura Harvey has set her team up to absorb pressure and take away the best components of the opponent without the intention of creating big chances of their own. Can this tactic be successful in the playoffs? Well, it's worked before, with Harvey having most recently gone to the NWSL championship final in 2023, where the Reign narrowly lost to Gotham.  

This playoff run feels premature for a team in flux. A group that is bedding in a slew of bright young players, while also having one last serenade for a core of legends that are at the end of their careers.

The list of the most clutch Champions League goalscorers is predictably headed by the tournament's most prolific player, Cristiano Ronaldo. Manchester City icon Sergio Agüero can match the Portuguese legend and now a certain Ricardo Pepi has joined the select group.

The U.S. men's national team (USMNT) hopeful scored his third decisive stoppage-time goal in club soccer's most prestigious continental tournament on Tuesday evening, snatching a 1–1 draw for PSV Eindhoven in the 93rd-minute of a trip to Olympiacos. Pepi has a habit for pulling the rabbit out of the hat on big European nights.

Pepi's first-ever Champions League goal was a 92nd-minute winner against Sevilla back in November 2023. The Texan forward had barely been on the pitch for 10 minutes by the time he nodded in, completing a dramatic turnaround after PSV had been trailing by two goals. 

The Eindhoven outfit also found themselves 2–0 down to Shakhtar Donetsk in last season's league phase. Fellow U.S. forward Malik Tillman scored twice in the final two minutes of normal time before Pepi popped up with another winner while the clock read 95.

In the 33-year history of the Champions League in its modern format, no player can better Pepi's tally of three goals in second-half stoppage time which positively changed the result, per Opta. 

Ronaldo's total haul of European goals may dwarf Pepi—and every other player—yet only three of his 140 strikes in the competition fit the clutch criteria. Intriguingly, all three of his decisive late goals were scored for Manchester United. During his first spell at Old Trafford, Ronaldo notably sunk the aspirations of his boyhood club Sporting CP with a dagger of a stoppage-time free-kick in 2007.

Fourteen years, five titles and two different clubs (Real Madrid and Juventus) arrived before Ronaldo's next late Champions League winner. Back at Old Trafford, but this time under the stewardship of his former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Ronaldo sniffed out a scratchy swipe against Villarreal, peeling away to the corner flag as the Theatre of Dreams erupted into a chorus of “Viva Ronaldo!” which lasted long after the final whistle.

“Sometimes it is not about ‘pass there, pass there,' it is the crowd—and they have sucked it in before—and when you have Cristiano on the pitch, you always have a chance. He is so good in front of goal and he has an impact on everyone,” Solskjær gushed. “That is what happens at Old Trafford.”

It can also also happen in Bergamo. 

Barely a month after his heroics against Villarreal, Ronaldo nabbed a 91st-minute equalizer on an away day at Atalanta. Solskjær, whose entire managerial career seems to be one long exercise in nostalgia, called upon the memory of basketball's greatest clutch player. “We all have our roles and responsibilities,” the manager beamed. “He is a leader.

“He does provide those moments. I am sure Chicago Bulls didn't mind having Michael Jordan.” 

Now there's a new U.S. athlete who warrants comparison to Ronaldo.

Christian Pulisic has resumed training and is expected to return to Milan's squad for Saturday's Serie A trip to Parma.

Pulisic has missed Milan's four most recent matches after sustaining what the club described as a ‘low-grade injury' to his right hamstring in the USMNT's 2-1 friendly over Australia last month.

He had been experiencing ankle soreness going into the game but was deemed fit to start before suffering the hamstring issue and being replaced after only 30 minutes.

The 27-year-old has missed Milan's wins over Fiorentina and Roma, along with draws against Pisa and Atalanta.

Milan's game against Parma is the final domestic match ahead of November's international window, when the U.S. play friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Max Allegri's side return to action later this month against city rivals Inter.

Pulisic has enjoyed a good start to this Serie A season, scoring four goals in as many starts in the league and registering two assists.

After opting to skip the Gold Cup in the summer to focus on rest and recovery — drawing criticism from U.S. soccer icons such as Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey — Pulisic has featured in all four of the U.S.' most recent games, dissuading fears of a rift between himself and head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

“I think we can say that he is the most important player now for the national team,” Pochettino said at the start of October.

Pulisic, who made his senior international debut as a 17-year-old in March 2016, has been capped 82 times and scored 32 goals.

It was a big day for U.S. men's national team strikers Ricardo Pepi and Folarin Balogun as they each scored in their respective Champions League matches on Tuesday.

Pepi came on as a substitute for PSV Eindhoven to score in stoppage time and earn a 1-1 draw with Olympiakos. With the game deep into stoppage time against the Greek side, Pepi nailed a free kick to help his Dutch club snatch a point. 

Pepi remains in top form in the Dutch Eredivisie with three league goals in his past four appearances, and five goals in 11 games overall.

Balogun got the only goal of Monaco's win over Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in their Champions League clash. In the 43rd minute, Balogun sneaked past the opponents' defense and slammed a shot into the top corner of the goal. Balogun has now scored three times in nine total matches for the Ligue 1 side, with four total in 13 appearances across all competitions.

Both Pepi and Balogun are in the mix for roster spots for USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad for the 2026 World Cup. Pepi hasn't played for the U.S. in almost a year following knee surgery and still remains limited in his minutes with PSV. Still, he also found the net in each of his USMNT three appearances under Pochettino in 2024, which bodes well if he does return.

Nonetheless, Balogun still returns as the incumbent frontrunner for USMNT striker spot after his standout performances in September and October. He should be expected to be called up by Pochettino later this week for the U.S. roster in November. 

The USMNT are back in action later this month with two friendlies: vs. Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and another on Nov. 18 against Uruguay in Tampa.

Adidas is preparing for the start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup by giving fans a glimpse at the home kits that several countries will wear when they step on the pitch next summer.

The kits were revealed on Wednesday with 22 countries featured, including defending champion Argentina, Spain and Germany. 

Here is the full list of each country receiving a new kit:

From that group, 15 countries have yet to secure a spot in the World Cup. Chile, Peru and Venezuela have already been eliminated from qualifying, but they will wear their new home kits for the 2026 international season. 

Adidas described each kit as being designed with the ""best-in class"" technology that is ""built to support world class players in high pressure moments.""

Sam Handy, GM football at Adidas, said in Wednesday's press release that a ""national kit is the symbol of a nation's togetherness and pride,"" resulting in a design process that emphasized its roots, along with a connection to the fans. 

""A World Cup is about creating moments that transcend the stadium, so we've engineered the designs as an honour to each nation's roots but also to celebrate an era where every fan, everywhere, is part of the story,"" Handy said.

A total of 28 teams have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. The United States, Canada and Mexico received automatic bids as the host nations. 

There are still 20 open spots available, with up to 10 able to be clinched throughout the month of November. 

The 2026 World Cup will begin on June 11 and wrap up on July 19. The final will be played at MetLife Stadium, marking the first time the U.S. will host the title game since 1994 when Brazil defeated Italy at the Rose Bowl.

Social commitment

Wed | 05/11/25 | 12:29

FC Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain have faced off on the biggest stages worldwide in recent years: from the 2020 Champions League final in Lisbon to the Club World Cup in the USA this summer, there have been matches packed with emotions, including great victories for FC Bayern but also defeats and setbacks. A European rivalry that thrills fans around the world has come about.

FC Bayern showcased football at the highest level again on Tuesday when they beat PSG 2-1 in the Champions League duel at Parc des Princes. The two clubs also stood out with their commitment in a completely different area. FC Bayern and PSG are working together to support social initiatives. The goal is to help people in difficult situations.

FC Bayern supported PSG's education and sports programme “École Rouge & Bleu” the day before the match. It is aimed at children aged seven to eleven from disadvantaged districts in Paris. The project aims to strengthen their academic and social skills through sporting, cultural and digital activities.

The sessions take place four days per week in the afternoon, led by educators of “PSG for Communities”, a department dedicated to social responsibility. The focus is on homework and values like tolerance, responsibility and respect in a playful way. Two schools have been established since 2018, in Mantes-la-Jolie und Poissy, with a third set to open up at Paris' Necker hospital.

FC Bayern coaches held a joint session with educators from the PSG Foundation in Poissy ahead of the Champions League match. It began with educational and learning activities before the children played a football game wearing FC Bayern and PSG jerseys. Bayern Legend Roy Makaay was on site to present jerseys as well as gifts and thrilled the young participants.

FC Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain were rivals out on the pitch again, but this time they also teamed up to bring attention and joy to children. Football connects people, builds bridges and can have a social impact, especially where support is needed the most. That too is at Champions League level.

Madrid were well beaten by a resurgent Liverpool side (Carl Recine/Getty Images)

Almost a year on from their Champions League defeat there last season, Real Madrid lost again at Anfield.

November 2024 saw a side managed by Carlo Ancelotti beaten 2-0 by Arne Slot's Liverpool in the league phase. On Tuesday, it was Xabi Alonso's turn to suffer as he returned to a stadium he knows well from his five years as a player for the Merseyside club from 2004.

Madrid's new head coach had been on a positive run, with three wins from three to begin this season's Champions League and 10 from 11 so far in La Liga — including a 2-1 defeat of Barcelona in El Clasico just over a week ago.

However, two painful defeats, 4-0 against Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-finals in July and 5-2 against Atletico Madrid in La Liga in September, had also stirred doubts over whether Madrid could truly compete with challenging opponents.

Alonso himself distanced last night's 1-0 loss from what you might call the Atletico effect.

“There are ways to lose, and today is very different from the way we lost at the Metropolitano,” he told Spanish broadcasters Movistar Plus. “Today, the team competed and gave it their all.”

That might well be true, but there are still key lessons to learn from another disappointing Madrid display.

Real Madrid only managed two shots on target against Liverpool, one from Federico Valverde and the other by Jude Bellingham.

In last season's trip to Anfield, they mustered three. But there was the same trend in both games: neither Kylian Mbappe nor Vinicius Junior created enough danger.

Mbappe had received the Golden Boot award on Friday, given to the top goalscorer in European league football last season. He is joint leader of this season's chart too, alongside Erling Haaland of Manchester City.

Before kick-off on Tuesday, he was on 18 goals from 14 club matches in all competitions, but the France international just could not get the better of countryman Ibrahima Konate or Virgil van Dijk. Every time he received the ball, Mbappe was too far from the Liverpool penalty area, and when he did get a chance inside it, the centre-backs beat him in the air, which is not one of the strengths of his game.

For his part, Vinicius Jr was unable to get past Conor Bradley. As usual, the Brazilian accounted for having Madrid having the majority of their play on the left wing, but he, too, was ineffective. He did not register a single shot on goal, did not make one good cross and failed on five of his six dribbles. Bradley, who was praised by Ancelotti's coaching staff after nullifying Mbappe last November, even with then first-choice right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold eventually making his move to the Bernabeu, put in a good display again.

“We struggled to get to the final line,” said Alonso in his post-match press conference. “They were sitting deep, and we found it very difficult to cause them any damage in that area.”

Anfield was hostile territory for Madrid, and especially the returning Alexander-Arnold. There was a lot of booing throughout the match and Alonso's team had to cope with that pressure.

Madrid made 50 ball recoveries (two more than Liverpool) and all their players looked more committed than was the case here last season under Ancelotti. The most striking contrast was Vinicius Jr, who received a yellow card after stopping a Liverpool counter-attack with a foul in his own half.

If the attackers were not keeping up their press, both Alonso and his assistant Sebas Parrilla would remind them to do so. After the match, Alonso insisted, in replies to multiple questions on the subject, that intensity was not a problem. He might be right, but plainly intensity alone was not enough.

In recent years, veterans with a lot of weight in the team, such as Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Nacho, Luka Modric and Lucas Vazquez, have left Madrid. At the same time, a transition has begun within the dressing room, giving way to younger players such as Alvaro Carreras (22), Dean Huijsen (20) and Franco Mastantuono (18) — three of the club's four summer transfers, adding to the signing of Alexander-Arnold.

Just like in that derby away to Atletico, there was a lack of experience and leadership among the Madrid players at Anfield. This is something that the coaching staff sees as vital to mentally combating key moments, and after the game, Alonso gave an example of where it was lacking. “We have to learn not to concede and not to give away untimely fouls,” he said.

That message was repeated by Courtois and Valverde — both now considered veterans of the team.

Alonso kept the same asymmetric 4-4-2 formation that worked well in El Clasico. The plan was to play Eduardo Camavinga almost as a right-winger, but this time it was not as successful as against Barcelona in the Bernabeu last month — and this was visible from early on in the game.

Changes, when they did come, did not have the desired effect either. Liverpool scored their goal just past the hour, and Alonso waited until the 68th to substitute Camavinga, bringing on Rodrygo in his place.

The Brazilian has lost a lot of prominence this season, and is only Madrid's 17th most-used player in terms of minutes played (348). He has not scored for them in 27  appearances going back to March. On Tuesday, he didn't create a single chance and lost nine balls in just over 20 minutes on the pitch.

It is difficult to understand why he was the first solution that came to Alonso's mind last night. Despite being behind on the scoreboard, the manager did not give his two promising strikers, Gonzalo Garcia and Endrick, any playing time at all.

He then waited until the 81st minute for his next substitution, when he brought on Alexander-Arnold for Arda Guler. The Liverpool academy graduate was not only lacking in rhythm in his first appearance since September because of a hamstring injury but also seemed inhibited by the hostile reception from a crowd that once adored him, so he did not improve things either.

In the final minute of the 90, Brahim Diaz came on for Valverde, who appeared to be in some discomfort.

All in all, the substitutions from Alonso did not come quickly and he did not bet on the youngsters. Ancelotti was criticised for the same reasons last season.

“Courtois was exceptional — he started to give me the feeling of Paris 2022,” Van Dijk told TNT Brasil after the game, referring to Madrid's 1-0 Champions League final victory over Liverpool that year. The Belgian was key in that match, with nine memorable saves that helped the Spanish side hang on to win a 14th European Cup. But your goalkeeper being the best player on the team in a match is not always good news.

On Tuesday, Courtois prevented what looked to be four certain goals — making three prodigious saves to deny Dominik Szoboszlai alone.

Liverpool recorded an expected goals total of 2.51 through their nine shots on target (to Madrid's 0.45), and their siege finally yielded Alexis Mac Allister's winner.

In their matches against other big-name teams this season, Madrid have only managed to keep a clean sheet in the 1-0 Champions League home win against Juventus last month — and achieving that was a struggle.

When asked if Courtois had prevented an Anfield rout, Alonso replied: “For me, the worrying thing is that we have to learn.”

...

The boos rang out around Anfield when former Liverpool defender Alexander-Arnold entered the pitch at Anfield, replacing Arda Guler in the 82nd minute of Real's 1-0 defeat. This was the first time that the English full-back had played a game at Anfield since appearing for the Reds in their final game of the 2024-25 campaign against Crystal Palace.

Alexander-Arnold chose to leave at the end of his Liverpool contract, although Madrid ended up paying a €10 million (£8m/$11m) fee to release him early so he could feature for Los Blancos at the Club World Cup. Ahead of Tuesday's European clash, the Englishman was labelled a ""rat"" and his famous Liverpool mural was vandalised.

 

Alexander-Arnold's Madrid and England team-mate Bellingham addressed the hostile reception from the home crowd on Amazon Prime: ""Obviously, it is one of those things in football. The fans booing isn't a reflection of how they feel about him. I think it is more to give their team the edge and throw him off a little bit. I am sure they're appreciative of what he has done for the club. It is one of those things.""

The night turned out to be a disappointing one for Bellingham and Co as Alexis Mac Allister's 61st-minute strike sealed all three points for the hosts, but the English midfielder did make European history as he eclipsed Lionel Messi and Madrid colleague Kylian Mbappe. At just 22 years and 128 days old, the former Birmingham City prodigy smashed Los Blancos icon Iker Casillas's long-standing record as the youngest player in history to reach 50 appearances in Europe's elite club competition.

Since moving from Dortmund to Madrid in the summer of 2023, Bellingham has lived up to, and arguably exceeded, the astronomical expectations placed upon him. He marked his arrival at the Spanish capital with goals in his first four Champions League games, establishing himself as the heartbeat of a side that would win the competition under Carlo Ancelotti in the 2023-24 campaign. That early streak made him only the fourth Real Madrid player in the 21st century to score on both his La Liga and Champions League debuts, joining the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Isco, and Marco Asensio. Bellingham's record-breaking spree doesn't stop there.

Alexander-Arnold has endured a far tougher start to life in Madrid, however. The Liverpool academy graduate has only started three games for Xabi Alonso's side to date, and played second fiddle to Dani Carvajal at the start of the campaign. A hamstring problem also set Alexander-Arnold back, but he is set for a run in the team now as Carvajal has been sidelined until the new year with a serious knee injury. The 27-year-old will hope to start at right-back when Los Blancos take in a trip to Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

This week, reports indicated that Inter Miami is interested in signing Pedro Gallese, Orlando City's goalkeeper, in January when his contract with the Lions expires. With the late defeat against Nashville SC last Saturday, Javier Mascherano needs to move his squad and prevent the Herons' elimination in the first round once again. 

Despite what happened on Saturday, one thing is clear: Las Garzas are already making moves and asking the club about certain players. Inter Miami have shown interest in signing Lautaro Di Lollo to reinforce their defense, and Milton Delgado, both from Boca Juniors, to replace Sergio Busquets once he retires. 

Nevertheless, the Pedro Gallese rumour only has one winner for the GK room, and two losers. 

Oscar Ustari is the only goalkeeper whose contract doesn't end in 2025. This could seem like a coincidence, but I believe it was on purpose. There is a reality: Yarbrough hasn't played a single game since being signed. 

This could be polemic, but the reality behind his deal arrived from the idea of adding depth, and because with GKs, everything is possible. You could have both of your players injured, and if you don't have a third goalkeeper, you have to invent something on the run. 

I believe the player realized he wouldn't get playing time with the Herons. On the side of the coin, we have Rocco Ríos Novo. 

The Argentinian footballer arrived from Lanus on a loan until December. Ríos Novo started in goal last Saturday, showing that Javier Mascherano sees him as a viable option to replace Oscar Ustari when his performance dips.

Throughout the season, Novo had a decent performance when it was his time to shine. Everybody will remember his actions against Club Necaxa for the Leagues Cup, when the 23-year-old player saved the Herons on the penalties. 

If we use the logic, Ustari will remain on the roster for the 2026 season, with Pedro Gallese on the squad, and Rocco Ríos Novo will become the third goalkeeper. 

Due to the two veteran goalkeepers, Inter Miami could renew Novo's loan and sign him to become the starting player under the posts for many years. 

Gallese is 35 years old, while Ustari is 36 years old; meanwhile, Novo's have 23 years. He is practically a kid, and could be both benefited or hurt by the signing of the soon-to-be ex-Orlando City player.

FIFA will present its inaugural “FIFA Peace Prize – Football Unites the World” award during the World Cup draw on Dec. 5 in Washington D.C.

The award – which aims to be FIFA's version of a Nobel Peace Prize – will be presented on an annual basis to an individual or group of individuals who have helped unite people in peace through unwavering commitment and special actions.

“In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a Wednesday, Nov. 5 statement.

Infantino added the award “will recognize the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.”  

The announcement comes before Infantino will appear at the America Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday, Nov. 5, where U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine World Cup champion Lionel Messi are among speakers at the event.

Infantino has attended several events in the past few weeks to promote the World Cup and the sport's ability to provide peace and unity globally.

Infantino joined Trump at the Summit for Peace in Egypt on Oct. 13, and attended the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia on Oct. 28.

Infantino also accepted an Atlantic Council Global Citizen award in New York on Sept. 24, where he claimed the World Cup will resemble 104 Super Bowls – likening the soccer tournament to the popular NFL championship game for American sports fans not keen on the sport.

“We need to have occasions to unite the world, to bring everyone together, to bring people together so that they can meet, they can exchange, they can know each other, and they can all learn from each other. This is what the FIFA World Cup is about.”

Trump announced the World Cup draw would be held at the Kennedy Center in late August. The draw will set the schedule for all 104 matches of next summer's tournament co-hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The World Cup begins on June 11, 2026, and the final will be on July 19, 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Today, adidas unveils the official 2026 home kits for 22 partner federations ahead of FIFA World Cup 26™, including: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Northern Ireland, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Wales* 

The collection combines historic visual identities and traditions of each nation and portrays them in a modernist, forward-looking aesthetic. The designs are representative of a liberated style of play and fresh perspectives on the game, aiming to bridge the gap between every generation of fan, ahead of the biggest World Cup tournament ever.

The bold array of jerseys reflects the heart of each nation via colourways and patterns that celebrate key aspects of each nation's identity. From their rich histories to famous landscapes, traditional architecture and iconic past kit designs, each jersey aims to unite fans around a shared passion for their nation. 

Throughout, subtle details that nod to the tournament's storied history - including acknowledgements of historic jersey designs, past victories and memorable dates – can be discovered when viewed up close, creating on-going moments of delight for fans past the first viewing.

The full range is crafted for performance, built to support world-class players in high-pressure moments to cope with the varying conditions they will experience across three unique host nations. To tackle the more intense warm-weather conditions, body-mapped 3D engineered mechanical stretch fabrics incorporating adidas' latest CLIMACOOL+ materials wick sweat faster, keeping players dryer for longer. Perforated wide 3-stripe tapes enable ultimate breathability, while strategically placed mesh holes on both fabric and trims deliver best-in-class air permeability, ensuring optimal ventilation even in the most demanding climates. 

The jerseys also feature a new lenticular heat-applied federation crest and adidas logo expression, a process that creates a unique shapeshifting appearance, adding a bold and innovative visual detail.

Sam Handy, GM Football at adidas said: “The national kit is the symbol of a nation's togetherness and pride. As teams step onto the world stage at the biggest World Cup we have ever seen, they carry the hopes of a whole new generation of fans, while representing those that have come before them. A World Cup is about creating moments that transcend the stadium, so we've engineered the designs as an honour to each nation's roots but also to celebrate an era where every fan, everywhere, is part of the story.”

Thomas Mace, VP Design, adidas Football said: “Designing our jersey roster for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ has been about honouring each nation's unique identity while pushing the boundaries of innovation and performance. Every jersey tells a story — blending cultural heritage with modern aesthetics — and is built using our most advanced technologies to keep players cool and comfortable on football's biggest stage. From the bold visual details to the shapeshifting lenticular logo and innovative ventilation features, this collection represents the future of football jersey design.”

All adidas federation home jerseys** will be available to purchase from 6th November via adidas.com and select retail stores.

Design overview of select nations: 

Argentina

The traditional Argentina vertical stripes in sky blue and white, take on a shapeshifting look, with a unique 3 coloured fading effect, channelling the blue tones from the three previous FIFA World Cup™ winning shirts – 1978, 1986 & 2022. The back neck sees a bespoke sign-off reading ‘1896' – celebrating the founding date of the AFA. 

Germany

Championing Germany's previous successes in this tournament, the home jersey pays homage to some of the nation's most iconic shirts. The repeating diamond shape and chevron detailing are each inspired by the iconic graphics from previous shirts, including the 2014 World Cup winning shirt.

Italy 

Tradition meets innovation in the Italy home Jersey - inspired by the rich heritage of Italian football, the shirt celebrates the essence of the FIGC (the Italian Football Federation) with its bold design. Azzurra, referring to the National team's nickname and the colour of the jersey, meaning ‘the blue,' appears in gold lettering across the back of the shirt neck.

Japan

The classic blue of the Japanese Home jersey is brought to life using an abstract graphic with ash blue linear details, reflecting the famed haze found on the horizon where sky and sea meet in Japan. The Japanese flag sits proudly as a sign-off across the back of the neck.

Mexico:

Heritage and future come together in the new México home shirt. This jersey represents the energy and pride that will unite generations of fans during the upcoming FIFA World Cup. It celebrates the unwavering support of a nation that lives and breathes football, where every shared moment reflects the heart of México. On the back of the neck, the phrase “SOMOS MÉXICO”, meaning “We Are México”, appears as a symbol of the unity and passion that define the Mexican spirit. 

Spain

Spain's home kit for FIFA World Cup 2026™ arrives in a clean, pinstripe finish, with the red base punctuated by repeating yellow vertical lines, that draw visual cues from the national flag and crest. The spirit of the nation is carried by the players with the word ESPAÑA seen written on the back of the shirt neck.

Not long after the 2026 World Cup draw is held on Dec. 5, teams that have qualified for the tournament will begin looking for a place to stay next summer.

Those national soccer teams that have qualified for the World Cup (and we won't know them all in early December), will pick the city where they want to have their base camp.

It'll be the place they train before and in between the three group-stage matches they will play.

Three potential base-camp sites are in the Kansas City area. National teams will have the opportunity to train at Compass Mineral Sporting Fields, where Sporting KC practices; the KC Women's Soccer Training Complex for the KC Current; and the University of Kansas' facilities and Rock Chalk Park.

FIFA made an online base camp brochure for its member associations that includes “top-notch training site and hotel pairings that could become your home away from home.”

Here are hotel pairings FIFA suggested for the three training sites in the Kansas City area. Each will have the option for the entire hotel to be dedicated to a national team.

219 West 9th St. in Kansas City

This is FIFA's top option for a national team wanting to train at Sporting Kansas City's facilities.

FIFA wrote: “Hotel Savoy, a full buyout option, offers stylish accommodations, extensive meeting space, and convenient downtown access, ideal for teams seeking comfort, privacy, and proximity to Kansas City's top attractions. “The nearby Sporting KC Training Centre, home to MLS' Sporting Kansas City, is state-of-the-art with its cutting-edge facilities and services contributing to football development across the USA.”

1228 Baltimore Ave. in Kansas City

For a team training at the Current site, this is FIFA's preferred hotel choice.

It wrote in the brochure: “The official Hotel of Major League Soccer for Sporting Kansas City and host to many other National Teams, Hotel Kansas City sets the standard for grand hospitality. Hotel Kansas City is part of the Unbound Collection by Hyatt. “Hotel has the option for a full buyout.”

1200 Oread Ave. in Lawrence

If a national team chooses to train in Lawrence next summer, the Oread is the option that FIFA thinks is best.

This is from FIFA's brochure: “The Oread Lawrence, located beside the University of Kansas, offers full buyout and exclusive use for national teams. With seven adaptable meeting rooms and an outdoor terrace known as The Nest, the hotel provides a focused and private environment for rest, recovery, and team operations. The dedicated staff ensures a tailored, team-first experience throughout the stay.

“The University of Kansas training facility, a short drive away, includes multiple dressing rooms, medical rooms, polar and thermal recovery baths, two gyms, a cardio room, equipment storage, and dedicated meeting spaces — fully equipped to support elite football preparation.”

Football fans on social media (X) are left divided after Cristiano Ronaldo's comments on the FIFA World Cup following Lionel Messi's win in 2022. Many believe the Portuguese superstar is right that the World Cup does not define his career, while others think he has changed his mind after Argentina won it.

After the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo said that his biggest dream of winning the tournament had come to an end. The forward added that he was fighting hard to fulfill the dream and posted on Instagram:

However, his opinion has changed, and the Al-Nassr captain has now claimed in an interview with Piers Morgan that he does not dream about winning the World Cup. He said:

Fans are now divided about his comment and have posted:

Cristiano Ronaldo's best finish at the FIFA World Cup remains the semifinal in 2006.

Cristiano Ronaldo spoke about Lionel Messi in his interview with Piers Morgan, claiming that he was better than the Argentine. He disagreed with his former teammate Wayne Rooney, who said that the Argentine was better than the Al-Nassr captain.

The comments have not gone down well with the Portuguese superstar, and he said that he does not agree with anyone who picks the Argentine over him. He said:

Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have won three international trophies each in their careers. The Portuguese has won the UEFA Nations League twice and the UEFA Euro once, while the Argentine has the FIFA World Cup and two Copa America medals.

...

With their historic performance in CAF World Cup qualifiers, Cape Verde will play in its first-ever FIFA World Cup. But how did the island nation make it here?  

Winning the FIFA World Cup is perhaps the biggest achievement in all of sports. The sheer size of the tournament, in addition to its rich history, puts it above any other competition.

But while the significance of winning the World Cup is obvious, simply qualifying for the tournament can have a profound impact on a nation. Earning a place among the world's best can transform a country's entire soccer landscape.

Cape Verde has recently achieved this milestone, qualifying for its first-ever World Cup. With a population of just under 600,000, Cape Verde becomes the second-smallest country ever to reach the tournament, marking a historic moment that will reshape its national identity overnight. This achievement was made possible in part through the FIFA Forward program, established in 2016 to support the growth and development of soccer worldwide.

FIFA Forward stands as the world's most extensive sports development program. Its purpose is straightforward: to distribute FIFA's revenues equitably among all 211 member associations. The initiative is built on three main pillars — increasing investment in global football development, creating targeted, customized projects for greater impact, and emphasizing transparent, accountable management of all funds.

Across Africa, the program follows the same framework. Funding is primarily directed toward five key areas — infrastructure, capacity building, competitions, national teams, and operational support — with additional specialized projects tailored to each federation's unique needs.

By emphasizing transparency and measurable results, FIFA Forward has reshaped the landscape of football governance. For nations like Cape Verde, which historically lacked financial and structural resources, the program has provided both stability and opportunity. It has empowered federations to focus on long-term sustainability instead of short-term fixes.

Established in 1982 and admitted to FIFA in 1986, the Cabo Verdean Football Federation (FCF) has made significant strides in advancing football nationwide. Support from the FIFA Forward program, which includes financial assistance for national team operations, has been instrumental in driving this progress. Since 2016, FIFA has invested $1 billion USD in Africa through FIFA Forward, and Cape Verde is one of the first nations where the change is visible, having qualified for the World Cup.

The FIFA Forward program has helped to modernize the FCF's operations, improving its infrastructure, working environment, and overall readiness for international competition. With this financial backing, the Cape Verde national team gained the resources needed to manage international travel, training camps, and essential equipment. The program's funding also supported the construction of new artificial pitches and the renovation of the Aderito Sena Stadium, enabling the nation to meet hosting standards for World Cup qualifiers and other major matches.

“It's a victory for the Cape Verdean people, for those who are here and those who are abroad,” said Cape Verde head coach coach Pedro Leitão Brito, commonly known as Bubista, to FIFA.com. “It's also a victory for unity.”

This sense of unity speaks to the broader social impact of football, which often transcends sport to become a symbol of collective pride and resilience.

With the infrastructure and new outlook on the federation made possible by funding from the FIFA Forward program, Cape Verde has been able to attract players who previously may not have considered representing the nation. For many dual nationals, the opportunity to compete at the international level has strengthened their connection to their heritage and allowed them to contribute to the growth of Cape Verdean football.

MLS Cup Champion Steven Moreira, one of the leaders on this Cape Verde team, reflected on the emotional significance of the qualification.

Speaking to Tiago Brandao of Territory MLS, Morreira said: “It's incredible, the most beautiful thing I've achieved in my life, because I moved to another country and made my family proud. My wish is to go as far as possible with the team, make history, and if we can play against France, Brazil, or other great teams, that would be wonderful.”

Moreira's words reflect the dual identity many Cape Verdean players share — a balance between global ambition and national loyalty. For Cape Verde, attracting such talent marks a turning point. The success of these players will likely inspire future generations and strengthen the domestic football system.

Another example of Cape Verde's growing influence is Roberto Lopes, who was born in Ireland to a Cabo Verdean father and has spent his entire playing career in the League of Ireland with Bohemians and now Shamrock Rovers. Lopes stated that playing international football had given his career a new dimension.

“You could say it's skyrocketed — it really has,” Lopes told FIFA. “Being able to test yourself against the best players in the world, bringing back your knowledge to the team, and trying to improve yourself every day – it's made me a better player, it's made me a better person, and I've experienced things I never would have in my life before.”

His comments encapsulate the transformative power of international football, not just for the players but for the nation they represent. By investing in development and providing access to global competition, FIFA Forward has allowed nations like Cape Verde to broaden their horizons and take meaningful steps toward sustainable football growth.

The Cape Verde example demonstrates that FIFA Forward's success is not measured solely by financial figures but by the social, cultural, and developmental outcomes it facilitates. Through infrastructure projects, improved governance, and targeted funding, the program has laid the groundwork for long-term success. Cape Verde's World Cup qualification serves as a case study in how equitable investment and strategic vision can reshape a small nation's sporting identity.

Furthermore, the nation's achievement underscores a growing trend within African football: smaller federations are no longer content to play supporting roles. With enhanced resources and a renewed sense of purpose, they are beginning to challenge traditional powers on the world stage.

FIFA's commitment to developing the global game continues to expand. In line with its strategy to make football truly international, the organization plans to invest a record-breaking $5 billion in the sport by the end of 2026. This will be FIFA Forward 3.0. Since 2020, FIFA has constructed 32 pitches worldwide, with two more set to open in Guinea-Bissau this November. Of these 34 total pitches, 26 are located across Africa, highlighting FIFA's focus on advancing football infrastructure throughout the continent.

Cape Verde's first-ever World Cup qualification is more than a sporting success, it's a national milestone born from years of strategic development, investment, and belief. The FIFA Forward program has been a catalyst for this transformation, allowing the nation to build the infrastructure and confidence needed to compete globally. As Cape Verde prepares to take its place among the world's best, it stands as a testament to what can be achieved when vision, opportunity, and unity converge under the shared language of football.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Welcome to ESPN India Edition

Take a look at some of Cristiano Ronaldo's best moments for Real Madrid against Barcelona in LaLiga. (4:05)

Cristiano Ronaldo told Piers Morgan his legacy will not be defined by whether or not he wins the FIFA World Cup.

A five-time Ballon d'Or winner, Ronaldo has 952 career goals and is the all-time leading scorer in men's international football with 143 goals.

The World Cup is the only major trophy missing in his distinguished career.

""If you ask me, Cristiano, is it a dream to win the World Cup? No, it's not a dream,"" Ronaldo, 40, said in a clip of the full interview that will be released later on Thursday.

The Portugal captain considers it unjust that one single tournament should define a player's career.

""Define what?"" the Al Nassr captain said. ""To define if I'm one of the best of the history, to win one competition, [of] six games, seven games. You think it's fair?""

Ronaldo, who won four of his five Champions League titles with Real Madrid, has faced constant comparisons with Lionel Messi throughout his career.

Former Barcelona star Messi, a record eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, recently said that lifting the 2022 World Cup with Argentina after several failed attempts was ""the dream of my life.""

Ronaldo has enjoyed many achievements with his national team. He led Portugal to Euro 2016 glory, and to the inaugural UEFA Nations League three years later and again this summer.

He is the only player to have featured in six European Championships and is the record goal scorer in the history of the competition with 14 goals. Ronaldo insists there is no debate as to who is best in the history.

""Is Messi better than me? I disagree. I don't want to be humble,"" Ronaldo said.

- Cristiano Ronaldo: 'Lionel Messi better than me? I disagree'
- Ronaldo: Amorim can't perform miracles at Man United
- Portugal to play in special kit in tribute to legend Eusébio

Ronaldo is expected to captain Portugal if they qualify for the 2026 World Cup that will be staged in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

It will mark Portugal's first tournament without Diogo Jota, who died in July in a crash in Spain.

Although Ronaldo did not attend Jota's funeral, he was left ""devastated"" by the Liverpool forward's sudden passing.

""I didn't believe when they sent me the messages,"" Ronaldo said.

""I cried a lot. It was a very difficult moment for everyone, for the country, for families, for friends, for teammates.

""Devastated. It was very, very sad news.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.in', 'title': 'ESPN India'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cristiano Ronaldo reveals most expensive thing he's ever bought as Al-Nassr superstar compares becoming a billionaire to winning the Ballon d'Or","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-reveals-most-expensive-thing-ever-bought-al-nassr-superstar-compares-becoming-billionaire-ballon-d-or/blt07716a7d49c22ec4","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 10:21:33 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed the most expensive thing he has ever bought and compared becoming a billionaire to winning the Ballon d'Or. In October 2025, Ronaldo's net worth reportedly climbed to a staggering $1.4 billion (£1.04bn/€1.2bn) after he put pen to paper on the most lucrative contract extension in sporting history with Al-Nassr. Under the terms of the new deal, the forward now earns a whopping £178m-a-year in wages.

In the summer, Ronaldo signed the most lucrative contract extension in sporting history with Al-Nassr as he put pen to paper on a fresh two-year deal. The 40-year-old is now earning a whopping £178m-a-year in wages, which is £488,000-a-day. He is also believed to have received a signing-on fee worth £24.5m ($32.8m/€28.2m), which will increase to £38m ($51m/€43.8m) if he enters the second year of his contract.

In October, U.S. publication Bloomberg reported that following the new contract extension, the ex-Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star became the first footballer on the planet to become a billionaire as his net worth now stands at $1.4 billion (£1.04bn/€1.2bn). 

Speaking on 'Piers Morgan Uncensored', Ronaldo revealed that the biggest purchase of his life so far was a customised private jet, which set him back approximately €50m. The Portugal star said: ""The most expensive thing I've ever bought? An aeroplane, yes. I've had my aeroplane since I was 30, but I changed it a year ago, so it was a bit expensive. I have a [Bombardier] Global Express [model 6500]. I don't spend money [just because]… For example, I can buy whatever I want, but I don't need it. Three days ago I bought a car, but it's for my collection. It's like buying a painting. I'm not going to drive that car, it's an investment. I don't know how many cars I have, I don't count. It's normal, I'm not trying to be humble, it's a fact. Honestly, if I had to bet, I'd say 41, 42. I don't know, I swear I don't know. I love Bugattis, they're different beasts. I never drive. I spent a week in Madrid and didn't even go to the garage to see if the cars were there. The day I left, the two Bugattis went for inspection and came back, I looked at them, they're clean, they're good, they're going to the garage. I'm honest, cars are no longer a passion. I don't drive much in Saudi Arabia and the traffic is terrible, but when we go back home there isn't any. Yesterday I even drove home in my new BMW, given by Al Nassr to all the players, but I hadn't driven for six months.""

Ronaldo added on becoming a billionaire: ""I knew this was going to happen, I was prepared. It was a matter of time. Honestly, I was very happy. It was like winning a Ballon d'Or, because you have your goals of having a house, a car, and it was my goal to reach that number. Honestly. I'm not obsessed with money, because it can help you in many ways, but when you reach a certain level it doesn't matter anymore, but it's good to have more, because we are human, we are never happy with what we have. There are things more important than money, but I was very happy because it was one of my goals, besides football, trophies, Ballon d'Ors, Champions League. At 39, I reached that number and I was very proud.

""In football, I'm the only one. It doesn't surprise me much; the numbers don't lie. If you look at so many records in football, I'm at the top of the list, so it's just another one. Honestly, it doesn't surprise me because I knew my potential in football and outside of it. I knew I was going to reach that number for many reasons.""

When asked about his retirement plans, the veteran striker replied: ""I think I'll be prepared. It will be tough, yes, it will be difficult. I'll probably cry, that's normal. I cry easily, I don't like to hold back my feelings. It will be very difficult, but I've been preparing for my future since I was 25, so I think I'll be able to handle it. Nothing will compare to football, the adrenaline of scoring goals, that will end. 

""Everything has a beginning and an end, so I think I'll be prepared. I have other passions, I'll have more time for myself, for my family, my children. I want to follow in Cristiano Jr.'s footsteps, because it's the age when people do stupid things, because I did the same. I want to be more present and then I have my hobbies.

Bayern Munich's 2-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain was marred by controversy after Luis Diaz's reckless tackle on Achraf Hakimi saw him sent off just before half-time. The Colombian forward, who had scored twice, now faces a suspension as Vincent Kompany and Joshua Kimmich expressed sympathy for the injured PSG full-back and reflected on the fiery encounter.

The Bavarians secured a hard-fought 2-1 win over PSG at the Parc des Princes, but the match was overshadowed by Diaz's red card late in the first half. The ex-Liverpool winger, who had scored both goals for Bayern, went in late on Hakimi, catching the Moroccan full-back on the ankle after losing possession. Referee Maurizio Mariani initially showed a yellow but upgraded it to a red following a VAR review.

Diaz's dismissal came at a time when PSG were already reeling from the injury-enforced substitution of Ousmane Dembele. Despite being reduced to ten men, Bayern held on to claim victory, leaving the hosts concerned over Hakimi's fitness ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations.

After the match, Bayern stars Kimmich and Manuel Neuer offered their takes on the incident, both showing understanding for Diaz while acknowledging the severity of the foul.

Kimmich, speaking to Prime Video, explained: “Lucho was a bit frustrated in that situation. He was a little annoyed that he lost the ball. I saw it briefly on the screen. He had actually slid in beside the man, and Hakimi wanted to get his body in front of him at that moment, and that's why he caught him low. But it does look nasty.”

Neuer, who was named Man of the Match, also weighed in after learning more about the tackle: “I was told it wasn't a particularly hard foul, not a red-card foul. I don't know if it was excessively harsh you have to see that. Lucho was disappointed at halftime and kept his fingers crossed for the team that we could see it through.”

Their reactions highlighted the emotional toll on the Colombian, who was visibly distraught leaving the pitch, knowing he had jeopardised an otherwise stellar display.

From the touchline, Kompany had a clear view of the challenge and expressed both concern and empathy afterward. The Die Roten boss was visibly unsettled by the tackle and drew parallels to Jamal Musiala's injury against PSG during the Club World Cup in the United States.

Speaking to Sky Austria, Kompany said: “It's a shame that the PSG player had to come off injured. At first, I didn't think it was that dangerous. But of course, it happened, and when a player gets injured, I always think of what happened to Jamal [Musiala]. He broke his leg against PSG in the USA. Then you think: ‘Is that comparable?' But I have to be honest: the most important thing for me is that Hakimi isn't injured for too long. I wish him a speedy recovery.”

Hakimi's condition remains a concern for Les Parisiens, with reports confirming he left the stadium on crutches and wearing a protective boot. Captain Marquinhos said post-match: “We have to wait for the tests. They've done some minor checks already, and more information will follow later.”

Meanwhile, Diaz made unwanted Champions League history by becoming only the second player ever to score twice and be sent off in the same match, following Antoine Griezmann's similar feat for Atletico Madrid in 2021. Diaz will now serve a suspension, missing at least one game in the competition. His absence comes at a crucial time, as Bayern prepare for a heavyweight showdown against Arsenal at the Emirates on November 26. Both clubs boast 100% records in the group stage, setting the stage for a thrilling battle for top spot.

With Hakimi's recovery uncertain and Diaz sidelined, both PSG and Bayern face significant challenges ahead: one looking to heal, the other to sustain their momentum in Europe's toughest competition.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Barcelona winger lacks 'class and culture' required to make it at Los Blancos but ex-star wants 'phenomenon' Pedri at the Bernabeu","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/lamine-yamal-not-good-enough-real-madrid-barcelona-winger-class-culture-los-blancos-phenomenon-pedri-bernabeu/blt098feb12e054d6b5","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 11:29:35 GMT","

Former Real Madrid striker Ivan Zamorano has sparked controversy by claiming Barcelona's teenage sensation Lamine Yamal 'doesn't have the essence or soul' of a Real Madrid player. While dismissing the winger as unfit for Los Blancos, Zamorano showered praise on Pedri, calling him a 'phenomenon' and urging Barcelona to better guide Yamal amid recent off-field distractions.

Former Madrid striker Zamorano has launched a strong criticism of Barcelona's 18-year-old winger Yamal, saying the youngster “isn't the essence or the soul of what a Real Madrid player should be.”

The Chilean described Yamal as a talented player lacking the maturity and character expected at the Santiago Bernabeu. His comments arrive amid growing scrutiny of the teenager's attitude and professionalism after a turbulent few weeks both on and off the pitch.

Speaking to El Chiringuito's Josep Pedrerol on El Cafelito the ex-Madrid star made his feelings clear when comparing Yamal to Barcelona midfielder Pedri, whom he described as a perfect example of humility and class.

“I wouldn't sign Lamine Yamal for Real Madrid. He's a star, but he doesn't embody the essence or soul of what a Real Madrid player should be,” Zamorano said. “I would sign Pedri, who is a star and a phenomenon... and without saying a word. He is humble, down-to-earth, and speaks only when necessary. Pedri has the essence, the soul, of Real Madrid.”

Zamorano, who represented Los Blancos between 1992 and 1996, went on to emphasise that players wearing the white shirt must reflect the club's “class and culture.” He added: “Real Madrid is a team with class and culture, and the players who play for Madrid have to represent that. I never heard Messi say that Real Madrid steals, and he was the best in the world.”

His remark was a direct reference to Yamal's pre-Clasico Twitch stream, where the teenager stirred controversy by quipping: “Yes, of course, they steal, they complain.” The comment reportedly angered several Madrid players and added fuel to the growing criticism surrounding his maturity.

Despite his criticism, Zamorano offered advice for Barca, suggesting that Yamal still has the potential to become a legendary player if properly mentored. “They have to try to guide Lamine Yamal. That way he'll only become a great player. Players who leave a legacy are made of a different breed,” he said.

The young winger's struggles have been evident on and off the field. He has been battling a recurring groin issue, while also dealing with increased media scrutiny following his recent breakup with singer Nicki Nicole. He was also involved in a spat with Real Madrid captain Dani Carvajal at the end of the recent Clasico clash between the two sides, which the Bernabeu club won 2-1.

Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick, who continues to back the teenager publicly, addressed Yamal's fitness concerns after the 3-1 win over Elche. “He has to manage his injury; he's disciplined. He has to train, undergo treatment... he's doing it. I can't say the injury is over; it comes and goes. And he has to manage it,” Flick explained.

The German manager has privately expressed frustration over the mounting distractions surrounding the winger but remains hopeful that Yamal's focus will return once his injury stabilises and media pressure eases.

Barcelona's attention now shifts back to football as they prepare to face Club Brugge in the Champions League. The Catalan giants currently sit ninth in the continental table and will aim for a crucial win to strengthen their qualification hopes before facing Celta Vigo in La Liga.

Trailing five points behind leaders Real Madrid, Flick's men are under pressure to close the gap before the international break. With fixtures piling up, the German coach is counting on his young stars including Yamal, who has four goals from nine matches this season, to rediscover their rhythm and help steady the club's form during a crucial phase of the campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Barcelona's turbulent season has taken another turn, with coach Hansi Flick reportedly informing his staff that he plans to leave the club at the end of the campaign. Frustrated by player attitudes and a perceived lack of support from the board, Flick's disillusionment has been deepened by ongoing issues surrounding Lamine Yamal's conduct and the club's lenient approach toward their young star.

Flick's tenure at Barca appears to be nearing an early end. According to ABC, the German coach has privately informed his staff of his decision to step down at the end of the season, admitting that he feels “very tired” and disillusioned by the atmosphere within the squad.

Flick, who had originally envisioned a three-year project in Catalonia, has grown increasingly exasperated with what he sees as a decline in professionalism and unity among his players. Despite good performances in certain spells, the German is said to be concerned by a lack of focus and commitment, particularly from individuals who have, in his words, “lost the humility that once defined them.”

The coach's frustrations are not directed at results alone, but at what he considers a cultural issue within the dressing room - a team distracted by fame, social media, and individual interests rather than collective goals. Flick has reportedly discussed these concerns with his assistants and analysts for months, expressing doubts about his ability to change the mentality from within.

At the centre of Flick's frustration lies Yamal, the teenage sensation whose talent has been overshadowed by off-field distractions. The club's willingness to indulge the 18-year-old's behaviour from special privileges on team trips to skipping recovery routines for media obligations has reportedly caused tension within the coaching staff.

Incidents have piled up: from Yamal flying to Milan after the defeat against Real Madrid instead of returning with teammates, to filming commercials while nursing a groin injury. Even minor breaches, like using golf carts reserved for staff or being the only player served meals at his table, have fuelled Flick's sense of unequal treatment. The teenager also sparked controversy before El Clasico when he jokingly remarked on Twitch that “Real Madrid steal, they complain…”, a comment that angered several Madrid players and drew criticism within the club. His recent breakup with singer Nicki Nicole has further added to off-field distractions, amplifying the perception that Yamal's focus has drifted away from football.

For Flick, the problem goes beyond discipline, it's about values. He believes Yamal's decline in performance stems from a waning sense of responsibility, and that the player's recurring pubalgia injury reflects a lack of proper commitment to recovery. The coach, who prioritises strict discipline and mental focus, is frustrated at being repeatedly asked about Yamal in press conferences rather than team performance. This has reportedly led him to express his dissatisfaction to senior club figures, including Joan Laporta's confidant Alejandro Echevarria and communications head Gabriel Martinez, who have tried to ease tensions internally.

Despite the growing strain, the 60-year-old's relationship with president Laporta and sporting director Deco remains polite and professional. However, significant philosophical differences persist between the coaching staff and the club hierarchy. Flick believes in firm discipline, a philosophy reminiscent of Luis Enrique's approach that transformed Ousmane Dembele, who went on to win the Ballon d'Or. In contrast, the club prefers to protect and appease its young stars, allowing personal freedom in hopes of maintaining morale and avoiding public fallout.

This divergence has led to frequent internal debates over how to manage Yamal's situation. The club argue that flexibility is necessary given his age and public profile, while Flick insists that indulging such behaviour undermines accountability and team culture. As he first warned back in September that “Egos kill success,” he has reportedly repeated the same message to his staff in recent weeks, a clear sign of how deeply the issue has frustrated him.

Despite the clear tension, ABC also reports that Flick's departure is not yet final. His closest assistants believe the situation could still change, particularly if results improve and harmony returns to the dressing room.

Those within the coaching setup point to the emotional volatility of football, where a winning run or a major trophy could shift the narrative completely. A strong finish to the season, or even a Champions League triumph, could convince Flick to complete his third and originally planned final year at the club.

For now, however, the feeling around the Barca headquarters is one of uncertainty. A fractured dressing room, a fatigued coach, and a generational talent struggling under the spotlight have once again plunged Barcelona into familiar turmoil, leaving the future of Flick's project hanging by a thread.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

England international and Aston Villa star Tyrone Mings suffered an injury against Liverpool that will keep him out of action until 2026. The news comes as a huge blow for the centre-back ahead of the World Cup next summer, as his chances of returning to the England squad have been further diminished. Mings last played for the Three Lions in 2023.

Mings had only just returned from an ankle injury, which he suffered during Aston Villa's 3-1 win over Fulham in the Premier League in September. The injury kept him out of action for the club's matches in October but he returned off the bench against Liverpool last weekend. He was introduced in the match in the 74th minute in place of Pau Torres but pulled up in stoppage time as he sprinted back to defend against Mohamed Salah. Mings clutched the back of his right leg due to a hamstring problem and left Anfield in discomfort.

After the game, Emery confirmed Mings' injury setback and predicted that the defender could be out for four weeks. The Spanish coach said: ""It's his hamstring. Yes, normally some weeks he will be out with an injury like that. But tomorrow we will test him and know exactly how much he will stay out of the team.""

According to The Athletic, Mings underwent scans on Monday and the reports have now shown that it is indeed a hamstring injury and quite a serious one, which keeps him sidelined for up to seven weeks. This means that the defender will no longer be available for selection for the rest of the 2025 calendar year. 

The England international has been plagued with several injuries since the start of the 2023-24 campaign, appearing in only 31 matches across competitions in this timeframe. In August 2023, Mings was sidelined after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament. In the current campaign, the central defender has started in six out of the eight Premier League matches he has played.

Mings last played for England in 2023 against Malta in a European Championship qualifying game. Since then, his continuous injuries have kept him out of the Three Lions squad. Mings, who has never played under England boss Thomas Tuchel, was hoping to impress the German coach this season to get a chance in England's World Cup squad, however, this latest injury comes as a major blow. With the defender out till 2026, it is unlikely that he will get enough time to attain full match fitness and play regularly in the second half of the season in a bid to catch Tuchel's eye. 

The 32-year-old is also a leader on the pitch and has played an influential role in the Villa dressing room. His absence from the team will surely impact their performance. 

Emery has fielded the centre-back pairing of Ezri Konsa and Pau Torres quite often this season and the duo will likely continue to feature in the starting lineup in the absence of Mings. Villa also have ex-Manchester United star Victor Lindelof and Lamare Bogarde in their ranks, both of whom could fill in when either of Konsa or Torres are suspended or injured.

The Villans next face Maccabi Tel Aviv in a Europa League fixture on November 5, before taking on Bournemouth in the Premier League on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ex-Bayern Munich star praises coach's 'direct and clear vision' and expects 'magnificent' career from former Man City captain","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/vincent-kompany-leadership-contagious-bayern-munich-praises-coach-direct-clear-vision-career-man-city-captain/blt4f2ba9192fb1802d","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:19:19 GMT","

Leroy Sane has praised Vincent Kompany's leadership and vision amid Bayern Munich's 16-game winning run this season. The German winger, who played under Kompany last season, believes the Belgian's influence is already clear at Bayern and expects him to have a brilliant coaching career, while he focuses on his new start at Galatasaray.

The reigning Bundesliga champions are enjoying a dominant run this season under Kompany, remaining unbeaten in all competitions. On Tuesday, the German giants extended their winning streak to 16 by beating Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 despite going down to 10 men after Luis Diaz received a red card before half-time.

Bayern shocked many when they appointed the Belgian following Burnley's relegation from the Premier League ahead of the 2024-25 season. However, Kompany proved his worth as he led the team to the Bundesliga title in his first season. The Bavarians' strong start this season convinced the board to extend Kompany's contract until 2029, securing his future at the club well beyond his previous deal, which was due to expire in the summer of 2027.

Sane, who played alongside Kompany at Manchester City from 2016 to 2019 and under him at Bayern last season, spoke highly of his former captain and manager's coaching approach. 

In an interview with Sky Sport, the German winger called Kompany 'a true leader' and a manager with a clear vision of the game.

""I was absolutely thrilled when Vincent Kompany became Bayern's coach, especially since I was still there at the time,"" Sane said. 

""I knew what kind of guy he was, what he was like as a teammate, and how he operates as a person. He's very direct and has a clear vision of football. You can see that now: he has a clear structure, a philosophy, and knows exactly what he expects from himself and the team. He's a true leader, and that's contagious, everyone wants to follow along. After his magnificent playing career, he's sure to have a magnificent coaching career as well. I'm very happy for him,"" he added.

Sane is the latest of many to heap praise on the former Anderlecht coach recently. A former Schalke director opened up on the impressive PowerPoint presentation Kompany gave as he considered taking over at the German club before eventually taking over at Burnley. His ""courageous"" decision to drop Harry Kane from the starting XI last week was also highlighted by club legend Lothar Matthaus, who says the coach clearly shows trust in his players.

The 29-year-old, who joined Galatasaray as a free agent this summer, reflected on his time in Munich. The German winger scored 61 goals and provided 55 assists in 220 appearances for Bayern across all competitions before deciding not to extend his contract, which expired in June. Sane revealed that he remains in touch with a few of his former teammates and is happy to see the team's success this season.

""I was just talking to Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich the other day. We're still in touch,"" Sane revealed. ""When I have time, I naturally watch their games too. I'm really happy that they're doing so well and I hope they keep pushing. And of course, when Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies rejoin the team soon, it'll only make them stronger. I'm really happy for the team.""

At Galatasaray, Sane is focused on replicating the impact he had at Bayern. After a slow start in Turkey, the winger is gradually finding his rhythm, having scored three goals and provided two assists in 13 appearances this season. The Turkish giants sit atop the Super Lig with nine wins from 11 games and are preparing for a Champions League clash against Ajax on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, red-hot Bayern will return to Germany for a trip to Berlin to face Union Berlin, aiming to extend their lead in the Bundesliga table. They are currently five points ahead of RB Leipzig and look unstoppable, with Harry Kane and Diaz leading the charge.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

NFL icon and Birmingham City minority owner Tom Brady has claimed that his dog, Junie, is a genetic clone of family pet Lua, who died in 2023. According to the former quarterback, the cloning was carried out by Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology firm in which Brady is an investor. The news was announced in a statement by Colossal as they look to lead the industry in the technology.

Colossal's statement on Brady's dog took the internet by surprise. The company also confirmed its purchase of another cloning company, Viagen Pets and Equine. The two firms are set to combine their research and technology to expand cloning services for both domestic animals and conservation purposes, with the hope of expanding worldwide. Brady said: ""I love my animals, they mean everything to me and my family. A few years ago, Colossal used a non-invasive method to collect a small blood sample from our older dog before she passed away. That allowed them to create Junie, who's a clone of Lua."" 

Brady described the experience as a ""second chance"" for his family, saying he was encouraged by how the technology could ""bring comfort to families who lose their pets while also supporting efforts to protect endangered species"".

Viagen, now owned by Colossal, is known for cloning pets for high-profile clients, including Barbra Streisand and Paris Hilton. The company operates under technology licenses from the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, which created the famous Dolly the Sheep in 1996. After being founded in 2021, Colossal has gained global attention for its ambitious ""de-extinction"" research projects, including attempts to revive species such as the woolly mammoth and the dodo. The company recently claimed to have cloned three dire wolf pups. Financial details of Colossal's acquisition of Viagen have not been disclosed, but reports suggest Viagen's dog cloning services are typically priced between $50,000 and $85,000.

Cloning pets has been a controversial topic in popular culture, often featuring in discussions about the ethics of recreating animals. Brady, now a broadcaster for Fox Sports, a seven-time Super Bowl winner, and minority owner of Championship club Birmingham, said he doesn't see Junie as a scientific experiment but simply as ""part of our family"".

Brady has been very busy since retiring from the NFL in 2023. Alongside his broadcasting duties, the 48-year-old has a stake in Birmingham City, who play in England's second division, as well as the Las Vegas Raiders Stateside. He has often been spotted in the stands at Birmingham games, and has even gone so far as to speak with potential new signings for the Midlands club, as they look to compete with Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's Wrexham.

Summer signing Marvin Ducksch revealed that he spoke with Brady in the process of signing for the Blues, and it convinced him how dedicated the NFL legend is to his football passion. He said: ""When I arrived for the medical and the contract signing, they handed me the phone, and I was allowed to speak with Tom Brady. That inspired me even more to speak with the GOAT in person. That was when I finally knew I had made the right decision.""

Brady's animal experiments are just another investment to be added to his portfolio in retirement. In the world of sports, he will be delighted to see the progress of Birmingham since claiming a stake in the club. They currently sit ninth in the Championship table, having won six of their 14 games so far this season. Brady will also take pleasure in seeing that his side are above Wrexham, who currently reside in 16th, four points below the Blues - although the two did play out a 1-1 draw at the start of October. Next up for Brady's men is a trip to Middlesbrough, a team vying for the automatic promotion spots this season.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Marseille's Champions League hopes have been hit hard by injuries, and Roberto De Zerbi made no effort to hide his frustration ahead of Wednesday's clash against Atalanta. The Italian manager admitted that his squad is stretched to its limits, with several key players sidelined and little time to recover between games.

Marseille had hoped to welcome back a few players for Wednesday's game, but De Zerbi confirmed in Tuesday's press conference that there would be no returns. Timothy Weah, Bilal Nadir, Leonardo Balerdi, Facundo Medina, Amine Gouiri, Hamed Junior Traore and Geoffrey Kondogbia are all ruled out of the European clash against Atalanta. To make matters worse, Nayef Aguerd's availability remains doubtful after his late withdrawal before last weekend's win over Auxerre. Emerson Palmieri is suspended, while Pol Lirola and Neal Maupay are not included in Marseille's UEFA list, leaving De Zerbi with very few options.

In the pre-match press conference, De Zerbi opened up about the club's mounting injuries and didn't hide his disappointment with the current situation.

""Do you think I'm happy to play a Champions League match with eight or nine injured players, plus a suspended one? No, not at all,"" the Italian manager said. 

""In analysing the situation, you have to consider everything. Great things often happen in adversity. The victory in Auxerre, where we didn't play well, came at a time when we were in serious trouble. The sun will shine again when Traore, Gouiri, Balerdi, Weah, Kondogbia, and all the injured players return. It will be a little easier. It's in the midst of problems that you have to give your best.""

The Italian manager also voiced his frustration with Marseille's packed run of fixtures, saying the constant turnaround between games has left his squad exhausted. The 46-year-old revealed that before the Auxerre match, the team could only hold a walking session because they had played just two days earlier. 

""We did it walking because we had only played two days earlier. It was a way of saying that we had prepared for the match without the intensity of a normal training session. You can't prepare for a match 24 hours in advance,"" he added.

""I like controversy, that's part of why I came here [to Marseille]. When you ask questions, it pleases me because you're always looking for a sharp retort. It's not about controversy, it's about truth. I have many flaws, but lying isn't one of them; I'm telling you the truth. We played poorly against Angers, but we lost two points in the 95th minute. We played poorly against Auxerre, but I see that some teams are doing less than us to win. From the match against Lorient - where we brought in six key players - until now, Marseille would be top of the table. I'd like to play better, but some of the criticism is a bit disastrous and harsher than reality.""

With only a few days to recover before facing the Serie A club, De Zerbi admitted the situation remains far from ideal. ""It's a difficult time, so we need to be a bit tougher and more determined. If we can get through tough times like these, things will get better.""

The injury pile-up has clearly taken its toll on Marseille's rhythm. After that explosive 6-2 win where Mason Greenwood stole the show with four goals, things have gone downhill fast. They have since lost to Sporting CP and Lens, drawn 2-2 with Angers, and managed a sluggish 1-0 win over bottom-placed Auxerre.

Still, Marseille haven't let PSG run away with a big lead. They sit second in Ligue 1, just two points behind Luis Enrique's side, who are also battling their own injury crisis. But with the schedule piling up and key players missing, it's no surprise De Zerbi's men look a little worn down juggling both league and European nights.

While De Zerbi has urged his players to dig deep, the coming weeks will be a real test for the squad. After facing Atalanta, Marseille host Brest before a tricky away trip to Nice, followed by another demanding Champions League clash against Newcastle at home. De Zerbi will hope his patched-up squad can rediscover their form despite a deep injury crisis.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Even with her semifinal spot secured, Elena Rybakina treated her final group match as unfinished business -- and closed out an undefeated run in Riyadh with her trademark precision.

Elena Rybakina had already secured a spot in the WTA Finals semifinals before taking the court Wednesday, but her final round-robin match still carried weight. Ranking points were on the line, along with the chance to preserve her perfect record in Riyadh.

Standing in her way: Ekaterina Alexandrova.

WTA Finals: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Despite entering the match with a losing record against Alexandrova, Rybakina continued her dominant run, winning 6-4, 6-4 in 1 hour and 14 minutes. The victory allowed her to finish with a perfect 3-0 mark in Serena Williams Group play.

“Every match I play, I want to win,” Rybakina said after the match. “Each win gives you confidence, so I'm really happy with that for now. The last few matches have been great and hopefully I can continue that.”

Rybakina had originally been scheduled to face Madison Keys, but tournament officials announced Keys had withdrawn hours before the match due to a viral illness.

""Really disappointed to not be feeling my best and ultimately having to withdraw from the tournament,” Keys said in a statement. ""Huge accomplishment to make it this far and very proud of myself for doing that and having a great year. I hope to be back next year.”

Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, went 0-2 in Riyadh, most recently falling in three sets to Amanda Anisimova. She had already been eliminated from semifinal contention.

The first alternate Mirra Andreeva declined to play, citing fitness concerns. That opened the door for second alternate Alexandrova to make her WTA Finals debut at age 30.

Still, the odds were stacked against Alexandrova. Rybakina had already acclimated to the conditions at King Saud University Indoor Arena and looked every bit a title contender through the early stages of the tournament.

Alexandrova arrived ready to play, winning the first six points and staying level with Rybakina through the first eight games. But Rybakina struck at the most opportune time, seizing her first break opportunity for a 5-4 lead before holding at love to close out the opening set in 35 minutes.

That break proved decisive, as Rybakina converted her lone chance while Alexandrova went 0-for-3.

In the second set, Alexandrova regrouped, holding serve to open with a 1-0 lead. But Rybakina broke twice to surge ahead 5-2. Serving for the match, she was broken for the first time, then faced two more break points while attempting to serve it out at 5-4.

Ultimately, a pair of aces -- her seventh and eighth of the match -- helped seal the win.

It was a strong effort from Alexandrova in her debut at the year-end championships, earning praise from her opponent.

“Ekaterina is always a tough opponent,” Rybakina said. “She has a big serve, and especially in the beginning it was difficult to return, so I'm pretty happy that I managed to win in two sets in the end.”

Rybakina finishes group play as the outright winner of the Serena Williams Group, dropping just one set en route to three consecutive top-10 victories.

Her latest win was her ninth over a Top 10 opponent in 2025, extending her career-high mark for a season. Since 1990, it's the most in a season by any player representing an Asian country, surpassing Li Na's eight in 2011 and 2013.

With her fifth year-end No.1 finish, Katerina Siniakova equals Martina Navratilova's record and extends her reign as one of doubles' most consistent champions.

RIHADH, Saudi Arabia – The WTA on Wednesday announced the Czech Republic's Katerina Siniakova has secured the WTA Year-End Doubles No.1 Ranking presented by PIF, earning the accolade for the fifth time in her career.

To celebrate Siniakova's incredible 2025 season, she was honored during a special presentation at the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF earlier where she officially received the year-end No.1 trophy.

Siniakova previously ended the season in the elite ranking position in 2018 (when co-ranked No.1 with Barbora Krejčíková), 2021, 2022, and 2024, now tied with Martina Navratilova, each recording five seasons for the most No.1 doubles year-end finishes in WTA history.

This wasn't her only history-making achievement this season, as the week of November 10, 2025 will mark Siniakova's 169th week holding the No.1 position -- now the third-most weeks in WTA history, behind only Liezel Huber (199) and Navratilova (237).

Siniakova's 2025 season has been defined by excellence and versatility across multiple team partnerships. She captured four titles, beginning with the Australian Open and the WTA 1000 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, both alongside Taylor Townsend. She later claimed another WTA 1000 crown at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open with Storm Hunter and added a WTA 500 title at the Korea Open Tennis Championships with long-time partner Barbora Krejcikova.

""It feels very special, it's amazing for me and I'm just so happy I've done it again,” Siniakova said. ""There's been so many great memories this season and I'm just so grateful I can lift this trophy again.""

In addition to her titles, Siniakova and Townsend reached the US Open final and are currently competing at the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF, where they have already advanced to the semifinals following two group stage victories.

With her latest milestone, Siniakova continues to cement her place among the legends of women's doubles, showcasing remarkable consistency, adaptability, and competitive spirit throughout her career.

Five year-end No. 1 finishes and 11 major titles later, Katerina Siniakova still can't quite believe her name sits alongside the ones she grew up watching.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- A year ago, Katerina Siniakova finished as the year-end No. 1 doubles player for the fourth time.

“Suddenly, they were talking about the only one that did it five times was Martina [Navratilova],” Siniakova said Wednesday evening. “So from that moment, I was like, `Oh, I'm so close.' 

“I'm just super happy and glad it happened this year. It's a privilege to be on the same page as Martina.”

Next week will be Siniakova's 169th week at No. 1, third behind only Navratilova (237) and Liezel Huber (199).

Indeed, the 29-year-old from the Czech Republic shares the record with one of her idols, who was born in what was once known as Czechoslovakia. Siniakova was honored in a ceremony and hoisted the trophy -- the Martina Navratilova Trophy.

On Tuesday, No. 1 seeds Siniakova and Taylor Townsend defeated defending champions and No. 3 seeds Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe 6-4, 7-6 (3). That made them the Liezel Huber Group winners. 

“We stuck to our plan and played together very, very well,” Townsend said afterward. “No gaps. Even when we were down, we stayed together kept the good energy … we just kept working the plan -- and it worked.”

They play their third round-robin match on Thursday against Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider, who have already been eliminated. A semifinal match awaits on Friday.

Among the 24 players who qualified for Riyadh, Siniakova has won the most Grand Slam titles -- a total of 11. 

She won seven (two each at the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon and one at the US Open) with longtime partner and fellow Czech Barbora Krejcikova. After they parted in 2023, Siniakova teamed with Coco Gauff to win 2024 Roland Garros.

Playing in only their third tournament together, Townsend and Siniakova won Wimbledon and, in their seventh, the 2025 Australian Open. Siniakova also paired with Sem Verbeek to win the mixed doubles crown this year at Wimbledon.

Her 10 women's doubles already fit into history's matrix. Since 1996, Venus and Serena Williams have the most major doubles wins (14), followed by Martina Hingis (13). Siniakova and Virginia Ruano Pascual are next with 10. 

“Those names, I was watching them growing up,” Siniakova said. “And now to be almost there, it's really nice. It's hard to describe it in words -- it just means a lot.

Earlier this summer, Townsend briefly passed Siniakova as the No. 1-ranked doubles player when she and Zhang Shuai, playing together for the first time, advanced to the Washington, D.C. final.

“It is a dream,” Townsend said. “It's one of the goals that I set for myself when I actually began to think it was attainable.”

Said Siniakova, “She said in the beginning of the year that this is her goal. I was so happy for her because she deserved it.

After losing in the US Open finals, their plans diverged. Both players actively pursue their singles careers, with Siniakova currently at No. 49 and Townsend at No. 118 -- although her career high is No. 46. That disparity means they sometimes don't play the same tournaments.

They were supposed to play the WTA 1000 in Beijing, but Townsend wasn't feeling great. Eventually, she played singles in Osaka. Siniakova, playing with three different partners, remarkably won Seoul with Krejcikova and Wuhan with Storm Hunter before reaching the semifinals in Ningbo with Hsieh Su-Wei. That haul of points gave her a comfortable cushion at the No. 1 spot.

They plan to play the 2026 Grand Slams and as many WTA 1000s as possible.

Like a number of successful teams in history, Townsend (a lefty) and Siniakova (a righty) swing from opposite sides.

“It's always a compliment to be able to have a lefty because you don't see it very often,” Towsend said. “It is an advantage …

“… for me,” Siniakova interjected.

“For Kat,” Townsend said. “And for me, someone so good. I think that we complement each other well, but ultimately it goes down to our game styles, but also our ability to work together on the court. And that's what doubles is about.”

Sitting in the players' lounge, Siniakova continually shook her head as she discussed her growing place in the game.

“I cannot even believe it,” she said. “I'm just so happy I can have such success. I hope it's not the end. I'm definitely hungry for more.”

Five year-end No. 1 finishes and 11 major titles later, Katerina Siniakova still can't quite believe her name sits alongside the ones she grew up watching.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Sara Sorribes Tormo is to make her return to tennis this month following a six-month hiatus in which the Olympic doubles bronze medalist was diagnosed with depression. The former No. 32 plans to play the WTA 125 event in Colina, Chile starting on Nov. 17.

The Spaniard has not played since the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers in April, in which she won both her singles and doubles rubbers. In an interview with El Mundo, she said that after losing her passion for the sport, she was unsure if she would ever return.

""I couldn't even step onto a tennis court,"" Sorribes Tormo said. ""I'd wake up in the morning and think that the more hours I had until I could train, the better. I'd step onto the court and want to leave immediately. I'd go to training and not last more than 10 minutes. I'd burst into tears in the middle of training. After I'd been out for a month, I came to play here with my mother and lasted three minutes; I had a panic attack and we had to leave.

""It was killing me not to enjoy it, because I've always loved tennis and I've always played to try and improve. I lost that passion. I just wanted the hours to pass. It was like coming to clock in. I didn't want to be there. I didn't want to go to tournaments. That, combined with a lot of anxiety, made things very difficult.""

At first, almost completely out of energy, Sorribes Tormo could do little more than sleep all day. Whenever she thought she felt better, she'd relapse and need even more rest. For a player who'd made her reputation by tirelessly outlasting opponents on tour -- the 29-year-old's matches habitually passed the three-hour mark -- this was not a situation she was accustomed to.

""It was like nothing made sense,"" Sorribes Tormo told El Mundo.

Gradually, matters improved. There was ""a lot of therapy, a lot of internal reflection and a lot of personal work."" Sorribes Tormo set up a home gym so she could stay fit without leaving the house. She began to discover a love of hiking and headed out to do the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage solo -- an experience she describes as ""wonderful.""

A post shared by Sara Sorribes Tormo (@sarasorribes)

Getting away from the all-consuming nature of life as a tennis pro turned out to be the key to finding her way back to the sport. Sorribes Tormo returns to the circuit with an identity beyond her results.

""f things don't go well, if I decide this isn't what I want to do, I'm at peace,"" she said. ""Because I know there are other things out there, and I've already experienced them. I know that Sara can live without playing tennis, that I really enjoy life outside of tennis. I think that's fundamental to starting with. When you carry less baggage, you feel much lighter.""

Novak Djokovic has made a winning start to his campaign in Athens, defeating Chile's Alejandro Tabilo in straight sets in his opening match at the ATP 250 indoor hard-court event, 7-6 (3), 6-1.And it was a special victory for a few reasons, most notably because Tabilo had won both of the pair's two previous meetings—in straight sets, no less—in Rome last year and Monte Carlo earlier this year.But only one player—Roger Federer—has ever won their first three career meetings against Djokovic, and he'll now remain alone in that stat.""I'm really thrilled to get through tonight,"" Djokovic said in his on-court interview. ""To get through against Tabilo, who I had never won against—we played two times on clay court and he won both matches—I was under more tension and stress before this match than in most matches.""I drew energy and support from the crowd and I want to thank you.""

There was little between the two players in the marathon 68-minute first set on Tuesday, with neither budging on serve—Djokovic had double break point in the very first game of the match, but Tabilo saved them both, and they would turn out to be the only break points of the first set.But come crunch time it was all Djokovic, as he jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the tie-break, eventually taking it, 7-3, and then after trading holds in the first two games of the second set he caught fire again, reeling off five games in a row from 1-all for a runaway victory.He finished the match with 27 winners to 21 unforced errors, with some spectacular serving that produced 13 aces to zero double faults.It was his first career win in his new home base.""It feels like home playing in Athens,"" he told the crowd. ""A few months ago when I came here with my family, I was really very excited because I always loved Greece—all Serbia loves Greece for sure. We have a lot of things connecting us.

Over the last 18 months, a few points played between Jessica Pegula and Aryna Sabalenka may have changed the court of tennis history foreverIt's not an exaggeration when one considers that Sabalenka, a future Hall of Famer even at this stage of her career, has beaten Pegula on the way to a pair of Grand Slam titles, and two WTA 1000 crowns, since last season began. After the latest installment in their head-to-head at the WTA Finals on Tuesday—a 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 win for Sabalenka in their second meeting at the year-end championships—the two players agreed that they bring out the best in each other.But Pegula lamented once again falling just short: this time, from a break ahead in the final frame.She has now lost nine of 12 matches against Sabalenka all-time, a d the last three have played out in three dramatic sets.""I do think we have really great matches, memorable matches,"" she said. ""I wish I won more of them ... even my coaches were saying, they're like, 'Whenever you guys play each other, it seems like you guys seem to bring out such a high level in each other.'""So, I feel like, do I love losing? No. But I feel like, if you asked me in 10 years, like I look back and had all these super memorable matches with her. I think it's, it's pretty cool. I just wish I won more of them.""

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto sits down with F1.com's Alasdair Hooper to discuss his rookie year in Formula 1, the key lessons he's learned and how much he's looking forward to racing in front of his home crowd in Brazil.

One year ago, Kick Sauber confirmed the signing of Gabriel Bortoleto. At that point the young Brazilian was a Formula 3 champion, was challenging for the Formula 2 title and had just spent the 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend inside the F1 paddock in his role as a McLaren academy driver.

Fast forward 12 months and much has changed. The 21-year-old bagged that F2 championship – matching the likes of Oscar Piastri by securing back-to-back F3 and F2 titles – and has already showcased his immense potential as he approaches his first home Grand Prix as an F1 racer.

His Sauber team boss Jonathan Wheatley has been unequivocal in his praise. “The real deal” was how he described Bortoleto, and Wheatley has worked with his fair share of F1 stars.

There have also been some eye-catching results along the way. A sixth-place finish in Hungary is the pick of the bunch, while there were two P8s in Austria and Monza. After three races outside the top 10 he returned to the points at the Mexico City Grand Prix last time out.

“It was a great achievement in my career to be joining Formula 1,” says Bortoleto when I ask him if he can believe it has almost been a year since he was confirmed as a Sauber driver.

“It has been my dream since I started racing and obviously, almost a year now, it feels amazing.

“It has been a very long season this year, so far. A lot of races, a lot of things to learn from my side and a lot of time spent as well with the team. But, yeah, it feels amazing.”

With the Sao Paulo Grand Prix marking Round 21 of 24, Bortoleto is closing in on the end of his rookie season in motorsport's top echelon. Undoubtedly there has been much to learn along the way.

“I mean, the amount of media commitments we have in Formula 1 – it's unreal, it's so many things!” he laughs.

“That's definitely one of the things that surprised me the most. You still need to keep your energy level up and you have so many things to attend during the week and so many meetings as well.

“It becomes a much more professional thing, and you need to adapt.”

Adapting is pivotal for anyone making their first steps in F1, where the off-track commitments are almost as fast-paced as racing around a circuit. But Bortoleto couldn't have better mentors around him.

In four-time World Champion Max Verstappen – the pair are close and sim race together – and two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso – Bortoleto is part of his driver management agency – the Brazilian has two modern day greats to learn from.

“When they're off track, they do what they like at home, relax, and I think they recover their energy and they come to a new weekend ready for the next race,” he explains, singling out the pair's ability to manage their time when so much is required of an F1 driver.

“I've learnt from Fernando and Max, watching them and how they behave off track and everything.”

He continues: “I think there's always work to do [for me]. I still feel like I need to do a step in that sense.

“But I feel like I'm much more comfortable now going into the weekends, much more relaxed with my energy levels arriving on Sunday – still quite high and able to perform the best way I want – while, maybe at the beginning of the season, I felt like I was getting a bit more exhausted before we even started [practice] because I was putting too much energy on Thursdays, and on Wednesdays.

“It could be so easy just to feel like you've got to go all in to prove yourself. But sometimes it's [about] less and sometimes doing a bit less.

“It's still putting a lot of effort in things and studying and doing; I still believe I do a lot. But [I do] a bit less than what I was doing at the beginning of the season in some senses – but with more quality, with more understanding of things.”

Bortoleto has already shown himself to be a passionately hard worker, revealing on F1's Beyond The Grid podcast that he often gets straight onto his home simulator after a Grand Prix on Sunday. “It's when you have everything fresh in your mind,” he told host Tom Clarkson, who was trying to get his head around the driver getting back behind the (virtual) wheel straight after a race.

“That's what I love about my private life,” he tells me when I ask about that passion for the sim. “It's about going home and doing my sim, spending time with my friends, playing and driving on other cars and testing with F1.

“I think this is how I recharge my energy. I think that's what I actually like to spend a lot of time doing, that I feel like the days pass and I've done what I loved from the beginning of the day to the end of the day.

“I feel like this is a way of me disconnecting a bit from F1 weekends and still doing something I love but being able to recharge.”

Finding that balance is one of the key factors for Bortoleto in helping him perform to the best of his ability – and there is no denying the importance he puts on his loved ones around him as part of that.

“Obviously F1 is my priority, it's my sport,” he adds. “It's what I'm committed to in my life.
“I think about it every single second of my day. I'm doing things related to it, but my private life is also very important for me. Spending time with family, my girlfriend, my friends, doing things I love.

“It's also a priority in my life and I manage to balance both things very well.”

Sauber went into 2025 off the back of a challenging 2024, Zhou Guanyu landing the squad's only points score with the four he collected at the Qatar Grand Prix – that year's penultimate race.

As a result, even with the team's all-new line-up of Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg, expectations for 2025 were low, with many assuming the squad would focus on 2026 – when they become Audi's works team – as new F1 regulations come into force.

While that focus on 2026 has been present, as it has to be for the entire grid, Sauber did not stand still this season. They may sit ninth in the heavily congested Teams' Championship, but their haul of 60 points is 56 more than last year already. What's more, they are only 12 points behind sixth-placed Racing Bulls.

On an individual level, that has allowed Sauber's drivers to star on the track and showcase their talent on a more regular basis – Hulkenberg's British Grand Prix podium a prime example, while Bortoleto's own points-scoring exploits (in Austria, Hungary and Italy in particular) have only helped to enhance his reputation and the excitement there is around the 21-year-old.

“It's just unreal what we have been able to do since we started the season,” Bortoleto says, reflecting on the team's improvements. “You know, [we were on the] back foot and the car was not behaving as we expected. Turning things around and being able to be fighting for points constantly now has been a big thing for us.

“I'm so happy. I'm glad for the team because I see how much hard work they put into things, and how much time is spent, and we deserve some good results.”

Does that improved performance give him a sense of pride, I ask, given he's able to showcase his talent?

“Yes, obviously it's always nice that people know what you're capable of,” he responds. “But I believe, at the same time, I never felt inside the team any pressure or anything to show something. They always knew what I was capable of, and they trusted me.

“But obviously I put this pressure myself, I wanted to deliver for the team because that's why I'm here, I need to deliver results. I think it was very good from their side, and from my side, and a combination of things that [meant] we're able to reach the level we are now.”

Perhaps one of the key reasons we are seeing Bortoleto take to F1 like a duck to water is that he's already battle-hardened, having fought for – and won – both the F3 and F2 titles at the first time of asking.

“So much,” he says, when I ask how much he's learned from those seasons fighting at the front.

“I've been fighting for titles for two years in a row and that's the biggest pressure you can feel – when you know you have only one year to perform in Formula 2 and in Formula 3, and if you don't perform, maybe you're not in the grid next year in Formula 1 or in Formula 2.

“You never know what can happen in your life, so you need to deliver the results as soon as possible and I knew that was the situation. I think that pressure I felt in F2 and F3 prepared me for my season.”

It's a different type of pressure now for Bortoleto. He may not be a championship contender, as he was for the previous two years of his racing career, but his efforts are now geared towards helping Sauber enter their new era.

Patience will be key, as the squad hold lofty ambitions to one day fight for titles, but for that, Bortoleto is taking inspiration from a Netflix documentary on one of the sport's true greats.

“Well, it's definitely something I've been learning,” he says when I ask about adjusting from fighting at the very front to what he is doing now.

“Obviously there's still the feeling of not fighting for wins; it's a topic for me that I keep fighting because I truly believe I have the potential to do that. I just need maybe the opportunity to achieve that. Hopefully we will do soon.

“We are working for that, but it's part of a process. To be honest, yesterday I watched again Schumacher's Netflix series – I've watched [it] already many times – but I like to re-watch things sometimes and you see his progress with Ferrari when he joined and, everything he developed with the team and then winning the championship.

“I feel like it's a bit of an inspiration in that sense for me to join Audi and have the project very clear ahead of me. I want to win titles with them one day and I'm going to work for that every single day and night I can.”

Bortoleto undoubtedly sees his future with the Audi project and, to him, the squad has already become more than an F1 team.

“I know a lot of environments in teams in Formula 1 and, not that I've been part of them, but that I hear from and I'm lucky – I'm a lucky guy,” he says. “I have a team that supports me, I have people around me that have very good energy and that I really enjoy working with. I really think I couldn't be in a better place for my first year and for my future as well.”

Next up on the F1 calendar? Sao Paulo. It's always a special weekend but for Bortoleto it will mark his first home race as an F1 driver.

Brazil's history in F1 needs no introduction. The country has produced three F1 World Champions – with eight titles between them – but they have had no one to cheer following the retirement of Felipe Massa after the 2017 season. When Bortoleto joined Sauber, he ended that absence of Brazilian drivers on the grid.

“It will be insane man, Brazilian people are for me the best,” Bortoleto tells me when I ask if he's begun to think about racing at Interlagos in F1.

“Obviously it's my country so I always say this, because I feel like this. I connect to them, I'm connected to my country, I'm connected to my people, they are the same as I am.

“I really want to go race in Brazil, and feel the atmosphere there, and be with the fans and everyone, definitely.”

For a racer who has already spoken about the importance of recharging, how does Bortoleto plan to approach the weekend? After all, Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli was refreshingly honest about not managing his first home Grand Prix weekend at Imola in the best way possible.

“Well, I'm going to give my best,” Bortoleto says. “Obviously [the fans] are going to expect a lot of things and I don't ask them for less than this. They are fans, they want to see me winning and doing well so they are going to expect always high things about me.

“It means that they believe that I can achieve this; if they didn't expect anything from me, it's because they don't think I'm able to achieve this so I'm fine with it. I'm going to give my best and I will deliver the job I can deliver in that weekend.”

And what about following in the footsteps of one of Brazil – and F1's – greatest ever drivers? Bortoleto idolises three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna, both hail from Sao Paulo and the 21-year-old wears his late hero's helmet colours. Even from that perspective, this upcoming weekend will be a special moment for the rookie.

“Senna is my biggest idol, the guy I grew up hearing about and, again, I think hopefully one day, I can achieve a little bit of what that guy did for the sport and for Brazil and everyone,” Bortoleto explains.

“He's an idol even after so many years since he passed away, still inspiring people. That's, I think, a goal in my life as well, to be able to be successful in Formula 1 but at the same time make something big for my country.”

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Aston Martin CEO and Team Principal Andy Cowell has shared an insight into the squad's “big, big goals”.

Andy Cowell is confident that Aston Martin will achieve the goal they have set of one day winning back-to-back championships, with the team boss stating that the squad's vision is to “get to the top and then stay at the top”.

Since the former Racing Point outfit became Aston Martin in 2021, the team have made changes as they aim to work their way forwards in the pecking order. This has seen a number of high-profile signings join, including Managing Technical Partner Adrian Newey and new Chief Technical Officer Enrico Cardile.

The squad also opened a brand-new factory at their Silverstone base, housing facilities including a new wind tunnel which became operational earlier in 2025.

As such, Cowell – who joined as CEO in October 2024 before also becoming Team Principal in January – spoke about Aston Martin's “big, big goals” during an interview on the team's YouTube channel.

When asked about the secret to keeping all members of the outfit happy, Cowell listed the factors involved in this.

“Honesty, and don't overpromise, and make sure we've got a single focus – the race car,” the Briton said. “It all comes back to the race car, so what are we all going to do for the race car?

“Set big, big goals – set goals that everybody thinks are impossible, but then make it possible, and that's teamwork. The vision to get to the top and then staying at the top. Coming up with those tough targets – ‘BHAGs', I like to call them.”

Pushed on what the ‘BHAG', or ‘Big Hairy Audacious Goal', was, Cowell answered: “To win multiple championships, back-to-back.”

And when asked if he believes that will happen, the team boss added: “That's what we're striving to do, and yes, it will happen.”

While achieving consecutive titles remains the goal, Cowell also shared an insight into what greatness looks like for the team in terms of the process.

“Teamwork,” he explained. “It's an engineering business, working as a team, for the good of that race car.”

Cowell admitted that he understands if those working for the team might be impatient about achieving success, with the CEO admitting that he welcomes this quality.

“Let's have that hunger,” Cowell added, before acknowledging that he also feels this too. “There isn't a single day where I feel like I've achieved enough.”

Aston Martin currently sit in seventh place of the Teams' Standings on 69 points, just three away from sixth-placed Racing Bulls in a tight midfield battle.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

From Lando Norris' disco ball to Alex Albon's Miami orange, special edition helmets have been everywhere this season. We take a look back at where it all began.

Special edition helmets are a relatively recent addition to Formula 1's long history – what was once purely a piece of safety equipment has become a canvas for drivers and sponsors to showcase their personality, pay tribute or have some fun.

The journey from mostly plain lids to glittering, custom-designed works of art has been full of experimentation over the years – including design restrictions and concerns about the weight of paint. Here's a look back at how special edition helmets became a beloved part of F1's identity.

In a sport where faces are hidden behind visors, a helmet has always been a driver's signature. For decades, drivers such as James Hunt, John Surtees, and Sir Jackie Stewart kept the same design throughout their entire careers.

Back then, helmets weren't nearly as protective, and their main purpose besides safety was for the fans and marshals to tell the drivers apart. Even so, individuality did shine through at time. Hunt's name stretched boldly along the side of his helmet, while Stewart paid homage to his Scottish roots with a tartan band around the crown.

Few designs, however, are as instantly recognisable as Ayrton Senna's yellow, green and blue helmet – an enduring Brazilian icon that once fetched nearly $1million at auction.

For much of F1's history, a helmet represented the driver but not the team. That began to change when Michael Schumacher moved to Ferrari and decided to replace the German flag on his helmet with a bright red design to match his new team's colours. This marked the start of a new, more flexible era, one where creativity and collaboration between driver and team became the norm.

Helmet designs don't come out of thin air, and every special edition helmet begins with an artist – both a designer and engineer. Two of the best-known names in this profession are Jens Munser and Mad 56.

Munser, the mastermind behind Schumacher's Ferrari-era lids, Lando Norris's squiggles, and Sebastian Vettel's 2024 Imola Senna tribute explained to Motorsport Tech Magazine: “The process hasn't changed much – we still start with sketches – but we now use printed stickers for logos instead of hand-painting every detail. We've improved the pigments to make paint lighter and more resistant to stones. Michael always wanted to save weight, even if it meant a less glossy finish.”

Mad 56, real name Massimo Dante, works primarily with Red Bull and has also collaborated with Williams driver Alex Albon for more than a decade. Though artists have creative freedom, they must balance aesthetics with FIA regulations and sponsor requirements, which is a tricky art in itself.

In 2015, the FIA announced that drivers must stick to a single helmet design during the entire season, as some of the constantly changing special edition helmets were starting to cause issues. The reasoning was simple: fans, commentators, and race officials were struggling to recognise who was behind the wheel!

The move came after a series of increasingly elaborate designs – most famously Sebastian Vettel's 2012 LED-lit helmet in Singapore. The glowing design, while undoubtedly eye-catching, raised safety concerns and was quickly banned, prompting the FIA to rethink just how far helmet customisation should go.

The single-design regulation remained in place until 2020, but even under those tighter rules, creativity didn't disappear. Designers found clever ways to work within the limits – for example, Lewis Hamilton's special edition Mexico City Grand Prix helmets, or Sebastian Vettel subtly changing the colour of his usual helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix in 2017.

When the ban was lifted at the beginning of 2020, a wave of colour and creativity returned to the grid – and it hasn't slowed down since.

Today, F1's grid is awash with one-off designs, each a reflection of personality, heritage, and at times – humour. Amongst his many iconic special edition helmets, Lewis Hamilton collaborated with Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama for a chrome-inspired Japanese Grand Prix special in 2023, Valtteri Bottas once ran a pre-season helmet modelled on his own head, and Albon's designs often pay tribute to his pets and his home nation of Thailand.

The 2025 season has also seen plenty of eye-catching limited-edition designs – from bold artistic statements to heartfelt tributes. One standout came from the youngest designer yet, Thea, the young fan behind Carlos Sainz's unofficial mascot “Sparkles” the unicorn. The Spaniard wore Thea's design as a sticker on his helmet for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and, while it was meant as a one-off, after his P3 finish in Baku, there's no wonder he'd want his new mascot to stick around!

While some special edition helmet designs are lighthearted, others carry deep personal significance. One of the best examples of this was Romain Grosjean during his return to the Haas garage for Pirelli tyre testing, where he was finally able to wear the helmet that his children had designed for his planned 2020 farewell race – one he never got to use after his terrifying Bahrain crash.

It was a very sentimental helmet and reaffirmed that special edition helmets can be much more than just a marketing tool when they hold such meaning for the drivers.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

The two brands are set to extend their near decade-long collaboration.

Formula 1 has today announced the extension and expansion of its Global Partnership with Heineken following nearly 10 years of collaboration between the two brands to bring fans together both at and beyond Grands Prix events.

The new multi-year deal highlights the vital role Heineken has played in celebrating and amplifying the spectacle of Formula 1 after joining forces back in 2016.

Since the inaugural year of collaboration, the global drinks brand has delivered multiple eye-catching and impactful at-track activations, while enhancing the fan experience both at and away from the circuits, with engaging events such as pop-up bars to luxury hospitality within the paddock.

The F1 Fan Zone, elevated to be presented by Heineken 0.0, will include new in-person installations and vivid branding across each race weekend. In addition, the premium beer brand will be given the naming rights of three Grands Prix each season.

Heineken will also launch the ‘Heineken Star Fans' campaign, designed to celebrate the best fans across the season through an online content series, dedicated pages on F1.com, awards, and exclusive competitions.

One key feature of the brands' fan engagement will include the launch of the world's first Season Ticket, giving one lucky fan and a plus one access to every Grand Prix on the calendar with travel and accommodation included. Crafted from carbon fibre and precision-engineered rivets, the ticket symbolises speed, craftsmanship, and connection.

The season ticket will help fans not only enjoy the spectacle of live racing but also connect with other fans all around the world. The inaugural holder is Brandon Burgess, who captured the attention of fans and media around the world with his ambitious quest to attend every race in 2025 on a budget while juggling a full-time job.

Next year, Heineken will be offering another fan the chance to get their hands on this coveted Season Ticket for them and a friend to experience every twist and turn of every race via F1 Unlocked.

The global beer brand will continue to use F1's platform to provide messaging around responsible consumption and promote Heineken 0.0 – a premium zero-alcohol product – while continuing to deliver trackside branding, Paddock Club hospitality and co-branded products across each season.

Stefano Domenicali, President & CEO, Formula 1, said: “For nearly a decade Heineken has stood alongside Formula 1 with a shared passion for creating an unrivalled experience and spectacle for our fans. I want to thank the Heineken family, Dolf and his team for their continued support and I am delighted that our partnership will bring even more excitement to spectators both at and away from track for many years to come.

“In motorsport, innovation is in our DNA, so I'm thrilled that Heineken continues to push the boundaries of engaging fans and taking them even closer to the action.”

Dolf van den Brink, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board at Heineken, added: “After almost a decade of creating unforgettable fan experiences together, I'm thrilled we will be extending and expanding our partnership with Formula 1.

“This new chapter of our partnership is about more than sponsorship – it's about connecting with fans, creating unique experiences, and celebrating the global F1 fandom. In celebration of this contract renewal, we are excited to launch the sport's first season ticket, giving a fan and a friend the opportunity to attend every race of the season – truly a once in a lifetime adventure.

“We can't wait to deliver more fan-first activations, shared experiences, and showcase the incredible energy that surrounds F1, both on and off the track – all with a cold Heineken (0.0) beer in hand.""

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

With Mercedes recently confirming that Kimi Antonelli will remain with the team in 2026, Toto Wolff is confident about the youngster's progression into next season.

Toto Wolf believes that Kimi Antonelli will show the “real Kimi” in 2026, with the Mercedes boss feeling confident that the rookie will be better prepared to deal with various aspects of the sport during his sophomore campaign.

It was confirmed ahead of the United States Grand Prix in October that Antonelli and team mate George Russell will remain as the Silver Arrows' line-up into 2026, a season in which a wave of new technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.

Antonelli's rookie year in F1 has witnessed various highs and lows, with a good start followed by a tricky spell during the European leg of the season. The Italian has since enjoyed a stronger run of form since finishing fourth in Baku, having also claimed a P5 in Singapore and a P6 in Mexico.

Looking ahead to 2026, Wolff feels that the 19-year-old will take another step forwards.

“Kimi has a long-term future,” the Team Principal explained after Antonelli's place at the team for next season was confirmed. “I think it's very tricky to come into this generation of cars without having driven them against all of the guys that know ground effect cars.

“Next year's a reset. He now knows all the tracks, he knows about the media pressure and how to work within the team, so we're going to see the real Kimi next year.”

Asked if he has confidence that Antonelli can be a future World Champion from what he has shown already, Wolff responded: “Yeah, absolutely.”

While Antonelli has faced some highs and lows in 2025, Mercedes have also seen dramatic performance swings with their car across different tracks.

Pushed on whether this is also an area that the squad need to get on top of ahead of 2026, Wolff answered: “It's so difficult to find correlation between the simulator and the wind tunnel, then you come to a track and it's all different.

“We didn't expect to be that competitive in Singapore [where Russell won], but we have been... It's a bit of a surprise box with the regulations, and all the front-running teams seem to suffer from correlation issues.”

The McLaren chiefs are the latest guests on our Beyond The Grid podcast.

McLaren have won back-to-back Constructors' titles for the first time since the early ‘90s. But just eight years ago, in 2017, they finished second to last, so how exactly have they transformed into World Champions since then?

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson at the McLaren Technology Centre, CEO Zak Brown and Team Principal Andrea Stella outline how they've masterminded McLaren's remarkable turnaround together, revealing just how desperate the team's situation was at the start of this journey – and how they're planning to sustain their recent success in the years to come.

But in the immediate future, their eyes are on the next prize, as McLaren chase a first Drivers' World Championship since Lewis Hamilton won in 2008.

Going into the final four rounds of the 2025 season, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri are separated by just one point at the top of the standings.

Brown and Stella discuss how the pair have evolved during their time at McLaren, address criticism of their approach to this title fight, and discuss whether they'll have any regrets should Max Verstappen beat both Norris and Piastri to the crown.

The reality star and business mogul has been studying law for the past six years.

Kim Kardashian and ChatGPT clearly have a toxic relationship.


	While being questioned by Teyana Taylor for Vanity Fair‘s Lie Detector Test video series, the reality star and business mogul was asked if she ever uses the AI chatbot ChatGPT.




	“I use it for legal advice,” she responded, referring to her time studying law over the past several years. “So when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I'll take a picture and snap it and put it in there.”


	Taylor quickly chimed in, asking, “So you're cheating?”

	“They're always wrong. It has made me fail tests,” Kardashian admitted. “All the time. And then I'll get mad and I'll yell at it and be like, ‘You made me fail. Why did you do this?' And it will talk back to me.”

	











The Kardashians star declared ChatGPT her “frenemy,” as the AI software will also give her a sassy response when she calls it out for incorrect information.


	“Then I will talk to it and say, ‘Hey, you're gonna make me fail. How does that make you feel? That you need to really know these answers, I'm coming to you.' And then it'll say back to me, ‘This is just teaching you to trust your own instincts, so you knew the answer all along.'”


	Taylor quipped in response that ChatGPT “clocked” her All's Fair co-star, adding, “So technically, you and ChatGPT are friends, just toxic friends.”

	











	“They need to do better 'cause I'm leaning to them to really help me, and she is teaching me a life lesson and then becoming my therapist to tell me why I need to believe in myself after they got the answer wrong,” Kardashian responded. “It's like a thing. I screenshot all the time and send it in my group chat. Like, can you believe this bitch is talking to me like this? This is insane.”


	The American Horror Story actress studied law for six years through an apprenticeship program in California. She shared in 2021 that she passed the “baby bar” exam, and then reportedly took the bar exam over the summer and is awaiting her results.


	She also plays a lawyer on the new legal drama All's Fair, which follows an all-female law firm in Los Angeles that specializes in high-profile divorces. In addition to Kardashian and Taylor, the series also stars Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts and Sarah Paulson.

Tuesday's episode saw Elaine Hendrix return to the ballroom for the first time after she was unable to attend Halloween Night due to an injury.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode eight of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


Dancing With the Stars‘ rocked and rolled all night Tuesday as the cast celebrated Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night.




	Tuesday's episode marked the return of group dances, which saw the cast cut into half as each group performed alongside one of the co-hosts, Julianne Hough and Alfonso Ribeiro. 


	Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov were eliminated from Dancing With the Stars season 34 at the end of the episode.

	At the top of the show, Ribeiro revealed the couple who finished at the top of the leaderboard would be granted immunity from the relay dances next week, and would earn bonus points towards next Tuesday's 20th Birthday Party celebration episode —  if they survived elimination, of course. 

	











	While both Whitney Leavitt and Alix Earle tied for the highest individual score of the night (both with a 39/40), the tie was broken by awarding immunity to Leavitt for having the highest cumulative judges scores from across season 34. 


Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Leavitt, social media star Earle, Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actress Elaine Hendrix, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter comprise the remaining cast of celebrities, while Fishel was eliminated from the competition Tuesday night. 


Hendrix suffered an injury last Tuesday that prohibited her from dancing on Halloween Night. Instead of performing live, she earned a 32/40 based on rehearsal footage reviewed by the judges. She was not eliminated from the show or prohibited to continue dancing, meaning she will perform an individual dance and partake in a group number on Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night.  

	











	After performing a Viennese waltz to “What the World Needs Now Is Love,” Hendrix gave a brief update on how she's been doing since the injury, noting that she's been feeling “very solid and strong and grateful.” 


	With only eight celebrities left in the competition heading into the episode, season 34 of Dancing With the Stars is nearing its end. After Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night, there are only three episodes left, including Nov. 25's special three-hour finale. 


	Still, after Tuesday's episode, none of the couples have yet received a perfect score from the panel of judges. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night did see the first 40/40 handed out to Team Chicago, though no individual couples have earned a perfect score. 


	During the individual dances, Earle and Leavitt nearly earned perfect scores, both scoring 39/40. Chiles and Irwin trailed close behind them, with respective scores of 38/40 each. 


	Last week's Halloween Night saw the couples perform spooky numbers and compete in the dance marathon, while Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Jen Affleck and her partner Jan Ravnik were eliminated from the competition. (The Hollywood Reporter was in the ballroom to capture all the behind-the-scenes moments that cameras missed.) 


	Flavor Flav served as a guest judge alongside mainstay judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli.


	The couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated at the end of each episode. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final performance is completed.

	











	See the full list of scores for week eight of DWTS season 34 (aka Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night) below.

The actor joined the cast for the third installment in Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi franchise.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	While some may find the intense desert heat grueling, Robert Pattinson actually found it “relaxing.”


	During a recent interview for IndieWire, alongside his Die My Love co-star Jennifer Lawrence, the actor shared his experience shooting Denis Villeneuve‘s upcoming Dune: Messiah.




	“When I was doing Dune it was so hot in the desert that I just couldn't question anything,” he recalled. “And it was so relaxing, like my brain actually wasn't operating, I did not have a single functioning brain cell. And I was just listening to Denis [Villeneuve]: ‘Whatever you want!'

	While details surrounding Pattinson's character in the third installment of the sci-fi franchise have been kept under wraps, sources previously told The Hollywood Reporter that the Twilight alum would likely be playing the chief villain in the film.


	Pattinson isn't the first Dune star to open up about filming in the desert elements. Zendaya, who plays Chani, previously told W Magazine that she got heatstroke while filming Dune: Part Two in Jordan because she wasn't drinking enough water. 


	“It was very hot, and I remember thinking, ‘Oh, man, the bathrooms are so far away,' because we had to hike to the locations,” she recalled. “If you have to pee, you need at least 10 minutes to get out of the costumes. I was like, Damn, I don't want to drink too much water. I had such a fear of peeing myself or shitting myself, honestly, in the suit on set.”

	











	Zendaya continued, “One day, I didn't drink enough and I had a heatstroke. I felt so barfy. I remember calling my mom on the bathroom floor, saying, ‘I feel terrible.' She was like, ‘Did you drink water today?' I said no. I thought I was being smart, but you can't do that. So, lesson learned.”


	Austin Butler, who portrayed villain Feyd-Rautha in the second installment, also previously shared his experience working in what he described as an “uncomfortable environment.”


	“It was 110 degrees and so hot,” he explained to Entertainment Weekly. “I had the bald cap on, and it was between two soundstages that were just these gray boxes of 200-foot walls and sand. It became like a microwave. There were people passing out from heatstroke. And that was just my first week.”


Dune: Messiah is set to be released on Dec. 18, 2026. Returning castmembers include Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson and Anya Taylor-Joy.

The bloom is decidedly of the rose: The first season's senior stud airs the dirty laundry of his short-lived marriage to winning contestant Theresa Nist, while heaping praise on runner-up Leslie Fhima.


							By 

	Oren Peleg



	On Nov. 6, Gerry Turner, the 72-year-old bachelor from the first season of ABC's The Golden Bachelor will release his memoir, Golden Years: What I've Learned From Love, Loss, and Reality TV. 


	Turner found himself on the show after his wife of nearly 45 years died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2017, and his two adult daughters suggested he apply to the show in 2020. The pandemic paused casting and other efforts to launch the series, but filming finally began in 2023.Fans of the show may remember that Turner, a retired restaurateur, gave his golden rose to Theresa Nist, a 70-year-old financial services professional from New Jersey. The two married shortly after the finale aired in November 2023. Then, in another twist, they divorced after just three months of marriage in early 2024.

	Say what you will about Turner's aw-shucks, Midwestern ways (or the fact that his past may not be exactly as he claims), but the season was a hit for ABC, and the most watched of the Bachelor franchise since 2021. Time and again, audiences responded strongly to the depiction of seniors (especially older women) dating and finding love.

	











	Turner's memoir is mostly a retelling of his experience leading up to, during, and then shortly after taping of the show. The book reveals new details and slightly different versions of what viewers saw on TV, but ultimately, the sections sure to be most talked about relate to what took place afterwards, in which he badmouths his short-lived flame while lavishing praise on the show's runner-up. 


	Here are ten of the book's most illuminating passages:On The Death Of His Wife“Suddenly, shockingly, out of nowhere, the love of my life, my partner in all things for the last forty three years, was gone.”Within a month of selling their Iowa home and retiring to a small, lakeside town in Indiana, Toni Turner's health deteriorated quickly and she died of a kidney infection a few months shy of her 65th birthday. It's later revealed that Toni had hidden from Gerry a Type-2 Diabetes diagnosis, which may have led to her death. Whatever the cause, Toni is brought up throughout the book, and her memory is clearly an inspiration and solace for Gerry.On Fame And Representation“Hey, man, I wanted to wish you luck,” he said. “You're representing the men of America in this. It's awesome to see you on TV, and I hope you find love.”At an In-N-Out in Los Angeles, a man recognizes Turner and gives him his support. It's a reprise that runs throughout the memoir.


On The Runner-Up“The real red flag for me was her romantic history.”Turner ultimately gave Theresa Nist the golden rose and the two married (if briefly). But the decision came down to Nist and Leslie Fhima. Turner claims that Fhima's two previous divorces were a major red flag and one of the biggest reasons she didn't win. Yet, Fhima is still in Turner's life, while Nist…not so much.

	











On Meeting The Kardashians


“Kris and one of her daughters met me at the front door — if you can call it that — but I don't know which one of them she was.” During publicity for The Golden Bachelor, Turner made an appearance on Hulu's The Kardashians. While Kendall Jenner says she's a fan of The Bachelor franchise, Turner can't return the compliment. He doesn't know their names, who they are, etc. However, Turner reveals that, off camera, Kris Jenner asked him about getting hearing aids, and the two had a human moment about “the normal wear and tear on a person's body at our age.”


On Pre-Nups and Cold Feet“Two days before the wedding, I got a frantic call from my lawyer saying the document was not executable. One of her signatures was missing.”


	With the cameras and the excitement gone, Turner admits that the strain of a long-distance relationship (forced to stay under wraps by the show's producers) made him second-guess his decision to marry Nist. When Turner asked Nist (who works in finance) to sign a pre-nup, she initially balked at the request. When she finally relented, Nist missed some signatures, giving Turner pause. 


On Consummating The Marriage


“My first night at her house, she took out sheets and pillows before telling me, ‘Tomorrow's a big workday. I need a good night's sleep. Do you mind sleeping on the sofa?'”About a week after their wedding, Turner claims he drove from his home in Indiana to Nist's home in New Jersey. Not only was he surprised by how small her house was (he claims she uses her stovetop as a vanity because — amongst other things — the lack of space), but was sensing a gap growing between them. That distance was most notable in their lack of physical intimacy.On Ending Things“Sitting about six feet from Theresa on a stone bench, I turned to her and asked, ‘So is it time to just call it quits?'”Turner's retelling of where and when he and Nist decided to end their marriage might seem a little too polished for some, leading to more questions than answers. As he writes, the two were spending time apart in their respective homes, then reunited in LA for Joey Graziadei's “After The Final Rose” episode. Returning to their hotel, the newlyweds found a secluded bench, had a talk, and decided to divorce after only three months together. Was it really that easy and clean?


On Cancer And Post-Divorce


“…to be that insignificant to someone I had married, albeit briefly, was very painful. We no longer talk; we have no reason to.”Shortly after his divorce from Nist, Turner was diagnosed with a rare form of bone marrow cancer. He informed several friends and even some of the women from The Golden Bachelor, but the response he claims he got from Nist was muted and she only followed up with him a few times before they completely stopped talking.


On Questioning Motives“There was something about the image of Theresa curled up on one of the couches, planning her strategy to win a rose, that made me feel sick to my stomach.”In the aftermath of his brief marriage to Nist, Turner learns from multiple other contestants on the show that Nist was reading a book called “The Secret to Finding Love and Fame on America's Favorite Reality Show.” As he claims, it made him completely question Nist's motives for being on The Golden Bachelor and why she ever decided to marry him. Ouch. On The Lingering Leslie Question“Although I hate to admit it, every time I think about Leslie, I still get emotional.”Turns out it should have been Leslie Fhima after all? According to Turner, he and Fhima saw each other during a taping of Celebrity FamilyFeud. After the show, the two had a quiet moment together that must have been electric enough for Fhima to say to Turner, “You still got it for me?” The two still regularly talk, though Turner claims they are just good friends. Then again, isn't that the basis of all great loves?

Three years after Motomami cemented her global appeal, Rosalía is back with a daring album that rethinks the type of music a superstar can make.


Rosalía offers an exasperated laugh as she sits down, having tried on a variety of equally stunning outfits only to end up in the casual clothes she arrived in: black pants and a camo jacket lined with fur. It's the same jacket she was spotted wearing at a Parisian cafe in early October, seated alone with a cup of tea while poring over the sheet music of a song from the 1900 Puccini opera Tosca.

	











	The Barcelona-born singer's candid moment with the canonical tragedy was significant — one of many subtle nods that she was pursuing something outside the typical parameters of modern mainstream music. Rosalía studied musicology in college, and over the last eight years has often meshed a wide variety of genres and influences in her songs. But for someone who rose to global fame on the cutting edge of culture, studying the musical notation of a century-old opera communicated a pointed message.


	Weeks later, fans began to understand why. On the evening of Oct. 20, she took to Madrid's Callao Square with giant projector screens, where a countdown unveiled the release date for her fourth album, Lux (Nov. 7 on Columbia Records), as well as its cover art, which features Rosalía dressed in all white, wearing a nun's habit and hugging herself under her clothing.

	











	Every move Rosalía has made over the past three years while crafting Lux has been considered, intentional and entirely in her own world. Having risen to fame with the flamenco-inspired pop of her Columbia debut, 2018's El Mal Querer, she flipped the script with her eclectic, energetic 2022 album, Motomami, which spanned pop, reggaetón, hip-hop, electronic and more and became her first album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 33. But Lux is something different: an orchestral, operatic opus recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra that blends history and spirituality and experiments with form, language (she sings in 13 different ones throughout the album's 18 tracks) and the very idea of what is possible for a major recording artist in 2025, for a project that's more Puccini than pop — not that it doesn't have its moments of catchy relatability.


	“It's like an album she wrote to God — whatever each person feels God is to them,” says Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Latin Iberia, which works with Rosalía alongside Columbia. “This is an artist who said, ‘I want to walk down a path where few walk.' And when you navigate inside the album, you completely understand the genius behind it.”


	Rosalía spent the better part of three years crafting Lux's lyrics and instrumentation, drawing from classical music, native speakers and instrumentation, and the giants of the past — women including Saint Rosalia of Palermo; the Chinese Taoist master/poet Sun Bu'er; the biblical figure of Miriam, sister of Moses; and even Patti Smith all figure into its cosmology — to create something that feels both worldly and otherworldly, a distinct take on navigating life's chaos. It was also a period where she experienced personal and professional changes: She broke off her engagement to Puerto Rican reggaetón star Rauw Alejandro, switched management and landed her first big acting role in the forthcoming third season of hit HBO series Euphoria, all while immersed in making the album.

	











	“In general, just to be in this world is a lot; sometimes it's overwhelming,” she says on a fall day in Los Angeles. “In the best-case scenario, the idea would be that whoever hears it feels light and feels hope. Because that was how it was made and where it was made from.”


	“This record takes you on a complete journey; the singing on it is just astounding,” says Jonathan Dickins, who runs September Management, home to Adele, and who began representing Rosalía in June. “I think she's a generational artist. I'm lucky enough to have worked with one, and now I'm lucky enough to work with another. She is an original.”


	To make Lux, Rosalía relied on several of her longtime collaborators — producers Noah Goldstein and Dylan Wiggins and engineer David Rodriguez among them — and tasked them with taking a new approach. “The whole process helped me grow as a musician, as a producer, as a sound engineer,” says Goldstein, who has also worked with Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and FKA twigs. “That's one of my favorite things about working with Rosalía: I'm always learning things from her.”


	She also tapped new collaborators such as OneRepublic singer and decorated songwriter Ryan Tedder (who spent three years DM'ing Rosalía, hoping to eventually work together) and urged them to push their boundaries. “For an artist to give me the freedom to just express myself in that way, God, that is the most fun I've ever had,” says Tedder, who has worked on mammoth albums by Adele, Beyoncé and more throughout his career. “I've been asked by everybody, ‘What does the new Rosalía stuff sound like?' And I literally say to everybody, ‘Nothing that you possibly would imagine.' ”

	











	Fans got their first taste of Lux when Rosalía dropped the single “Berghain,” which features Björk and Yves Tumor, in late October. The song kicks off with a string orchestra introduction followed by a Carmina Burana-like chorus and then Rosalía singing in an operatic soprano voice — in three languages.


	For Rosalía, challenging preconceptions about the type of music she, or anyone, can make is part of the point — thinking outside the box, following her inspiration and constantly learning, finding and creating from a place of curiosity and openness to new experiences and ideas. “I think that in order to fully enjoy music, you have to have a tolerant, open way of understanding it,” she says. “Because music is the ‘4'33” ' of John Cage, as much as the birds in the trees for the Kaluli of New Guinea, as much as the fugues of Bach, as much as the songs of Chencho Corleone. All of it is music. And if you understand that, then you can enjoy in a much fuller, profound way, what music is.”


When did you start working on this album?


	I don't think that it's easy to measure when something like this happens or starts. The album is heavily inspired by the world of mysticism and spirituality. Since I was a kid, I've always had a very personal relationship with spirituality. That's the seed of this project, and I don't remember when that started.


How did you approach Lux differently?


	This album has a completely different sound than any of the projects that I've done before. It was a challenge for me to do a more orchestral project and learn how to use an orchestra, understand all the instruments, all the possibilities, and learn and study from amazing composers in history and say, “OK, that's what's been done. What can I do that feels personal and honest for me?” And also the challenge of having that inspiration in classical music and trying to do something that I haven't done before, trying to write songs from another place. Because the instrumentation is different from all the other projects I have done. But also the writing, the structures, it's very different.

	











After Motomami, your success and fame hit a new level. How did that help you make this album?


	All the albums I've done helped me be able to be the musician I am today and make this album now. Lux wouldn't exist if I hadn't taken the previous steps. Each album helped me release something, to free myself as much as possible. Every time I go to the studio, it's from wanting to play around, try something different, to find different styles of making songs. I always try to stay open.


You've said Motomami was inspired by the energy of L.A., New York, Miami. What was your mission in making Lux?


	It's made from love and curiosity. I've always wanted to understand other languages, learn other music, learn from others about what I don't know. It comes from curiosity, from wanting to understand others better, and through that I can understand who I am better. I love explaining stories. I like to be the narrator. I think as much as I love music itself, music is just a medium to explain stories, to put ideas on the table. So that's what this project is for me. I'm just a channel to explain stories, and there's inspiration in different saints from all across the world. So you could say it feels like a global thing, but at the same time, it's so personal for me. Those stories are exceptional. They are remarkable stories about women who lived their lives in a very unconventional way, of women who were writers in very special ways. And so I'm like, “Let's throw some light there.”


	What I know is that I am ready, and this is what I needed to do. What I know is that this is what I was supposed to write about. This is my truth. This is where I am now.

	











What contributes to the fact that the album feels so global is you sing in 13 languages on it.


	It took a lot of writing and scratching it and sending it to someone who would help me translate and be like, “This is how you would say this in Japanese. This is how it sounds.” There were so many things that I had to play with and take under consideration. Because it's not just writing. It's not just on paper. It has to sound good. There's a big difference for me when I write, for example, a letter for somebody that I love than if I write a song. It has to have a certain sound, a certain intention of musicality.


	It was a big challenge, but it was worth it. It made me grow so much. And I feel like every word on this album, I fought for it, I really wanted it, and then I waited for it, and then it came. It took me a year to write just the lyrics for this album, and then another year of arranging music and going back to the lyrics and retouching. It took a lot of effort searching for the right words: “How is this not just going to be heard, but also, if you read it, how does it feel?”


The lyrics read like a novel.


	There's a whole intentional structure throughout the album. I was clear that I wanted four movements. I wanted one where it would be more a departure from purity. The second movement, I wanted it to feel more like being in gravity, being friends with the world. The third would be more about grace and hopefully being friends with God. And at the end, the farewell, the return. All of that helped me be very strategic and concise and precise about what songs would go where, how I wanted it to start, how I wanted the journey to go, what lyrics would make sense.

	











	Each story, each song is inspired by the story of a saint. I read a lot of hagiographies — the lives of the saints — and it helped me expand my understanding of sainthood. Because my background is Catholic from my family, so you understand it through this one [lens]. But then you realize that in other cultures and other religious contexts, it's another thing. But what surprised me a lot was that there's a main theme, which is not fearing, which you can find shared across many religions. And I think that's so powerful because probably the fears that I have, somebody on the other side of the world has the same ones. And for me, there's beauty in that, in understanding that we might think that we're different, but we're not.


All of these songs are very personal, but “Focu 'ranni” feels especially so. What was the experience of writing that one?


	I found out that there's this saying by Santa Rosalia de Palermo — she was supposed to get married and then she decided not to; she decided to dedicate her life to God. I thought that something in that was very powerful. I researched her story, and that's why there's some Sicilian thrown in that song. It was a challenge to sing in that language. That was a challenging song to do and to sing, but I feel grateful that it exists.


You create a world, and a sisterhood almost, on this album. How does a more playful song like “Novia Robot” fit in?


	There was this woman who was very inspiring named Sun Bu'er; she dedicated her life to becoming a teacher of the Tao. And the way she lived her life was unconventional at that time. I thought there was something powerful about her story. Apparently, in order to make a journey, she destroyed her face to be able to travel safely. And she had a partner, she had a family, but she decided she wanted to dedicate her life to spirituality. It was so bold and courageous. And at the end of that song, you hear another voice, which is in [Hebrew], that's inspired by Miriam, this figure who led an entire people and was a rebellious woman and considered close to the idea of ​​sainthood in Judaism. So I thought that it was cool to have those two voices, the same way how in opera there are so many voices co-existing. So I thought in that song that could happen with that playfulness, yes, and playing with the sound of how Chinese Mandarin would sound.

	











The album is so operatic and orchestral. How did you begin to immerse yourself in those styles and find the people that you worked with to deliver that?


	They're the people I feel comfortable with, so I love sharing time with them in the studio. For example, I worked on [Lux song] “Mio Cristo” for months by myself in Miami and L.A., and I delayed the moment when I would share it. I wanted to make a song that was like my version of what an aria could be. So I remember just going to the studio after so much work, after so much back and forth with an Italian translator, and I [had been] improvising on the piano, trying to find melodies, to find the right chords and notes. I went to the studio and I shared it with Dylan [Wiggins], with Noah [Goldstein], with David [Rodriguez], and I remember they were like, “Yes. That's the song. There it is.” So it's been a lot of isolation on one side — a lot of writing — and then on the other side a lot of collective effort in the studio.


It's such a vivid album. How are you plotting out how it will look visually?


	My sister and I work together a lot. I'm very lucky that I get to just keep playing around and having fun like how we used to when we were kids. Her and I love recommending things to each other, we send books to each other. Having a project together is something I feel so grateful about, the fact that my family is involved — my mother, my sister, they're very important people in my life, and I feel like I can share everything with them. And on the visual side, it was just playing around with references and imagination, just trying to think, “What can we do with this?” Just playfulness. That's how I think the best things happen — out of joy.

	











Have you given any thought yet to what a live performance of this album would look like?


	Thoughts are never lacking, but we'll see. I don't want to think too much how that would look until that really is happening, if that makes sense. But there's definitely a lot of creativity with how this could be translated to the stage.


At the same time you were working on this, you were filming the third season of Euphoria, your first major acting role. Was that difficult?


	It was very challenging to do both. I was recording the album and producing and checking mixes, everything, while I was shooting Euphoria. I had to divide my mind between both and it was also the first time that I was doing something like this — preparing a character, studying lines. These are new things for me and I'm not used to it. It's very different from making an album and making music. For some reason, I didn't completely go crazy, and we're still here.


Did any of that experience seep into the album?


	[Euphoria creator] Sam [Levinson] and I are both very sensitive people. For some reason, whatever he's creating for me resonates for this moment. When we were shooting, when we spoke about the [show's] story, I didn't know him that well. I really admired his work, but I didn't know how his mind worked, how he is as an artist. I realized he has so much sensibility and I connected so much with that, not just with his work, but also him as a person.


How did that role come about?


	I shared that I really wanted to start acting, that it was something that I would love to do. The only thing I had done was [the Pedro] Almodóvar [film Pain and Glory in 2019], and when I was 16 I studied theater for a year. I feel like being a musician and being onstage is being a performer, but I had never experienced it as being filmed, learning lines; it's a very different job. I had done it with Almodóvar, but I was like, “I would love to do it with somebody like Sam, somebody that has a vision as strong as him. Or someone like Sofia Coppola.” So then I heard the third season was happening and I was like, “I would love to audition.”

	











You had to audition?


	Of course! Because I'm not an actress, and that was really scary. But at the same time, something told me that I was supposed to do it. So I did an audition tape, then met an audition person and then something else, and then it happened.


At the end of your album, you address the concept of death. Are there things in your life that you worry about not having enough time to do?


	No. Whenever God decides it's time to go, it's time to go. Whatever I have come here to do, I feel like I'm doing; whenever I have to leave, I will leave. That's how I try to live. I would love to know how it feels to be 100 years old, but that's not on me to decide. But I would love to keep writing, I would love to keep making music, I would love to keep learning how to cook better, I would love to keep studying — one day I would love to go to college again and study philosophy or theology — and I would love to keep traveling. There are so many times that I travel and feel like I haven't seen enough or haven't had enough time to just experience places.


	But for now, I'm dedicating myself to my mission, which is making albums and performing. And for me, performing is an act for others. I don't like touring. I like to be onstage and I love my fans, so I do it. But I love being in my home, calm, reading, cooking, going to the gym, lifting weights and going to sleep. Literally, that makes me so happy; I don't need a lot. (Laughs.) When you travel, it's much harder; psychologically it's a challenge, always. But I also know that there are other jobs that have so much complexity and challenges, and I feel so grateful that I can be a musician.

	











What's the biggest challenge that you feel like comes with this career?


	The price you pay, the sacrifice, the amount of moments that you lose with your family, with your loved ones. My grandpa died when I was at the Latin Grammys in 2019, and I was about to perform when I found out. I couldn't even be at the burial. Those things, I'll have to live with the sadness and the regret of not being there. Those are things that are not the good side of being a musician: always struggling, always being committed to whatever you're doing, to the people who are there in the audience that night who paid for their ticket to see your performance. Maybe that's the thing they're looking forward to the most that week. The price is really high, but this is what I chose, and I'm fully conscious that this is the decision I've made.


In releasing this album, what would success look like for you?


	Success, for me, is freedom. And I felt all the freedom that I could imagine or hope for throughout this process. That's all I wanted. I wanted to be able to pour what was inside, outside. And those inspirations, those ideas, make them into songs. I was able to do that, and I will not ask for more.

Otherwise, the country superstar has been having a blast on his first-ever tour of Australia.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Jelly Roll appears to be having the time of his life on his first-ever tour of Australia. The country superstar who was previously barred from playing international shows due to his felonious past has been tearing it up Down Under, appearing at three stops on the inaugural Strummingbird Festival on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Newcastle and Perth, as well as playing shows in Brisbane, Melbourne and the Harvest Rock festival.

	By all accounts it's been a blast. But this week the “Son of a Sinner” singer said he hit a snag while trying to indulge in some high-end retail therapy. In an Instagram Story posted on Wednesday (Nov. 5), Jelly said he hit a Louis Vuitton store during some down time and claimed the staff treated him like he was a common criminal.


	“Hey man, The Louis Vuitton in Sydney, legitimately just treated us like we were finna come in and rob that place,” Jelly said with a smile on his face as he laughed about the incident, with the store's logo clearly displayed behind him. “I have never been looked at more like a crim… Listen, the last time I was looked at like a criminal this bad.. I was an actual criminal this bad.”


	Jelly Roll, 40, announced his first-ever non-U.S. dates in June 2024 with a run of Canadian gigs, just a week after telling Howard Stern that his dozens of bids behind bars on drug charges in his youth — dating back to when he was 14 — had been keeping him from booking shows outside the lower 48.

	











	From the looks of it, though, JR is otherwise having the very best time on his Aussie run, arguing with the locals about the inexplicable difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit, getting the obligatory snap with the Sydney Opera House in the background, falling in love with Australian football and, of course, helping his drummer do a shoey.


	Jelly has two more shows left on his outing, including a Thursday (Nov. 6) gig in Townsville at Queensland Country Bank Stadium and Saturday (Nov. 8) at the Outer Fields at Western Springs in Auckland, New Zealand.

Dragon was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2008.

	Lars Brandle



	Robert Taylor, former lead guitarist and backing vocalist with ARIA Hall of Fame-inducted rock band Dragon, has died aged 74.


	Taylor's passing was confirmed in a social post by ex-drummer Kerry Jacobson.


	“I'm writing to share the unexpected and devastating news of the passing of my mentor, my partner in crime for some of the best times, my musical comrade through the hardest of times and my dear friend of decades…the irreplacable (sic) Robert Taylor,” he writes.


	“Many admired his songwriting and his musical talent and, after all these years people would still speak to me with great reverence of his talent and contribution to Australian music.

	Born in Waipukarau, New Zealand, Taylor had a hand in some of the most enduring Australasian songs of a generation.


	Dragon was formed in Auckland, NZ, and relocated to Sydney, Australia in the mid-70s. Led by the band's flamboyant and self-destructive frontman Marc Hunter, Dragon pumped out the hits, initially in the back-end of the 1970s with “Are You Old Enough?,” “April Sun In Cuba” and “Still In Love With You”.


	The ‘80s wasn't kind to many bands from the previous decade, but Dragon orchestrated an impressive comeback with the 1983 album Body and the Beat, which spawned the hits “Rain,” “Cry,” and “Magic.” The first of those, “Rain,” poured down for a Billboard Hot 100 appearance in 1984, peaking at No. 88.


	Taylor was there as Dragon spread its wings for two distinct heydays, performing in the band from 1974–1979, and again from 1982–1985.

	











	Dragon continued to breathe chart fire through the ‘80s with “Speak No Evil,” “Dreams of Ordinary Men,” “Young Years” and a cover of Kool & The Gang's “Celebration.”


	Dragon was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2008, ten years after Hunter died with throat cancer, at the age of 44. Taylor joined his surviving Dragon bandmates for the special Hall of Fame presentation at Melbourne Town Hall.


	Taylor “had a dry wit, was a keen observer and had a memory like a razor but mostly he was just one of the good ones,” writes Jacobson. “That's what has stuck in my head today “he was one of the good ones” and I think that sums it up. I will miss him terribly. My love and condolences to Carol, Lesley and Alex.”


	Today, Dragon continues to tour and record with a lineup featuring co-founder and bass player Todd Hunter — Marc's brother — and Mark Williams on vocals.

	After more than 50 years, Miss Piggy is finally stepping into the spotlight and getting the solo movie treatment she deserves.


Jennifer Lawrence recently revealed that she and Emma Stone are developing a movie about the iconic Muppet with Oh, Mary! sensation Cole Escola penning the script, marking the character's first solo outing since Jim Henson debuted her on The Muppet Show in 1976.


	“I don't know if I can announce this, but I'm just going to,” she prefaced on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers' Las Culturistas podcast. “Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie and Cole is writing it.”

	When asked if she and Stone will appear in the movie, Lawrence said, “I think so, we have to.”


	Lawrence did not reveal any plot details. Deadline has reached out to Disney and Jim Henson Co.


	Starting as a chorus pig on The Muppet Show in the mid-1970s, Miss Piggy gradually became a bigger part of the series, before becoming an icon in the late '70s and early '80s. Despite Kermit being the star, she's long hogged the spotlight from her froggy beau.


	Recently marking their milestone 70th birthday, The Muppets have had a year of celebrations leading up to the news last month that The Muppet Show is getting a refresh from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's Point Grey Pictures. Deadline reported that Disney+ has ordered a TV event featuring special guest star Sabrina Carpenter to premiere in 2026, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the classic original series.

					By Denise Petski 

Senior Managing Editor


	Five years after his exit from Dancing With The Stars, original host Tom Bergeron is returning as a guest judge for the show's 20th anniversary special on Tuesday, Nov. 11.


	“It feels really good,” Bergeron said Tuesday on Good Morning America about his return. “I'm really looking forward to it.”


	 After hosting DWTS since its launch in 2005, Bergeron exited in 2020 after being publicly critical of the show's choice to cast then-President Donald Trump's White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in Season 28.


	He told DWTS alum Cheryl Burke on her podcast at the time that he sat down with showrunners in 2019 and discussed potential contestants for the upcoming 28th season. At that time, he and showrunners agreed that the show would be a “wonderful escape from that divisiveness” of the 2020 election cycle.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“In the summer of 2019, I had two lunches—one with that showrunner person and another one with his boss,” Bergeron recalled. “I said, ‘Well look, 2019 is the threshold to an election year in America, we are a very divided country. Just nobody, of any party, don't go there—just make us the wonderful escape from all that divisiveness for two hours a week.”


	“And then a few weeks later, I get a phone call,” he continued. “And they run down the list of who is going to be on the show, and this former showrunner says to me, ‘You might want to sit down for this last one.' And then they told me who it was, the former press guy for Trump. I said, ‘Guys, this is exactly what we said we wouldn't do. Don't go there. This is not the right time, play to our strengths, be the show that gives people a break from all this bulls–t.”

	











	“And that really pissed me off,” Bergeron noted, saying it was this move that led him to releasing his 2019 statement criticizing Spicer's casting.


	“So I wrote the statement that I wrote, that did not name anybody, that did not name a political party,” he said. “It merely said, ‘I was told certain things when I was asked my opinion, they agreed, and now they've thrown a curveball.' I even went so far as to say it's their right to do that. They're the producers of the show, if that's what they want to do they are entitled to do that. We will have to agree to disagree.”


	“So at that moment, I knew this is probably my last season, because of that one betrayal.” 


	Bergeron offered to “take the season off”. Producers responded by offering to let him out of his contract.


	Co-host Erin Andrews also departed the show after that season, and Tyra Banks followed as the next host.

Kim Kardashian is taking her real-life risqué wardrobe to the screen, sharing some behind-the-scenes snaps of her “All's Fair” fittings.

With a carousel on Instagram, Kardashian posted, “here's a sneak peak of some looks from the first few episodes,” accompanied by close to 20 different looks from the show.

Starting the slideshow with a double-breasted shorts suit, Kardashian looks the picture of her high-profile lawyer character, Allura Grant.

In one image, Kardashian appears to wear a classic pin-striped outfit, complete with a tight pencil skirt, button-down shirt, waistcoat and tie.

The next pic, however, reveals a dramatic dip in the back of said skirt, revealing a burgundy thong beneath.

The collection of photos also includes that red croc coat seen in promos, a blue satin pajama set, the white date-night gown from episode one and several more Kardashian-worthy designs.

In her caption, the 45-year-old adds, “Gonna post a full fashion sneak down vlog of each look! Coming soon …”

While a vlog has yet to be posted, the internet is waiting to see how the show — a legal drama — will use this backless skirt on Kardashian's character.

The look gives new meaning to the phrase “business in the front, party in the back.”

From filet mignon to cheese pizza.

Sean “Diddy” Combs' prison meals have been revealed as he rang in his 56th birthday behind bars over his prostitution conviction.

The disgraced rapper, who is serving a 50-month sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Fort Dix in New Jersey, enjoyed a variety of meals on his special day. 

For breakfast, the “Act Bad” emcee could enjoy fruit, as well as bran flakes and a breakfast cake or whole wheat bread with jelly packets. Combs and the other inmates were also served skim milk, margarine spread and sugar-substitute packets, People reported.

At lunch, which is served from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. local time, the Revolt co-founder could choose between chicken parmesan or a chickpea burger, along with a drink of choice.

The lunch meal also consisted of pasta with marinara sauce or spinach as a side, garlic bread or whole wheat bread, and either fruit or dessert.

For dinner, Combs and his fellow inmates were offered a choice between cheese pizza and navy beans, which were served with Italian pasta salad, green beans and a garden salad with assorted dressings.

If the Bad Boy Records founder, who once had a net worth of $1 billion, has funds in his account, he can purchase several items from the prison commissary, including Pop-Tarts for $2.85, honey buns for $1.30 and cheesecake squares for $1.07.

In July, Combs was found not guilty on two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and on racketeering conspiracy. However, he was convicted on two counts of prostitution.

Last month, the Sean John clothing brand founder was sentenced to a measly 50 months behind bars.

Over the weekend, the first photos of Combs since his arrest last September were released.

In the snap, the unrecognizable dad of seven, who now has a gray beard, was seen laughing as he enjoyed his recreation time outside FCI Fort Dix.

Combs is set to be released from prison on May 8, 2028.

One way to know that the new Alex Rodriguez docuseries isn't a puff piece is that it was directed by a huge Red Sox fan.

A source at the premiere of the new three-part HBO Max doc, “Alex vs. ARod,” told Page Six that the project's co-director, Gotham Chopra “is a massive Red Sox fan, therefore he hates the Yankees and always hated A-Rod. But Alex trusted him with this doc.”

Rodriguez, 50, of course, played with the Bronx Bombers for 12 seasons.

Another guest said that Rodriguez won over the Boston-born director. 

The film was created by Religion of Sports, co-founded by Chopra (the son of famed new age whiz Deepak Chopra), along with NFL greats turned broadcasters Tom Brady and Michael Strahan. 

Brady and Strahan were among guests at the premiere, along with former Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia and his wife, Amber, plus the team's announcers Michael Kay and Suzyn Waldman, A-Rod's Minnesota Timberwolves business partner Marc Lore, Kevin Durant's longtime agent Rich Kleiman, and Rodriguez's entire family.

We hear that during a Q&A at the NYC screening, there was a humorous moment when the former third baseman was asked a “touchy feely” question, we hear, and he responded, “I am in this doc, but you should not be listening to me for mental health advice, please, please please.” 

Said a spy, “It was very funny.”

The warts and all story — which debuts Nov. 6 and was co-directed by Erik LeDrew — is being called a raw and authentic look at the polarizing baseball legend. 

We hear that HBO execs at the DGA Theater debut were “gushing that this one of the top docs they've ever created.”

“It's a side of Alex we've never seen,” said a pal of the hard-hitting project.

“Dancing With the Stars” judge Carrie Ann Inaba is apologizing for commenting on contestant Danielle Fishel's body.

During last Tuesday's show, Inaba's critique of Fishel and pro partner Pasha Pashkov's routine included a remark about the actress being a “tiny, little woman” who should “use the space” around her when she dances.

Before stepping out into the ballroom this Tuesday, Fishel admitted in a confessional that the words stuck with her.

“I am a tiny, little woman, but she's big on the inside — more powerful — so I need to unleash her more often,” the “Boy Meets World” star, 44, acknowledged.

However, she pointed out that “it doesn't come naturally to be flailing [her] 5-foot-1 body around the [dance] floor.”

Pashkov — who has called out Inaba for her “unfair” criticism of Fishel in the past — also took the judge's feedback to heart, saying that their contemporary choreography for this week “is the perfect style to put [that] into action.”

After their performance, Inaba took a moment to revisit her “tiny, little woman” comment.

“I would like to apologize for my words if they hurt you at all because I didn't mean that at all,” she told Fishel during judging.

“You are small, but you do pack a punch, and that's why I can say it, because I believe in you, OK?”

Fishel assured Ibana, 57, that she was “not” offended by the remark.

Despite Inaba's praise for their dance, Fishel and Pashkov, 39, were ultimately voted out of the competition.

Fishel's “Boy Meets World” co-stars recently questioned whether the “DWTS” judges — specifically, Inaba — had “a personal vendetta” against her.

At some point, Netflix is going to have to change the title of Nobody Wants This. After two successful seasons of interfaith relationships, punctuated by awkward Jewish stereotypes, Netflix continues to defy the title of its popular rom-com series, and that will continue for as long as nobody wants it to, apparently. The streamer has renewed Nobody Wants This for another season of rabbi-podcaster romance. In a video posted to various social media sites, Kristen Bell took it upon herself to share the good news with the rest of her Nobody Wants This congregation.

Season two didn't have the easiest rollout. After being nominated for three Emmys, including Outstanding Lead Comedy Series, Nobody Wants This returned to Netflix on October 23. Unfortunately, just ahead of the release of the show, Bell made what many felt was an ill-advised tribute to her husband, Dax Shepard, on Instagram, writing, “Happy 12th wedding anniversary to the man who once said to me: ‘I would never kill you. A lot of men have killed their wives at a certain point. Even though I'm heavily incentivized to kill you, I never would.'” Fans did not take the message well, accusing Bell of minimizing domestic violence. Nevertheless, she returned to Instagram to tell castmates Adam Brody, Jackie Tohn, Justine Lupe, and creator Erin Foster that they remain gainfully employed. And for those asking, yes, Bell, a true millennial, greets co-star Timothy Simons with a South Park-style “Timmy” in it.

Nobody Wants This's second season was well-received by fans and critics for the most part. The A.V. Club found the second date just as enjoyable as the first. “The true draw here was and will always be the palpable central romance,” TV writer Saloni Gajjar wrote in her review of season two. “The dilemmas faced by Noah and Joanne feel relatable and serious, packaged and delivered in a lighthearted yet captivating manner. And as far as TV rom-coms go, it's so easy to fall for this one.”

After months of speculation over whether the once-and-future Batman would appear in Dune: Part Three, Robert Pattinson finally admitted it. He's done a Dune. In a recent interview with IndieWire, Pattinson, who is promoting the new Lynne Ramsay movie, Die, My Love, says that not only is he in Dune, but he found the experience “so relaxing” because he “did not have a single functioning brain cell.” Does this guy know how to sell a movie or what?

“It's actually really nice,” Pattinson said. “When I was doing Dune it was so hot in the desert that I just couldn't question anything. And it was so relaxing, like my brain actually wasn't operating, I did not have a single functioning brain cell. And I was just listening to Denis [Villeneuve] ‘Whatever you want!'”

“I actually found it relaxing. Now I'm taking that into other roles.”

Earlier this year, rumors were flying from here to Arakis that the Dune movies were looking to spice things up with Pattinson. Deadline reported that he was being eyed for Scytale, a villainous Face Dancer looking to overthrow Paul Atreides. If there was ever a way to describe Pattinson, it is “Face Dancer,” but Pattinson didn't say who he was playing, only that his “brain actually wasn't operating,” so he could've been playing a sandworm for all we know.

Principal photography on Dune: Part Three began in July. Pattinson joins a cast of many holdovers from the previous movies, including Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho.

Dune: Part Three is scheduled for release on December 18, 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Great Job, Internet: YouTuber diagnoses how movie trailers lost their voice","https://www.avclub.com/gji-narrated-movie-trailer-youtube-video","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 05:49:00 GMT","

Movie trailers have undergone many changes since they were first rolled out behind the feature presentation in the early 1910s. But in recent years, trailers have lost something: their voice. For decades, people like Mark Elliott, Nick Tate, and Don LaFontaine introduced moviegoers to worlds, lands, times, and to one man who could save them all via trailer narration. But more recently, that voice has been silenced. In a new video from YouTuber Paul E.T., the mystery of how the trailer lost its voice gets a full-throated answer.

﻿

Breaking it down into three sections, Paul E.T.'s video speeds through the history and evolution of trailers. Starting with marketer Nils Granlund developing the idea to promote the Broadway show The Pleasure Seekers with rehearsal clips, Paul E.T. shows how trailers have been in flux ever since. In the '40s, trailers began to feature narration, a helpful technique for introducing both the stars and the films' premises. But it was the '80s when the trailers found their voice through guys like LaFontaine. Unfortunately, like all trends, they grow stale over time.

Paul E.T. comes to two conclusions about trailer narration. First, that they were overused so much in the '80s and '90s that they became cliché, with comedians like Pablo Francisco making a name for themselves through impersonations of those gravely baritones. Second, trailers still use narration, albeit in different ways. As the trailer evolved into distinct components, with trailers for trailers becoming more common in the last decade, editors began relying more on other sounds to grab viewers' attention. The decline of narration saw the rise in licensed music in trailers and staccato editing rhythms set to crucial exposition.

“What happened to narrated movie trailers?” is a fascinating and insightful look at how the trailer evolved into what we see today. We're still in a world dominated by trailers, and god willing, we always will be.

Fans are so obsessulated with Ariana Grande that if she can't make it to a premiere, they're wishing harmulation upon her. At least that's according to an Instagram Story by Grande from earlier today. Grande won't be attending the São Paulo premiere of Wicked: For Good due to plane issues, and she is asking fans to channel their inner-Glinda and not “wish danger on us” for missing the festivities.

“Please don't wish danger on us,” Grande wrote on Instagram. “We did everything we could, and I promise you no one is more upset than I am, I promise. No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please, please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try. There was no other time for me to leave, and these plans have been booked for months.”

Grande assures fans that she is disappointed by the situation as she has “been looking forward to this moment for a year.” In a follow-up post, she upgraded her sadness to “beyond devastated,” stating that she would not be making it to São Paulo until after the premiere. “My team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we've searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time. Even in attempting a private option, there is a permit necessary in order to fly from here that takes time to attain.”

In the second message, she further detailed how sorry she was for her absence and how hard she's been working. After explaining that she “wrapped another film on the 31st,” Grande says an issue with her flight forced her to deplane. The other film was Focker-In-Law, which isn't going to make the anti-male nurse contingent of her fanbase happy. (Don't get them started on which animals can be milked.) Nevertheless, she explains that because the plane had a “safety problem,” she had to find a different flight to Brazil. Also, she's been working really hard, so maybe cut her some slack, okay? “I worked all day the 1st and the 2nd as well, just the same as Jonny [Bailey], Cyn[thia Erivo], and Jon [M. Chu] have been working,” she writes. “We all were scheduled to leave the same day. It just so happened that this plane had a safety problem.”

“I am so heartbroken that I'm unable to be there with you all. We sincerely tried everything we could, and I apologize from the bottom of my heart.”

Wicked: For Good opens on November 21.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sterlin Harjo on The Lowdown's ""funny, sad, beautiful, heartbreaking"" finale","https://www.avclub.com/sterlin-harjo-interview-the-lowdown-season-finale","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:17:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: This piece contains spoilers for The Lowdown.]  

Ever since Bogie popped the collar of his trench coat and hit the mean streets of San Francisco, America has been riveted by film noir and its style, swagger, sexiness, and dark-underbelly mysteries. And over the past seven weeks, Sterlin Harjo's The Lowdown has delivered a lot of the elements above (and the catharsis of folks getting their just deserts), closing out its first season with a satisfying finale on November 4. 

In the latest FX series from the Reservation Dogs co-creator, our gumshoe is Lee Raybon (Ethan Hawke), an eccentric citizen journalist hellbent on bringing down Tulsa's white-supremacist elite. Lee wraps up his investigations in this week's “The Sensitive Kind,” shining a light on femme fatale Betty Jo Washberg (Jeanne Tripplehorn), among others. He also helps mayoral candidate Donald Washberg (Kyle MacLachlan) face some hard truths. Newly enlightened, Washberg cuts ties with his crypto-Nazi campaign backers and restores his family's land to the Osage people his ancestors stole it from. It's a visceral pleasure to see racists brought low and Indigenous Oklahomans get the restorative justice they've been denied for so long. But sadly, in our current reality, it can all feel like a beautiful dream.

Yet Harjo, who lives in Tulsa himself, insists that it doesn't have to. The writer-director spoke with The A.V. Club to give us the lowdown on inspirations for the series, dig into this season's sendoff, and explain why he believes there's still hope for the future of this country.

The A.V. Club: What is it about Tulsa that makes it a great setting for this very American story?

Sterlin Harjo: I think that everything is represented here that makes up America. It's a diverse city where there is a collision of cultures, and there are unthinkable crimes that happened in the building of Tulsa. There's a lot of history here that is both dark and beautiful. And now reconciliation and facing history is happening.

I also tend to mythologize things that I'm involved with. I grew up in Oklahoma; and culturally, I'm mixed. I'm Muscogee Creek, I'm Seminole, my grandfather was Italian. Both of my parents are half white, descending from various European countries. So I always felt like I was trying to make sense of myself. And once I found Tulsa as a home, I just needed to sort things out for my own dreams and my own myth-making capabilities. 

It's also about myself being a father and trying to figure out if I'm going to be able to make a living for my daughter, who's a teenager, and all the challenges of trying to figure out how to have a stable home for her and myself while also making films and telling these stories. There's been people telling me, like, “You know, it's funny. It's like Ethan's playing you.” And I think it's a mix of all of these influences, including Ethan's own life. He's also a father. 

AVC: The Lowdown represents a wide variety of cultures and communities in Oklahoma, which is sadly rare in shows and movies about the American West.

SH: I think it's more truthful than most writing out there. The worst thing is when people are trying to be diverse just for diversity's sake. That does zero good for anyone. It's not very hard to look out your window and see diversity, and it's very lazy when you don't try to understand that diversity around you. And it's like, Well, are you a writer or not? That's your job, you know? You're supposed to try and accurately represent the world around you, and that's what we tried to do in this show, whether it came from consultants and writers and myself or just a general interest in the people that make up this world. When Killer Mike [who plays Cyrus] first came onto the set and he was talking to me about how much he liked the script, he said, “I love that the story is diverse, but it's not just tacked on. It's not just for diversity's sake.” I'm very proud of that.

AVC: You've said that Lee Raybon was inspired by your friend and former colleague Lee Roy Chapman. The character is so interesting and specific, especially because he occupies a very particular space as a white man who's able to move between various communities in Tulsa.

SH: Yeah, I started [writing the script] after Lee Roy passed. But it was too soon, so I just kind of put it away, and then I pulled it back out when I felt like I was far enough away from it. I didn't want to try to tell his story; he was a complex, fully realized human being that's no longer with us. 

But I love the spirit of Lee Roy and that he wasn't afraid to stick his nose in places that others thought he shouldn't. He wasn't afraid to call out something that he felt was wrong. He did have relationships in every community in Tulsa. He could fluidly move throughout the city, and people trusted him. And I wanted to have that spirit in the character. The show is also inspired by the time period [the early 2010s] when I worked with Lee Roy at This Land Press. It was the last gasp of having a longform magazine in a town like Tulsa. We were trying to change the world, and we did change our world.

AVC: Let's talk about the finale, which was so satisfying to watch. With all the horrible things being perpetrated by the people in power every day, it almost feels like a fantasy of an America we're so far from right now.

SH: It feels like we entered a different timeline 10 years ago. You know, there was a time when you could be white and tough and strong and like the outdoors and like to shoot a gun now and again and still say that Nazis suck. And from both sides, people are scared to do that now. There's this fear to speak out against things that you're seeing and to feel like, Maybe I'll just say nothing. That way I can hedge my bets. And I think that it shouldn't be a fantasy, and that's what the show is.

It's why in this last episode, we opened with this racist preacher intercut with [a reenactment of] the Oklahoma Land Run with Donald Washberg, who isn't a racist but he's participating in things that were constructed by racism and therefore is still a part of it. But he's not a bad person; he even knows the Native activists by name. These are all really tough things to parse and sort of express in nuance. But like, it's all there; that's real. There are cowboys that will turn to a Black man in Tulsa and say, “Hey, don't go to that racist place. You could get hurt.” That's actually more real than I think what mainstream media puts out there. We're not as divided. 

So hopefully it's not a fantasy. Hopefully we can get back to that. [There's this idea that] you're either good or bad, but there is a lot in between. We can strive to be good or we can strive to be bad. We can strive to be together or we can strive to be separated. And hopefully, history has taught us that separating ourselves by race, by sexual orientation, by politics is a bad thing for everyone. There's proof of that over and over and over again. 

AVC: At the beginning of the finale, Chutto [Mato Wayuhi] tells Lee that his family doesn't care about getting their land back from the Washbergs, and Lee struggles to understand why. Can you talk about that moment?

SH: Land becomes so much about individual ownership, and that's not the point. Whenever Native people say, “We would like our land back,” it's not because they want to individually own it. It's because land is there for community. It's there for food; it's there for shelter; it's a basic human need. And it's caused so much pain in this country because people have this idea that they need to own it. It's made people sick, it's made people fight, and it's making many people die. 

And look, I exist in Oklahoma because I was displaced here. My ancestors were moved here because of land. So my existence has always been connected to land and displacement and who has land and who doesn't. We were all moved to Oklahoma, and then the land wasn't good here. And then there's the Dust Bowl, and then all of a sudden, there's oil, and the land is good. It's all connected to capitalism and money. 

Tulsa was founded by Muscogee Creek Indians. And the reason is because we were moved here from Alabama, our homeland, and we had to walk all the way to Oklahoma. The word “Tulsa” comes from the word “Tallahassee,” which is a Muscogee word that means “old town.” Our whole story is about the taking of land and hurting people to own it.

AVC: I love that the season ends with Betty Jo cry-singing a karaoke version of Waylon Jennings' “Luckenbach, Texas (Back To The Basics Of Love)” at a bar. What made you decide to finish on that scene?

SH: I had written that moment for another part, and it ended up not working in that part. But we just loved the performance so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn is amazing. Betty Jo gets away, but internally, she doesn't, and I needed to show that. She's back in her spot, and she's trying to be the rodeo queen still, but she can't help but feel the undercurrent beneath the words she's singing. It's funny, it's sad, it's beautiful, it's heartbreaking. And that's the show, you know?

Robert Irwin and professional partner Witney Carson brought power and precision to the ballroom during “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Night” on “Dancing With the Stars.” The duo performed a Paso Doble to “Icky Thump” by The White Stripes, blending strong choreography with the energy of a classic rock anthem. The episode celebrated legendary musicians inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, giving contestants the opportunity to channel bold, expressive styles through their routines. 

During the live broadcast, Irwin and Carson delivered a performance that emphasized the traditional intensity of the Paso Doble. The dance, known for its sharp lines and theatrical flair, showcased Irwin's growing confidence and physical control. The choreography featured commanding movements, dramatic pauses, and synchronized spins that reflected the rhythm and tone of “Icky Thump.”

The couple receives a total score of 38 out of 40 receiving two 10's and three 9's. 

#dancingwiththestars #dwts #robertirwin #witneycarson 

The staging amplified the routine's visual impact with deep red lighting and cinematic effects that complemented the song's driving guitar riffs. Judges praised Irwin for his continued improvement and commitment to character, noting how he has evolved from earlier weeks. The Paso Doble allowed him to demonstrate strength and focus, two qualities that are central to the dance's storytelling. The performance aligned with the night's theme by embracing the rebellious, high-energy attitude that defines rock and roll.

“Icky Thump,” released in 2007 by The White Stripes, is recognized not only for its distinct sound but also for its social message. According to Parade, the song carries political undertones that address themes of immigration and hypocrisy within cultural systems. Its heavy guitar riffs and bold lyrics made it a fitting selection for a dance that emphasizes defiance and power.

The title itself originates from the Northern English expression “ecky thump,” meaning surprise or disbelief. The White Stripes used it as a metaphorical statement to critique societal contradictions. For Irwin and Carson, performing to a song with such depth gave their Paso Doble additional resonance beyond its choreography. It combined the intensity of the music with the symbolic strength of the dance, resulting in a layered artistic moment. Tonight's performance follow's last week's knockout dance for Halloween night.

Ahead of the performance, Robert's sister, Bindi Irwin—who previously won Season 21 of “Dancing With the Stars”—shared her excitement on social media. She posted an affectionate throwback photo from her time on the show, expressing pride in her brother's journey. 

The post quickly gained attention, sparking enthusiasm among fans who celebrated the Irwin family's ongoing connection to the series.

Viewers responded positively to Robert's routine, commending his dedication and chemistry with Carson. Many noted how the performance reflected his growth week after week, blending technical improvement with stage presence. With his sister's encouragement and a standout performance on Rock and Roll Night, Robert Irwin continues to solidify his place as one of the season's most talked-about contestants.

“Dancing with the Stars” turned up the volume for Rock & Roll Night, where Alix Earle and professional partner Val Chmerkovskiy delivered a fiery Paso Doble to Bon Jovi's 1986 hit “Livin' on a Prayer.” Known for her social media presence, Earle showed a more intense side this week, channeling the song's grit and drama into one of her boldest performances yet.

For Rock & Roll Night, the ballroom transformed into a high-energy concert setting. Earle and Chmerkovskiy hit the floor dressed in leather and studs, fully embodying the rock aesthetic as they performed their Paso Doble to Bon Jovi's anthem. The couple receive three tens for a combined score of 39 out of 40.

The pair's choreography balanced sharp technique with expressive storytelling, matching the song's powerful guitar riffs and commanding tone.

NOOO FLAVA #alixearle #valchmerkovskiy #dancingwiththestars #dwts 

The judges praised Earle's improvement, noting her stronger frame and growing confidence. While Derek Hough emphasized the challenge of controlling such a high-energy routine, Bruno Tonioli called the performance “electrifying,” crediting Earle for matching Val's intensity. 

Carrie Ann Inaba highlighted the couple's teamwork, noting that Earle's posture and power stood out compared to earlier weeks.

Last week, the duo impressed audiences during the Halloween-themed episode of “Dancing with the Stars,” where Earle and Chmerkovskiy performed a theatrical contemporary routine inspired by “Beetlejuice.” The performance showed Earle's flair for storytelling and her willingness to take creative risks. Judges at the time applauded her character work, and fans online called it her breakout moment of the season.

That experience seemed to carry over into Rock & Roll Night, with Earle embracing the intensity and discipline required for the Paso Doble. The chemistry between her and Chmerkovskiy continued to grow, helping them deliver a routine that felt both technically solid and emotionally charged.

Off the dance floor, Val Chmerkovskiy recently made headlines for his lighthearted reaction to Earle's dance moves at a “Dancing with the Stars” after-party. According to People, Chmerkovskiy joked that he “saw his Mirrorball flash before his eyes” after watching Earle dance in a viral clip from the event. The playful moment showcased the pair's easy rapport, which fans have praised as one of the most fun partnerships this season.

As “Dancing with the Stars” continues, Earle and Chmerkovskiy are proving they're more than just a crowd favorite—they're serious contenders. With consistent improvement, strong chemistry, and growing fan support, their Rock & Roll Night Paso Doble could mark another turning point in their journey toward the Mirrorball Trophy.

Terri Irwin is like any proud mom — doting, sentimental, and always ready to share a rare throwback of her kids. If you're a “Dancing With the Stars” fan cheering for Robert Irwin, you're in for a treat.  Ahead of Robert's next performance on DWTS, Terri took to Instagram to share rare footage of 5-year-old Bindi Irwin meeting her baby brother for the first time. 

The now-viral clip from nearly 22 years ago shows her late husband, Steve Irwin, proudly introducing their daughter to their newborn son. 

The moment is pure Irwin family magic: full of laughter, tenderness, and the joy that made them beloved around the world. In the video, little Bindi cradles baby Robert and asks with innocent curiosity, “I couldn't help hoping that maybe he was really a girl … how do you know it's a boy? Did you check?” Then she looks down and sweetly adds, “How long are you going to sleep for?”

The most unforgettable moment in the video comes when little Bindi proudly announces, “I'll call him Brian.” After a brief pause, Steve gently responds, “His name's Robert.” Without missing a beat, Bindi insists, “But I'll call him Brian for short,” leaving her parents laughing.

Later in the clip, Steve reflects on the beauty of becoming a father as he cradles his newborn son. “It's like the whole reason you've been put on earth — it's to do this. It's what it seems like,” he says with visible emotion.

Even decades later, the tender exchange continues to capture hearts, perfectly showcasing the Irwin family's warmth, humor, and unshakable bond.

After Terri shared the video, fans flooded the comments with love and nostalgia. Many couldn't get over Bindi's adorable “Brian” moment, with one writing, “Steve's face when Bindi says she's gonna call him Brian 😂.”

Another fan shared, “You think Steve was passionate about conservation, until you see him with his family.” Others admitted to rewatching the video several times, saying, “Have I seen this many times before? Yes! Did I just watch it 8 times in a row? Also yes! I just adore Bindi and Brian!”

Viewers also praised Bindi's spunky personality, calling the clip “literally my favorite of all time” and “proof she's had that spark since day one.” Many celebrated Terri for raising such a loving family, with one fan writing, “We all love ‘Brian' & Bindi! You sure have raised them right, Terri ❤️ Steve must be smiling down on you all.”

One fan wrote: “Terri, 🩷 you're the definition of unconditional love — thank you for inspiring all of us mums to lead with our hearts. 🌸🌈💕”

Even Bindi herself joined in, commenting, “Love you so much BRIAN!!!”

One fan playfully commented, “Let's vote for Brian this week!” as Robert continues to charm audiences on “Dancing With the Stars.” The wildlife conservationist is competing alongside professional partner Witney Carson and recently climbed near the top of the leaderboard following the show's Halloween episode.

His sister Bindi, who famously won “Dancing With the Stars” in 2015 with Derek Hough, has been one of his biggest supporters. She and her husband, Chandler Powell, even moved to California with their daughter, Grace, to cheer Robert on throughout the season.

With so much love and encouragement behind him, it's clear the Irwin family's connection remains unbreakable, whether in the ballroom, on screen, or in the heartwarming moments they continue to share.

Between Luis Buñuel‘s neglected, English-language “The Young One” from 1960 and his more widely known classic of pampered guests trapped in a dinner party in 1962's “The Exterminating Angel,” the prolific surrealist released “Viridinia.” The 1961 film marked Buñuel's return to filmmaking in Spain, which was then well into Francisco Franco's reign as dictator, after more than two decades of taking refuge in the United States and directing features in Mexico. 

He did not, of course, return to the most hospitable environment for his confrontational films, here the story of a soon-to-be nun (Silvia Pinal) who confronts the edges of her idealism and religious piety: “Viridiana” was not shown in Spain until 1977, almost two years after Franco died. Now, Janus Films is re-releasing “Viridiana” in 4K starting at New York's Film Forum on November 14, and IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer in the video above.

More on the film from Janus, if it's been a while: “Banned in Francisco Franco's Spain and denounced by the Vatican upon its premiere, Luis Buñuel's irreverent vision of life as a beggar's banquet is regarded by many as his masterpiece. In it, novice nun Viridiana (Silvia Pinal) does her utmost to maintain her Catholic principles, but her lecherous uncle (Fernando Rey) and a motley assemblage of paupers force her to confront the limits of her idealism. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival, ‘Viridiana' is as audacious today as ever.”

 










“Viridiana” has gone on to influence countless nun movies, from 2015 Best International Feature Oscar winner “Ida” (also about a nun who dabbles in mischief and even pleasures of the fleshly kind) to even Anne Hathaway as a nun in Rebecca Miller's “She Came to Me” from last year. (Hathaway told IndieWire she watched the film as part of her preparation.)

“Viridiana” won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1961 but was banned from exhibition in Spain due to its criticisms of the Catholic Church; multiple endings exist, but the one made especially for the censored version of the movie is actually more salacious than the censored one, because in it we see Viridiana heading, basically, into a threesome.

Watch the trailer for the new restoration of “Viridiana” in the video atop this post. “Viridiana” opens at Film Forum in New York on Friday, November 14.

Get ready for a meta time at the movies, as the first trailer for “Atropia” has just dropped (watch below), ahead of the Sundance winner's limited release on December 12. Directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Hailey Benton Gates, known for her work in front of the camera as Josh O'Connor's love-lorn Tinder date Helen in “Challengers,” “Atropia” is her feature directorial debut.

The film stars an impressive cast, including Callum Turner, Alia Shawkat, Zahra Alzubaidi, Tim Heidecker, Jane Levy, Tony Shawkat, and Chloe Sevigny. A satire of the military-industrial-entertainment complext, “Atropia” is based on real-life U.S. military bases that simulate foreign environments to prepare troops for overseas combat or help them to recover after traumatic experiences. Shawkat plays an actress who signs up to portray an Iraqi civilian on one of these bases in California that's been made over to look like the Middle East, where she falls in love with a soldier (Callum Turner) suffering from PTSD.

Produced by Luca Guadagnino, Naima Abed, Emilie Georges, Lana Kim, and Jett Steiger, “Atropia” won the biggest prize at Sundance 2025: the juried U.S. Dramatic Competition award.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“I tried to make a documentary about [the subject of fake overseas villages on military bases] first,” Gates told IndieWire at our Sundance Studio earlier this year. She also just wrapped a part in Kristoffer Borgli's upcoming “The Drama” for A24. “So I did a lot of research and visited a bunch of the bases. Sort of working my way up the DoD, and they weren't interested in my documentary. So then I thought it was a subject ripe for satire. I think America's misunderstanding of the people they're invading is inherently comedic. And I was really inspired by ‘M*A*S*H' and the Lubitsch film ‘To Be or Not to Be,' which is also a story of actors. I love movies like that where the tone turns on a dime.”

Vertical will give “Atropia” a limited release on Friday, December 12 with an expansion targeted for January 2026. Check out the trailer below.

The Golden Globes has announced that actress, producer, and three-time Golden Globe winner Dame Helen Mirren will receive the 2026 Cecil B. DeMille Award — and, as part of a new twist on how the honor will be given.

Rather than during the Golden Globe Awards telecast, like in the past, both the Cecil B. DeMille Award and Carol Burnett Award will take place during a new annual primetime special titled “Golden Eve,” airing on Thursday, January 8, 2026, at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on the CBS Television Network and streaming on Paramount+. 

 










“Helen Mirren is a force of nature and her career is nothing short of extraordinary,” said Helen Hoehne, president, Golden Globes, via statement. “Her transcendent performances and commitment to her craft continue to inspire generations of artists and audiences alike. It is a profound honor to present her with the Cecil B. DeMille Award.”

The Oscar, Emmy, SAG, BAFTA, and Tony Award-winning actress has received 16 Golden Globes nominations over her six decade career, with her first win being for her role in the TV movie “Losing Chase,” and her later wins being for dual roles as the Queen of England in both the 2005 miniseries “Elizabeth I” and the 2006 film “The Queen.” Given her celebrated body of work across stage, film, and television, Mirren was also appointed a Dame of the British Empire in 2003 in recognition of her artistic achievements.

Radiohead are in a strange spot. This is the first time, since their debut album over 30 years ago, that the group is touring with no new or recent material behind them. A band that has been synonymous with invention, innovation, and a once seemingly ceaseless charge of forward momentum is now standing still, a little directionless, and forced to look back. It's easy to forget just how much the band has slowed down in recent years—it's been almost a decade since their last record, and they have made just two studio albums since 2007's In Rainbows.

A recent interview with The Sunday Times also revealed a band a little unsure of their place in the world. They confirmed there are no new songs and no immediate plans for any more, while remaining uncertain of the future beyond this tour. Ed O'Brien said he wanted to quit the band and almost did. Some of them have not spoken to one another in years, and they will be touring with separate dressing rooms for the first time.

Also, the band remain under constant criticism for their stance on Israel, to the point that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement called for a boycott of these shows due the group's “complicit silence” and Jonny Greenwood's ongoing collaborations with Dudu Tassa, whom BDS say has previously performed for members of the “genocidal” Israel Defence Forces (IDF). On Tuesday, The Guardian published an article stating that, after the reporting on the call to boycott in September, “its journalists were blocked from receiving tickets to review the Madrid concert.” If one indeed follows the other, it is an obscene and hugely ironic move given the band's public stance on the rights to free speech and around silencing and censorship issues.

The combination of these factors does not paint a picture of a band at its peak, both creatively and in terms of interpersonal dynamics (O'Brien has also been publicly vocal about his support for a free Palestine). Radiohead's decision to play this tour in the round, on a small circular center stage, feels like a symbolic decision rooted in bringing one another close together to try and regain some sense of grounding and connection.

To that end, the mood outside the concert in Madrid for the opening night of the tour was jubilant. No protests took place, that I witnessed, and once inside, the mood felt the same. In terms of what to expect from the evening, it felt genuinely impossible to get a sense of where it could go. When they got back together to rehearse for the first time in years, they played their albums from The Bends onwards, back-to-back, and then pulled out a long list of 65 songs that would make up an ever-changing setlist. Perhaps this is the first time the group stared into the rearview mirror to think about something akin to a greatest hits set. Or perhaps this is the perfect opportunity to become obdurate, go weird and dive into the B-sides and deep cuts. In true Radiohead fashion, the result was something completely different.

The place erupted as the band casually stumbled onto the stage and glided into the immortal “Let Down.” It's a song that has become a hit in the TikTok era, positioning the band as arguably being more popular than ever during a time when they are being most actively disliked in other corners. The group was encased in wrap-around screens projecting visuals of their performance and only barely visible as the slow-burn groove of the song unfurled over beautifully overlapping guitars.

When they follow up with “2+2=5” and “Sit Down. Stand Up,” the rustiness showed a little, with some clunky and out-of-sync rhythms that struggled to lock in neatly. But the volume and intensity of the songs—with thumping sub-bass and lightning-crack drums—were visceral. “Sit Down. Stand Up” is glitchy, jittery, and chaotic to begin with, but it veered off into wonderfully strange territory on stage, almost sounding like a drum‘n'bass remix. It's the closest the band has ever sounded to making straight-up club music.

The screens covering the band, which only allowed brief glimpses of them in between visual transitions, were a little alienating at first; fine for a band who made their bones on “feeling alienated.” But once they moved away to fully display everyone on stage, there was a mighty roar in response, as the screens soon became a thoughtful and effective element of the production. The set-up inside the circle felt more like a rehearsal space, with the group clustered together while also roaming freely around the stage, playing to different parts of the audience. Also back were Yorke's, let's say, idiosyncratic dance moves: twisting and jerking all over the place in zig-zag weaves and spiralling dips.

The mood and tempo bounced around early on. From a quietly euphoric “Lucky” to a slightly lethargic and stodgy “Ful Stop” via the looming intensity of Hail to the Thief's “The Gloaming.” What followed was a flawless and truly phenomenal run. “Myxomatosis” was crunchy and punchy, again landing with pummeling sub-bass, while “No Surprises” into “Videotape” was a beautiful one-two hit of melancholy. “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi” was genuinely sublime, with the band locked into a furious and ceaselessly twisting rhythm. Then from “Everything in its Right Place” to “The National Anthem” via “15 Step,” the group channeled their imperial era: as weighty, tactile, and eruptive as it is deft, nimble, and graceful.

The group seemed most energized when performing material from In Rainbows and Hail to the Thief. Yorke even fist-punched the air with anticipation of singing “A Wolf at the Door” as it whirred to life, before he let rip emphatic howls. The encore was another story. “Fake Plastic Trees”—as beautiful and welcome as it is—felt like a sideways offering at this point. It was done gorgeously, but it came across as more of a token concession to a bygone era, or parallel universe, of the group rather than a meaningful re-engagement with that period of their work. Things picked up with “Paranoid Android” and when Greenwood and O'Brien pulled out their own drum kits to play alongside Philip Selway and newcomer Chris Vatalaro on “There, There.”

For the closing “Karma Police,” they banded together closer than they had all night. The band moved to one corner of the stage to deliver a rousing and euphoric version. It sounded like a group who were feeling reconnected, in sync, and rejuvenated. It also felt like they were still standing on the edge.

Opening frame: a dimly lit restaurant situated on the 52nd floor, with window views overlooking the River Thames on a weekday evening. Coworkers engage in unintelligible chatter at the bar. Clinking cutlery provides the background music. A lone woman is shamelessly filming foodie content with her front camera. The shot pans to a two-top in the corner where two bastions of British rap excellence—Dave and Kano—par over wagyu steak dinners. It's a rare link for the pair, who occasionally intersect through work but haven't made much time to meaningfully engage. For 27-year-old Dave, this is a dream scenario. He's tracked Kano's career since he was in secondary school, recognizing the East London legend's journey as a road map. Now, as he sits atop the present-day rap food chain and in the center of Britain's culture sphere, Dave is seeking counsel from someone who's weathered the storms of stardom, public life, and survivor's guilt for two decades.

“I wanna know, what life was like in your teens? We shared dreams. How'd you do it? Do you have regrets? What's your life like?” These questions establish “Chapter 16,” a track from Dave's third studio album, The Boy Who Played the Harp. The song is a six-minute, convincingly genuine conversation between him and Kano, who offers reflections that are both nuanced and emotionally effective. “Some years'll worsen you and some will better you,” he says to Dave's angst. Over James Blake's melancholic ad-libs and piano strokes, the two beautifully articulate what life feels like from their respective positions in the Black British lineage. Dave feels his role changing as he ages: He's inching closer to 30 and feels pained watching the youth from his area make decisions that leave lasting damage. Artistically, he struggles over whether any of it matters. Romance is still complicated: “Love? I can't seem to find it,” he admits. To those concerns, Kano urges him to stop rejecting companionship, to take pictures with friends who may fade away in the future, and to grab every accolade that British institutions denied folks of his generation.

“Chapter 16” becomes especially powerful when Kano starts asking the questions: “Can you ever see when you're just someone's wallet? Have you ever smelt when a cousinship turns rotten?…Tell me, have you ever tasted victory and didn't want it?” The inquiries are a beautiful reminder that, in intergenerational relationships, there's much to be learned from all sides. But, within the context of The Boy Who Played the Harp, they lay out the stakes that Dave faces throughout its 47 minutes.

A couple years ago, we heard Dave in another back-and-forth with a fellow UK rap superstar. In 2023, on the occasion of their respective 25th birthdays, he and Central Cee released a collaborative four-track EP, Split Decision. It was a quintessential summertime offering; its cover art depicted a Ferrari F40 being hoisted onto a yacht. Cench's tight, staggering flows were on default settings; he covered familiar themes like taking women on vacation, his previous life as a misguided youth, and how much cash he's been stockpiling. But for listeners of Dave, the EP was a respite from regularly scheduled programming. The Streatham representative isn't any stranger to stroking his own ego, but he's always been framed as a golden boy from the ends—someone whose path could have easily gone “left” but, instead, led him to assume the responsibility of providing audiences with the why's and how's of the working class Black British condition. His contributions to Split Decision reminded folks that, though he often works from a place of introspection, he can (and does) indulge in the pleasures afforded to a young adult with riches. The two-man tape's lead single, “Sprinter,” spent 10 weeks atop the UK Singles chart and became the most streamed UK rap song of all time.

The Boy Who Played the Harp plunges back into the contemplative narration Dave is most appreciated for, even to a higher degree than in earlier years of his career. Its title references the Biblical David, who, in Chapter 16 of the Book of Samuel, played the harp-like lyre to provide relief for King Saul. From the outset, it's clear that in the four years since Dave last dropped a studio album, life feels a lot different. He's been in the public eye for the entirety of his adulthood and now that the initial rush has subsided, an existential crisis is settling in; the money and status that helped liberate him from his previous strata are now agents of internal chaos. On the stripped-down “History,” the intro that also features James Blake, he grapples with the obstacles he's maneuvered through to become an undisputed legend in his field. That's followed by “175 Months,” another slow burner that acts as a confession to God in which Dave questions whether he's strayed too far from grace. Recognizing the contradictions of fame, he asks himself questions like: “How am I tryna pray for Congo with these diamonds on my neck?”

Later, on the self-explanatory “Selfish,” Blake's somber keys are the foundation for Dave's continued self-reflection, which becomes painfully morbid as he analyzes why he can't seem to nurture long-term relationships. Then, on the eight-minute-long “My 27th Birthday,” he runs through his choices with a fine-tooth comb. It's here that we get his most heartfelt dispatches, where he's most willing to unpack his doubts. At one point, he's enjoying a fish dinner at some luxury Caribbean resort and observes white guests mistreating the locals who serve them. At another, he's on vacation in Dubai feeling like a hypocrite because he's denounced slavery and inhumane practices in his work, but is in a nation that engages in both. And, overall, he's feeling considerably closed in; he's spent the last few years in a house he still can't believe he owns, fighting bouts of excessive drinking, imposter syndrome, and loneliness. He asks himself, “How do I explain that I don't wanna heal 'cause my identity is pain?” The question lends itself to why much of The Boy Who Played the Harp, in both sound and storytelling, feels laborious.

Perhaps Dave is caught in a loop of his own making. He's built a career speaking for the most suppressed from the perspective of a person who comes from similar struggles, but now that he's materially removed from that reality, he's unsure of where he stands—in the minds of others but, more immediately, in his own. He denounces atrocities in the Congo, but wears jewelry that may have come from its diamond mines. He hardly ever prays, but seeks guidance from the God he was raised to worship. He boasts about money but won't speak up for Palestine. These are criticisms he turns onto himself throughout the album without ever reaching a resolution. Will he stop participating in these things or does he just want to clear his conscious to the public?

In 2017, on his breakout “Question Time,” a 19-year-old Dave called then-Prime Minister Theresa May to task over UK airstrikes that killed children in Syria and for defunding the NHS rather than paying liveable wages to nurses like his mom. Two years later, “Black,” from his debut, Psychodrama, got at the maddening reality of being part of a subjugated people, working your whole life to dispel myths about yourself, only to still be treated like a second-class citizen. “Three Rivers,” from 2021's We're All Alone in This Together, paid tribute to Britain's immigrant communities as hostilities toward them began to rise. That sort of state-of-society demonstration, which has always distinguished Dave from his peers in UK rap, is hardly present on his newest album. And it doesn't help that The Boy Who Plays the Harp is considerably less dynamic when it comes to production.

What made Psychodrama and We're All Alone in This Together especially stimulating was that between Dave's social commentary and lyrical flexing lay sullen portraits of his of neighborhood (“Environment”), brooding D'n'B (“Voices”), glitzy trap-like bounce (“Clash” with Stormzy), and more. On The Boy Who Played the Harp, that diversity appears sparingly. “Raindance” with Tems, a sweet, stripped-down take on an Afroswing love song, will likely be the album's mainstream win. Young British sensation Jim Legxacy contributes to “No Weapons” as a producer and vocalist, making it the album's most fun track. “Marvellous” is largely about a young boy from Dave's South London neighborhood who's getting a taste of street life, but the Spanish guitar and thumping drums give it a useful jolt.

Even with the presence of these songs, the heart of this album lies in the more downtempo, man-in-the-mirror moments. The Kano-featuring “Chapter 16” is such an effective song in this context because, while Dave spends much of the album berating himself about whether he's a fraud, or has strayed too far from God, or deserves to find true love, the make-believe steak dinner provides him with someone to bounce those insecurities off of. And, even though it takes the long road to get there, maybe this is the point that The Boy Who Played the Harp seeks to make: When you isolate yourself from the world, the voices within may eventually turn on you.

When Denver five-piece Destiny Bond perform live, they shed pints of sweat like any hardworking hardcore band. But every once in a while, they lose more than just fluids; vocalist Cloe Madonna Janzen busted a tooth at a recent gig in San Antonio, Texas, marking the second time she's lost one at a show. Aside from being punk as fuck, Janzen's dental mishap encapsulates Destiny Bond's spirit of inversion: Pain can be liberating, anger can be productive, and hardcore can be vulnerable. On their new album The Love, Destiny Bond mine these dualities and hone their sound into something that's somehow crisper and more ragged all at once.

On their 2023 debut, Be My Vengeance, Destiny Bond leaned into the more melodic tendencies of the punk and emo they grew up on (AFI, Kid Dynamite, Sunny Day Real Estate), and Janzen slipped between phlegmy screams and cleaner yelps. On The Love, she commits entirely to grizzled shrieking, and her bandmates—guitarists Emily Armitage and Amos Helvey, drummer Adam Croft, and bassist Rio Wolf—dish out even heftier riffs, especially on the album's quasi title track, “Can't Kill the Love,” with its crackling guitar solo and burly backing vocals. The subsequent “Debt Perception” borrows from even gnarlier genres like power metal, between Croft's walloping kick drum and Wolf's crunching bass riffs.

As Destiny Bond's lyricist, Janzen animates many songs with rallying cries for trans people such as herself (and Wolf), but she always strives to write for anyone struggling within their tight-knit scene. “Debt Perception” could be read as a screed against anti-trans legislation, or a manifesto against oppression in general. “You still won't let us live,” Janzen screams, sawtoothed guitar surging just below her voice. “Now we swing as hard as the rest of them/You can't keep us in.” It's no coincidence that such a unifying song has one of Destiny Bond's most shoutable choruses: “We bash back/Break glass/Keep score!”

On Be My Vengeance, Janzen's lyrics were mainly focused on the Denver punk community, where Destiny Bond have proved a nurturing force. But the new album is more introspective, with Janzen taking a microscope to intra-band dynamics. Fist-pumping opener “Destiny Song” has the melodic lead guitar of 1990s pop-punk, and it functions as a rousing band theme (“I'm bound to you/You're bound to me/Baby, we're bound by/We're bound by destiny”). But Janzen isn't just singing arm-in-arm punk anthems; she wrote “Lookin' for a Fight/Done Lookin” as an examination of her occasionally fraught friendship with drummer Adam Croft. “We had some aggression issues we had to work out,” she said of their dynamic in a recent Talkhouse conversation with Scowl's Kat Moss. Janzen described the track as “a conversation between me and Adam, how I perceive our fights in my brain.”

A punk song of heightened emotional maturity, “Lookin' for a Fight/Done Lookin” presents both Janzen and Croft as flawed and prone to prod each other's wounds. The song is a breakneck burst of speed punk that reflects the bandmates' charged relationship. Both are working at their highest wattage here—especially Croft, who bashes his drum kit at a feverish pace. Toward the end, a rhythmic shift denotes a change of heart. Atop a steadier tempo, Janzen scraps the feud and embraces Croft: “My home is right here/Wherever I find/Find you with me.” Sometimes, the pain is the cure.

Makaya McCraven's music is a process of transmutation: In his hands, improvisation turns into composition and then back again. Like most brilliant ideas, it's simple to explain and devilishly difficult to pull off. McCraven plays live with one of his groups, usually consisting of some of the best musicians of his generation. Then, he meticulously edits recordings of those performances into new songs, bringing a dexterous hip-hop production technique into the world of jazz. When he tours, McCraven arranges that material for the band to develop further. None of the constituent parts of this model are particularly novel—Teo Macero pioneered the studio-as-jazz-instrument in the 1960s, with Miles Davis—but it's only possible with McCraven's inimitable combination of a jazz drummer's soul and a hip-hop producer's mind.

Off the Record, a collection of four new EPs that have also been released separately, is a useful introduction to McCraven's evolution since his landmark 2015 album In the Moment, when he began his experiment in jazz/hip-hop hybridization. Rather than a chronological narrative of the growth of the artist, the new set presents a composite portrait: Turn from one EP to the other and you see a wholly different facet of McCraven's identity, from deft percussionist to bold beatmaker. Much of the variety comes from his choice of collaborators, who range from veteran guitarist Jeff Parker to eclectic folklorist Ben LaMar Gay. The shared characteristic that unites all four releases, though, is McCraven's uncanny ability to alchemize hip-hop from jazz, structure from freedom, a collective effort into a singular vision.

The first words on PopUp Shop, which is drawn from a 2015 concert in Venice, California, come from McCraven: “We're about to be makin' some stuff up right here on the spot. This is improvised music. Spontaneous composition.” That's true for his audience that night, but not for us. The next track, “Venice,” is obviously spliced and reworked, with tight loops built from McCraven's drums and Benjamin Shepherd's bass. This Dilla-inspired beat doesn't change much, serving mainly to highlight a blistering Parker guitar solo. Elsewhere on the four-song set, as on album highlight “Imafan,” McCraven retains the live feel by allowing Justin Thomas' vibraphone free rein—until sections suddenly begin repeating, revealing his subtle manipulations. The liberatory lift at the end of this song, like a sunflower unfolding, comes from Thomas' melodic sensibility. McCraven, though, extends the moment for as long as possible after the fact. These edits were made quickly on the day after the show, but they show off the fundamentals of McCraven's process, demonstrating that In the Moment was not a one-off success but the proof of concept for a generative mode of composition.

Hidden Out! also derives from one night, this time a 2017 show at Chicago's Hideout with Parker and bassist Junius Paul (one track, “Awaze,” swaps Parker for trumpet player Marquis Hill and saxophonist Josh Johnson, from a separate set a week before). Rather than a day of edits, however, these songs underwent eight years of on-and-off tinkering, which may explain their relative seamlessness. “News Feed,” for example, begins with crowd noise and then develops as if everyone in that room witnessed the song's moody drama, like the live soundtrack to a noir film. But then you realize that there was no vibraphone on stage—that element was overdubbed. Moments like this occur everywhere, from the dreamy haze of “Away” to the muscular funk of “Dark Parks,” each one a testament to McCraven's patient craftsmanship, his ability to maintain a mood while pushing it, subtly, in a new direction.

The outlier here is Techno Logic, the only EP recorded at several concerts across many years, from 2017 to 2025. These tracks stand out stylistically, too, because of the deep, resonant low end of Theon Cross' tuba and the irresistible charm of Ben LaMar Gay, the only musician on Off the Record capable of stealing the show entirely. Wisely, McCraven lets him. On “Gnu Blue,” Gay chants a wordless mantra that flows over a busy, bassy rhythm, effortless compared to Cross and McCraven's frantic pace. The rhythm section's purpose on “Technology” is to simulate a digital breakdown with lumbering tuba blasts and crashing percussion while Gay delivers their mission statement: “Many, many, many years behind what we've got already/It's called technology.” Gay's most remarkable contribution, though, is not through vocals but the diddley bow, an instrument made with wire, two nails, a wooden board and a beer bottle. As if to prove his thesis from “Technology,” Gay manages to make this simplest of instruments the centerpiece of “Strikes Again” with a driving, repeating figure that brings the traditional blues into McCraven's ultra-modern project.

The latest EP is The People's Mixtape, featuring a quintet of Paul on bass, Hill on trumpet, Joel Ross on vibraphone, and Jeremiah Chiu on synth, recorded in January, 2025 at Brooklyn's Public Records. The band is tighter than ever, or McCraven's editing is more precise, or likely a combination of the two. On a track like the relentlessly propulsive “The Beat Up,” it would be impressive either way; the song dances forward in a dazzlingly intricate rhythm until a fierce solo from Hill urges everyone on, ever faster. The pace rarely lets up, even on seemingly laid-back tracks like closer “Lake Shore Drive Five,” where an atmospheric synth slowly rolls forward until finding traction in a vibraphone and percussion groove. Then, like coasting down the highway after leaving the congestion of the city, the group speeds onward with exhilarating freedom and purpose. At the end of the song, you can hear the audience suddenly appear again, as if McCraven is reminding us that for all his skill as a producer, this is where his music originates each and every time: in a room with other people, exultantly finding their way forward together.

	Just three months ago, the mere thought of a Radiohead concert in 2025 — or really, any future year for that matter — seemed impossible. Since the band wrapped its A Moon Shaped Pool tour in August 2018, the musicians have been busy with various side projects. And we mean very busy: Frontman Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood have released three albums as the Smile; Greenwood has scored several films, including the recent Paul Thomas Anderson epic One Battle After Another; Yorke released an LP with producer Mark Pritchard; drummer Phil Selway and guitarist Ed O'Brien both dropped solo albums; and bassist Colin Greenwood released a stunning Radiohead photo book. So, yeah, it's been a long seven years since we've seen these five lads together onstage. Would it ever happen again?When Yorke heard rumors of a band reunion last year, he shut them down quickly. “I am not aware of it and don't really give a flying fuck,” he said. “No offense to anyone, and thanks for caring.”


	We care quite a bit. And that's why it felt like a goddamn miracle when the lights dimmed at Madrid's Movistar Arena for the kickoff to Radiohead's 2025 European tour, and they took the stage after the longest break of their career. It was worth the wait.

	They opened with “Let Down,” marking the second time they've kicked off a set with the OK Computer stunner since Manchester in 2017 (it recently entered the Hot 100 a cool 28 years after its release thanks to TikTok, because the kids are just like us — hysterical and useless). 


	It immediately felt like the band was ushering in a new era, for several reasons. They were joined by drummer and percussionist Chris Vatalaro — a Selway collaborator who's played with Imogen Heap, Anohni and the Johnsons, Jarvis Cocker, and more — who has seemingly taken over for Portishead's Clive Deamer, their previous live drummer. But most notably, tonight was the first time Radiohead performed in the round. For the first few songs, they were concealed by a semi-translucent video curtain, which began to partially lift during a steadfast “Bloom,” off The King of Limbs.

	











	The video screen split into panels that lifted up and down throughout the show, always obscuring a large part of the stage. At times, this made it difficult to see the band, but Yorke made sure to consistently shift positions so everyone in the arena could get a glimpse of him. And when we say “shift,” we actually mean “dance,” in the lovable Yorkian way we all know and love. It was joyous to see those moves again after so many years, whether it was while clutching his keyboard synth during “Ful Stop” or during “The Gloaming,” his arms wading through invisible water, shaking in his sneakers like a frenzied, enthusiastic child. It is now the witching hour. Are you ready?

	“The Gloaming” is just one of the six Hail to the Thief songs the band tore through tonight, including the first “Sit Down. Stand Up.” since 2004 (we have a lot of “the rain drops” to make up for since then). “A Wolf at the Door” has only been played sporadically in the past, and Yorke nailed every single line of the spoken-word Capitalist fairytale — investments and dealers! investments and dealers! — showing us just how much they've rehearsed for these momentous shows. 


	Going heavy on this 2003 album isn't surprising, considering Radiohead just released the excellent Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003-2009), packed with songs so great that they even caught Yorke by surprise. “I was shocked by the kind of energy behind the way we played,” he said at the time. “I barely recognized us, and it helped me find a way forward.” (As my colleague Rob Sheffield noted, “It's welcome news to see Thom Yorke suddenly remembering that there once was a band called Radiohead, and that they were actually very good at playing music.”)

	“Weird Fishes/Arpeggi” will always be a highlight in any Radiohead show, if not just to watch O'Brien contribute those soulful backing vocals. The guitarist is often overlooked, but glance over at him during songs like this, and he's singing his heart out, delivering magic. Another heartwarming In Rainbows moment: both Greenwood brothers facing each other during “Bodysnatchers,” with Colin beaming. We're so back, baby.


	Yorke isn't one to address crowds during shows — he's not going to tell a story about his childhood, like Bruce Springsteen. But when the band emerged to rapturous applause for the encore, he uttered two simple words while clutching an acoustic guitar: “Fair enough.” He then dove into “Fake Plastic Trees,” the only Bends material to fly in from Planet Telex tonight, complete with an audience sing-along and cellphone flashlights (by this time, the video screen had officially lifted, leaving a clear view). The same goes for Amnesiac — we only got “You and Whose Army?”, but it was absolutely killer, with a camera on Yorke's mic, capturing his dramatic eyebrow raises and hand gestures. 

	











	Elsewhere, the encore portion featured the usual spectacular suspects, from a thrilling “There There” to a stop in OK Computer-ville, including “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” “Paranoid Android,” and their usual closer, “Karma Police.” A gut-wrenchingly beautiful rendition of the Kid A staple “How to Disappear Completely” was cushioned in between these, a reminder that we are indeed here, and this is really happening.

	This is the first Radiohead tour without a new album, and their first show of any kind since they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 (only O'Brien and Selway showed up to the ceremony). Several factors — grief, mental health, and intraband tension over the Israel-Hamas conflict — almost prevented them from returning at all. In a way, Yorke's “fair enough” sounds like an admission that they're officially, unambiguously, classic rock. He reportedly sent around a 65-song set list for the band to rehearse, and Radiohead plan on changing up the set list from night to night — a major pivot from their past refusal to play the classics. It would be easy to call this a cash grab, but as they've proved over the past seven years, they don't need to do these shows. This was for the fans.Radiohead Set List: Nov. 4, 2025“Let Down”“2 + 2 = 5”“Sit Down. Stand Up.”“Bloom”“Lucky”“Ful Stop”“The Gloaming”“Myxomatosis”“No Surprises”“Videotape”“Weird Fishes/Arpeggi”“Everything in Its Right Place”“15 Step”“The National Anthem”“Daydreaming”“A Wolf at the Door”“Bodysnatchers”“Idioteque”


	Encore:“Fake Plastic Trees”“Subterranean”“Paranoid Android”“How to Disappear Completely”“You and Whose Army?”“There There”“Karma Police”

Sabrina Carpenter arrested Nicole Kidman during her concert on Tuesday night at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena, invoking the Babygirl actress' iconic AMC ad. 


	“We come to this arena for magic, right?” Carpenter said from the stage. As the cameras focused in on Kidman, she continued, “Oh, my goodness, speaking of magic. I expected to find love, but not my soulmate. What is your name?”


	After Kidman told her, Carpenter asked, “Nicole, where are you from?” Upon hearing that Kidman is from Nashville but is originally from Australia, Carpenter replied, “But you live in Nashville, which means if things work out between us, then I guess I'm moving to Nashville.” She added, “You're so — oh, babygirl, I don't know what to do.”

We come to the #ShortnSweet tour for magic … and to see who #SabrinaCarpenter “arrests” next. This time? It was NicoleKidman. 😍 #Juno #MansBestFriend 


	Carpenter has been pulling out the big guns on tour recently when it comes to finding celebrities to arrest being too hot. Last week, she arrested Anne Hathaway during her five-night run at Madison Square Garden in New York. “Has anyone ever told you you look like a princess?” Carpenter said. “I'm getting so flustered. Anne, can I arrest you for being the most perfect princess in the world?” She previously arrested model Gigi Hadid in Pittsburgh for being a “gorgeous girl.” 

	











	The pop star is on the final leg of her multiyear Short n' Sweet tour. It concludes Nov. 23 at Los Angeles' Crypto Arena (a night that is certain to attract a high-profile arrest). Recently, Carpenter played double duty on Saturday Night Live, hosting and performing her songs “Manchild” and “Nobody's Son.”

	The shrine to a San Francisco bodega cat continues to grow a week after he was killed by a robotaxi. A mound of brilliant marigolds, colorful hand-written notes, candles, treats, and cat toys overflows onto the sidewalk under a large portrait of a regal-looking tabby adorned with a crown. Locals are grieving the loss of KitKat, a fixture at Randa's Market in the Mission District, after a Waymo driverless taxi ran over him during a stop to pick up passengers on the night of Oct. 27. A bartender from a nearby bar rushed the cat to a veterinarian hospital, where he was pronounced dead.


	Known as “the Mayor of 16th Street,” KitKat was named one of the city's favorite shop cats by SFGate. He patrolled the block daily, visiting businesses for treats, and greeting neighborhood dogs and people alike. “He was a special cat,” says Randa's Market owner Mike Zeidan, his voice breaking as he gestures to the memorial outside the shop. “You can tell by the love and support he's getting from the community that he was amazing.”

	











	At Delirium, two doors down from Randa's, bartender Amy Rothbauer says she never worked a shift without KitKat stopping by. It's especially hard that there's no one to take responsibility for the feline's death. “If a driver had killed him, at least there'd be a person to talk to about it,” she says.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The news of KitKat's tragic death has sparked communal grief and outrage as locals weigh in on the safety of autonomous vehicles. SFGate reports that a 311 complaint about the incident alleged that “Waymo did not even try to stop and hit the cat at a fast speed.” Meanwhile, a San Francisco city supervisor is calling for a complete overhaul of robotaxi regulations.

	











	Waymo has acknowledged that one of its fleet was responsible for the death of the cat. “We reviewed this, and while our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,” they said in a statement. “We send our deepest sympathies to the cat's owner and the community who knew and loved him, and we have made a donation to a local animal rights organization in his honor.” The company did not disclose the donation amount or name the organization, and declined to provide additional comment when contacted by Rolling Stone.

	According to recent data, Waymo's market share now rivals that of Lyft. Last August, Waymo disclosed that it has more than 800 vehicles in commercial operation in the Bay Area. That figure, which is nearly three times larger than any total the company had shared before, is frustrating for those who believe that driverless technology is outpacing safety concerns. Last week, on the same day KitKat was killed, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said onstage at a tech conference that she believes society is ready to accept deaths caused by driverless cars, as long as the companies that operate them are held to high standards — but the outpouring of grief over the death of KitKat seemingly proves that society isn't ready to put up with any loss of life to a robotaxi, be it human or otherwise.


	Waymo is just one of the robotaxi companies operating in San Francisco; competitors include Zoox and Tesla. Former Zoox engineer Bob Somers, now an anti-driverless car activist, joined the Tesla Takedown movement after his experience designing and testing AV safety systems convinced him they're nowhere near as rigorous as they need to be. Somers tells Rolling Stone that, even with sensor suites that include multiple lidar, radar, and camera systems, AVs have failure modes that can lead to disaster. In October 2023, a pedestrian in San Francisco was hit by a driver-operated vehicle and thrown into the path of a Cruise robotaxi that dragged her for 20 feet. “[The AV] did the right thing by slamming on the brakes as hard as it could, but it ended up on top of her,” Somers says. “The problem was that the vehicle didn't understand that she was trapped under the vehicle, and ended up trying to pull over to the side of the road.” The woman received an $8 million settlement for her injuries. That incident shuttered Cruise for more than a year; the General Motors-owned company only recently restarted operations.

	Somers says the AV industry should see KitKat's death as another stern warning. “Pets are hard to detect and track,” he says. “They dart in and out between things. They hide under cars.” Does that mean that statistics showing that AVs are safer than human-operated vehicles are untrue? It's a matter of where the statistics are coming from, Somers says. “You shouldn't trust numbers that come directly from a company's marketing department.” As of today, Tesla has had at least three robotaxi crashes and paid out two settlements after its Autopilot system was accused of being at fault in two fatalities.


	Zeidan tells Rolling Stone that witnesses said they saw KitKat sitting under the Waymo, and attempted to stop it from driving off. “This lady said there was nobody to yell at in the car, no driver. They were touching the car, hoping it wouldn't move, and it just…. ran over him.”

	Activists have seized on KitKat's story to raise concerns about robotaxi safety. Calling for Gov. Gavin Newsom to grant voters the right to regulate AVs in their cities, San Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder said on Instagram, “Waymo thinks they can just sweep this under the rug and we will all forget, but here in the Mission, we will never forget our sweet KitKat. We will always put community before tech oligarchs, and California should do the same.” On Nov. 4, at a press conference in front of Randa's Market, Fielder announced a plan to introduce a resolution that would allow counties the right to ban autonomous vehicles. She was joined by Tony Delorio, principal officer of Teamsters Local 665, who told the gathering, “​​Waymo only follows rules because humans programmed them, not because it cares about our kids. If tech companies want to use our streets, they play by our rules, starting with local control.”


	Remembering getting the call that KitKat had been hit, Zeidan passes a shaky hand over his face. “It could have been a child,” he says. “Hopefully, something good will come out of [his death].” Next door at Delirium, bar patrons raise a glass in their feline friend's memory. “Maybe he'll be a catalyst for change,” one says wryly. Rothbauer, the bartender, sighs. “Everybody loved that KitKat.”

	It was a historic Election Night in New York City — and it wouldn't be Patti Smith's style to let the drama of the moment go unmilked. Smith appeared at Manhattan's Town Hall on November 4 to introduce her new memoir, Bread of Angels. It was a night of songs and stories, with stripped-down acoustic performances of classics from all over her catalog. But Smith made it feel like a New York celebration, from one of the city's great romantic bards, the Scheherazade of CBGBs — singing, reading, speaking her mind.


	“I'm very happy that we're all here together for a very auspicious day,” Smith told the crowd at the beginning. “A very special day. Out in the world, of course, it's Election Day — but also within our little world, where we're just sorta independent from the rest of the world, just for a little while.”


	She noted that November 4 was a significant day for her, as the birthday of her longtime friend Robert Mapplethorpe, the photographer and hero of her book Just Kids. “It also marks the passing day of my beloved husband, Fred ‘Sonic' Smith,” she said. “It's a day of celebration and remembrance and knowing that I have the privilege of loving these two wonderful men.”

	











Bread of Angels looks back on her childhood, especially her tight bond with her siblings, and her early adventures running wild in NYC, as she brings her poetry and rock & roll together during the punk explosion. But she leaves rock stardom behind in 1980 to build a new life in Michigan with Smith, the MC5 guitarist — by her account, in the fourteen years after their wedding, they're never physically apart besides the “handful of hours” she spends in the hospital giving birth to their two children. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But the heart of Bread of Angels is her grief tales, as she suffers the deaths of her husband, her parents, her brother, her friends, and many more. In one touching episode, after being widowed at 47, she receives a phone call from a total stranger — R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe — who calls to console her on her first Valentine's Day alone, and offers to be her valentine. (As he notes, he was “somewhat intoxicated.”) Another time, Bruce Springsteen cheers up her bereaved 12-year-old son by taking him for his first motorcycle ride — a fatherly promise that Fred Smith didn't live long enough to fulfill.

	Ever the raconteur, Smith discussed writing the book, her childhood, and even her fashion. “You're probably noticing that I took a lot of care in my attire,” she quipped early on. (To nobody's surprise, she was dressed down in jeans and work boots.) “I'm a superstitious kind of writer,” she explained. “And I tend to wear the same thing. I wore this old Electric Lady T-shirt through writing the whole book, in many countries of the world, and these same dungarees and my old writer jacket. But I would like to say that I DID wash my hair today.”


	Smith brought out her daughter Jesse to play piano while she read from the book, in a meditation on Emily Dickinson. Two of her longtime bandmates, Lenny Kaye and Tony Shanahan, joined her for an acoustic “Ghost Dance,” her 1978 lament for the Hopi tribe, and the classic “Because the Night,” recalling how she wrote her lyrics while waiting desperately for Fred Smith to call. Her producer Jimmy Iovine slipped her a tape of the Springsteen song while she was making her Easter album, resistant to the idea of doing any outside material — until she heard “Because the Night.” As she said, “I wanted to write my own songs and I had this fucking hit staring me in the face!”


	But the night's highlight came when she cast a spell with a hushed performance of “Dancing Barefoot,” her greatest song, the sex-and-death incantation from her 1979 album Wave. She read about getting inspired to write it by Delacroix's painting of Mary Magdalene gazing up at the crucified Christ. She kept the postcard in her guitar case for inspiration, until she and Ivan Kral wrote the tune together. “This song has many levels, but essentially it was a love song to Fred,” she said. “I was imagining Fred and I in another realm, he the hero and me the heroine.” But the record company tried to get her to change the word “heroine,” thinking it was a drug reference. “Just a little window of how tough it was to be a girl in the Seventies,” she said with a laugh. “I won the argument but lost the radio play.”

	She discussed her upcoming live shows to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of her classic 1975 debut Horses. “I can still access the part of me who wrote those things,” she said. “I can't say that I want to stay there — because I've evolved — but I still can comprehend the energy.” She recalled the album's climactic fantasy “Land,” calling it “a semi-apocalyptic journey of the hero Johnny. But in fifty years, so many things have changed. The things that Johnny saw and was concerned about fifty years ago—they seem like baby sauce compared to what Johnny is going through now. The world is complete fodder for the dark adventures of Johnny.”


	She read a poignant section from Bread of Angels where she contemplates the writer Yukio Mishima and “the lust for ascension,” as expressed in his poem Icarus. “At times I mourn the worlds I knew,” Smith mourned. “The hopes of my generation, flowers in hair, dancing to the Dead, seeking a universal music, ‘the language of peace,' as Jimi Hendrix would say.”

	For the end of the night, she had the crowd sing “Happy Birthday” to Robert Mapplethorpe, then led a festive romp through “People Have the Power.” She'd already done the song earlier, as part of a medley with “Peaceable Kingdom” — but she wasn't letting the crowd go home without a full-on sing-along version, not on a night when the city was possessed by Zohran fever. She turned “People Have The Power” into an Election Night sing-along, which turned out to be prophetic a few hours later when the city got a new mayor whose knockout victory speech quoted Eugene Debs in the first line. It was one of those nights when Patti Smith and New York City seemed to be vibrating on the exact same wavelength.

One of the most anticipated UFO/UAP documentaries in years is only weeks away from landing, and Collider can offer an exclusive sneak peek into the information its experts have to share. Premiering on November 21 in select theaters and on Prime Video, The Age of Disclosure explores an 80-year global cover-up, particularly by groups in the U.S., including the CIA, of non-human intelligent life and a race to reverse engineer alien technology. Coming in the wake of September's congressional UAP hearings, it features interviews from 34 current and former U.S. government, military, and intelligence community members with direct knowledge of the situation and concerns about what's at stake. Our sneak peek focuses on two particularly prominent individuals with a dire message about what they believe these unidentified aircraft indicate.

For 20-year intelligence community veteran and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Christopher Mellon, the evidence he's seen is enough to affirm that intelligence has arrived from another world. The video features a mix of segments from him and Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program chief scientist Hal Puthoff laying out the logic behind the presence of aliens. Unusual sightings by the military, like the famous ""Tic Tac"" aircraft video, Puthoff believes, indicate that something is taking a measure of humanity's technological might. Mellon adds that it only makes sense that, as the U.S. and other countries make greater advancements and become closer to rivaling these extraterrestrials, they'd start acting out of self-preservation. Both are convinced that something is watching closely with great concern.

Whether you believe in Mellon and Puthoff's assessment or not, The Age of Disclosure promises to highlight a bevy of issues surrounding UAPs and the U.S.'s handling of them, with real testimony from a wide range of government insiders recounting what they saw and experienced. Through figures like Lue Elizondo, who resigned from his government post in 2017 to bring three videos from Navy aircraft pilots and the existence of the AATIP to the media, it seeks to paint a credible picture of how the government has tried to push back against disclosure, even once more information reached the public. Moreover, the documentary tracks the growing movement to learn more from those with knowledge of what's been going on behind the scenes. In recent years, the push to bring UAP reports to light and brief Congress members on such encounters has gotten bipartisan support, from Democratic senator Chuck Schumer to current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and has already led to changes in legislation.

Mellon, Puthoff, Elizondo, and Rubio are just a few of the individuals who lend their voices to the documentary. The Age of Disclosure brings together officials of all backgrounds willing to share their insight, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Mike Rounds, former Director of National Intelligence General Jim Clapper, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Tim Burchett, Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who testified to Congress about UAPs, Stanford's Dr. Garry Nolan, and Commander Dave Fravor, who chased the ""Tic Tac,"" among many others. They brought a mix of scientific context to explain the bizarre nature of the military sightings, internal knowledge, and concerns ranging from what UAPs mean for humanity, how their technology could be used, and whether other countries were already at work reverse-engineering such tech.

At the helm of the ambitious project was first-time filmmaker Dan Farah, who previously served as a producer on Ready Player One, among other projects. He had unprecedented access for his directorial debut, not only getting to work with government officials who've been in the room for UAP hearings and have captured video, but also getting to film around Washington, DC. In an interview with Collider's Steve Weintraub following the film's premiere at SXSW, he expressed his desire to craft ""the most credible, non-sensational, serious documentary ever made on this topic,"" prioritizing landing officials who could lend real credibility to something often not taken seriously.

""I found my way to people, high-level officials in the government, military, and intelligence community who have direct knowledge of this topic and made them comfortable opening up in this documentary with what they could lawfully disclose. The most meaningful reasons they did it was they all felt a responsibility to bring out some of the truth to the public, to the extent they legally could. They felt the weight on their shoulders, and the film presented them with a comfortable and safe opportunity to do so because I was lining up so many interview subjects that there was strength in numbers. No one person had to go out on a limb and put themselves out there alone. They were surrounded by dozens of other high-level people. Every single person in this film is aware of a lot of information they could never legally disclose. When you watch the film, and you think about that, you see how much they reveal, and you think about how much more there is, that's a pretty wild thought.""

A driver on Interstate 80 in Centre County has filed a report that he saw a possible Bigfoot crossing the highway last month. 

The man, identified only as B.G., told the Bigfoot Research Organization (BFRO) that he and wife were driving on west on Interstate 80 near mile marker 169 around 5:30 p.m. Oct. 4.

A BFRO investigator determined the incident occurred about 11.5 miles northeast of Bellefonte. 

Traveling about 150 yards behind a Subaru, the man said he noticed “something” on the right shoulder walking to the left on two legs. 

“I immediately thought, ‘What the hell is he doing?! He's going to get hit!'” the man reported, thinking it was a person. 

The figure crossed in front of the Subaru, and the man said he could still see the head above the car. 

When he got a better view, the man said the figure was “completely dark, all the same color” with a “slender/slim build” and long arms that were not raised as it walked. 

As it moved across the highway, the man said he was “shook” by the how it almost glided or slid instead of walking like a typical person. 

The figure did not stop to step over the guardrail but kept moving effortlessly, leaving the man to think there was a break in the railing, but there wasn't. 

His wife was looking out the passenger side window and did not see anything or react until the man yelled, “What the hell was that?” By that time, the figure had disappeared, and she did not see it. 

“I just want to add I know what I saw, but don't know WHAT I saw,” the man said in his report. “I'm an avid hunter with +50 years in the woods. This was not a bear.” 

A BFRO investigator spoke to the witness, who is a retired civil engineer and Air Force veteran. “I found him to be sincere and very credible,” the investigator said. 

The BFRO did not immediately respond to an email from PennLive seeking additional information. 

Earlier this year, a Penn State student reported a possible Bigfoot encounter in State Game Lands 333 while raccoon hunting in February. He said he heard tree knocks and then was followed out of the woods. 

And, just last month a report by Canada Sports Betting ranked Pennsylvania in the top 10 as a “Bigfoot hotspot.”

The Burlington Cenotaph War Memorial once stood majestically in its original location on the shore of Lake Ontario at Lakeside Park (now Spencer Smith).

The cenotaph was dedicated in April 1922 by Lord Byng (Governor General of Canada). A choir of students sang O Canada, the Burlington Fireman's Band performed and T. Waumsley played the Last Post in memory of the soldiers who gave their lives. Three Maple trees were planted surrounding the memorial, signifying the 3 branches of the armed forces.

In 1962, development along Lakeshore Road dictated the need to move the cenotaph. It was then moved next to the newly constructed Town Hall on Brant Street, where it remains today.

The cenotaph is a 10-foot granite column on a two-tier base. A seven-foot bronze statue of a Canadian soldier in First World War battle dress tops the column, which lists the names of 38 First World War fatalities from Burlington and Nelson Township, 17 key First World War Canadian battle locations, and the names of 44 local service people who died in the Second World War. Burlington's contributions to the military conflicts in Korea and Afghanistan, as well as peacekeepers, are recognized on the base of this monument.

Local legend and lore has tales of the haunted Burlington Cenotaph where paranormal activity has been reported. The bronze statue is considered to be remarkedly lifelike. The stories claim that on nights of a full moon, the statue is rumoured to come down from its pedestal and walk around. Other reports have observed the hands of the statue moving down its rifle in different positions and the statues eyes glowing white on certain nights. Others have heard voices, marching feet and bugles. The spirit is said to be that of Alfred Johnson, a Second World War Private. With claims that he is “here to protect the city”. It is reported that he enjoys the occasional cigarette. His name is among those engraved on the monument.

So, who was Alfred Johnson?

Alfred Edward Johnson was born in Burlington to Albert and Marg Johnson on January 11, 1915. He obtained his education in Burlington schools. He was employed at the local cannery at the time he enlisted in September 1939. He joined the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and went overseas. Sadly, he was killed in a Commando Raid on Dieppe in France on August 19, 1942 at the age of 27.  He is buried at the Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery in France. He left behind his wife Alexandria.

In November 2020, Burlington's City Council voted to rename the area around the Burlington Cenotaph to the north of City Hall to be named Veteran Square following a request from the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 60 (Burlington). A monument marking Veteran Square was unveiled November 9, 2021, with Royal Canadian Legion members, the Mayor and City Council members, and The Burlington Historical Society representatives in attendance.

The city hopes “that by naming the area around the Burlington Cenotaph, it will bring further respect and reverence to this significant monument and area honouring those who gave residents their freedom and built up this country.” Giving the community a place where they can reflect and pay tribute and appreciation to our local veterans and peacekeepers for their sacrifices.

The area surrounding the cenotaph is used as a location for events of significance such as Legion Week, First Poppy on the Mayor and Remembrance Day observance (November 11).

Here's How We Could Look for Them","https://www.universetoday.com/articles/self-replicating-probes-could-be-operating-right-now-in-the-solar-system-heres-how-we-could-look-for","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:55:00 GMT","

In 1949, famed mathematician and physicist John von Neumann delivered a series of addresses at the University of Illinois, where he introduced the concept of ""universal constructor."" The theory was further detailed in the 1966 book, Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, a collection of von Neumann's writings compiled and completed by a colleague after his death. In the years that followed, scientists engaged in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) considered how advanced civilizations could rely on self-replicating probes to explore the galaxy.

As many theoretical studies have shown, self-replicating probes (released from a single planet) could proliferate and explore the entire galaxy within a few eons. According to new research by Professor Alex Ellery of Carleton University (go Ravens!), these probes may have already visited the Solar System, and some could be operating here right now. As he recommends in a recent paper, future SETI surveys should be on the lookout for the telltale technosignatures these probes would produce. 

Alex Ellery is an Engineering professor with the Centre for Self-Replication Research (CESER) and the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Carleton University. In the past, Ellery has explored the concept of Von Neumann probes and their potential as a viable method for interstellar exploration by advanced civilizations, as well as the implications this has for SETI. In this latest paper, he revisits the rationale for such probes, their implications for the Fermi Paradox, and how resource requirements would drive their behavior, producing discernible technosignatures in the process.

As a researcher with CESER, Ellery is well-versed in the concept of Von Neumann probes and the technological innovations that will go into creating them. In a previous study, Ellery has detailed how 3D printing, self-replication, and robotics will allow humans to build Von Neumann probes sooner than expected. He also conducted a detailed study on how human engineers could place limits on the number of times each probe could reproduce itself, thus ensuring that they do not run amok (per the Berserker Hypothesis).

In these and other papers, Ellery also argues that the search for Von Neumann probes and the technosignatures they would produce is a focus that SETI researchers should prioritize, rather than the traditional practice of searching the night sky for signs of radio transmissions. These searches, he's indicated, should consider the Solar System as a good starting point, which echoes similar recommendations made by Professor Gregory L. Matloff in his paper ""Von Neumann probes: rational propulsion interstellar transfer timing.""

As he told Universe Today at the time of the paper's publication: 

The Solar System is huge and mostly unexplored, and the probes could be very small. There could be probes everywhere: in craters on the Moon, or lurkers in the Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt. There are 100 million objects in the Kuiper Belt alone, and we have examined only two, one of which was very anomalous in its shape.

Similarly, Ellery considers how SETI researchers and future explorers could look for evidence of extraterrestrial probes through a dedicated search. The first step, he argues, is to consider the rationale for sending out self-replicating probes. 

As he indicated in his paper, the most obvious reason for a species to engage in interstellar exploration is survival. This could be motivated by a desire to live beyond the main sequence phase of its star, the threat of destruction at the hands of a more advanced civilization, or fear that technology advancements will eventually threaten the existence of its creators. As told Universe Today via email, in all cases, self-replicating probes offer the most efficient and plausible means for ensuring the survival of an advanced civilization:

ET probes would be driven by survival of their local environment, be it main-sequence star lifetime, tectonic activity, etc., plus military reconnaissance to assess threats and alliances. Although many of us are motivated [by the desire] for knowledge (of which military reconnaissance is a type), science per se is not much of a driver. Nor is the exploration instinct - usually, greed or escape underlies exploration. Columbus wanted to find a route to the riches of Cathay, but America was in the way. 

What's more, he goes on to demonstrate that such probes would not be hampered by the same restrictions as biological organisms. This is true of propulsion, since advanced probes would be able to withstand acceleration beyond 9.8 m2 (the force of Earth's gravity) and would not require exotic propulsion methods. In addition, interstellar probes would not require supplies, bioregenerative life support systems, or have to worry about waste disposal. All the materials they would need could be harvested along the way.

This would include extracting resources from star systems (such as asteroid belts and/or smaller rocky-metallic bodies) or from objects found in the interstellar medium, including asteroids, comets, and rogue planets. This desire for exploration and threat assessment, paired with the need for resources, would lead to predictable behaviors that could help guide the search for interstellar probes. 

From the question of motivations, Ellery concludes that the activities of interstellar self-replicating probes would follow a basically pattern that can be broken down into the six likely steps. First, they would target the ubiquitous asteroids and moons in a specific system for their readily accessible raw materials, which are required for universal construction. Second, from these materials, they would build surveying probes to survey the extrasolar system for resources and life-bearing environments comprehensively.

Third, they would select and secure resource-rich locations to establish bases for self-replication operations. Fourth, they would begin replicating more copies of themselves, including surveyor probes and sentinels. The fifth step would consist of the long-term and detailed exploration of the extrasolar system using these same probes. The sixth and final step would see the probes execute specific task instructions, which could include building O'Neill Cylinders for future settlers while (hopefully) not encroaching on potentially life-bearing planets. 

Another possible task, and a highly controversial one, would be the seeding of planets with simple or more complex organisms (aka. Directed Panspermia). Based on this breakdown of activities, self-replicating probes would produce technosignatures that future surveys could look for. 

Beyond returning to the Moon by the end of this decade and sending crewed exploration missions to Mars in the next, numerous plans exist for the commercialization of Low Earth Orbit (LEO), cislunar space, and beyond. These efforts, it is hoped, will facilitate the ""Great Migration"" to space, possibly leading to settlements on other bodies and ""Islands in Space"" (a la O'Neill Cylinder and Stanford Torii). As Ellery explained, for human exploration of the Solar System to consolidate into commercial industrialization, we must know where to find the resources we need to make that transition happen. 

First, Ellery considered asteroid resources, which are likely to be as abundant in extrasolar solar systems as they are in our own. Beyond the Copernican Principle, which states that Earth and our Solar System are typical of the norm, there is also considerable evidence to support this idea. This includes studies of presolar interplanetary dust particles, which have been observed to contain metal nitrides, carbides, oxides, silicates, and iron-nickel alloys—the building blocks of planets, planetesimals, and asteroids. 

Furthermore, extrasolar planetesimals observed accreting onto white dwarfs within a 650 light-year (200 parsec) radius of Earth were predominantly composed of oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and iron, with smaller concentrations of volatiles such as carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen—similar to asteroids and moons in our Solar System. In addition to asteroids, self-replicating probes would likely be attracted to the Moon and similar rocky bodies because of their composition (silica, nickel-iron, and other metals), which is partly due to asteroid impacts that occurred over several billion years.

Ultimately, Ellery concluded that asteroidal processing would be difficult to distinguish from natural processes and that the Moon would be an ideal base for self-replicating probes to center their manufacturing operations. Moreover, he suggests that nuclear reactors would likely power these operations, as they are a highly fuel-efficient power source that provides virtually unlimited energy density. This could include Magnox models, a type of gas-cooled reactor that utilizes natural uranium, graphite, and carbon dioxide gas as the heat exchange coolant.

These, he concluded, could be constructed using lunar resources, and that the reactors would have left isotopic ratio signatures of Thorium-232, Neodinium-144, and/or Barium-137. ""We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artifacts buried with asteroidal resources on the Moon,"" he wrote. ""Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved."" All of this makes the Moon the ideal place to begin searching for possible indications of associated technosignatures. 

These searches could take advantage of NASA's and other space agencies' plans to create ""a sustained program of lunar exploration and development."" As he summarized:

I think measurable technosignatures will be on the Moon - unusual surface Uranium or Thorium isotope ratios and subsurface magnetic anomalies. If we begin to settle the Moon, we will search for resources to utilize, specifically nickel, cobalt, and tungsten, which are delivered by asteroids to the lunar subsurface. I think that if we have been visited, a gift in return for mining of our resources may be hidden among those asteroidal metals. The gift could be a universal constructor machine that would be of immediate and future utility to any civilization settling its solar system before interstellar ventures. 

In the near future, it is predicted that human exploration of the Solar System will give way to commercial development and the establishment of permanent outposts in space, as well as on other planets and celestial bodies. Before we establish footholds beyond Earth and LEO, perhaps we should consider exploring for more than just resources and building sites. A dedicated technosignature search could reveal something far greater, such as evidence that humanity is not alone in the Universe. Similarly, the Solar System has been largely overlooked when it comes to SETI efforts in general and technosignature searches in particular.

In the whole of Alien, the tit­u­lar enti­ty only appears on screen for about three min­utes. That's one rea­son the movie holds up so well against the oth­er crea­ture fea­tures of its era: in glimpses, you nev­er get a chance to reg­is­ter signs of the alien's being an arti­fi­cial con­struc­tion. That's not to say it was a shod­dy piece of work; quite the con­trary, as explained in the new video above from Cin­e­maTyler. Its cre­ation demand­ed the ded­i­cat­ed efforts of an inter­na­tion­al group of pro­fes­sion­als includ­ing spe­cial effects artist Car­lo Ram­bal­di, who'd engi­neered the giant ape head in the 1976 King Kong remake and the aliens in Close Encoun­ters of the Third Kind (and would lat­er work on an even more icon­ic extrater­res­tri­al for E.T.).

Charged with design­ing the alien, and even­tu­al­ly with over­see­ing its fab­ri­ca­tion and assem­bly, was the artist H. R. Giger, whose artis­tic sen­si­bil­i­ty occu­pied the inter­sec­tion of organ­ism and machine, Eros and Thanatos. Though it's most thor­ough­ly expressed in the dead­ly crea­ture that stows away aboard the space tug Nos­tro­mo, it also, to one degree or anoth­er, per­vades the whole movie's look and feel.

Whether from the late sev­en­ties or any oth­er peri­od, the usu­al sleek, anti­sep­tic sci-fi futures date rather quick­ly, a con­di­tion hard­ly suf­fered by the unre­lieved­ly dark, dank, and dys­func­tion­al set­ting of Alien. This sur­pris­ing­ly grimy real­ism makes the threat of the alien feel that much more real; hid­den in its many shad­ows, Giger's vision preys that much more effec­tive­ly on our imag­i­na­tion.

Not that it was guar­an­teed to suc­ceed in doing so. As Cin­e­maTyler explains, the process of cre­at­ing the alien came up against count­less set­backs, all under increas­ing­ly severe con­straints of both time and bud­get. At times the pro­duc­tion got lucky, as when it hap­pened upon the near­ly sev­en-foot-tall Bola­ji Bade­jo, who end­ed up wear­ing the alien cos­tume (despite Scot­t's insis­tence, ear­ly in the pro­duc­tion, that he did­n't want to make a movie about “a man in a suit”). But it was attempt­ing to cre­ate a being of a kind nev­er seen on screen before, one that had to be devel­oped through tri­al and error, more often the lat­ter than the for­mer. And it was hard­ly the only dif­fi­cult aspect of the mak­ing of Alien, as evi­denced by the eleven-and-count­ing episodes of Cin­e­maTyler's series on the sub­ject. Maybe in space, no one can hear you scream, but one can eas­i­ly imag­ine the cries of frus­tra­tion let out by Scott, Giger, and all their pres­sured col­lab­o­ra­tors down here on Earth.

New observations of comet 3I/ATLAS have shown that our interstellar visitor may have lost a significant amount of mass following its close encounter with the Sun.

For those who haven't heard of 3I/ATLAS, on July 1, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object zipping its way through our Solar System at high speeds. Follow-up observations showed that it was on an escape trajectory. With an eccentricity greater than 1, it was determined to be an interstellar visitor, the third we have spotted so far after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

Contrary to conspiracy theories going around the Internet, a lot of telescopes are keeping a close eye on it and reporting their results. Take a look at this long list of observations on the Minor Planet Center website if you don't believe us. It's an interesting comet, which may be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. Studying it could tell us about the environment it came from, and give us a sense of the interstellar medium. In short, it's pretty cool, even though it isn't an alien spacecraft and shows distinct cometary behavior.

    

For a brief time, 3I/ATLAS was briefly obscured from our view by the Sun. During this time, we got a view of it from around Mars, being imaged by the European Space Agency's (ESA) spacecraft Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). But now our interstellar visitor is back from behind the Sun, and observations can resume. 

Of particular interest to astronomers is how the object has been affected by radiation from the Sun as it made its closest approach, known as perihelion. So far, we have already had some surprises, with the object demonstrating a rare anti-tail, odd and extreme abundance ratios of iron to nickel, and unusual brightening as it approached perihelion. While its behavior is distinctly cometary, it certainly is an interesting object, appearing slightly different from comets bound to our Solar System.

    

The latest observations, from October 31 to November 4, show that the object has likely lost a significant amount of mass during its encounter with our host star. It has also changed course slightly, undergoing non-gravitational acceleration, or acceleration not accounted for by gravity alone. 

As explained by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb in a blog post, 3I/ATLAS has undergone a ""radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared"", as well as a ""transverse acceleration relative to the Sun's direction of 3.7x10^{-7} au per day squared"".

That might sound odd, but it is not unexpected, nor a sign that it is an alien spaceship. As comets are heated, they lose mass by outgassing, where the volatile ices on their surface vaporize, and conservation of momentum tells us the object undergoes a resulting acceleration. Extrapolating from the latest observations (though we should note that there are always margins of error in observations), it is possible to estimate how much mass has been lost due to outgassing.

""The reported non-gravitational acceleration amounts to 94 kilometers per day squared at perihelion. These values combine to imply that 3I/ATLAS lost a fraction of its mass equal to: ~13% divided by v in units of 300 meters per second, where a value of v~300 meters per second corresponds to the characteristic thermal speed of molecules at the surface temperature of 3I/ATLAS near perihelion,"" Loeb writes.

""This ejection speed would be the maximum expected value for a natural comet, thus implying that 3I/ATLAS must have lost more than 13% of its mass near perihelion in the natural scenario.""

That's a lot of mass to lose, but not unheard of for a comet. We also need to stress uncertainties in astronomical observations, which are refined with more observations, and the fact that this is only the third interstellar object we have observed. Its composition appears to differ a little from our Solar System comets, and more observations will hopefully provide clues as to how it reacted to its passage through our part of the galaxy.

If it has lost this much mass (or close to it), we should see a significant cloud of gas in further observations, as well as a significant brightening. The latest observations show that it has brightened significantly, and by a factor of around 5 in the Green-band, indicating that the object continues to act like a comet, albeit one that can give us clues about another part of our own galaxy. Stay tuned for more updates as the world turns its telescopes (amateur and professional) to the object once more.

Sarah wasn't expecting to experience paralysis at 7 am on a weekday during a meditation at her home.

But in August, while listening to “The Gateway Tapes”—a set of guided meditations intended to help people reach new planes of consciousness—she says her limbs froze.

Sarah, who is in her early thirties and didn't want her real name used due to privacy concerns, says the tapes—which she had been listening to on and off for months—took her on a roller-coaster journey of out-of-body experiences. “I was in and out of time and space,” she says. It felt like a bad trip, she says, despite the fact she was sober.

She recalls a subsequent three-week period of disorienting instability that veered from feelings of intense spiritual connection to fears that she may never again relate with others. Looking back, she is relieved she was not left “in a kind of a spiritual psychosis,” but she sees the events as part of an ultimately positive “awakening” process.

Sarah is not the only one to report baffling and petrifying experiences thanks to the Gateway Process, which has been around for over 50 years and has exploded in popularity since the pandemic. But, like many others, she also credits it with helping her calm her mind and make transformative life changes.

Developed by radio broadcasting executive Robert Monroe, the Gateway Process claims to be “a voyage of self-discovery” that can help people go “farther, deeper and faster into different dimensions of consciousness.” Monroe founded the Monroe Institute in 1971 in Faber, Virginia. Dubbed an American “Hogwarts” by one consciousness content creator, the facility claims to help coax people out of their bodies via in-person and virtual retreats, and even Spotify playlists, by way of self-hypnosis style exercises powered by “binaural beats”—sounds attuned to different frequencies which play in each headphone ear. Proponents claim binaural beats balance the two sides of the brain and boost wellness. And while there is still an absence of scientific evidence to support the institute's methods, that hasn't stopped the military from taking an interest in Monroe's mysterious courses which also include manifestation and “remote viewing”—a form of clairvoyance in which one leaves the body to investigate the real world using only the mind.

Since 2022, some 12,500 people, including military service people, psychonauts, and meditators, have joined online and in-person “Gateway Voyage” programs. That's a 35 percent increase in participants over the pre-pandemic period of 2016 to 2019. In 2025, there were 80 in-person retreats with 20 participants each, according to the institute. “For the first time in our history, we have reached the absolute maximum capacity of our campus retreats this year,” says Paul Citarella, the Monroe Institute's executive vice president. In-person retreats cost $2,695 while virtual ones are $1,150. The growing demand has prompted the institute to host retreats beyond just Virginia at other locations across the US, as well as in Romania, Italy, Switzerland, and Greece. The organization's Expand app has been installed 386,000 times since its July 2021 launch, company data shows.

In June, the institute announced it is undertaking what it calls “the world's first higher states of consciousness study” with neurofeedback company Neuphoria, which claims that the research could help people become “among the first humans in history to map, master, and return to altered states—on demand, with data.” Some 333 Gateway Voyage graduates have signed up and will soon spend four weeks tracking their brain state data while listening to the meditations, paying $897 a piece.

A straight-laced southerner with a gray moustache, Monroe wasn't initially interested in mysticism or the metaphysical. In the 1950s, he began experimenting with binaural beats. He later trademarked this method as “Hemi-Sync” technology. This was all in an effort to develop new methods of “sleep learning,” a practice which aims to manipulate the mind to receive information and improve memory while asleep. Then, while testing the techniques, Monroe spontaneously experienced feelings of separation from his body. The event led to him writing his cult classic 1971 book, Journeys Out of the Body, which helped popularize the term “out-of-body experience” (OBE).

“I smoothly floated up over the bed, and when I willed myself to myself to stop, I did, floating in mid-air,” Monroe wrote of his first spontaneous OBE. “It was not a bad feeling at all, but I was nervous about falling suddenly.”

Years later, he and his team created the Gateway Tapes, and they became the go-to shortcut for seekers of OBEs. The remote viewing aspect, which may be familiar to Stranger Things fans, sounds particularly hard to believe, but the idea has obvious military appeal.

And so, in the early 1980s, amid fears that the Soviets had a psychic warfare edge in the Cold War, the CIA and the Department of Defense sent US Army lieutenant Colonel Wayne McDonnell to the institute to ascertain its suitability as a defense contractor. McDonnell gave the organization and its unusual curriculum his approval in a 1983 report which has since been declassified.

“There is a sound and rational basis,” McDonnell writes, “in terms of physical science parameters for considering Gateway to be plausible in terms of its essential objectives.” On manifestation, he adds: “Since our consciousness is the source of all reality, our thoughts have the power to influence the development of reality in time-space … If those thoughts can be projected with adequate intensity.”

Since Covid lockdowns led to growing interests in yoga, meditation, and lucid dreaming, there has been a surge of curiosity about the Monroe Institute, often from people who want to meet dead loved ones or who have had near death experiences (NDEs) and wish to understand them better. A 2021 VICE article on the CIA report about the Gateway Tapes also boosted awareness about the facility.

“Our whole goal is basically what we call the global awakening of human consciousness,” says Citarella. “The core of what we do at Monroe is make it easy for people to access [psychedelic] states without having to use substances.”

Sheila Schwartz, a retired weight loss expert, says the Monroe Institute “saved her life.” She says she was on the brink of suicide after a lifetime of being misunderstood due to her ADHD and autism. She is now in the process of completing her 28th Monroe course. Through the program, Schwartz learned to access “deeply peaceful states” which helped her “rewire my thoughts, open my heart, and speak my truth,” she says. “It helped me reconnect to what I had always known at some level, that I am so much more than my physical body.” She is now in the process of moving to Virginia to be closer to the institute.

The subreddit r/gatewaytapes, with 83,000 members, provides an insight into why. As well as some tales of misfortune and confusion, people regularly tell of blissfully completing the meditation exercises and entering “theta” states, which are typically associated with deep relaxation and vivid dreams.

“The binaural beats synchronize the two hemispheres of the brain,” says Marina Weiler, an assistant professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at the University of Virginia, who specializes in OBEs and is a member of the Division of Perceptual Studies research group. Beats at 100 hertz in one ear and 104 hertz in the other can push the brain into a theta state, she explains, although scientific research on the efficacy and safety of binaural beats is lacking. “That's usually the frequency that people choose to achieve the out-of-body experiences.” People may experience other psychic phenomena and extraordinary experiences, but they do not always have OBEs, Weiler adds. “But they can, if combined with intention and a lot of practice.”

Joe McMoneagle has had a lot of practice; the former US Army chief warrant officer is known as “Remote Viewer No. 1.” In Vietnam he had an NDE and reportedly developed attuned suspicions of when his platoon was about to be ambushed. McMoneagle was recruited into Project Stargate, the US Army's psychic intelligence unit—the inspiration for the 2009 black comedy The Men Who Stare at Goats—which declassified files suggest sketched the insides of Soviet manufacturing plants, found kidnapped generals, and even located the mystical Ark of the Covenant, though it was never recovered.

“My success rate was around 28 percent,” McMoneagle told the Daily Mail. “That may not sound very good, but we were brought in to deal with the hopeless cases. Our information was then cross-checked with any other available intelligence to build up an overall picture. We proved to be quite useful ‘spies.'”

McMoneagle became a speaker and trainer at Monroe, where he did his remote viewing training. “The military is interested in it if it works,” physicist Thomas Campbell, author of the My Big TOE trilogy, tells WIRED. In January he appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast and discussed the institute, after helping Monroe create the tapes decades prior. (A study at the center last year to investigate how pilots can improve the quality of their sleep with Gateway was sponsored by a Department of Defense contractor, according to one nonmilitary participant.) “It's a double-edged sword,” says Campbell. “All technologies and ideas and concepts typically can be used, and be abused.”

However the former army technical intelligence analyst is optimistic about the effect the Monroe Institute's methods might have on the military. “It's going to open their minds,” Campbell says.

During OBEs, people often feel like they are looking at their bodies from another perspective—even floating above with a bird's-eye view. Whereas dreams do not always feel real, OBEs carry a sense that what is unfolding is indeed very real, and that there is more out there than we can usually perceive.

In his book, Monroe—who died aged 79 in 1995—tells of enduring “a severe, iron-hard cramp” across his diaphragm after first listening to the binaural beats in 1958. On one occasion he felt “shocked and frightened,” but over time the pain gave way to spontaneous OBEs. In addition to floating, he also once “experienced an overwhelmingly strong sexual drive and could think of nothing else. Embarrassed and irritated at myself because of my inability to control this tide of emotion, I returned back into my physical body.”

Over time he figured out how to control the process without being subsumed by sexual desires.

For people like Sarah, the road to nirvana can be equally disconcerting. “I had some extreme somatic jolts in multiple areas on my body,” she says in a Reddit post in r/gatewaytapes, trying to make sense of the scary experience. Then, “I was paralyzed, I tried to move my arms and legs and couldn't.” Monroe's cheaper at-home programs come without hands-on human supervision, even though they advise people to “ground” in nature and practice integrative exercises, with instructors on Zoom to provide support. Those like Sarah who do the tapes outside of a course are on their own.

Citarella acknowledges that playing the tapes alone at home can be particularly challenging. “Sometimes people don't want their worldview changed,” he says. “It's almost like Pandora's box: Once you've opened it, and you have some kind of undeniable experience, you can't close the box again.” He adds that, “It's pretty rare that we see someone who really has become destabilized.” But he is mindful that “if you're already struggling with [your] grip on reality and you're changing your definition of reality, that can be not a good thing.”

Sarah cautions against people doing it alone without “a tether to reality.”

But she says that after “grounding” in a reiki energy healing session following three weeks of disturbance, she was left with “a deep sense of comfort that life is indeed meaningful.” She began curbing her drinking and binge eating. She also changed careers and left her corporate job. “It really forced me to take a look at all of the things in my life,” she says. “It gave me a better understanding of my purpose.”

That purpose, Sarah adds, is exactly the same as the Monroe Institute's, “to uplift human consciousness.”

Washington Monthly

QAnon. Pizzagate. Chemtrails.

Conspiracy theories dominate much of the internet and form the rabid core of MAGA canon: That the January 6 insurrection was a “false flag” operation; that vaccines cause autism; and that the 2020 election was “rigged.” 

In the runup to his second campaign, Trump egged on the believers of QAnon, reposting Q-related content and playing QAnon songs (yes, there is such a thing) in his campaign rallies and videos. (As of 2022, as many as 1 in 5 Americans—and 1 in 4 Republicans—were QAnon believers. MAGA's conspiracist roots run so deep that they even ultimately precipitated a crack in Trump's base. Adherents perceived the administration's failure to release the “Epstein files” as a betrayal of QAnon's key tenets: that a Satan-worshipping cabal of pedophilic elites secretly run the world, that Epstein was “proof” of this scheme, and that it was Trump's destiny to “save the children.” 

While social scientists and politicians have struggled with strategies to beat back the tide of conspiracies, YouTuber and cultural critic Natalie Wynn—known as ContraPoints—is reaching vast audiences with her videos. Wynn, an ex-philosophy PhD student, has built an award-winning commentary channel dedicated to countering the rising tide of right-wing extremism on YouTube. She produces extensively researched, expertly set-designed, and meticulously costumed feature-length video essays for an audience of 1.9 million subscribers. “One of the hallmarks of Wynn's rhetorical style is her ability to get her viewers to see things from another person's point of view,” Nancy Jo Sales wrote in a 2021 Guardian profile. 

Her latest video, “CONSPIRACY,” has racked up more than 4 million views with a deep dive into the history and dynamics of conspiracist thinking in America, and how conspiracism undermines democracy. The success of her approach could hold important lessons for how to loosen conspiracists' grip on American politics. 

This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The full interview is available at YouTube, Spotify and iTunes. 

***

Anne Kim: To set the table for our audience, you host a YouTube channel under your alter ego, ContraPoints, which has nearly two million subscribers. You've won awards for your commentary and you've been fearless in your dissections of right-wing ideology. You've critiqued incel culture, transphobia, and racism, and done video essays that have covered a wide range of topics, ethics, politics, gender, philosophy. I think you were once a PhD student in philosophy. Your latest video, “CONSPIRACY,” is a two hour 40 minute tour de force. There's really no other way to describe it. It's about conspiracist thinking in America, and I found every minute to be riveting. We want to talk about your approach in creating this video, but what prompted you to tackle this topic in the first place?

Natalie Wynn: Thank you. My channel has often covered fringe aspects of digital culture. Back in 2017, I did a lot of stuff on what was at the time called the “alt-right,” but which has now increasingly become the Republican Party. So I guess this is kind of my beat in a way. I remember spending a lot of time online as a teenager, during the Bush administration. At that time, conspiracy theories were everywhere online—mostly about 9/11. But there has been a kind of acceleration of it, and a mainstreaming of it, that happened during the first Trump administration. Most fascinating to me was QAnon, because of just how exotic that particular conspiracy theory got. And also the fact that it played a major role in motivating thousands of people to attempt to overturn an election. I actually regretted not doing a video about QAnon back in 2020. But I thought that by the time 2024 came around, it was still relevant.

Gillen Tener Martin: This video has gained four million views, reaching beyond even your subscriber base. Whom are you hoping to reach with this video? 

Natalie Wynn: I thought about this question a lot while I was working on it. Am I going to try to convince people who are deep in the conspiracy world? Am I trying to convince them to stop it? I decided ‘no, I'm not going to do that.' I don't think it's the kind of thing that you can just reason people out of. 

Who I wanted the video to emotionally resonate most with are friends and family of people who have gone down the rabbit hole. I think there is an element of catharsis in hearing someone analyze this thing that has caused a lot of distress in your life. I think millions of Americans and people around the world are in that situation.

Anne Kim: You talk about the patterns that conspiracies have in common. What are the commonalities that you've observed in the various conspiracies that have taken hold of our modern politics over the last 20 years?

Natalie Wynn: There are really two types of patterns that I analyze. One is the method of argument, and one is the content of the beliefs. Part of my research for this video was watching a lot of viral conspiracy “documentaries,” I guess you could call them, that have been influential over the last couple of decades. For the 9/11 “truther” movement, there was this video called “Loose Change,” which was viral on YouTube in the late 2000s. I compare it to “Fall of the Cabal,” which was a Facebook-viral documentary that onboarded a lot of people to QAnon beliefs in 2019 and 2020. What I describe as a common style of argument is basically a ‘catalog of “anomalies.”

An anomaly is something that subjectively feels inconsistent or implausible about an official narrative. So for example, a 9/11 “anomaly” would be that a passport of one of the hijackers was found after 9/11 at Ground Zero. How could a passport survive this fire that burned the building down? 

The 9/11 conspiracy theories at least approximate something like amassing evidence for a specific conclusion. Whereas with a lot of the QAnon stuff, it's hard to even suggest what the logic might be. It's like, “look at these reptile symbols in the architecture of the Vatican.” You mentioned I used to be a philosophy PhD. I dropped out, but I still got as far as logic class. And in logic, there are premises that lead to a conclusion. I would not say that “Fall of the Cabal” is anything close to that. 

Instead, I think what they're doing is creating room for doubt that maybe all the world's institutions are captured by some kind of radical evil. That I think is emotionally powerful because it makes people feel like they have nowhere to go for good information. They can't trust the press. They can't trust doctors. Obviously, the government is corrupt. Obviously, you can't trust any official historian because they're all in on it. So that's uncomfortable, right? Because it's uncomfortable not to know what kind of world you're living in. It creates this thirst for knowledge, which the conspiracy documentary that you're watching then fills in with a bunch of stuff that they haven't demonstrated with anything resembling evidence. But it fills in the gap that you've just created by causing them to question everything else. 

For the content, I break it down into three major tendencies that I call dualism, symbolism, and intentionalism. Dualism is black and white moral thinking. People are good or people are evil. And all of the world's institutions, governments, universities—those have all been captured by radical evil. Whereas, we, the conspiracy researchers and the common people, obviously we're good. 

Intentionalism would be the idea that things happen because someone consciously wills them to happen. So If there is an economic recession, well, that's not the product of widely dispersed, reckless decision-making. It's not the product of ordinary human greed compounding at the level of millions of little decisions. It's instead like, “Someone decided there's going to be a recession now and they made that happen.” And every single detail unfolds according to plan. So that's intentionalism. 

Symbolism I compare to divination, like reading tea leaves or astrology, where you are using associations with symbols that you attempt to interpret. You can look for the symbols basically anywhere. Government buildings are a good place to start. [So take] again, the Vatican: it has reptile symbols, a snake is associated with Satan, so that means the Vatican is probably satanic. A lot of the activity in the QAnon community online was “decoding.” There are these cryptic messages, and then people go around looking for clues. I think this is closer to divination than it is to the kind of thing that a journalist or historian would do, which I think is also fun for people because journalism and history are kind of tedious, right? It requires you to collect information and to proportion your belief to evidence. Whereas divination is kind of fun because you can follow whatever feels emotionally satisfying to you in the moment. It's almost like free association. 

Gillen Tener Martin: I think it's common to think about conspiracist thinking as a mainstream phenomenon in the U.S. today, but you trace a big historical arc to the beginnings of the Republic. Can you talk a bit about that long arc of conspiracist thinking?

Natalie Wynn: People talk about this like the internet started it. I do think the internet made it worse, but I don't think the internet started it. I think the printing press probably was the first thing to make it worse. There was this book by John Robison. He's a [Scottish] writer on conspiracy theories, and he was the popularizer of the Illuminati conspiracy theory in the 18th century. They thought the Illuminati was a branch of the Freemasons: atheists and anarchists that would cause revolutions and overthrow all the world's governments and all the world's religions. 

Someone sent a copy of his book to George Washington, and there's a correspondence where George Washington acknowledges having read the book and he sort of says, “Well, I've heard a lot about this. I don't think the Freemasons of America are involved, but I'll keep an eye on it.” It's funny to me considering how “online” Illuminati conspiracy theories feel—the 2010s was a peak of people looking for triangles and eyes everywhere, like in Katy Perry music videos. “My God, it's the Illuminati!” It's kind of funny that George Washington was having this conversation with someone.

Anne Kim: Let's bring things back to the modern day and to Trump. What is it about Trump and conspiracist thinking that has enabled such a close partnership? You could argue that Trump exploits all the tendencies that you've talked about in order to leverage and use that thinking to his benefit. There are aspects of Trump that fit into what you're talking about. He does see the world in very dualistic terms: black and white, us against them. But how did Donald Trump become the totem for conspiracy theorists and conspiracist thinking, to the extent that he has?

Natalie Wynn: I think Trump has always recognized conspiracy thinking as useful, as this underground strain of American politics that is available at any time to be tapped by someone unscrupulous enough to tap it. In 2015, he went on the Alex Jones show “Infowars,” which I don't think any other presidential candidate, certainly not one running for one of the main two parties, has ever gone on. Because, you know, it's crackpot. But Trump saw that there were millions of people listening to that, and no politician saw that as a useful voting demographic. He did. 

I think that he found it useful especially in 2020. The best way to plot a real conspiracy is to theorize a fictional conspiracy, because the existence of a conspiracy justifies a counter-conspiracy. So if you say that the election has been rigged, and if your followers believe that, then it's justified to conspire to overturn the election, right? It's not like this is the first election where people have said that it's rigged or that it's a conspiracy. People say it basically every time. But traditionally, American politicians who lose the election concede and they tell their followers, “yes, we accept the results of the election.” And that quells this impulse. But Trump did the opposite. He fanned the flames up until the point of January 6th. 

So I think in a very pragmatic way, he finds conspiracy thinking useful. Although things have gotten a little awkward lately as a result of the Epstein situation because the Epstein stuff is a load-bearing pillar of conspiracy thinking in the modern age. I think that a lot of people, and certainly most conspiracy theorists, believe that there is a vast pedophile conspiracy that involves a huge proportion of Hollywood and politicians and so on. I get the sense that Trump has gotten used to the idea that he can just tell his followers, “Yeah, we're not thinking about that anymore,” and they'll stop. But this one seems to be a little more difficult. As a big part of QAnon, people are very attached to this, and so it's a little harder to put a memory hold on this particular thing.

Gillen Tener Martin: It says a lot to me that this has formed one of the most notable cracks in his base so far. And going back to January 6th, I think it can be easy for us now to forget the relationship of conspiracies to that event, but in the video you give a really good overview of how conspiracy both led to and excused an insurrection. Can you talk a bit about the role of QAnon and conspiracism in January 6th?

Natalie Wynn: So QAnon always had this element of apocalyptic thinking. The idea was that there was going to be this event called “the Storm”' where Donald Trump—who they viewed as a messiah figure—was going to purge the deep state of the cabal (cannibals, pedophiles, whatever evil people that had taken hold of it). And there was a growing frustration that this hadn't happened. What happened is a morphing of the idea “Trump is going to abolish the deep state” to “we are the digital soldiers, we've been here all along, the point of this movement was that it was training us to be ready for this moment, and now it's up to us to join the president in bringing about the Storm.”

Obviously, there were a lot of different groups at January 6th. There [were] also Proud Boys and other people bringing their own agenda to it. But a lot of those who I guess would be considered “ordinary people”—people who were not previously involved in white nationalist gangs, for example, like accountants and grandmothers—who showed up on January 6th were there because of QAnon conspiracy theorizing.

Anne Kim: Your reference to the accountants and the grandmothers alludes to a point that you make in your video about how almost anyone can be vulnerable to conspiracist thinking. Could you talk a little bit about what makes someone more vulnerable to this kind of thinking in the first place? 

Natalie Wynn: Some of it is pretty universal. Systematic thinking is hard: it's unintuitive to humans, whereas intentionalist thinking—the idea that things happen as a result of plans manifesting—is more intuitive. But there are things that I think cause specific people to really tend to dive into this. One of the big ones is some sense of humiliation or having this longing to feel important that has been frustrated in other areas of life. This is something I noticed with the most high-profile celebrity conspiracy theorists. 

For example, David Icke is most notorious for the reptilian theorizing that he did beginning in the 1990s. But he used to be a sports broadcaster. He announced on a talk show in the early ‘90s that he was the son of God, and he prophesied a coming era of hurricanes and earthquakes and this sort of revolution. And he was mocked, he was laughed at, and was kind of a pariah in the British media. I mean, we can understand why. But I think from his perspective, that was painful and humiliating. And so there's this desire to be like, “Who did this to me?” And in his case, the answer to that question was reptilians. But I think that it's something you also see with more recent conspiracy theorists. 

Candace Owens, who has really been on a conspiracy tear recently, wasn't always like this. Back in 2017 or so, she was involved in Black Lives Matter activism. But there was this incident where she created a website called Social Autopsy, which was essentially a revenge doxing website for people who had been harassed. She got very negative feedback for this, and I think the sense of being canceled. She's talked about this in interviews. She felt like “the media is against me,” and then she heard Trump talking about how the media is lying, and that really resonated because she was under attack by the media. So I think that there's a sense of humiliation in both those cases. 

But it's also common in the average person who gets into conspiracy theories. A sense of career unfulfillment or estrangement from your kids or just any kind of miscellaneous personal frustration that you have can create a scapegoating impulse. When bad things happen, people want a sort of satanic mastermind that they can blame. And conspiracism offers that. 

Gillen Tener Martin: You make a really strong case throughout the video for how conspiracist thinking is not compatible with democracy. Can you lay out why?

Natalie Wynn: So the idea of how democracy ideally is supposed to function is that there is public deliberation about issues and it's possible for us to negotiate and to reason about things and to make compromises. Conspiracism throws a wrench in the works of all of that because it's so irrational. I almost want to say a-rational. It's not really engaging with reason at all. So when you find that you cannot reason with your neighbors—you can't even have a coherent conversation because you don't know how to have a coherent conversation with someone who thinks that the pandemic was caused by the Rothschilds—I think it's a problem for a political system where people need to reach at least some baseline of consensus about what reality is. 

There's a wide spectrum of opinion, much of it I would disagree with, but which I would still consider to be within the realm of things that can be argued about. Whereas the idea that the Judeo-Bolshevik-Vatican-Freemasons are controlling the White House through reptilian moon radars or whatever … I don't know how to talk about that because it's so not grounded in reality that discourse itself fails. And that scares me.

A three-candidate alliance could unseat a popular incumbent and hand City Hall to a pol most voters didn't choose. 

The November/December issue is here.

Instead of accepting the existing digital political battlefield as inevitable, Democrats should challenge it as a root cause of our dysfunctional politics, and vow to be the party that cleans it up.

With the onset of the Great Depression, the United States appeared on the verge of political revolt in rural areas. For half a century, rural people had felt increasingly marginalized by changes in American society and the economy and ignored by political leaders. A farm crisis in the 1920s inflicted further pain. By 1933, with farmers earning just half what they had in 1919, and when a full one-third had lost their land, rural anger seemed ready to erupt. Edward A. O'Neal, president of the Farm Bureau, predicted at a Senate committee hearing, “Unless something is done we will have…

      Communication Builds Our Community
     

Bugonia, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons, marks another collaboration between Lanthimos and Ston following The Favourite and Poor Things. If you enjoyed those films then you will enjoy this one.

Bugonia explores the danger of conspiracy theories.

Stone plays Michelle, the CEO of a powerful agribusiness corporation. Smart, wealthy, and commanding, she represents the pinnacle of corporate influence. Plemons stars as Teddy, a humble beekeeper and warehouse worker whose family has been devastated by Michelle's company.

Drawn into a web of conspiracy theories about Michelle, her corporation, and the planet's fate, Teddy takes increasingly drastic actions-believing he's saving humanity. The film dives deep into how conspiracy thinking, on both the left and the right, can drive people to extremes. Yet Lanthimos also poses an unsettling question: what if some of those theories might be true? The tension keeps viewers guessing-how much of Teddy's paranoia is delusion, and how much is real?

Bugonia offers a bleak but insightful reflection on modern life, communication, and power. In one memorable scene, Michelle and Teddy exchange polished corporate phrases like ""let's have a dialogue,"" even as it's clear that no meaningful change will follow. Teddy knows these catch phrases and is not swayed by them. Their interactions capture the frustration and futility that define so much of public discourse today.

Stone and Plemons deliver outstanding performances, both emotionally raw and darkly funny. If you've seen any publicity about this movie you know that Stone went so far as to shave her head for the role-a striking choice that underscores her total commitment.

I very much enjoyed the movie. It was funny, scary, and surprising in so many places. I would guess that Stone and Plemons might get Academy nods for their performances but it's still early in the season. 

I give Bugonia 4 out of 5 stars.

New photos show that the recently discovered comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) developed a surprising golden glow after reaching its closest point to the sun. Until now, the comet has gone under the radar, largely thanks to the more famous interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.

New photos reveal that a recently discovered comet dubbed the ""other ATLAS"" has transformed into a spectacular golden ribbon after surviving a close approach to the sun — a journey that many experts believed would be the comet's doom.

The comet, called C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), was discovered in May by astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), which scans the night sky for moving objects using telescopes in Hawaii, Chile and South Africa. The object has largely gone under the radar until now, mainly due to the recent hype around the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered by ATLAS astronomers in early July, and Comet Lemmon, which has been clearly visible in the night sky over recent weeks.

C/2025 K1 reached its closest point to the sun, or perihelion, on Oct. 8, coming within a minimum distance of 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of our home star — around four times closer than 3I/ATLAS managed during its own perihelion on Oct. 29. Due to the intense gravitational strain from this close encounter, many experts believed that C/2025 K1 would be ripped apart, according to Spaceweather.com.

On Oct. 29, at the same time 3I/ATLAS achieved perihelion, astrophotographer Dan Bartlett snapped a stunning shot of C/2025 K1 from June Lake in California. The image shows the comet with a distinct golden glow and a long tail that looks as if it has been buffeted by the solar wind — similar to Comet Lemmon, which recently had its tail torn to pieces.

""This comet was not supposed to survive its Oct. 8th perihelion,"" Bartlett told Spaceweather.com. ""But it did survive, and now it is displaying a red/brown/golden color rarely seen in comets."" The same unique coloration was observed by at least two other photographers, in California and in Arizona.

 




Comets typically appear white because the sunlight they reflect contains all the wavelengths of visible light. However, when specific chemicals are present within the cloud of ice, gas and dust surrounding the comet, known as the coma, they can absorb specific wavelengths of light, causing the comet to shine with a different hue.

For example, several notable comets have turned green in recent years — including Comet Nishimura, the explosive ""devil comet"" 12P/Pons-Brooks and the aptly named ""green comet"" C/2022 E3 — due to the presence of either dicarbon or cyanide in their respective comas. Some comets can also turn blue if their comas contain carbon monoxide or ammonia, which may be happening to 3I/ATLAS, according to recent observations. However, the golden color of C/2025 K1 is much rarer.

In a recent blog post, astronomer David Schleicher, who has been studying C/2025 K1 from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, wrote that the comet has a surprising lack of carbon-bearing molecules, such as dicarbon, carbon monoxide and cyanide. Only two other known comets have ever had fewer of these molecules, he wrote.

 




This depletion of carbon-bearing molecules is the most likely cause for the comet's gold coloration, but ""we don't know exactly why,"" Spaceweather.com representatives wrote. But it could also have something to do with its recent solar flyby or its relatively low ratio of gas to dust, they added.

—'Miracle' photo captures Comet Lemmon and meteor seemingly entwined over Earth

—Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS transforms into a giant 'cosmic rainbow' in trippy new telescope image

C/2025 K1 now has an apparent magnitude of 9, which is equally as bright as 3I/ATLAS following an unexpected brightening event that occurred during its flyby of the sun. Both objects are too dim to see with the naked eye, but they can be seen with a decent telescope or a pair of stargazing binoculars.

If you want to see it for yourself, C/2025 K1 is located between the constellations Virgo and Leo in the eastern sky, and it is most clearly visible shortly before sunrise, according to Spaceweather.com. It will reach its closest point to Earth on Nov. 25, meaning it will likely remain visible until early December.

Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called the 2008 financial crisis, is back with his unique blend of dire warnings, cryptic messages, winking memes, and pop-culture references.

The Scion Asset Management chief has returned to X after a two-year hiatus to sound the alarm on the AI boom. Where advocates see a revolutionary technology that will supercharge productivity and generate massive profits, he sees hype, speculation, and excess.

Burry, whose iconic bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was immortalized in the book and movie ""The Big Short,"" kicked off his comeback with a single, ominous post on Thursday.

""Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,"" he wrote.

The third sentence is a nod to the movie ""WarGames,"" where an AI supercomputer runs thousands of simulations of nuclear war and discovers all of them end in mutual destruction. Burry's quote underscores how perilous he believes today's market is for investors.

Signaling he'll be sticking around for a while, the famed forecaster has updated his profile picture and revised his bio to read: ""Cassandra Unchained: Missteps to Mayhem, Coming December 2025, Stay Tuned.""

That line is an apparent reference to the Greek myth of Cassandra, the Trojan priestess cursed to utter true prophecies but never to be believed, and to a speech Burry gave at Vanderbilt Medical Center in 2011 titled: ""Missteps to Mayhem: Inside the Doomsday Machine with the Outsider who Predicted and Profited from America's Financial Armageddon.""

Back then, Burry delivered a step-by-step breakdown of how the subprime mortgage bubble inflated, how he predicted and placed bets on its collapse, and how the fallout revealed glaring vulnerabilities in the US financial system.

""We must remember that entire societies can and often do follow the wrong path for a very long time, and that there is nothing wrong with breaking from the social norm to ensure good outcomes,"" Burry said. ""Sober analysis on the part of the individual is paramount.""

Positioning himself as a rebel who's speaking out against the AI mainstream, Burry swapped his banner image on X to a still from ""Star Wars: A New Hope,"" where Obi-Wan Kenobi uses a Jedi mind trick to deceive Imperial stormtroopers.

Referring to that meme, the Scion boss posted on Monday before the release of his firm's third-quarter portfolio update: ""These aren't the charts you are looking for. You can go about your business."" He attached three images offering fresh insight into why he's bearish on the AI frenzy.

Move along pic.twitter.com/ysPWozmnbt

The first chart showed that growth has slowed sharply in Amazon and Alphabet's cloud-computing divisions, and cooled slightly in Microsoft's rival unit.

The second highlighted that the US tech sector's capital expenditures have surged during the AI boom, echoing their spikes before the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.

The third shows the circular dealmaking between Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, and other AI companies.

Burry nodded to the meme again in a follow-up post, writing ""Move along"" and attaching an image of a stormtrooper. He also shared a highlighted excerpt from ""Capital Account,"" a book that covers the dot-com bubble. It detailed how the telecoms boom and bust resulted in vast tracts of unused infrastructure, plunging prices, and the downfall of many high-valued companies that wound up scrambling for protection from creditors.

Burry's posts underline his skepticism about the AI boom. He appears to see shades of the dot-com bubble in the interwoven deals between tech titans, as they pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building huge amounts of infrastructure that might end up sitting idle if demand falters and valuations come crashing down, as they did 25 years ago.

The hedge fund manager backed up his words with two striking bets last quarter that were revealed on Monday. Scion purchased bearish put options on 1 million Nvidia shares and 5 million Palantir shares, with notional values of $187 million and $912 million, respectively.

The wagers dominated the firm's US stock portfolio, which had only eight holdings in total, including just four direct positions worth a combined $68 million.

Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider that Burry is ""clearly backing convictions with what can only be called a highly unconventional portfolio, with sizable short positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, both darlings of the current AI boom, to the tune of around $1 billion.""

Nvidia and Palantir fell 4% and 8% respectively on Tuesday. Burry's wagers drew the ire of Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who questioned why he was shorting companies that are ""making all the money.""

Both stocks have soared in price over the past few years; Nvidia became the first company to secure a $5 trillion market value last week, while Palantir was valued at nearly $500 billion at Monday's close — more than Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, or Netflix are worth.

The pair's valuations and high growth expectations could leave their stocks vulnerable to sharp declines if they disappoint, especially when investors are increasingly using margin and levered ETFs, Mould said.

Burry could win big if Nvidia and Palantir stumble, but the ""danger"" is that he ""gets run over by momentum and liquidity-fueled markets"" if they keep impressing investors and the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, Mould added.

Daniel Bustamante, the chief investor and founder of asset manager Bustamante Capital Management, told Business Insider that he broadly agrees with Burry's stance on AI stocks.

The Magnificent Seven's capital spending is ""already hurting earnings growth, retail is crowded into those names, and then margin debt is at all-time highs,"" he said. ""You basically have all tinder soaked in gas, and all it takes is a lit match at this point to cause some serious issues.""

In this article

Axon Enterprise's stock plummeted 11% after the Taser maker missed Wall Street's third-quarter profit expectations as it grapples with tariff constraints.

Adjusted earnings totaled $1.17 per share adj., falling short of a $1.52 per share forecast from LSEG. Adjusted gross margins fell 50 basis points from a year ago to 62.7%, which Axon attributed to tariff impacts.

Axon's connected devices business, which includes its Taser and counter drone equipment, felt the biggest pinch during the first full quarter with tariffs. The business segment accounted for over $405 million in revenues, increasing 24% year over year.

""As long as tariffs stay in place, I view that as sort of a one-time adjustment,"" finance chief Brittany Bagley said during the earnings call. ""Now that's baked into the gross margins.""

Bagley expects growth in the company's software business to eventually offset margin losses long-term. Software and services revenues jumped 41% from a year ago to $305 million.

Total revenues grew 31% from a year ago to $711 million, topping the $704 million expected by analysts polled by LSEG. The U.S. accounted for 84% of sales.

The Arizona-based company reported a net loss of $2.2 million, a loss of 3 cents per share, versus net income of $67 million, or 86 cents per share in the year-ago period.

Axon lifted its full-year revenue outlook to $2.74 billion, from between $2.65 billion and $2.73 billion. FactSet analysts expected $2.72 billion at the midpoint.

The company expects revenues between $750 million and $755 million during the fourth quarter, which was above LSEG analyst expectations of $746 million.

Along with the results, Axon said it is acquiring Carbyne in a deal that values the emergency communications platform at $625 million. The deal is expected to close next year in the first quarter.

Axon shares have jumped more than 40% over the last year as demand for its security tools accelerates. Shares more than doubled in 2024.

""We are building an elite business that is still nowhere near its ultimate potential, and we are doing it with a team that is rapidly bought into the mission,"" said Axon's president Josh Isner on the earnings call.

The euphoria around artificial intelligence is colliding with the limits of reality, and cracks are emerging.

Last night, tech giants like AMD smashed expectations on AI chip demand, and Palantir reported another quarter of strong growth. Yet the Nasdaq fell, revealing Wall Street's playlist is stuck on one track: AI mania.

Palantir — the poster child of that obsession — plunged nearly 8% despite its blowout quarter, while Oracle dropped almost 4%. Even AI darlings Nvidia and Amazon pulled back. The message? It's AI or nothing — and that tunnel vision is flashing warning signs.

Some CEOs are warning of a market correction, others of an inevitable mismatch between revenues and the massive capital expenditure needed to power AI. One CEO even told CNBC that stocks are in a correction, even if the S&P 500 hasn't reflected it. Perhaps it's time investors step off the hype train and look at the broader market — even the strongest empires fall when they start believing their own legend.

SoftBank market cap drops by about $32 billion. Shares plunged more than 14% Wednesday amid a broader drop in Asian AI-linked companies as investors turned wary of stretched valuations in the market's most crowded trade.

PE industry consolidation. ""How is it that there are more private equity funds in North America than there are McDonald's franchises,"" said KKR & Co's co-CEO Joe Bae on Tuesday. PE managers are bracing for a wave of consolidation as investors demand higher returns and stronger governance. For reference, there are about 14,000 McDonald's in the U.S. and 19,000 private equity funds.

Democrats sweep U.S. elections. Democrats made a clean sweep in the three biggest contested elections in the U.S. on Tuesday night, including in New Jersey and Virginia. In New York, self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani beat out opponents Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.

Asian markets tank. Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped below the 50,000 mark on Wednesday amid a wider decline in Asia markets as investors fled AI-related stocks. South Korea's Kospi also saw losses of as much as 6.16%, with chip heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix posting losses. 

[PRO] Stocks in correction? CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management Josh Brown said Tuesday the stock market is going through a correction, even if the indexes have yet to reflect it. 

Nvidia deepens India footprint with $2 billion deep tech alliance to mentor AI startups

Nvidia will help train and mentor emerging deep tech startups in India as a founding member of a $2 billion investment alliance, deepening its presence in the world's third-largest startup ecosystem.

The U.S. chipmaker has joined the India Deep Tech Alliance (IDTA) — a group of private equity and venture capital investors pledging $2 billion for deep tech investments — as a founding member.

Deep tech startups are an umbrella term for emerging companies in semiconductors, space, AI, biotech, robotics, and energy.

Federal judge concerned that justice department sought to ‘indict first and investigate later' in case of ex-FBI director

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered prosecutors in the criminal case of the former FBI director James Comey to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, saying he was concerned that the justice department's position had been to “indict first and investigate later”.

Magistrate judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of the day on Thursday grand jury materials as well as other evidence that investigators seized during the investigation. The order followed arguments in which Comey's attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to review materials that were gathered years ago.

Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020 in a case filed days after Donald Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued that it is a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the Republican president and must be dismissed.

At issue at Wednesday's hearing were communications seized by investigators who in 2019 and 2020 executed search warrants of devices belonging to Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and close friend of Comey who had also served as a special government employee at the FBI.

Richman factors into the case because prosecutors say Comey had encouraged him to engage with reporters about matters related to the FBI and that Comey therefore lied to Congress when he denied having authorized anyone at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source. But Comey's lawyers say he was explicitly responding to a question about whether he had authorized the former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe to serve as an anonymous source.

Comey's lawyers told the judge they had not reviewed the materials taken from Richman and thus could not know what information was privileged.

“We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today,” the judge said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Stadium staff prepare temporary grass that was laid on top of artificial turf at BC Place stadium for a friendly soccer match between MLS soccer's Vancouver Whitecaps and League One's Wrexham, in Vancouver, on Friday, July 26, 2024.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

The head of Major League Soccer has long believed Vancouver has what it takes to be a premier soccer market. 

Now, as the Vancouver Whitecaps reach new highs on the field, league commissioner Don Garber is coming to the city to lobby for change. 

“My trip isn't just to celebrate all the great things that have been going on over the years,” he said in a phone interview. “It's to help make sure that success is sustainable long term.”

Garber will be speaking with business leaders and public officials during the trip, and high on his list of talking points will be the Whitecaps' stadium deal. 

The club currently plays its home games at BC Place, a 55,000-seat venue in Vancouver's downtown core. 

Opened in 1983, the stadium is owned by PavCo, a provincial Crown corporation that leases the venue to tenants including the Whitecaps and CFL's B.C. Lions. It's also set to host seven matches during the FIFA World Cup in June and July.

The venue is also used for non-sporting events, including concerts — it hosted the final three dates of Taylor Swift's Eras tour last December — and trade shows. 

Garber says the Whitecaps' stadium deal “isn't optimal” because of scheduling issues and the limited revenue the club receives from food and beverage sales. 

“The club isn't sustainable in a situation where they're … in a building which they have no control over, they have minimal participation with revenue. The biggest issue is the lack of schedule flexibility,” he said.

Last year, the 'Caps had to cede home-field advantage to the Portland Timbers for a playoff game because a motocross show was already booked in at BC Place for the same date. 

BC Place said in a statement Tuesday that it makes “40-plus days available per year to the Whitecaps to host matches.” 

Whitecaps CEO and sporting director Axel Schuster told reporters last month that, while the club is among the top-10 in MLS when it comes to attendance, because of their deal with BC Place, the 'Caps linger at the bottom when it comes to food and beverage revenue.

“Clubs that are having half of our attendance are making three times the revenue of us in this category,” he said. 

The Whitecaps' current lease with BC Place expires at the end of December. 

BC Place said in its statement that it's currently having “productive discussions” with the MLS club about renewing its lease. 

“Any agreement has to be looked at in totality, factoring in not just revenue but also operational costs and capital investments,” it read. 

It noted renovations are currently underway for new premium hospitality areas and said tenants will have more opportunities to generate revenue next season. 

“Ultimately, it's our goal to balance the right deal for both parties while ensuring fairness for British Columbians,” the statement said. 

“As the proud home of Vancouver Whitecaps FC, B.C. Place has supported the club's journey in Major League Soccer for the past 14 years and has hosted its matches for over four decades. The stadium remains committed to supporting the club's growth and success now and into the future.”

The Whitecaps also announced in April that it had started discussions with the City of Vancouver about building a new soccer-specific stadium at the PNE fairgrounds on the city's eastern edge

The discussions began after the club's ownership group — made up of Greg Kerfoot, Steve Luczo, Jeff Mallett and former NBA star Steve Nash — announced in December it was putting the club up for sale.

Schuster said last month that the current owners are still looking for an option that will keep the Whitecaps in Vancouver, and that could include bringing in new investors.

Stadium troubles are nothing new for MLS clubs, Garber said. 

“This team is no different than any other professional sports team,” he said. “Having the ability to capitalize on all aspects of what a stadium could deliver — both for fans, for corporate partners, for hospitality value and also for schedule flexibility — is something that we hope to be able to make some progress on. I know it's a challenge, but we've had challenges in every market.”

The commissioner sees his role in the talks as sitting down with community and government leaders to explain what kind of value teams provide and talk about how the league is a good partner. 

“If we're able to have a very thoughtful and open discussion, I'm hopeful we'll be able to reach a resolution, whatever that resolution might be,” he said. 

Despite the business dealings, the Whitecaps remain healthy, Garber said. 

“Look at their fan base, look at how they're performing on the field,” he said. “But you need to have an integrated connection between what happens on the field and what happens off the field.”

The 'Caps finished the regular season second in the Western Conference with an 18-7-9 record, then dispatched FC Dallas in a first-round playoff series. 

Vancouver will host Los Angeles FC in the Western semi-final on Nov. 22. More than 23,000 tickets for the game were sold before LAFC — and South Korean star Son Heung-min — were confirmed as the opponents, and the team is now expecting more than 40,000 fans to fill the stands. 

Adding German soccer legend Thomas Müller to the roster in mid-August was a major coup for the 'Caps. 

The 36-year-old attacking midfielder contributed seven goals and three assists over seven regular-season appearances, added another goal in the team's first playoff game, then scored in a penalty shootout in the second to help the club advance. 

Müller is a “true champion” who uplifts not only the team but Vancouver as a whole, Garber said. 

“There were a number of MLS teams that were chasing after Thomas Müller,” he said. “And he picked Vancouver because he saw the potential, and really saw that this team could — with his influence — expand their global presence and their global exposure. And undoubtedly, he's been able to do that in a really short period of time. 

“He is a winner, and I'm so excited to have him in the league.”

New York elected its first Muslim mayor, setting up a clash with Donald Trump and giving hope to divided Democrats.

Zohran Mamdani, a pro-Palestinian socialist, beat establishment candidates with a string of populist Left-wing promises.

He stood up to Mr Trump, who has threatened to pull funding from the world's financial capital following the result.

In his victory speech, the 34-year-old declared: “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.

“And if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.

“This is not only how we stop Trump, it's how we stop the next one.”

Recommended

Mr Mamdani was propelled from fringe candidate to frontrunner through a slick social media campaign centred on affordability in one of the world's most expensive cities.

He tapped into residents' frustrations over soaring living costs, promising free buses, free childcare and city-run supermarkets.

He will become the city's youngest mayor in more than a century, having vowed to freeze rents in rent-controlled homes and raise taxes on the city's wealthiest residents.

Midway through Mr Mamdani's address, Mr Trump issued a warning on his Truth Social platform, writing: “And so it begins...”

The US president has repeatedly labelled Mr Mamdani a “communist” and threatened to cut off federal funding to New York City in the event of his election.

“It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,” Mr Trump said on Sunday.

Republicans could view Mr Mamdani's victory as a gift before next year's mid-term elections, as the socialist mayor will probably be portrayed as a caricature of the ultra-progressive Left to scare moderate and undecided voters away from the Democrats.

In Tuesday night's race, Mr Mamdani beat Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate.

Referring to Mr Cuomo, whose father Mario is also a former New York governor, Mr Mamdani added: “My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty. I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life but let tonight be the final time I utter his name”.

In his speech, the mayor-elect also criticised billionaires and pledged to “fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism”.

“New York will remain a city of immigrants, built by immigrants and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” Mr Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, said.

“I'm Muslim. I'm a democratic socialist. And I refuse to apologise for either,” he added, receiving applause.

Concluding his speech, Mr Mamdani was joined on stage by his wife Rama Duwaji, 28, a Syrian-American illustrator who has largely kept her distance from her husband's campaign.

His parents, who he thanked for making him the “man he is today”, also joined the couple on stage.

Mr Mamdani's progressive policies and pro-Palestinian views will hand the GOP a wealth of material to attack the Democrats.

During the campaign, Mr Cuomo and Mr Sliwa accused him of fanning the flames of anti-Semitism.

The socialist came under fire for refusing to condemn the phrase “globalise the intifada”, later saying he would “discourage” the use of the term.

Mr Mamdani recognised Israel's right to exist, but not as a Jewish state and previously vowed to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israel prime minister, if he set foot in New York.

More than 1,100 rabbis across the country signed a letter accusing Mr Mamdani of exacerbating “hostility towards Judaism and Jews”.

Meanwhile, Elise Stefanik, a Republican New York representative, branded him a “jihadist candidate for mayor”.

During his speech, Mr Mamdani appeared to take a swipe at the personal attacks he had endured. “No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election,” he said.

Sir Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, who spoke with the socialist following his primary win in June, congratulated Mr Mamdani on his “historic campaign”.

From Jan 1, Mr Mamdani will be responsible for a $115bn (£88bn) budget and 8.5 million people as he takes on one of the most difficult jobs in US politics.

When his victory was called, Lex Rountree, a 27-year-old tenant organiser who had volunteered for the campaign since the start, burst into tears.

“It is so beyond meaningful to see a Democratic socialist being elected by such a wide margin and it shows we are ready for a new era in politics,” she said.

“People are dying for change and the establishment needs to wake up.”

While Mr Mamdani received phone calls from Democrats, including Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, despite some of the party's senior figures refraining from endorsing his campaign.

Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat senators, did not back Mr Mamdani, while Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, only endorsed him weeks before election day.

Mr Schumer later congratulated Mr Mamdani, describing his victory as “historic” and “well-earned” on X.

Mr Jeffries said: “Democrats are smoking Donald Trump and Republican extremists throughout the country. Enough with the premature obituaries. The Democratic Party is back.”

Mr Trump, who is from New York, made an intervention in the election to try and keep Mr Mamdani out of Gracie Mansion.

The US president's team is understood to have put pressure on Eric Adams, the current mayor, to drop out of the race to give Mr Cuomo a better chance at success.

There were also calls for Mr Sliwa to quit the ballot, but the Republican refused, claiming politicians and billionaires do not choose who becomes mayor.

Mr Mamdani insisted he will pack his cabinet with the “best and the brightest” and attempted to quell concern over comments he'd made criticising the New York Police Department (NYPD) by saying he will keep Jessica Tisch, the current commissioner.

The New York race was one of many wins for the Democratic Party across the country on Tuesday night.

Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger were projected to win their races in New Jersey and Virginia.

In California, a Democratic plan to redraw congressional districts was voted through, marking a big win for another of Mr Trump's foes, Gavin Newsom, the state's governor.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","A big pattern change will funnel Arctic air into the US. Here's where temperatures will drop","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/weather/cold-temperatures-snow-winter-forecast-arctic-climate","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:18 GMT","


            A big pattern change is on the way for the United States with a blast of Arctic air set to bring a first taste of winter to millions.
    


            It all starts this weekend as a cold front allows December-like air from near the North Pole to start spreading into the northern US. This front will push farther south and east through the weekend, and temperatures could drop 10 to 15 degrees below normal almost everywhere east of the Rockies by Sunday night.
    


            These winter-like conditions — with the coldest temperatures of the season — could make it as far south as the Gulf Coast early next week.
    


            The brief pattern flip could also potentially switch on the lake-effect snow machine for the first time this season and bring some measurable snow downwind of the Great Lakes.
    


            Here's how this chilly change-up will play out.
    


            Parts of the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest will be first in line for plummeting temperatures starting Saturday. This temperature drop could also be accompanied by a wintry mix for some.
    


            Minneapolis will likely have a near-normal high temperature in the mid to upper 40s on Friday, but will barely hit the upper 30s by Saturday. A mix of rain and snow is possible throughout Saturday. The city usually has its first measurable snow — defined as at least 0.1 inches — by November 3, but that has not happened yet and it isn't likely to Saturday.
    


            December-like chill will expand into much more of the country on Sunday.
    


            The day will start with low temperatures in the 20s or lower for much of the central US and stay frigid. Temperatures could end up 15 degrees below average for much of the Plains, Midwest and portions of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
    


            The high temperature in Chicago will likely struggle to reach around 40 degrees Sunday, which is 10 degrees colder than normal. St. Louis will also be 10 degrees colder than it should be with a high in the mid-40s.
    


            Monday morning will be the coldest since spring for tens of millions of people east of the Rockies. Low temperatures at or below freezing – 32 degrees – are possible as far south as Texas and as far east as the Appalachians.
    


            Buffalo, New York, could drop into the 20s on Monday morning and only reach the upper 30s by the afternoon. A normal early November high for the city is about 50 degrees.
    


            Monday will likely be the coldest day of the wintry blast for much of the eastern two-thirds of the US, but the Southeast will be the epicenter for some of the coldest air relative to normal.
    


            Nashville, Tennessee, will likely have a high in the mid 40s on Monday, after temperatures drop below freezing early in the morning. That high is almost 20 degrees below normal– 63 degrees would be normal on Monday's date.
    


            Monday will also feature a dramatic temperature drop for Atlanta. Sunday's high in the city is expected to be around 70 degrees, but temperatures will struggle to reach 50 degrees on Monday. Temperatures could tumble to near-freezing by Tuesday morning, which could end up being Atlanta's coldest morning since February.
    


            Much of the East will remain quite chilly on Tuesday. It's likely to be the coldest day of the stretch for Washington, DC, and New York City. High temperatures in both cities could be about 15 degrees below normal, with Washington, DC, in the mid-40s and New York City in the low-40s.
    


            This cold snap won't stick around long though: Temperatures in much of the central US will quickly rebound to near or even above normal on Tuesday and most of the East will follow suit on Wednesday.
    


            The blast of Arctic air could set up some places to get their first measurable snow event of the year, but exactly where – and how much – is still coming into focus.
    


            The typical snow belts downwind of the Great Lakes are so far the most likely to achieve this feat later this weekend into next week, with lake-effect possible after the cold front swings over the lakes on Sunday. Some snow could accumulate in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York through Monday night.
    


            There's also the possibility that the same storminess that's likely to bring some sloppy weather to Minneapolis at the start of the weekend organizes into a storm that could drop a quick stripe of snow through the Midwest early next week. It's looking less likely than the chances for lake-effect snow, but still bears watching in the coming days.

PPG (NYSE: PPG) today announced that it achieved a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the largest simultaneous paint stirring challenge during a customer event at the 2025 SEMA Show in Las Vegas. More than 275 participants stirred paint together to highlight the manual effort still common in collision repair before PPG unveiled its new SEM MIX'N'SHAKE™ automated stirring solution.

More than 275 participants simultaneously stirred paint at SEMA 2025 as PPG breaks the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the largest paint stirring challenge as it unveiled the SEM Mix'n'Shake™ automated stirring system.

The SEM Mix'n'Shake system produces a fully homogenized car paint mix in less than 60 seconds. By automating this step, body shops can reduce rework and recover up to 6% more productive work hours annually. The system also improves paint consistency, efficiency and workplace cleanliness and reduces sundry costs such as stirring sticks and disposable cups by up to 10%.

A GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS official verified the participant count and confirmed the record. Afterward, the crowd watched as a SEM Mix'n'Shake system mixed paint hands-free – a clear contrast to the manual effort that preceded it. The paint used during the stirring challenge will be donated to Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah, to support hands-on learning and technical training for students in automotive and collision repair technology.

“This was more than a record-setting event – it was a symbolic moment for the industry,” said Rodolfo Ramirez, PPG vice president, Automotive Refinish Coatings, Americas. “By showing how much time and effort shops still spend on mixing, we helped our customers see the value of automation.”

The Mix'n'Shake system is part of a broader effort to transform the body shop through automation and digital integration. It connects with the PPG LINQ™ digital ecosystem and complements innovations, including the PPG MOONWALK® automated mixing system, helping shops reduce waste, increase throughput and free technicians to focus on higher-value tasks.

A UPS cargo plane carrying 38,000 gallons of jet fuel burst into flames in Kentucky, killing at least seven people.

The aircraft exploded shortly after taking off from Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, US authorities confirmed. The aircraft erupted into a fireball and hit two businesses including Kentucky Petroleum Recycling.

Some of the injuries are reported to be serious, and officials have warned the number of casualties is likely to rise.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said at a press conference: “We believe we have at least three fatalities. I believe that number is going to get larger. Anybody who has seen the images in the video knows how violent this crash is.”

He added that the plane was not carrying any “specifically hazardous cargo onboard” that would create an environmental issue for people around the site, but said the impact of the crash could cause hazardous conditions.

UPS Flight 2976, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter bound for Honolulu, Hawaii, went down at around 5.15pm local time (10.15pm UK) on Tuesday. The aircraft was carrying three crew members, according to UPS.

“We do not, at the moment, have the status of the crew,” Mr Beshear said at the press conference. “Watching that video, I think we're all very, very worried about them.”

The plane reportedly took off with a fire on one wing, and a huge fireball erupted as it hit the ground. Several buildings in an industrial area beyond the runway were set ablaze, and footage from the scene shows a large plume of black smoke rising from the airport tarmac.

Craig Greenberg, Louisville mayor was not in the area at the time of the accident. Officials said he would return to Louisville by 9pm local. Writing on X, Mr Greenberg said: “There are multiple injuries and the fire is still burning. There are many road closures in the area – please avoid the scene.”

Mr Beshear said the crash hit two businesses: a recycling centre, which bore the brunt of the impact, and an auto-parts shop, where all but two employees have so far been accounted for. He added that the identities of the missing workers would be released soon.

“There may be people that still need to be rescued. Do not be the reason that the first responders cannot get to them,” Mr Beshear said. “There are still dangerous things that are flammable, that are potentially explosive.”

The airport has closed its airfield while emergency services respond to the incident.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed the crash and said it would lead the investigation alongside the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

The Louisville Metro Police Department said a shelter-in-place order has been issued for all areas within a five-mile radius of the airport, advising residents and businesses to remain indoors while the situation is assessed.

Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport is a major hub for UPS, handling millions of packages daily. The MD-11, originally designed as a wide-bodied passenger aircraft, is now primarily used for cargo operations.

Live Updates


            • In the most significant economic case to reach the Supreme Court in years, Trump's authority to issue emergency tariffs faced deep skepticism from key conservatives — including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
    


            • While justices had tough questions for both sides, a majority expressed reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to issue the unchecked tariffs.
    


            • Chief Justice John Roberts referred to the “imposition of taxes on Americans” as a “core power of Congress.”
    


            • As plaintiffs presented their case, Kavanaugh repeatedly noted that courts had previously allowed then-President Richard Nixon to use similar emergency powers to impose tariffs during his administration.
    


            • Both sides previously framed the appeal in existential terms, with Trump warning that a ruling against him could have “catastrophic” consequences for the nation's economic health. The companies challenging the policy say the on-again-off-again tariff announcements have driven costs — and uncertainty — to intolerable levels.
    


            John Mulaney was among the Supreme Court spectators Wednesday.
    


            Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the small businesses challenging the Trump administration's tariffs, argued in front of the court Wednesday.
    


            Mulaney has made several appearances with Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration. Katyal was a guest on the talk show “Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.” And, in 2023, Mulaney was a guest on Katyal's podcast, “Courtside.”
    


            A majority of the Supreme Court appeared skeptical of President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs Wednesday, with several conservative justices picking away at many of the administration's top arguments to defend the import duties in one of the most closely watched oral arguments of the year.
    


            Court wrapped shortly before 1 p.m., and in arguments that spanned over two and a half hours, the 6-3 conservative majority asked difficult questions of both sides. The overall cadence suggested that a majority at least had reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to impose sweeping global tariffs with no limit.
    


            “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in one key moment.
    


            Roberts and other members of the court's conservative wing had tough questions for the small- and medium-sized business that are challenging Trump's tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in particular, seemed concerned about limiting the power of a president to raise tariffs in an emergency.
    


            Kavanaugh, a potential key vote in the case, repeatedly noted that a lower court had allowed then-President Richard Nixon to impose global tariffs under a similar law during his administration – a historical reference that suggested Congress intended to give a president “tools to respond to an emergency in an appropriate way.”
    


            The court has repeatedly sided with the second Trump administration this year, including a major case involving the power of federal courts to temporarily pause a president's policies. If the court rules against Trump over tariffs it would be the first major break of his second term.
    


            The court is expected to hand down a decision by the end of June – or potentially sooner.
    


            Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told CNN's Dana Bash today the Supreme Court “may finally be willing to put the brakes” on President Donald Trump's expansive use of his executive power after his tariff authority appears to have been met with skepticism by some of the court's conservative justices.
    


                    “Today's oral argument indicates that the conservative justices may finally be willing to put the brakes on Donald Trump's utterly runaway arguments that he can do whatever he wants under Article II of the Constitution,” Raskin said.
                





            A majority of the court expressed reservations about the administration relying on declared emergencies to issue unchecked tariffs during oral arguments.
    


            “If it were just calling balls and strikes, as [Chief Justice John] Roberts once said, it would be a 9-0 humiliating defeat for Donald Trump, here, because they're just finger painting on the Constitution and on the statute. No other president has ever attempted to do this before.”
    


            CNN's experts watched and analyzed today's arguments in real time. Catch up on all of their insights below.
    


            If the justices rule against the Trump administration's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, will businesses that have paid the duties be entitled to refunds? That is a major question riding on the landmark Supreme Court case.
    


            So far, the federal government has collected $90 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged, according to Customs and Border Protection data as of September 23.
    


            “If you win, tell me how the reimbursement process would work,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration. “Would it be a complete mess?”
    


            “We don't deny that it's difficult,” Katyal responded.
    


            He said the five businesses he's representing in the case should undeniably be entitled to a refund if the justices rule in their favor. But, once again, acknowledged refunds would be “complicated.”
    


            “So, a mess,” Barrett interjected.
    


            Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration's use of emergency economic powers to increase tariffs, said President Donald Trump can accomplish his goals by relying on other laws that more explicitly enable him to impose the import taxes.
    


            Those alternatives, however, are more limited in scope and, in some cases, have time limits. Here are some of them:
    


            Justice Samuel Alito teased the attorney representing businesses, noting that he had used an argument touted often by conservatives about Congress and its inability to pass off legislative duties to the president.
    


            “I wonder if you ever thought that your legacy as a constitutional advocate would be the man who revived the non-delegation argument,” Alito joked to the attorney, Neal Katyal, who previously served as the acting Solicitor General for President Barack Obama.
    


            “Heck yes,” Katyal replied quickly as Alito chuckled.
    


            Katyal continued: “I think Justice Gorsuch nailed it on the head when saying that when you're dealing with a statute that is this open ended – unlike anything we've ever seen – to give the president this kind of power? Yes, this isn't just delegation running riot.”
    


            Two conservative justices raised hypothetical questions to underscore the potential impact if the Supreme Court finds the law at issue doesn't allow a president to impose any emergency tariff.
    


            “If one of our major trading partners, for example China, held a US citizen hostage,” Justice Clarence Thomas asked, could the president impose a tariff “for the purposes of leveraging his position?”
    


            Justice Samuel Alito asked whether a president could issue a tariff against an enemy on the precipice of war with the United States.
    


            No, said Neal Katyal, representing the businesses challenging the Trump administration because tariffs – like taxes – are revenue raising.
    


            When the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decided the case against Trump, the majority ruled that the emergency law at issue might allow some tariffs in some situations, just not the sweeping ones Trump had levied.
    


            A concurring opinion, and a federal district court in another case, said that the law doesn't allow for tariffs.
    


            The questions from Thomas and Alito appear to be attempting to steer away from the concurring opinion's broader reasoning, which would broadly limit a president's power.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed Neal Katyal, the lawyer for the businesses challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, on why Congress didn't alter the language in the emergency tariff law — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — if it was meant to rein in tariff-raising authorities.
    


            Kavanaugh pointed out that the law, which Trump has been relying on to impose sweeping tariffs over the course of his second term, was enacted shortly after then-President Richard Nixon imposed broad tariffs.
    


            Katyal argued that IEEPA should not necessarily be viewed as a response to Nixon's prior tariff actions.
    


            By way of example, Katyal pointed to Switzerland, which is being subjected to 39% tariffs: “That is just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in our history,” he said.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts asked very punchy questions of the administration during the first hour of the debate, but he's now pressing the attorney representing the small businesses challenging the tariffs.
    


            It's not as easy, Roberts said, to simply frame a tariff as a tax – a power reserved to Congress.
    


            “It implicates, very directly, the president's foreign affairs power,” said Roberts, who is a key vote to watch in the case.
    


            Trump's tariffs, Roberts said, were “quite effective” in achieving the president's particular objective.
    


            That position is closely aligned with the administration's position that a president has broad power in the context of foreign affairs.
    


            One of the last questions before the plaintiffs' arguments began came from Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
    


            In addition to questioning the Trump administration's novel use of a federal law to impose higher tariffs, she challenged why all countries are being subjected to “reciprocal” tariffs to begin with.
    


            “Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain, France? I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy,” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration.
    


            Sauer argued the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump imposed are intentionally broad “because the emergency is so broad.” In enacting those tariffs, Trump has declared a national emergency stemming in part from alleged unfair trade policies practiced abroad.
    


            The long — and sometimes heated — round of questioning between Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration, and the justices, has concluded.
    


            Now Neal Katyal, the lawyer for the businesses challenging President Donald Trump's argument for using emergency authorities to raise tariffs, is making his case.
    


            In another bad sign for the administration, Justice Neil Gorsuch is pressing Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the power of Congress to delegate its authority to the president. Gorsuch, a member of the conservative wing and a Trump nominee, has been a proponent of what's known as the “nondelegation doctrine,” intended to keep clear lines separating the powers of Congress and the president.
    


            If Congress can delegate its constitutional authority to levy tariffs, Gorsuch pressed, what else could it delegate?
    


            “If that's true, what would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce – for that matter, to declare war – to the president,” Gorsuch asked.
    


            The point of Gorsuch's question speaks directly to the idea of separation of powers. That aligns with an argument raised by the businesses challenging the tariffs: that imposing import duties, by default, is a power held by Congress.
    


            Liberal Justice Elena Kagan appeared to take a jab at President Donald Trump's repeated declarations of emergencies this year as a legal basis to expand the powers of his office and implement his agenda.
    


            “You yourself think that the declaration of emergency is unreviewable. And even if it's not unreviewable, it's, of course, the kind of determination that this court would grant considerable deference to the to the president on,” Kagan told Solicitor General D. John Sauer.
    


            “And in fact, you know, we've had cases recently which deal with the president's emergency powers. And it turns out we're in emergencies - everything all the time, about, like, half the world,” she added.
    


            The administration is arguing that courts don't have the power to second-guess the president's determination that emergencies – like the ones he's using to justify his tariffs – exist. The same argument has been pushed in cases challenging Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations and his deployment of National Guard troops in major US cities.
    


            Courts typically give presidents a great deal of deference when it comes to cases involving emergency declarations, though several this year have rejected Trump's argument that, as an initial matter, they lack authority to review those determinations at all.
    


            President Donald Trump's attorney faced deep skepticism from several key conservative justices in early arguments at the Supreme Court over his sweeping global tariffs – a potentially troubling sign for the administration.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in particular, pressed the administration hard on several points, including whether the law at issue in the case authorized Trump to impose his emergency tariffs.
    


            Roberts pushed back on key arguments from the administration, suggesting that the language in the law – which permits a president to “regulate” imports – may not be clear enough to justify the import duties. Barrett, meanwhile, asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether the court had ever viewed the term to “regulate” to include sweeping tariffs.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, seemed skeptical of one of the administration's historical arguments: That former President Richard Nixon was permitted by courts to impose tariffs under a precursor to the law at issue in the case.
    


            The arguments are still ongoing and, often, the direction of the session can change with subsequent attorneys. However, Sauer has been asked to confront a number of serious and difficult questions from the conservative wing.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts, who has asked a number of questions skeptical of the administration's arguments, at one point emphasized Congress' “core power” of regulating taxes, rejecting the government's claim that the tariffs aren't taxes.
    


            “The vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Roberts said. “So to have the president's foreign affairs power trump that basic power for Congress seems to me to kind of at least neutralize between the two powers, the executive power and the legislative power.”
    


            The challengers to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have noted that American taxpayers, not foreign companies, ultimately pay for them. The administration has framed the tariffs as “regulatory” and have argued they are not taxes.
    


            It's early in oral arguments at Wednesday's landmark tariff case, but already there's been a key moment: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, questions the administration's novel use of a law to raise tariffs.
    


            “Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, ‘to regulate importation' has been used?” Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer, referring to language in a federal law the Trump administration has relied on to increase tariffs.
    


            When Sauer waffled, Barrett pressed on.
    


            In a testy back and forth with Solicitor General D. John Sauer, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back strongly on his argument that the emergency law President Donald Trump leaned on to impose his tariffs gave Trump sweeping authority.
    


            “It's pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president in IEEPA,” Jackson said, referring to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was enacted in the 1970s.
    


            “So it seems a little inconsistent to say that we have to interpret a statute that was designed to constrain presidential authority consistent with an understanding that Congress wanted the president to have essentially unlimited authority,” she added.
    


            In a potentially key early moment for the arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts is questioning a key argument made by the Trump administration to justify its tariffs.
    


            Roberts pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer on a case called Dames & Moore v. Regan. That case, which the administration relies on heavily, okayed former President Jimmy Carter's decision to use frozen Iranian assets as a “bargaining chip” to win the release of 52 American hostages.
    


            Roberts seemed skeptical of the idea that the administration could hang its hat on that case. That decision was narrow, Roberts said.
    


            “This at issue in Dames & Moore involved a different provision,” he said, “and it certainly did not concern tariffs.”
    


            Roberts should know. He was a clerk to then-Justice William Rehnquist, who authored the opinion.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the Supreme Court case on his sweeping emergency tariffs represents a “life or death” moment for the country, framing the stakes in stark economic and national security terms.
    


            The Supreme Court is meeting today to hear oral arguments over Trump's global emergency tariffs, and will also be deciding the limits of a president's power – an area in which the court's 6-3 conservative majority has repeatedly sided with Trump since he began his second term in January.
    


            “Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.
    


                    “With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.”
                





            The president tied the case to his administration's trade policies, crediting tariffs and new trade deals for what he described as historic economic success.
    


                    “Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump said. “A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them,” the president added.

A day after Democrats dominated the first major Election Day since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the president is in Miami to speak at a forum of business leaders and global athletes about what he sees as his economic achievements.

While a debate about the future of the Democratic Party may have only just begun, there are signs that the economy — specifically, Trump's inability to deliver the economic turnaround he promised last fall — may be a real problem for Trump's GOP heading into next year's higher-stakes midterm elections.

The Republican president's speech to the America Business Forum will be a broad look at his economic agenda and how investments he has secured abroad help U.S. communities, according to a senior White House official.

Democratic candidates who won Tuesday in the New Jersey and Virginia governor's races, and the New York City mayor's contest, focused their campaigns on the public's cost-of-living concerns.

The Latest:

The U.S. president, during an ostensibly economy-focused speech, said South Africa should not be a member of the Group of 20, a collection of the world's leading rich and developing economies.

“South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore because what's happening there is bad,” Trump said at the America Business Forum. He reiterated that he will not attend the annual G20 summit for world leaders, to be held later this month in Johannesburg.

Trump has had a contentious relationship with South Africa and had a tense Oval Office meeting with the country's president earlier this year.




Trump was ticking through positive economic data, including Walmart's announcing that the price of Thanksgiving dinner staples will be down significantly, when he decided to remark on the presence of Saudi ambassador Reema Bandar al-Saud at his Miami speech.

“That's a big deal. I don't know if they care about that in Saudi Arabia, but here it means a lot,” Trump said of the Walmart Thanksgiving prices. “We got the princess here from Saudi Arabia. She's got a lot of cash, serious cash. And she's a great person. So she doesn't care about the price of a turkey is down a little bit. You know, she doesn't have to worry about it.”

The Trump administration will present its resolution Wednesday to members of the U.N. Security Council on an international stabilization force in Gaza, according to a U.S. official.

The proposal would provide a mandate for the force for at least two years, marking the next step in President Donald Trump's plan to halt two years of war between Israel and Hamas.

Representatives for Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates will join the United States in a show of regional support, according to the official, spoke on condition of anonymity because the closed Security Council briefing has not been formally announced.

The draft also calls for the force to ensure “the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip” and “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.

The president bragged about the stock market rising and insisted the economy was booming, but also acknowledged that it hasn't been great for all Americans.

“We have the greatest economy right now,” Trump said. “A lot of people don't see that.”

He talked about job creation and said “you have to talk” about such things because “if people don't talk about them, then you can do not so well in elections.”

His comments came after Democrats dominated Tuesday's elections around the country and many voters cited concerns about the economy.

Trump has been quick to note he wasn't in the ballot, but also said before going to Miami on Wednesday “ we learned a lot.” He promised during the speech to “make America affordable again.”

Trump said America “lost a little bit of our sovereignty last night” after Democrats swept key elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, mayor in New York City and a ballot initiative in California to redraw its congressional districts in response by efforts by Republican states to do the same.

The president noted that he was speaking in Miami on the first anniversary of his win in the 2024 election, suggesting that it was “the single most consequential election victory in American history.”

Trump said his return to the White House had allowed the American people to “reclaim our government,” implying as he often has that his Democratic opponents are outside the national identity.

Wednesday marks the last day for states to apply for federal funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program, created through Trump's summer tax and spending cuts bill as a counterbalance to sweeping Medicaid cuts that are expected to hit rural hospitals hard.

The program is expected to distribute $50 billion in total, with half of the funds divided equally among states. The other half will be divided based on a formula developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that examines a state's rural population and the number of low-income people it serves.

Several states have already made public their applications for the funding. The awardees will be announced by the end of the year.

Hospitals and health industry experts have warned that while the fund throws a lifeline to rural hospitals, it won't save them all.

Arguments at the Supreme Court have concluded for the day as the justices consider President Trump's sweeping unilateral tariffs in a trillion-dollar test of executive power.

Conservative justices seemed skeptical of Trump's tariffs, potentially putting at risk a key part of his agenda in the biggest legal test yet of his unprecedented presidency.

Challengers say Trump is illegally using an emergency law to claim nearly limitless tariff power and American small businesses are paying the price. Trump's administration says the law gives the president the power to regulate importation, including tariffs.

The Republican president has said a ruling against him in the case before the court Wednesday would be catastrophic for the economy.

U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla is staying put.

The California Democrat who flirted with running for governor in 2026 announced Tuesday he plans to remain in the Senate.

“I choose to stay in this fight,” Padilla told reporters on Capitol Hill in disclosing his decision. “The Constitution is worth fighting for, our fundamental rights are worth fighting for.”

Fellow Democrats had been urging Padilla, first appointed to the Senate by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, to consider entering a race that lacks a clear leader or star and was left wide open after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced her decision not to run.

Newsom's final term runs through January 2027. His party is favored to hold the seat in the heavily Democratic state.

Many have declared Republican Curtis Sliwa the spoiler in the three-way race between him, Democrat Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo.

But AP Voter Poll data suggests that it's unlikely that Sliwa's presence in the race changed the outcome.

When asked how they would vote if only Mamdani and Cuomo were in the race, about half of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo. In the hypothetical question, about 4 in 10 Sliwa supporters said they wouldn't have voted. The remainder either would have moved to Mamdani, or didn't know what they would do.

The data indicates that even half of Sliwa's voters on Tuesday would not have been enough to make up the significant lead that Mamdani won by.

With slightly more than 90% of the estimated vote counted, the AP Decision Desk found Mamdani won with 50.4% of the vote, while Cuomo gathered 41.6% percent of the vote. Sliwa, for his part, won 7.1% percent of the vote. Those figures could change as late-arriving mail ballots are added.

Asked about his thoughts on Democrats' resounding victories in Tuesday's election, Pennsylvania's Democratic senator said he didn't think they meant much, saying Democrats were heavy favorites in both New Jersey and Virginia, as was a ballot measure in California.

“I wasn't surprised by any of these things,” said Sen. John Fetterman.

Whether the results will have an impact on the shutdown, Fetterman said he didn't think Democrats should be treating the shutdown “like it's some kind of a political game.”

“If people think that we should keep it closed because of the elections that we already knew we were going to win, it's like then that seems like it's a game,” he added.

Democrats expanded their majorities Tuesday in both the New Jersey Assembly and Virginia House and broke a Republican supermajority in the Mississippi Senate.

Democrats flipped control of two Mississippi Senate districts that had been redrawn under court order to increase Black voter representation. The reshaped districts played a significant role in Democrats' victories, said Heather Williams, president of the national Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

“When there are representative maps -- and there is a process that actually gives voters a choice of who their elected officials are -- we can connect with voters and win,” said Williams, adding: “Mississippi was a prime example of that.”

But the future of such districts could be in doubt. That's because the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a legal challenge to the section of the federal Voting Rights Act allowing such court intervention.

Reporters waiting near the South Lawn for the president to leave on a trip to Florida noticed what appeared to be a mock-up of a sign that says, “The Oval Office.”

The flowery, gold lettering appeared to be written on some type of temporary paper that was put up on the wall near the door where reporters enter for Trump's appearances in the Oval with foreign leaders, Cabinet members or other guests.

The White House had no comment on the sign.

The Department of Homeland Security is revoking protections that shielded some South Sudanese living in the United Status from deportation, saying it is now safe for them to return to their chaotic East African nation.

The order, which will take effect in early January, affects the small number of South Sudanese who have temporary protected status, which allows people already in the U.S. to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe.

But the news comes amid fears that the 2018 peace agreement ending that nation's civil war is collapsing, with growing hunger, violence and kidnappings, including of aid workers, and weeks after an international ceasefire monitor warned that all sides in the conflict were recruiting new fighters.

The announcement, which was released for public review Wednesday in the Federal Register, will be formally published Thursday. It will take effect 60 days later.

The DHS statement acknowledged South Sudan is dealing with “violence linked to border disputes, cross-border violence, cyclical and retaliatory attacks, and ethnic polarization,” but notes that “return to full-scale civil war, to-date, has been avoided.”

Petros Krommidas lost to incumbent Nassau County Legislator Patrick Mullaney in his bid for a seat in the Nassau County Legislature on Long Island, according to the county's unofficial election results.

With all precincts reporting, Krommidas captured about 40% of votes cast in the race while Mullaney, a Republican, garnered about 55%.

Krommidas disappeared after a night swim off Long Beach in the spring. A state judge ruled that his name had to remain on the ballot after local Republicans challenged Democrats' attempt to field a replacement.

The California Republican Party says Proposition 50 violates the 14th and 15th Amendments.

The ballot measure created a new congressional map with the goal of giving Democrats five more of the state's 52 congressional seats. It easily passed.

The party announced plans to file a federal lawsuit on Wednesday. It's being filed by The Dhillon Law Group, the California-based firm started by Harmeet Dhillon, who now works for the U.S. Department of Justice. A state assemblyman and 18 voters are also plaintiffs.

While some people last Friday dressed in Halloween costumes or handed out candy to trick-or-treaters, a group of U.S. data scientists published a list of datasets that have been axed, altered or had topics scrubbed since Trump returned to the White House.

The timing of the release of the “Dearly Departed Datasets” with “All Hallows' Eve” may have been cheeky, but the purpose was serious: to put a spotlight on attacks by the Trump administration on federal datasets that don't align with its priorities, including data dealing with gender identity; diversity, equity and inclusion; and climate change.

Officials at the Federation of American Scientists and other data scientists who compiled the list divided the datasets into those that had been killed off, had variables deleted, had tools removed making public access more difficult and had found a second life outside the federal government.

Indians lit up social media on Wednesday to celebrate Zohran Mamdani's election win as New York City mayor after he thanked his Indian-born parents, quoted a historic speech by India's first prime minister and turned the victory rally into a Bollywood-style street party.

“We are proud of him. He has done a great job,” Mamdani's maternal uncle Vikram Nair told The Associated Press.

Meanwhile in Uganda, where Mamdani was born, the opposition leader in the Ugandan Parliament sees his victory as an inspiring political shift. “It's a big encouragement even to us here in Uganda that it's possible,” said Joel Ssenyonyi, who represents an area of the Ugandan capital of Kampala.

Uganda has had the same president for nearly four decades, Yoweri Museveni, despite attempts by multiple opposition leaders to defeat him in elections.

Mamdani attended St George's Grammar School in Cape Town for around three years in the mid-1990s, from the age of five. He and his family lived in South Africa after leaving his country of birth, Uganda, and before emigrating to the United States. Mamdani's father, a political theorist, worked as an academic at the University of Cape Town.

“We trust that he will continue to uphold the principles embodied in our school motto, Virtute et Valore — the courage to do what is right,” Mamdani's former school said in a statement sent to the AP.

The grammar school also released a photo of Mamdani at 6 or 7 years old.

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered prosecutors in the criminal case of former FBI Director James Comey to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, saying he's concerned the Justice Department's position has to been to “indict first and investigate later.”

Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of Thursday grand jury materials as well as other evidence that investigators seized. Comey's attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to review materials that were gathered years ago.

Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020 in a case filed days after Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty.

Progressive organizations are using Tuesday's election victories to warn Democrats against cutting a deal with Republicans to end the government shutdown.

“Moderate Senate Democrats who are looking for an offramp right now are completely missing the moment,” said Katie Bethell, political director of MoveOn. “Voters have sent a resounding message: We want leaders who fight for us, and we want solutions that make life more affordable.”

Trump sent the social media post as Air Force One was about to take off for Miami, where he's addressing business leaders in the afternoon.

Wednesday marked one year since his reelection.

“Happy Anniversary! On this day, November 5th, one year ago, we had one of the Greatest Presidential Victories in History — Such an Honor to represent our Country. Our Economy is BOOMING, and Costs are coming way down. Affordability is our goal. Love to the American People!” he wrote.

Democratic candidates who won Tuesday in the New Jersey and Virginia governor's races, and the New York City mayor's contest, focused their campaigns on the public's cost-of-living concerns.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said it's time for Trump to meet with them as well as GOP congressional leaders to negotiate an end the shutdown and address the health care issue.

“Democrats stand ready to meet with you face to face, anytime and anyplace,” the Democratic leaders wrote. Trump has so far refused to engage in talks until the Democrats vote to reopen the government.

Voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, have given Democrat Vi Lyles a fifth term as mayor.

Lyles won comfortably Tuesday to remain the city's top leader 2 1/2 months after the death of a young Ukrainian woman on a commuter train. The stabbing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska sparked outrage from Trump and other Republicans, who sought to pin blame for violent crime and pretrial release decisions on Democrats in general, and Lyles in particular.

Lyles defeated Republican candidate Terrie Donovan, who had made crime her top issue even before the August stabbing. Charlotte hasn't elected a Republican mayor since 2007.

The suspect in Zarutska's stabbing had been arrested more than a dozen times. The GOP-controlled state legislature tightened suspect release rules in September, and Lycles has promoted additional safety measures on Charlotte's light rail.

Trump just got a serious warning from voters that he's out of touch with their fears about a deteriorating U.S. economy.

Democrats were able to run up the score in key races across the country on Tuesday by harnessing some of the same populist fervor that helped get Trump reelected a year ago — but also by focusing on the kitchen table issues the Republican had vowed to fix. Now, as the incumbent, fears about the economy have made Trump the face of much of the public's discontent.

Voters in the Virginia and New Jersey governor races, the New York City mayoral contest and the California ballot proposition each ranked economic concerns as a top issue. Democrats swept all those, and it was difficult to point to any major race, anywhere, where Republicans had a key victory.

Mamdani wasted little time as New York City's mayor-elect before making clear that he'll be standing up to the president of the United States, who had threatened not only to defund the city if he won, but also to arrest and deport him.

“Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,” he said at his victory party. “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.”

“New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” said Mamdani, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Uganda. “So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.”

Trump seemed to be watching: “…AND SO IT BEGINS!” he posted on social media as Mamdani spoke.

The Republican speaker insisted he's willing to talk to Democrats about their demands for health care funds, but blames them for the record-breaking shutdown, now in its 36th day.

Johnson was speaking with GOP lawmakers on the steps outside the Capitol, where he has kept the House closed to regular business, sending lawmakers home in September.

Israel's hardline National Security Minister Itamir Ben-Gvir said Mamdani's election is an “everlasting disgrace — how antisemitism triumphed over common sense.” He called Mamdani “a Hamas supporter, a hater of Israel and an avowed antisemite.”

Mamdani has said Israel's military campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim denied by Israel. During the campaign, he also denounced “atrocities” committed by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which he called a “horrific war crime.” While supportive of Palestinian rights, he denies being antisemitic and reached out to Jews during his campaign.

Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli posted on X encouraging Jews of New York to emigrate to Israel, writing that the city “would never be the same again.” His feed on the social media site Wednesday was a stream of anti-Mamdani graphics, including a photo of the Twin towers being engulfed in flames with the caption “New York already forgot,” a meme criticized as Islamophobic.

When asked Wednesday about their combative relationship during the mayoral campaign, Mamdani said he has repeatedly expressed a willingness to help the president fulfill some of the promises Trump made during his 2024 presidential campaign.

“I have said time and again that I will work with the president if he wants to work together to deliver on his campaign promises of cheaper groceries or a lower cost of living. But for too long what New Yorkers have seen is a mayor who has been willing to work with the president at the expense of those New Yorkers,” Mamdani said on New York's NY1 news channel.

“And I want to make it very clear that if the president looks to come after the people of this city, then I will be there standing up for them every step of the way.”

'Fox News @ Night' panelists discuss California voters passing the congressional redistricting proposition.

California voters gave the green light to Proposition 50, which allows the state to redraw its congressional map to counteract a redistricting plan in the state of Texas. It will be in effect for the next three congressional election cycles and is expected to add Democratic seats to California's 52-seat delegation, only nine of which are currently held by Republicans.

It is a big win for California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, and for the state's Democratic Party.

Not all the news is good, though, when it comes to specific issues facing the state or even whether Californians want to see their governor run for president.

2025 FOX NEWS VOTER POLL

According to preliminary results from the Fox News Voter Poll, on the redistricting question itself, Golden State voters who backed redrawing the maps overwhelmingly said they did so to counteract changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than because they think it is the best way to draw congressional districts.

Most voters said their reason to vote yes on Prop. 50 was to counter GOP map changes taking place across the country. (Fox News)

In contrast, the much smaller number who voted ""No"" said they did so because they do not think it is the best way to draw congressional districts, as opposed to being motivated to stop Democrats from gaining more seats in Congress.

FOX NEWS VOTER POLL – CHANGE CANDIDATE MAMDANI DEFEATS LEGACY POLITICAL FIGURES

Over half of California voters said that Prop. 50 is not the best way to draw district lines. (Fox News)

Meanwhile, the vast majority of voters generally think a nonpartisan commission should draw the districts, as opposed to the party in power – which is ironic in that such a commission is exactly what is being preempted by today's vote.

Voters overwhelmingly agreed that congressional district lines should be drawn by a nonpartisan commission. (Fox News)

When asked how they generally feel about states redrawing their congressional districts in response to how other states have drawn theirs, most California voters oppose the idea – again, unusual seeing as that is exactly what they voted for with Proposition 50.

FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP'S RATINGS ARE STRONG ON BORDER SECURITY, WEAK ON THE ECONOMY

Over half of voters said they oppose redrawing congressional district lines in response to other states that are redrawing their congressional maps. (Fox News)

More than half of Golden Staters approve of the job Newsom is doing as governor.

California voters were split on how they viewed Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom's job performance. (Fox News)

Yet as to whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, more than half said it's not a good idea.

Voters were split on if they wanted to see Governor Gavin Newsom run for president, despite roughly half approving of his job performance as governor. (Fox News)

Even so, he outperforms former Vice President Kamala Harris on this measure, as these California special election voters would prefer she sticks to the sidelines – by more than two to one.

Just over a quarter of voters said they would like to see former Vice President Kamala Harris run for president again. (Fox News)

Was President Donald Trump a factor in Prop 50's success? The president remains deeply unpopular in the state, with close to two-thirds disapproving of the job he is doing.

Just over half of California voters say they disapprove of President Trump's job performance. (Fox News)

Half of those casting a ballot said they did so specifically to show their opposition to him.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT

Roughly half of California voters said that opposition to President Donald Trump was the reason they voted on Prop 50. (Fox News)

Meanwhile, California voters reject Trump's immigration enforcement policies, with more than six in 10 saying they've gone too far.

A similar number opposes sending the National Guard into U.S. cities.

Just over half of voters said they oppose the federal government's move to send National Guard troops to major cities in California. (Fox News)

And these voters who oppose Trump and his policies also overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – in some instances by more than nine to one. It might be pointed out, however, that Trump lost California by more than 20 points in 2024, and his disapproval ratings could be exaggerated among voters in this special electorate.

Despite all their negative feelings toward Trump, all is not candy and rainbows for how Californians see things at home.

The economy was by far their top issue, yet the view of the Golden State economy is not so golden, as more than six in 10 said the state economy is in ""not good"" or poor shape.

CALIFORNIA FARMERS PUSH BACK ON PROP 50 AS DEMOCRATS EYE NEW HOUSE MAP

Over half of voters said they hold a negative view of California's economy. (Fox News)

The vast majority – close to nine in 10 – also say their family financial situation is either holding steady or falling behind. Only about one in 10 feel they are getting ahead.

Plus, more than eight in 10 lamented California's cost of living as unaffordable.

Another eight in 10 said crime is a problem.

Voters overwhelmingly said that crime in their area is a problem. (Fox News)

However, worried Californians are, they are equally perturbed by the state of the nation.

More than seven in 10 said they are unhappy about how things are going in the U.S., with close to half angry about the direction the country is heading.

Almost half of California voters said they were angry about how things are going in the U.S. today. (Fox News)

More than nine in 10 said they are concerned about political violence in the U.S.

These concerns appear to play out in the vote to redraw the congressional map, with more than nine in 10 who said it is important to them which party controls Congress.

Black voters, young voters, Hispanics and college graduates were among those most inclined to back Prop 50, while those most likely to oppose it included voters with no college degree, voters ages 65 and over, and independents.

The Fox News Voter Poll is based on a survey conducted by SSRS with California registered voters. This survey was conducted Oct. 22 to Nov. 4, 2025, concluding at the end of voting on Election Day. Once votes are counted, the survey results are also weighted to match the overall results in each state. Results among all more than 4,000 California voters interviewed have an estimated margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points, including the design effects.  The error margin is larger among subgroups.

Zohran Mamdani hasn't been New York City's mayoral-elect for 24 hours yet, but his postelection decisions are already likely rattling big business.

Former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan — whose regulatory moves angered many corporate leaders — has been named as one of the co-chairs of Mamdani's transition team.

""What we saw last night was New Yorkers not just electing a new mayor, but clearly rejecting a politics where outsized corporate power and money too often end up dictating our politics,"" Khan said in a speech on Wednesday.

During her time leading the FTC under former President Joe Biden, Khan drew the ire of many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Her ambitious anti-trust agenda targeted Amazon and Meta, among others. She is described as ""the nation's leading antimonopoly champion"" on Mamdani's transition website.

Mamdani won New York City's mayoral race handily last night, in a blow to the billionaires who spent big to try to keep him out of office. Business leaders who criticized the democratic socialist less than a day ago have offered to help him run the nation's center of capitalism, including outspoken Mamdani critic Bill Ackman.

Khan will lead Mamdani's team alongside former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, nonprofit leader Grace Bonilla, and city budget expert Melanie Hartzog.

Traders slashed odds that the Supreme Court will uphold President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs after justices on Wednesday signaled doubts about the legality of the administration's sweeping trade powers.

On Kalshi, contracts tied to whether the court would rule in favor of Trump's tariffs slipped to around 30% from nearly 50% before Wednesday's hearing.

A similar contract on platform Polymarket dropped to about 30% from more than 40% earlier in the week, reflecting traders' growing belief that the justices may strike down the policy.

The moves came after several conservative justices joined their liberal colleagues in expressing unease about the broad authority Trump claimed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on imports. They sharply questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the Trump administration's legal justification of the tariffs, which critics say infringes on the power of Congress to tax.

Lower federal courts have ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico.

Prediction markets, which allow traders to bet on real-world events, often react swiftly to perceived signals during high-profile court hearings. Wednesday's shift suggested that traders viewed the justices' tone as an indicator of headwinds for the president's trade agenda.

The Supreme Court will not issue a decision in the case on Wednesday. It is not clear when the court will release its ruling.

In this article

The Trump administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on Westinghouse nuclear plants could transform it into an independent, publicly traded company with the U.S. government as a major shareholder.

The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S.

Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more.

The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said.

Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said.

""There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,"" Isaac said. ""Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse.""

Cameco is one of the largest uranium miners in the world and Brookfield is one of the biggest investors in energy generation.

""We're going to keep all options on the table,"" Isaac said. ""This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up.""

The government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion.

The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from ""other jurisdictions"" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said.

""We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,"" the executive said.

Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner said in July that the company would meet Trump's call with the AP1000.

But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to deliver the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.

The first two AP1000 reactors in the U.S. came online at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 but the South Carolina project was canceled.

Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it.

The nuclear industry needs a big order of reactors to stimulate the market and supply chains, Isaac said. The U.S. government is serving that role, the executive said.

""What the U.S. government has done is committed to step in and be that stimulant if you will, their commitment is to facilitate the financing,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin drops below $100,000, filling traders with “an almost biblical level of dread”","https://sherwood.news/crypto/bitcoin-drops-below-usd100-000-filling-traders-with-an-almost-biblical-level/","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 18:18:56 GMT","

CoinMarketCap's Fear and Greed Index is at 20, its lowest level since April and on the edge of “extreme fear.”

Bitcoin fell under $100,000 twice on Tuesday, the first time since June, filling investors with “an almost biblical level of dread,” according to Nic Puckrin, cofounder of Coin Bureau. Total crypto liquidations continued, totaling $1.6  billion in the last 24 hours, CoinGlass data shows. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap's Fear and Greed Index is at 20, its lowest level since April, on the edge of “extreme fear.”

The question now is, where does bitcoin go from here? While bitcoin recovered Wednesday, it's still down double digits from its October 6 all-time high. As for bitcoin ETFs, outflows so far this week have already reached $763 million, per SoSoValue.

Citi analysts said bitcoin's dip is due to a slew of factors, including ETF appetite and impaired flows, “a key factor to monitor,” as well as technical paralysis.

“Bitcoin is currently trading below its 200-day moving average, which may further suppress demand,” the analysts wrote in a note.

CryptoQuant analysts echoed the sentiment, saying in a report that bitcoin broke its key support level “that confirmed the 2002 bear market,” noting that the price of bitcoin is “below its 365-day moving average of $102K, a key technical and psychological support level.”

“The 365-day MA has acted as the ultimate support level so far this bull cycle, and was one of the last signals triggered as the bear market began in December 2021-January 2022. A failure to cross back above the 365-day MA quickly could trigger a much larger correction in Bitcoin's price,” they said in a report. 

Additional risk triggers include macroeconomic factors, a prolonged shutdown, and concerns around digital asset treasuries, all of which could further dampen risk appetite and drive bitcoin's price lower.Timothy Misir, head of research at Blockhead Research Network, also said that a loss of the $98,000 support level “signals structural shift toward bear phase; below $95,000 could trigger panic.”

However, some analysts remain upbeat, and while November seems “choppy” for bitcoin, they say the bull run is not over.

Puckrin told Sherwood News that though this sell-off is nerve-wracking, longer term, he still sees $150,000 as a likely top for this cycle.

“It will just be a bumpy ride from here, and this volatility will increasingly catch out traders on both sides of the fence. The selling pressure is coming from OG holders and from the prevailing economic uncertainty, but eventually it will stop, and the price will recover. The long-term fundamentals haven't changed — liquidity and further rate cuts are still coming,” he said.

Spot ethereum ETFs also a fifth straight day of outflows, with roughly $219 million leaving the investment funds on Tuesday.

Shiba inu, cat in a dogs world, pepe, and popcat have fallen to levels not seen since 2024.

Bitcoin ETFs also continued to bleed, with $186.5 million in outflows on Monday.

BitMine, the largest ethereum treasury firm, also added over 82,350 tokens to its stash last week. 

November is historically bitcoin's best month, but the price may remain in the $107,000 to $113,000 range.","{'href': 'https://sherwood.news', 'title': 'Sherwood News'}","cryptocurrency"

As Bitcoin recovers from its slip below $100,000, an analyst recommended BTC traders “buy the dip, in stages.”

To do that, Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick said traders should figure out what the max is they can invest in Bitcoin and then follow these three steps.

First, they should buy 25% of max limit now, adding “the dip below 100K overnight well may be the last one ever.” Then he said they should buy 25% more of max if the Friday ‘close' is above $103,000.

Lastly, Kendrick said traders should buy the other 50% of max “if/when the Bitcoin-gold ratio goes back above 30.”

The Bitcoin-gold ratio has fallen to 25. It peaked for the year at 38.6 on January 5, 2025 and was close to reclaiming that high point again in August, when it hit 36.5. But the ratio has been steadily falling since August 12 as gold prices have soared.

In the past month, gold has at times begun to decline and positioned Bitcoin for a more favorable comparison. But the recent price volatility has cast doubts on BTC catching up to the precious metal.

Users on Myriad have grown increasingly certain that gold will outperform Bitcoin this year. At the time of writing, users estimated that there's an 82% chance gold will come out on top. Since the start of the year, gold has gained a staggering 66.5%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's latest plunge has left it trading 10.5% higher than it was January 1.

Analysts told Decrypt on Tuesday that the U.S. government shutdown, which has now become the longest on record, has been siphoning cash away from institutions that might otherwise deploy it through lending, equities, or cryptocurrencies.

But when the shutdown does finally end and the Treasury begins spending cash again, the recovery should be swift, BitMEX analysts said.

“This massive liquidity ‘snap-back' should trigger a strong relief rally, aligning perfectly with Bitcoin's historical end-of-year seasonal strength,” they said.

Key Takeaways

When most are backing away from crypto as Bitcoin slips below $100,000, Japan's Metaplanet is doing the opposite.

The firm, often called “Asia's MicroStrategy,” is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy, tapping a fresh $100 million loan to buy even more BTC.

Bitcoin Treasuries in Trouble? Over 50 Firms are Sitting on Major Losses

Metaplanet confirmed  it has withdrawn $100 million from its new $500 million credit facility. The loan is fully collateralized by the company's existing Bitcoin reserves.

The funds will be deployed toward additional Bitcoin purchases as part of Metaplanet's long-term accumulation plan. 

The firm is also expanding its Bitcoin Income Generation initiative, which includes selling cash-secured put options to capitalize on volatility and executing a $500 million share repurchase program.

This latest move forms part of Metaplanet's ambitious “555 Million Plan” — a roadmap targeting ownership of 210,000 BTC (roughly 1% of Bitcoin's total supply) by 2027.

The company already hit its 2025 interim goal of 30,000 BTC ahead of schedule in early October.

With 30,823 BTC currently on its balance sheet, Metaplanet now ranks as the world's fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy's (640,031 BTC), MARA Holdings (52,477 BTC), and XXI (43,514 BTC).

Metaplanet remains Asia's undisputed Bitcoin heavyweight.

While Metaplanet ramps up, most other corporate Bitcoin treasuries are cooling off. 

The feverish pace of accumulation seen earlier this year has slowed sharply through the fourth quarter.

Between January and June, public companies collectively added around 245,000 BTC to their balance sheets.

That figure dropped to 205,000 BTC in the second half of the year — and just 28,000 BTC in Q4 so far.

Quarterly BTC Additions by Public Firms:

Q1: 95,431 BTC

Q2: 150,079 BTC

Q3: 176,762 BTC

Q4: 28,000 BTC

Ethereum holdings have followed a similar pattern.

Public companies added 20,000 ETH in Q1, 41,500 ETH in Q2, and a massive 5.6 million ETH in Q3 — but only around 238,500 ETH in Q4 to date.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin's recent slide under $100,000, its lowest level since June, has rattled some investors, but prominent voices in the industry remain upbeat about the long-term outlook.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan described the downturn as peak retail capitulation rather than the onset of a deeper collapse. Hougan stated:

“Crypto retail is in max desperation. We've seen leverage blowouts… the market for sort of crypto native retail is just more depressed than I've ever seen it.”

He believes the sell-off is nearing exhaustion, and once retail exits, institutional demand could push prices higher.

Hougan added that Bitcoin could “easily end the year at new all-time highs,” projecting a range of $125,000 to $130,000.

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has argued that rising US government debt will force the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet through what he calls “stealth QE”—injecting liquidity via the Standing Repo Facility to support Treasury financing. Hayes wrote:

“If the Fed's balance sheet grows, that is dollar liquidity positive, and ultimately pumps the price of Bitcoin.”

He expects that this cycle of government borrowing and quiet liquidity creation will reignite the bitcoin bull market.

Market commentators, including The Kobeissi Letter, noted that Bitcoin has now entered bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its October 6 high.

Some traders warn that prices could drop further, potentially retesting the $92,000 level if support fails.

As the cryptocurrency market faces significant volatility in November 2025, Ethereum ETHUSDT and XRP are exhibiting unique price behavior compared to Bitcoin BTCUSDT. While Bitcoin continues to drain liquidity from the broader market, popular analyst CryptoInsightUK believes ETH and XRP may not necessarily follow BTC's lead this time.

Ethereum Nears Critical Bottom, Eyes Resistance Zone

Ethereum has absorbed most of its low and high timeframe liquidity, leaving little support below its current levels. This suggest that, most short-term sellers seem to be out of the market, reducing the chance of another sharp drop and opening the door for a possible rebound.

Adding to the analysis crypto analyst Ted highlighted that ETH nearly touched the $3,000 level before bouncing back, showing that this zone continues to act as strong support. 

However, Ethereum now faces a crucial resistance area between $3,500 and $3,600. Reclaiming this range would signal renewed bullish momentum, while failing to do so could send the price back toward $2,800, a level tested several times in recent months.

As of early November 2025, Ethereum trades near $3,300, down about 8.6% following the latest market pullback.

XRP Consolidates Around $2

Simialry, XRP has now absorbed nearly all its low-timeframe liquidity, leaving only a small amount of support below current price levels. This pattern often signals a consolidation or accumulation phase, where selling pressure fades and buyers quietly begin to position for a potential reversal.

Adding to the optimism, Ripple's decision to retain 25% of all XRP tokens reflects strong internal confidence in the asset's long-term growth. The company expects rising network demand to support higher valuations in the future.

Currently trading between $2.20 and $2.30, XRP faces a crucial support zone. A drop below $2.00 could send it toward $1.70, while a rebound from here may help recover recent losses.

As Bitcoin's dominance wavers, ETH and XRP might quietly prepare for their own rebound, signaling that not all altcoins need BTC's permission to rise.

FAQs

Ethereum has cleared most short-term sellers, holding strong near $3,000 support and eyeing a key resistance between $3,500–$3,600.

Yes. Analysts suggest ETH and XRP may decouple from Bitcoin's trend, building momentum from independent market drivers.

As per our Ethereum price forecast 2025, the ETH price could reach a maximum of $9,428.11.

Analysts and AI forecasts project XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025, driven by ETF approvals, partnerships, and regulatory clarity.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitget, a Seychelles-based fintech firm dubbed a “universal exchange” due to its cryptocurrency and traditional financial services offerings, has announced its full integration with the Morph Chain layer-2 blockchain.

Users on Morph can now trade assets from the Morph ecosystem directly from their Bitget wallets with USDT without the need for swaps or bridging.

According to a Nov. 5 press release, Morph is the first network to offer full integration with Bitget Onchain. The partnership was formally announced in a Sept. 2 blog post wherein Bitget stated its intent to transfer the 440 million BGB tokens it controlled to the Morph Foundation, making BGB the backbone token for the network.

Half of the tokens were slated to be burned at the time while the remaining 220 million BGB were reportedly locked with a scheduled release at 2% per month to fund liquidity incentives, use case expansion, and education.

With the integration now finalized, Morph is officially the native onchain home of the BGB token and serves as the core settlement layer with BGB established as both its gas and governance token.

As Coinspeaker reported on Nov. 4, Bitget announced an institutional financing program offering zero-interest loans to qualified participants with borrowing limits up to two million USDT without interest. Approved users are required to meet at least 50% of the exchange's standard monthly trading volume benchmarks and the program runs from Nov. 1, 2025, through Jan. 31, 2026.

The exchange also announced a major upgrade to its Bitget Onchain service in September allowing users to seamlessly trade, stake, and manage millions of on-chain tokens directly from their Bitget spot account. The expansion introduced support for Ethereum, Solana, BSC, and Base.

Bitcoin briefly slipped below the $100,000 mark a few hours back, shaking market confidence and sparking fresh volatility. As traders assess the next move, attention is turning to the altcoins that could crash if Bitcoin falls further, given their tight price link with BTC.

With Bitcoin's dominance climbing again, several highly correlated tokens are already flashing signs of weakness. These three coins often move in lockstep with Bitcoin — and if BTC slides deeper, their declines could quickly intensify.

Bitcoin Cash could be one of the altcoins to crash if Bitcoin falls, given its strong price link with BTC. Its 7-day Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.94, showing that BCH moves almost exactly in step with Bitcoin. The Pearson coefficient measures how closely two assets move together, with +1 meaning they move the same way and -1 meaning the opposite.

Even over the past year, BCH has maintained a high 0.80 correlation, making it one of the most consistently linked assets to Bitcoin's movements.

That connection is already visible in recent price action. Over the past month, Bitcoin Cash has dropped 18.9%, while Bitcoin has fallen 18.1% — showing both are still moving in tandem. As Bitcoin dominance climbs above 60%, this tight correlation makes BCH especially vulnerable to any deeper Bitcoin decline.

Large holders — the 100,000 to 1 million BCH cohort, often considered whales — have been reducing positions since November 1, cutting their stash from 4.39 million to 4.34 million BCH, or roughly 50,000 coins (about $25 million).

On the charts, BCH trades near $484. If Bitcoin weakens further, $439 is the next key support, below which a larger breakdown could begin. However, if BTC rebounds, BCH is likely to follow quickly. 

A move above $491 would be the first recovery signal, while reclaiming $523 would invalidate the bearish setup, indicating that Bitcoin's strength is also returning.

BNB is another major altcoin to crash if Bitcoin falls, given its consistently strong correlation with BTC. The 7-day correlation between the two stands at 0.97, showing they move almost together. 

Over the longer term, the one-year coefficient sits at 0.67, which still signals a strong positive link. That correlation is already visible in recent price data. BNB and Bitcoin have both corrected by over 4% in the past 24 hours.

The coin has followed BTC closely through this correction phase. However, despite the weakness, BNB remains one of the strongest performers of this cycle, still up 23.5% over the past three months.

On the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) chart, large-wallet inflows have dropped sharply since October 22 but are now trending upward as Bitcoin rebounds above $101,600, suggesting early signs of renewed buying interest.  The CMF tracks money inflows and outflows based on price and volume, mostly from large wallets. 

If Bitcoin manages to recover further, BNB could be one of the first coins to benefit. For that to happen, the price must hold above $946 to confirm a rebound setup. 

Between October 10 and November 4, the price made a higher low while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) made a lower low — a hidden bullish divergence that hints at an ongoing uptrend beneath the correction. This pattern lends weight to the rebound setup, but only if BTC keeps strong.

The RSI measures price momentum to show if an asset is overbought or oversold.

A daily close above $1,084 would invalidate the bearish structure and point to recovery. However, if Bitcoin fails again and breaks below $100,000, the BNB  price could test key supports at $859 and $817.

Litecoin (LTC) is another altcoin to crash if Bitcoin falls, given its strong and consistent correlation with BTC across both short and medium time frames. The monthly Pearson correlation coefficient for Litecoin and Bitcoin stands at 0.92, showing they move almost perfectly in sync. 

That connection shows in recent performance. While Bitcoin has fallen over 18% this month, Litecoin has dropped even more — about 28%, reflecting its tighter sensitivity to BTC price swings. Even in the past 24 hours, LTC has slipped 3%, only slightly less than Bitcoin.

Large holders — addresses holding 100,000 to 1 million LTC — have also started reducing exposure since October 29. Their combined supply fell from 28.51 million to 28.19 million LTC, a drop of 0.32 million coins. At the current price, that equals roughly $28.8 million in tokens offloaded — a clear signal that bigger players are turning cautious.

On the price chart, Litecoin trades near a strong support at $86. If that level breaks and Bitcoin weakens further, LTC could slide to $79, about 8.3% lower, and potentially even test $71 if bearish momentum builds. 

However, if Bitcoin rebounds, Litecoin's high correlation means it would likely bounce too. A move above $96 would invalidate the current bearish setup, while reclaiming $100 would confirm strength returning to both assets.

Eldrem, a web3 fantasy RPG, launches its Bestiary App, letting players earn NFT dragons, Eldrem Tokens, USDC, and in-game rewards through daily tasks and creature interactions.

Eliza Crichton-Stuart

Updated Nov 5, 2025

Web3 fantasy RPG Eldrem has officially launched its Bestiary App, providing players with early access to the game's creature-focused world. The new platform allow users to complete tasks both through a browser-based web platform and the Android app to earn rewards, including NFT dragons, Eldrem Tokens, USDC, and other in-game items. The launch gives players a chance to engage with the game's systems ahead of the full release, with a focus on exploration, creature management, and daily challenges.

Players begin by registering on the platform at play.eldrem.com and verifying their email. From there, they can complete a variety of tasks that range from simple daily tasks to more advanced in-app challenges. Each completed quest grants Activity Points (AP), which convert into raffle tickets. Players receive one daily ticket for every five AP and one weekly ticket for every 18 AP. These tickets can be used to win Origins NFTs, USDC, Eldrem Token shards, VIP passes, early access to game content, and in-game creatures.

Tasks on the web platform are designed to be accessible without the app, such as logging in daily, following Eldrem on social platforms, or enabling two-factor authentication. The Android Bestiary App introduces additional tasks that involve combat, including defeating waves of enemies or bosses. Progress on both platforms is synchronized, allowing players to switch between devices while continuing to earn rewards.

The Bestiary App allows players to interact directly with their in-game creature. Upon logging in, users receive a default baby creature in their profile, which can be fed, played with, and trained. Creatures grow from level 1 to 10 through daily care, after which further progression requires combat in the main game. The app also includes a combat interface, letting players engage in waves and boss battles, as well as a tracker that mirrors the web platform.

Eldrem's Origins Genesis NFT collection is scheduled to launch on November 11 through Magic Eden. The collection consists of 4,444 dragon NFTs, each providing in-game benefits and early adopter rewards. Owners of Genesis NFTs receive OG status for future drops, airdrop eligibility, and the ability to use their NFT dragons in battles. At present, only Genesis NFT dragons are tradable, while other creatures earned through tasks are account-bound. The development team has plans to convert in-game creatures into tradable NFTs in future updates.

Creatures in Eldrem serve functional roles in combat, resource gathering, and other gameplay systems. Players can raise baby creatures to level 10 through the Bestiary App, after which combat will be necessary for further leveling once the main game launches. Creatures earned through raffle tickets are tied to the player's account and are not tradable, with rarities ranging from common to epic. Genesis NFT dragons are considered Legendary and can be traded, used in battles, and linked to a player's wallet.

Eldrem uses the SEI network for its blockchain features, including NFT distribution, tracking token shards, and issuing raffle rewards. Players who wish to claim on-chain rewards such as USDC or Eldrem Tokens need to connect a Metamask wallet. Currently, the Android app only supports login via email and password, while wallet connection and reward claiming occur through the web platform. NFT rewards and tokens will be redeemable after the Genesis mint and token generation event, with the platform keeping track of progress in the meantime.

While the Bestiary App is currently available for Android, an iOS version is planned but has no announced release date. A full Windows PC version is also in development and is listed on the Epic Games Store for wishlisting. The main Eldrem game, expected to debut in 2026, will feature kingdom building, PvE co-op, large-scale battles, multiplayer alliances, and PvP. In the meantime, players can use the Platform and Bestiary App to level creatures, earn raffle tickets, and collect rewards in preparation for the main release.

The European Parliament rapporteur for the digital euro has proposed giving private payment firms an equal chance to solve Europe's payment sovereignty problem, potentially sidelining a key part of European Central Bank's project. Fernando Navarrete, the MEP coordinating the legislative process, presented his draft report to the ECON committee today, marking a sharp departure from the legislative direction pursued before the 2024 European electionsAll parties unanimously agreed on the need for European sovereignty and are keen to move away from the dependence on Visa and Mastercard for retail payments.  “Our commitment must be unwavering to the (sovereignty) goal itself, not to any single instrument to reach it,” Navarrete said. “When I ask myself what European citizens expect from us, I doubt that many feel an urgent need to create a digital euro.”

The development of the central bank digital currency conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) has two versions: one that is online and the other that is offline. Navarrete proposes that the offline CBDC, as a tokenized version of cash without intermediaries, should proceed. But the online version should only go ahead if the private sector has not already solved the problem by the time that the European Central Bank is ready to launch, which is likely to be 2029 at the earliest.

There is a private payment solution in progress, the Wero wallet, which is currently available in Germany, France and Belgium. So far 20 banks and payment firms are involved.

Despite the central role of antibodies in modern medicine, no method currently exists to design novel, epitope-specific antibodies entirely in silico. Instead, antibody discovery currently relies on immunization, random library screening or the isolation of antibodies directly from patients1. Here we demonstrate that combining computational protein design using a fine-tuned RFdiffusion2 network with yeast display screening enables the de novo generation of antibody variable heavy chains (VHHs), single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and full antibodies that bind to user-specified epitopes with atomic-level precision. We experimentally characterize VHH binders to four disease-relevant epitopes. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose of designed VHHs targeting influenza haemagglutinin and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). A high-resolution structure of the influenza-targeting VHH confirms atomic accuracy of the designed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Although initial computational designs exhibit modest affinity (tens to hundreds of nanomolar Kd), affinity maturation using OrthoRep3 enables production of single-digit nanomolar binders that maintain the intended epitope selectivity. We further demonstrate the de novo design of scFvs to TcdB and a PHOX2B peptide–MHC complex by combining designed heavy-chain and light-chain CDRs. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose for two distinct TcdB scFvs, with high-resolution data for one design verifying the atomically accurate design of the conformations of all six CDR loops. Our approach establishes a framework for the computational design, screening and characterization of fully de novo antibodies with atomic-level precision in both structure and epitope targeting.

Antibodies are the dominant class of protein therapeutics, with over 160 antibody therapeutics currently licensed globally and a market value expected to reach US$445 billion in the next 5 years4. Antibody development generally proceeds in two stages: (1) the discovery of antibodies that bind to a specific epitope; and (2) the subsequent affinity maturation and clinical optimization of those antibodies. Currently, identifying epitope-specific antibodies relies on animal immunization or screening of antibody libraries to identify candidate molecules that bind to a desired target, followed by subsequent epitope mapping. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and can fail to identify antibodies that interact with the therapeutically relevant epitope1. Efforts at computational design of antibodies have generally focused on the second optimization step of antibody development, such as sampling alternative native CDR loops to improve affinities5,6 or using Rosetta7 sequence design to improve the interacting regions. More recently, structure-based and sequence-based deep learning networks have been trained to design novel antibody sequence variants8,9,10, but these methods require an initial binding antibody from which to optimize. There have also been recent advances in antibody optimization with deep learning methods trained on data generated by powerful new experimental methods11,12. By contrast, computational methods able to perform the first stage of antibody design (generating epitope-specific binding antibodies) do not exist, and de novo (no homology to an existing antibody targeting that epitope) design of antibodies therefore remains an unsolved problem. There has been rapid progress in designing binding proteins (not antibodies) using RFdiffusion2,13,14. However, as with other methods for de novo interface design15,16,17, these binders almost exclusively rely on regular secondary structure-based (helical or strand) interactions with the target epitope, and the original (‘vanilla') RFdiffusion network is therefore unable to design antibodies de novo (Supplementary Fig. 1; see ref. 18).

An ideal method for designing de novo antibodies would enable: (1) targeting of any specified epitope on any target of interest; (2) focusing of sampling on the CDR loops, keeping the framework sequence and structure close to a user-specified highly optimized therapeutic antibody framework; and (3) sampling of alternative rigid-body placements of the designed antibody with respect to the epitope. We hypothesized that a specialized version of RFdiffusion fine-tuned on antibody structures should be capable of designing de novo CDR-mediated interfaces, given the diversity and quality of de novo interfaces that RFdiffusion can design and given that the underlying thermodynamics of interface formation are the same, and set out to develop such a method.

RFdiffusion uses the AlphaFold2 (ref. 19) and RF2 frame representation of protein backbones comprising the Cα coordinate and N-Cα-C rigid orientation for each residue. During training, a noising schedule is used that, over a set number of ‘timesteps' (T), corrupts the protein frames towards random prior distributions (Cα coordinates are corrupted with three-dimensional Gaussian noise, and residue orientations with Brownian motion on SO3). During training, a Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure and a random timestep (t) are sampled, and t noising steps are applied to the structure. RFdiffusion predicts the de-noised (pX0) structure at each timestep, and a mean squared error loss is minimized between the true structure (X0) and the prediction (pX0). At inference time, a random residue distribution (XT) is sampled, and RFdiffusion iteratively de-noises this to generate novel protein structures.

We fine-tuned RFdiffusion predominantly on antibody complex structures (Fig. 1; see Methods in Supplementary Information). At each step of training, the antibody structure is corrupted. To permit specification of the framework structure and sequence at inference time, the framework sequence and structure are provided as conditioning input to RFdiffusion during training (Fig. 1b). Because it is desirable for the rigid-body position (dock) between antibody and target to be designed by RFdiffusion along with the CDR loop conformations, the framework structure is provided in a global-frame-invariant manner during training (Fig. 1c). We utilize the ‘template track' of RF2/RFdiffusion to provide the framework structure as a two-dimensional matrix of pairwise distances and dihedral angles between each pair of residues (a representation from which three-dimensional structures can be accurately recapitulated)20 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The framework and target templates do not encode their relative positions in the three-dimensional space. In this work, we kept the sequence and structure of the framework region fixed, and focused on the design of the CDRs and the overall rigid-body placement of the antibody to the target. We trained RFdiffusion with an additional one-hot encoded ‘hotspot' feature, which provides some fraction of the residues that the antibody CDRs interact with, such that at inference, we can direct antibodies towards a specific site (Fig. 1d; we refer to these sites as ‘epitopes' throughout the remainder of the text). For simplicity, we refer to this fine-tuned version of the network as RFdiffusion for the remainder of this paper. 

a, RFdiffusion is trained such that at time T, a sample is drawn from the prior distribution (three-dimensional Gaussian distribution for translations and uniform SO3 distribution for rotations), and de-noised between times T and 0 to generate an (in this case) scFv. b, The antibody framework is provided as a sequence and ‘template' to RFdiffusion; the latter specifying the pairwise distances and dihedral angles between framework residues. For example, one can specify the design of a VHH (top) or scFv (bottom). c, Diversity in the antibody–target dock is achieved because the framework template does not encode the rigid body framework–target relationship. Diverse docking modes are sampled by RFdiffusion. d, The epitope is specified by provision of ‘hotspot' residues, which direct the designed antibody (compare orange, left, versus pink, right). e, Overview of the computational design pipeline described in this article. RFdiffusion performs the backbone design step, given a target, epitope hotspots and antibody framework. ProteinMPNN designs only the sequence of the CDR residues (not the framework residues). Fine-tuned RoseTTAFold2 predicts the structure of the designed antibody, given the target (sequence, structure and, optionally, some fraction of hotspot residues) and designed antibody sequence. Self-consistency (high similarity between predicted and designed structures) and high confidence (low predicted alignment error) define in silico success. Note that AlphaFold3, not available at the time of this work, is a better predictor of success than RoseTTAFold2. f, The contribution of this work is the epitope-specific antibody design pipeline depicted in panel e. Several methods can be used to experimentally validate designs and subsequently affinity-mature or optimize them. In this work, we used yeast surface display and/or E. coli expression with SPR for experimental validation (taking approximately 6 weeks and 2 weeks post-oligonucleotide order, respectively), and OrthoRep affinity maturation.

With this training regime, RFdiffusion is able to design antibody structures that closely match the structure of the input framework structure and target the specified epitope with novel CDR loops (Supplementary Fig. 1). After the RFdiffusion step, we use ProteinMPNN to design the CDR loop sequences. The designed antibodies make diverse interactions with the target epitope and differ significantly from sequences in the training dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1). There was no correlation between training dataset similarity and binding success (Extended Data Fig. 1a, red lines).

Design pipelines typically produce a wide range of solutions to any given design challenge. An effective way to filter designed proteins and interfaces that are most likely to succeed experimentally is based on the similarity of the designed structure to the AlphaFold2-predicted structure for the designed sequence (this is often referred to as ‘self-consistency'), which has been shown to correlate well with experimental success21,22. In the case of antibodies, however, AlphaFold2 fails to accurately predict antibody–antigen structures23, preventing its use as a filter in an antibody design pipeline, and at the outset of this project, AlphaFold3 (ref. 24) was not available.

We sought to improve design filtering by fine-tuning RoseTTAFold2 on antibody structures. To simplify antibody structure prediction, we provided information during training about the structure of the target and the location of the target epitope to which the antibody binds; the fine-tuned RF2 must still correctly model the CDRs and find the correct orientation of the antibody to the targeted region. The rationale for providing this information is that the target structure and binding location are available during design (but are typically not available during general structure prediction). With this training regimen and additional information, RF2 is able to robustly distinguish true antibody–antigen pairs from decoy pairs and often accurately predicts antibody–antigen complex structures, but only when the bound (holo) conformation of the target structure and epitope information is provided (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). At monomer prediction, the fine-tuned RF2 outperformed previous models available at the time, especially at CDR H3 structure prediction (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f).

When this fine-tuned RF2 network is used to re-predict the structure of RFdiffusion-designed VHHs, a significant fraction are confidently predicted to bind in an almost identical manner to their designed structure (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Furthermore, in silico cross-reactivity analyses demonstrated that RFdiffusion-designed VHHs are rarely predicted to bind to unrelated proteins (Extended Data Fig. 3b). VHHs that are confidently predicted to bind to their designed target are predicted to form high-quality interfaces, as measured by Rosetta ddG (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This indicates that RF2 filtering might enrich for experimentally successful binders.

We initially focused on the design of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) produced by camelids25. To date, two VHH-based therapies have been approved by the FDA with many clinical trials ongoing25. Despite having fewer CDR loops (three) than conventional antibodies (six), the average interaction surface area of a VHH is very similar to that of an antibody26, suggesting that a method capable of VHH design could also be suitable for antibody design. Indeed, in silico metrics for scFvs and VHHs showed similar qualities of interfaces, as assessed by Rosetta7 and fine-tuned RF2 (Extended Data Fig. 3b–f).

We chose a widely used humanized VHH framework (h-NbBcII10FGLA)27 as the basis of our VHH design campaigns, and designed VHHs to a range of disease-relevant targets: C. difficile TcdB, influenza H1 haemagglutinin, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sites I and III, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and IL-7Rα. Computationally filtered designs were screened either at high throughput by yeast surface display (9,000 designs per target; RSV sites I and III, RBD and influenza haemagglutinin) or at lower throughput with Escherichia coli expression and single-concentration surface plasmon resonance (SPR; 95 designs per target; TcdB, IL-7Rα and influenza haemagglutinin; the latter was screened using both methods).

The highest affinity binders to RSV site III, influenza haemagglutinin, RBD and TcdB are shown in Fig. 2a–c,e, respectively (see also Supplementary Fig. 2 for all the SPR traces of confirmed VHH binders identified in this study and Supplementary Methods Table 6 for success rates against each target, which range from 0% to 2%). The CDR loops are distinct from VHHs observed in nature, indicating substantial generalization beyond the training dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1). Of the haemagglutinin binders tested against the insect-cell-produced haemagglutinin monomer, the highest affinity binder had a dissociation constant (Kd) of 78 nM (Fig. 2b), with other binders having affinities of 546 nM, 698 nM and 790 nM. For TcdB, the target epitope was the Frizzled interface, for which there are no antibodies or VHHs targeting this site in the PDB. For the best-designed VHH from both RBD (Kd = 5.5 μM; Fig. 2c) and TcdB (Kd = 260 nM; Fig. 2d), binding was confirmed to be to the desired epitope: binding was completely abolished upon addition of a previously designed, structurally characterized de novo binder to that epitope (AHB2 (PDB ID 7UHB28) for RBD and FZD48 (PDB ID 9CM5 (ref. 29)) for TcdB; Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). This TcdB VHH also neutralized TcdB toxicity in CSPG4-knockout cells (an alternative TcdB receptor) with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 460 nM (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). For TcdB, the interactions were specific, with no binding observed to the highly related (70% sequence homology) Paeniclostridium sordellii lethal toxin L (TcsL; Extended Data Fig. 4b). These data demonstrate the ability of RFdiffusion to design VHHs that make specific interactions with the target epitope.

a,b, Nine thousand designed VHHs were screened against RSV site III (a; VHH_RSV_01) and influenza haemagglutinin (b; VHH_flu_01) with yeast surface display, before soluble expression of the top hits in E. coli. SPR demonstrated that the highest affinity VHHs to RSV site III and influenza haemagglutinin bound their respective targets with 1.4 μM and 78 nM, respectively. c, Nine thousand VHH designs were tested against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and after soluble expression, SPR confirmed an affinity of 5.5 μM to the target for design VHH_RBD_D4 (left). Binding was to the expected epitope, confirmed by competition with a structurally confirmed de novo binder (AHB2 (PDB ID 7UHB), right). d, Ninety-five VHH designs were tested against C. difficile TcdB. The highest affinity VHH, VHH_TcdB_H2, bound with 262 nM affinity (left), and also competed with a structurally confirmed de novo binder (FZD48, PDB ID 9CM5 (ref. 29)) to the same epitope (right). See also Extended Data Fig. 4a–c for quantification of the competition shown in panels c,d. For all panels, the measured binding response is indicated in a solid blue line, and the global fit using a 1:1 binding interaction model is indicated with a black dashed line.

We sought to evaluate design accuracy by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination of the designed anti-haemagglutinin VHHs in complex with natively glycosylated, trimeric influenza haemagglutinin glycoprotein (strain A/USA:Iowa/1943 H1N1; Supplementary Fig. 4), which retains the conserved stem epitope used during computational VHH design and upstream biochemical screening. Cryo-EM data processing revealed that one VHH design effectively bound to the fully glycosylated haemagglutinin trimer (out of the four tested), denoted hereafter as VHH_flu_01 (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5). Two-dimensional classification of all particles in the dataset (Fig. 3a) and the determined 3.0 Å structure of the complex (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Methods Table 10) identified approximately 66% of haemagglutinin particles bound to a maximum of two VHHs per trimer (Fig. 3a–h). This partial occupancy is probably attributable to the N296 glycan, which, in unbound subunits, partially occludes the target epitope but reorients when bound to VHH_flu_01 (see Fig. 3h).

CROPs, combined repetitive oligopeptides; GTD, glucosyltransferase domain. k, Owing to the modest resolution, a fragment of TcdB was first docked into the cryo-EM density map, and the full design model—including both the TcdB fragment and the designed VHH—was then aligned to the pre-fitted TcdB fragment. The predicted design closely matches the experimentally determined complex in structure, epitope targeting and overall conformation. l, Labelled cryo-EM two-dimensional class averages of the designed VHH, VHH_TcdB_H2_ortho, bound to full-length TcdB. m, The 5.7 Å cryo-EM three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex shows that VHH_TcdB_H2_ortho bound the target epitope as predicted. n, A TcdB fragment was docked into the cryo-EM map, followed by alignment of the full model including the OrthoRep-matured VHH. The resulting structure shows no detectable change in binding orientation or docking angle compared with the original design, indicating that OrthoRep maturation preserved the predicted mode of epitope engagement. In all panels: yellow indicates haemagglutinin; grey denotes the computational design prediction; pink or navy shows VHH (cryo-EM); and teal indicates glycan.

The structure of influenza haemagglutinin bound to two copies of VHH_flu_01 (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5) reveals a VHH approach angle that closely matches the predicted model (Fig. 3f) and a VHH backbone that is very close to the RFdiffusion design, with a calculated root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.45 Å (Fig. 3g). The CDR3 structure is also very similar between the cryo-EM structure and the computational model (RMSD = 0.8 Å; Fig. 3d), with residues V100, V101, S103 and F108 in the de novo-designed CDR3 loop interacting with the influenza haemagglutinin stem epitope in the cryo-EM structure, as designed by RFdiffusion and re-predicted with RF2 (Fig. 3e). The design is highly dissimilar from the closest antibody–VHH binding to this epitope in the PDB (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Fig. 5). Together, these results demonstrate the VHH design with atomic-level precision.

To improve the binding affinity of de novo-designed VHHs, we utilized the orthogonal error-prone DNA replication system, OrthoRep, for continuous hypermutation of target genes in vivo30,31. OrthoRep has been shown to drive the rapid affinity maturation of yeast surface-displayed antibodies. We used this capability to affinity-mature VHHs targeting TcdB, influenza H1 haemagglutinin and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Affinity-matured VHHs acquired several mutations relative to the parent designs and improved binding affinities by approximately two orders of magnitude (Supplementary Fig. 3), making them suitable candidates for downstream cryo-EM structural characterization.

For TcdB, our design campaign targeted the Frizzled-binding epitope located on the RBD. TcdB consists of four functional domains including a central delivery and RBD (DRBD) where the VHHs were designed to bind. Cryo-EM characterization of the original parent design, VHH_TcdB_H2, confirmed that the VHH engages the target Frizzled DRBD epitope (Supplementary Fig. 7). Analysis via two-dimensional and three-dimensional classification revealed a mix of bound and unbound TcdB particles (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Extensive three-dimensional classification and local refinement identified multiple structural states of TcdB within the dataset, including an extended bound state (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Three-dimensional refinement of the bound VHH in the extended TcdB state yielded a modest 4.6 Å map, into which the design model was confidently rigid-body docked, showing high agreement with the intended design structure (Fig. 3i–k). To evaluate whether the improved affinity achieved through OrthoRep preserved the original binding mode of the parent design, we performed additional cryo-EM analysis on the affinity-matured VHH, VHH_TcdB_H2_ortho. These experiments revealed a high proportion of TcdB particles now bound by the VHH, consistent with its enhanced affinity (Fig. 3l–n and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Using a similar processing pipeline as for the parent VHH–TcdB complex, we resolved the affinity-matured VHH–TcdB complex to a modest 5.7 Å resolution, enabling us to confidently dock the designed VHH into the cryo-EM density with close agreement. This confirmed that the VHH maintained targeting to the correct epitope and retained its original binding pose after OrthoRep-mediated affinity maturation (Fig. 3l–n and Extended Data Fig. 6). These results underscore the capability of RFdiffusion to design accurate de novo VHHs that are capable of targeting previously unexplored epitopes and are amenable to downstream affinity maturation.

We next used cryo-EM to characterize an affinity-matured VHH (VHH_RBD_D4_ortho19) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, where competition experiments indicated that the parental VHH bound the intended epitope (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Figs. 3b and 9). The RBD transitions between ‘up' and ‘down' conformations, with the ‘up' state enabling receptor binding and viral entry32. Cryo-EM two-dimensional class averages and three-dimensional classification reconstructions of the VHH-bound complex revealed a mixture of RBD conformations (1–2 ‘up'), with VHH density observed exclusively in the up state. This is consistent with its design, as the target epitope is occluded in the down conformation (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). Global refinement with an average estimated resolution of 3.9 Å provided well-defined density for the lower portion of the spike protein (local resolution of approximately 2.5 Å), but the relative flexibility of the RBD resulted in substantial signal averaging, causing density loss at higher contour levels, which precluded assessment of VHH design accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 9c–e). Symmetry expansion and local refinement helped improve the resolution of the RBD–VHH interface, confirming the intended VHH fold and accurate epitope targeting following rigid-body docking of the design model into the density map (Supplementary Fig. 9f,g), in agreement with our biochemical competition data (Fig. 2c). However, although the VHH bound the correct RBD epitope, its binding mode deviated notably from the design model, instead adopting a predominantly framework-mediated interaction that more closely matched retrospective AlphaFold3 predictions (Supplementary Fig. 9g,h). Owing to the deviation between the designed dock and the experimentally determined dock, we classified this as a design failure.

Given the success of RFdiffusion at designing VHHs with three de novo CDRs, we next tested its ability to design both heavy and light chains in scFv format. RFdiffusion was used to generate scFvs targeting specific epitope sites, following a strategy similar to the VHH design approach. However, unlike VHHs, where only three CDRs were built de novo, scFv design involved constructing all six CDRs on both the heavy and the light chains in addition to the docking mode.

The gene synthesis problem is more formidable for scFvs than for VHHs as they are too long to be simply assembled from pairs of conventional oligonucleotides synthesized on oligonucleotide arrays, and are challenging to uniquely pair due to high sequence homology between scFvs. We developed stepwise assembly protocols that enable the construction of libraries with heavy and light chains either specifically paired as in the design models (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11) or combinatorially mixed within subsets of designs specifically with similar target-binding modes (Supplementary Fig. 12). The latter approach helps to overcome the greater challenge of accurate design of six CDRs de novo, which increases the possibilities for error compared with the VHH problem as only one suboptimal CDR can compromise binding. We found that given sets of nearly superimposable designs targeting the same site with the same binding mode, new scFvs generated by combining pairs of heavy and light chains from different designs were confidently predicted to bind to the target site in the designed binding mode at similar frequencies as compared to the original designs (Extended Data Fig. 7a). By contrast, random, structure-agnostic pairing rarely led to predicted binders (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Hence, by mixing CDRs from different designs that bind in the same orientation, we can effectively overcome failures due to single imperfectly designed CDRs, thereby offering a combinatorial solution to a combinatorially more complex problem (two-chain scFv design versus one-chain VHH design). This strategy highlights a key advantage of structure-based design: ‘intelligent' pairing of heavy and light chains is possible with a structural model of every antibody, and allows de novo-designed antibody libraries to reach scales attainable by traditional library assembly methods, despite current limits in gene synthesis.

We succeeded in identifying epitope-specific scFvs from the heavy–light combinatorial libraries (of a theoretical complexity of approximately 10 million; Extended Data Figs. 7b,c and 8a–c) but not the fixed pairing libraries (Supplementary Fig. 13). Following expression and purification, SPR analysis of six distinct scFvs originating from two unique docks targeting the Frizzled epitope of TcdB revealed a range of affinities (Fig. 4d–h): the highest affinity binder, scFv6, had a Kd of 72 nM (Fig. 4g). Conversion of the scFv to a full length IgG1 generated antibodies that bind with comparable (68 nM) affinity, demonstrating that our design method can be used to generate full-length antibodies (Fig. 4i). There are no antibodies binding to this epitope in the PDB, hence, this success cannot be attributed to memorization. Subsequent prediction of the structure of the scFv with AlphaFold3 showed a binding mode identical to that of the two nearly superimposable parent designs that contributed the light and heavy chains (Supplementary Fig. 16c,d). Competition with a known receptor, Frizzled-7, to this epitope confirmed that binding of scFv5 was on target (Fig. 4j). By contrast, no competition was seen in the presence of CSPG4, an alternative receptor that interacts with an epitope at the toxin core. Thus, scFvs targeting user-specified epitopes can be identified from structure-aware designed combinatorial libraries.

Predicted polar contacts with R6 of the PHOX2B peptide (right), mediated by CDRH3, CDRL1 and CDRL2, are also shown. Figure was created using BioRender (http://biorender.com).

We next targeted a clinically relevant epitope: the QYNPIRTTF peptide derived from the PHOX2B neuroblastoma-dependency gene and master transcriptional regulator in complex with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allotype HLA-C*07:02 (we refer to this peptide below simply as PHOX2B). The PHOX2B peptide was originally discovered by immunopeptidomics of neuroblastoma patient-derived samples, and has been targeted with peptide-centric chimeric antigen receptors (PC-CARs) for treating high-risk neuroblastoma33. However, the PC-CARs identified previously are restricted to recognizing PHOX2B presented on HLAs of the A9 serological group, excluding the common allotype HLA-C*07:02 (ref. 34). Targeting the PHOX2B–HLA-C*07:02 complex could meaningfully increase the addressable patient population for these immunotherapies, and has been the focus of ongoing therapeutics development. Recently, computationally designed (non-antibody) binders for PHOX2B–HLA-C*07:02 have been developed, using the TRACeR-I system35, whereas high-affinity TCRs have been identified for targeting peptides on the common HLA-C*08:02/HLA-C*05:01 allotypes36. A benefit of structure-based design is the ability to target specific peptide residues to achieve binding specificity (rather than binding only to the MHC), and we therefore used RFdiffusion to target the R6 residue, which is known to be important for binding in the PC-CAR34. Given the low stability of the PHOX2B–HLA-C*07:02 complex (Tm of 44.2 °C)34, we leveraged a disulfide-stabilized approach to prepare a stabilized form of the pHLA target37. Using the combinatorial assembly approach described above, we identified modest-affinity (400 nM as measured by SPR and 1 μM as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC); Fig. 4k,l and Extended Data Fig. 8e–g) scFv binders to PHOX2B–HLA-C*07:02. Binding was specific to the peptide, with no detectable binding to the R6A point mutant PHOX2B peptide (PHOX2B(R6A)–HLA-C*07:02; Fig. 4l). Attempts were made to incorporate scFv binders into a 4-1BB-CAR, but T cell cytotoxicity assays demonstrated no detectable killing of a range of neuroblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 14), probably because of the modest binding affinity and/or low levels of antigen density expressed on the tumour cells. Although there is still considerable room for improvement in affinity, this demonstrates the ability of structure-based antibody design, paired with appropriate library assembly methods, to design specific binders to challenging and clinically important target epitopes.

To evaluate the accuracy of de novo scFv design, we determined the cryo-EM structures of two combinatorially assembled scFvs, scFv5 and scFv6, both targeting the Frizzled epitope of TcdB. Cryo-EM analysis confirmed that both scFvs bound the Frizzled epitope as designed (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 9). High-resolution two-dimensional class averages of scFv6 revealed clear density for both TcdB and the bound scFv, further supported by a 3.6 Å three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9). The resolved structure showed that scFv6 engaged the Frizzled epitope along its DRBD domain with the predicted binding orientation (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Methods Table 10). Superposition of the cryo-EM structure with the design model demonstrated remarkable agreement, with both heavy and light chains interacting with the epitope as intended (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 16a,b). The overall fold closely matched the design, a composite model of the two chains originating from distinct but structurally similar designs (RMSD = 0.9 Å), and each of the six CDRs exhibited near-atomic precision (backbone RMSDs: CDRH1 = 0.4 Å, CDRH2 = 0.3 Å, CDRH3 = 0.7 Å, CDRL1 = 0.2 Å, CDRL2 = 1.1 Å and CDRL3 = 0.2 Å; Fig. 5e,f). This agreement extended to the rotameric conformations of CDR side chains and their interactions with the Frizzled epitope, underscoring the accuracy of RFdiffusion in designing de novo scFv–target interactions (Fig. 5g).

This approach demonstrates that the predicted design closely matches the experimentally determined complex in structure, epitope targeting and overall conformation. In models, yellow denotes TcdB; navy indicates the variable heavy-chain fragment (cryo-EM); pink shows the variable light-chain fragment (cryo-EM); and grey denotes the computational design prediction.

scFv5 was designed to bind to the same epitope but with a distinct approach angle relative to scFv6 (Fig. 4b,c). A 6.1 Å cryo-EM reconstruction confirmed scFv5 binding to the TcdB Frizzled epitope, with two-dimensional class averages showing clear density for the complex (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. 15). Rigid-body docking of the design model into the cryo-EM density revealed close agreement between the predicted-binding and experimentally determined-binding modes (Fig. 5i,j).

Although our results demonstrate that the de novo design of antibodies is possible, the experimental success rates remain low. A key contributor to previous successes in de novo binder design was improved filters (primarily AlphaFold2 (ref. 19), which enriched for experimental success in the subset of designs that are tested experimentally2,22. At the outset of this study, we sought to build such a filter by fine-tuning RoseTTAFold2 (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3), but the filtering power of this model is limited (at least with the settings used; providing 100% of interface ‘hotspots'). This probably accounts for the low experimental success rates and the inaccurate SARS-CoV-2 design, where the overall fold and epitope targeting were correct, but the binding orientation was not.

Subsequent to the design work in this study, AlphaFold3 (ref. 24) was released and has improved antibody structure prediction accuracy24,38, both with24,38 and without38 antigen present. Retrospectively, we can assess how filtering with AlphaFold3 would have improved experimental success rates. First, AlphaFold3 accurately predicts the experimentally validated structure of the inaccurately designed SARS-CoV-2 VHH (Supplementary Fig. 9). Had AlphaFold3 been used as an initial filter, this design would have been rejected due to the discrepancy between the predicted and intended structures, thereby preventing its experimental testing. Second, we predicted the structures of the SARS-CoV-2, influenza haemagglutinin, TcdB and IL-7Rα VHH designs using AlphaFold3 with a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and templates for the target and only a template for the VHH (as CDRs are de novo, we reasoned the MSA would be of limited utility). We analysed the predictions for libraries with at least one structurally validated VHH (TcdB, influenza haemagglutinin and SARS-CoV-2). These results are dominated by anti-haemagglutinin VHHs as the majority of successful binders came from this library. We found that the AlphaFold3 interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) score, a measure of model confidence over the interface, is predictive of binding success (area under the curve = 0.86; Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Overall, only 9% of our ordered VHH designs have an ipTM > 0.6, suggesting that success rate will be improved by incorporation of an ipTM filter. We ran a similar analysis for the combinatorially assembled scFv libraries; we predicted the structures of the parental scFv designs (before combinatorial assembly) and the experimentally confirmed scFv designs (combinatorially assembled) using AlphaFold3 with an MSA for the target sequence and templates for the target as well as the heavy and light chains, taking the maximum ipTM score over 10 seeds. We found that successful designs cluster to higher AlphaFold3 ipTM scores than the parental designs (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Only 4% of the initial design library has ipTM > 0.85, whereas 5 out of the 6 experimentally confirmed designs pass this threshold, again suggesting that filtering by AlphaFold3 ipTM should increase success rates (Extended Data Fig. 10d).

Our results demonstrate that de novo design of antibody domains targeting specific epitopes on a target is possible. The cryo-EM structural data for the designed VHHs to influenza haemagglutinin and TcdB reveals very close agreement to the computational design models, showing that our approach can design VHH complexes with atomic accuracy—including the highly variable H3 loop and the overall binding orientation—that are highly dissimilar from any known structures in the PDB. Moreover, cryo-EM structural data of designed scFvs bound to TcdB demonstrate the ability of RFdiffusion to design two-chain scFvs accurately. To our knowledge, these are the first structurally validated cases of de novo-designed antibodies.

Our computational method synergizes with experimental screening approaches developed for retrieving antibodies from large random libraries in several ways. First, yeast display selection methods widely used for antibody library screening enable the retrieval of the highest affinity binders among large sets of designs, which is currently necessary due to the quite low design success rate. Second, screening combinatorial libraries that mix heavy and light chains from designs with similar binding modes allows for the identification of scFvs composed of structurally compatible chains targeting specific epitopes, as demonstrated here for TcdB and PHOX2B–peptide MHC. Third, affinity maturation using OrthoRep3 improves the measured affinity of initial VHH designs down to the single-digit nanomolar or subnanomolar range, while preserving the original designed-binding mode. From a practical standpoint, the key advance of this work is not the ability to generate VHHs and scFvs against a target—something often achievable through purely experimental methods—but rather the ability to accurately target specific binding epitopes. The epitope specificity is critical for therapeutic applications such as antagonists that block receptor–ligand interactions, antibodies that avoid competing with endogenous molecules, modulators that induce conformational changes to trigger signalling, or antibodies targeting conserved or evolutionarily restricted viral epitopes.

There remains considerable room for improvement. For the backbone design step, incorporating recent architectural improvements39 and new advances in generative modelling40,41,42 may yield design models with higher designability and diversity. RoseTTAFold2 and RFdiffusion have also recently been extended to model all biomolecules (rather than just proteins)43, and incorporating this capability into the antibody design RFdiffusion variant should permit the accurate design of antibodies to epitopes containing non-protein atoms, such as glycans. ProteinMPNN was not modified in this current work, but designing sequences that more closely match human CDR sequences would be expected to reduce the potential immunogenicity of designed antibodies44,45. Indeed, designed sequences are currently somewhat less human (as assessed by an OASis score46) than therapeutic antibody CDRs (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Further improvements in antibody structure prediction methods should allow faster optimization of upstream design methods and improve experimental success rates.

Ultimately, computational de novo design of antibodies using our RFdiffusion and related approaches47 could revolutionize antibody discovery and development. As the method improves and success rates increase, it has the potential to be faster and more cost-effective than immunizing animals or screening random libraries. A structure-based approach to antibody design should also aid the optimization of key pharmaceutical properties, such as aggregation, solubility and expression levels (all major challenges in antibody development) in a structure-informed manner. Together, we expect that computational design of antibodies will increase the number of tractable clinical targets and diseases accessible to antibody therapeutics.

A) Designed VHH sequences are distinct from the training dataset. Blastp49 was used to find hits against the SAbDab50, and the similarity of the CDR loops in the top blast hit were reported for all VHHs experimentally tested in this study. Note also that the 28 VHHs confirmed to bind their targets by SPR do not show enhanced similarity to the training set (red lines). B-I) Designed VHH are structurally distinct from immunoglobulins binding (when existent) to the epitopes used in this study. For each of the highest affinity VHHs identified for each target, and the structurally characterized influenza HA VHH, the closest complex in the PDB is shown. Designed VHHs (pink) are shown in complex with their designed target (teal and tan). The closest complex was identified visually (Methods). B) Designed TcdB VHH aligned against 3 VHHs from PDB ID: 6OQ5 (shades of blue). The designed TcdB VHH binds to a site for which no antibody or VHH structure exists in the PDB. C) Designed RSV Site III VHH aligned against VHH from PDB ID: 5TOJ (blue). D) Highest affinity designed influenza HA VHH aligned against Fv from PDB ID: 8DIU (shades of blue). E) Highest affinity designed influenza HA VHH aligned against VHH from PDB ID: 6FYT (blue). F) Structurally characterized (cryoEM) designed influenza HA VHH aligned against Fv from PDB ID: 8DIU (shades of blue). G) Structurally characterized (cryoEM) designed influenza HA VHH aligned against VHH from PDB ID: 6FYT (blue). H) Designed SARS-CoV-2 VHH aligned against VHH from PDB ID: 8Q94 (blue). I) Designed SARS-CoV-2 VHH aligned against FAb from PDB ID: 7FCP (shades of blue).

A-B) Cherry-picked example of RoseTTAFold2 correctly distinguishing a “true” from a “decoy” complex. The sequence of antibody 7Y1B was provided either with the correct (PDB ID: 7Y1B) or decoy (PDB ID: 8CAF) target. Both with 100% (A) or 10% (B) of “hotspots” provided, RF2 near-perfectly predicts binding (top row) or non-binding (bottom row). C) Fine-tuned RoseTTAFold2 reliably predicts its own accuracy. Correlation between RF2 predicted aligned error (pAE) and RMSD to the native structure with 100% (top) or 10% (bottom) of “hotspot” residues provided. With mean pAE <10, 80.3% of structures are within 2 Å when 100% of “hotspots” are provided (along with the holo target structure), with this falling to 52.6% when only 10% of hotspots are provided. D) Quantification of the fine-tuned RF2's ability to distinguish true targets from decoy targets with both pAE (top row) and pBind (bottom row). Note that this ability depends on the proportion of “hotspots” provided. Without any “hotspots” provided, RF2 is hardly predictive, because RF2 without privileged information is quite rarely confident or accurate in its antibody complex predictions. E-F) Fine-tuned RoseTTAFold is also performant at antibody monomer prediction. 86 antibodies released after the RF2, AlphaFold and IgFold training dataset date cutoff (January 13th, 2023) that share <30% target sequence similarity to any antibody complex released prior to this date were predicted as monomers with either fine-tuned RF2, IgFold, AF2 and AF3. E) The median Fv quality prediction (by overall RMSD) of fine-tuned RF2, of (PDB ID: 8GPG), with (right) and without (left) sidechains shown (gray: native; colors: prediction). While the backbone RMSD is close to the true structure, some sidechains are incorrectly positioned. F) Fine-tuned RF2 slightly outperforms IgFold at prediction accuracy. Overall prediction accuracy is slightly improved in fine-tuned RF2 vs IgFold (p = 0.026, Student's Paired T-test), with greater improvements in CDR H3 prediction accuracy (p = 0.0003, Student's Paired T-test).

A-C: VHH Design. A) Comparison of RF2 pAE and RMSD of the prediction to the design model. A significant fraction of designs are re-predicted by RF2 (given 100% of “hotspots”), and pAE correlates well with accuracy to the design model. B) RF2 can be used to assess quality of designed VHHs. Providing the VHH sequence with the true target structure (used during design) leads to higher rates of high-confidence predictions than predicting the same sequence with a decoy structure (not used in design), as assessed by the fraction of predictions with pAE <10 (normalized to the fraction of predictions with pAE <10 for that target with its “correct” VHH partners). In these experiments, the true or decoy target was provided along with 100% of hotspot residues, with those hotspot residues derived from the target with its “true” designed VHH bound. C) Orthogonal assessment of designed VHHs with Rosetta demonstrates that the interfaces of RF2-approved (RMSD < 2 Å to design model, pAE <10) VHH designs have estimated binding energy (ddG) only slightly less favourable than native VHH (left) and slightly higher spatial aggregation propensity (SAP) score as compared to natives (right). D-F: scFv design. D) RFdiffusion was used to generate scFv designs using the framework from Herceptin (hu4D5-8), which has been used to make scFvs previously51. Five targets were chosen (IL10 Receptor-α, TLR4, β-lactamase, TcdB and SARS-CoV-2 (omicron) RBD (PDB IDs: 6X93, 4G8A, 4ZAM, 7ML7, 7WPC). Shown are two examples with close agreement between the design model and the fine-tuned RF2 prediction (RMSD (Å): 0.60, 0.43; pAE: 4.73, 3.52). Gray: designs, Pink: RF2 prediction. E) Top: Against the same four targets to which VHHs were successfully designed, fine-tuned RF2 also predicts good specificity of designed scFvs to the designed target vs decoy targets. Bottom: against the set of five aforementioned targets, fine-tuned RF2 similarly predicts high scFv specificity to the designed target vs decoy targets. F) Orthogonal assessment of designed scFvs with Rosetta demonstrates that the interfaces of RF2-approved (RMSD < 2 Å to design model, pAE <10) scFv designs have low ddG (top; only slightly worse than native Fabs) and lower spatial aggregation propensity (SAP) score as compared to natives (bottom).

A) TcdB VHH binds to the correct epitope. The average response during VHH injection normalized to the response immediately preceding VHH injection for TcdB VHH competition with minibinder fzd48. When the minibinder is injected prior to the VHH (middle bar), the VHH no longer binds, confirming competition with the minibinder. B) TcdB VHH is specific. No binding is observed to the closely related Clostridium sordellii TcsL toxin, indicating that it is binding through specific interactions. C) SARS-CoV-2 RBD VHH competition with the minibinder AHB2. As in (A), when minibinder is injected prior to the VHH injection (middle bar) no response is observed. When the VHH is injected without a preceding minibinder injection (right bar), the VHH binds as expected. (A) and (C) are the quantification from the rightmost panels of Fig. 2a,b. D) Brightfield microscopy of Vero CSPG4 KO cells treated with vehicle, TcdB alone or TcdB + VHH after 24 h. E) Neutralization of TcdB by VHH_TcdB_H2 in CSPG4 KO Vero cells. Cell viability is measured after 48 h. Points indicate the mean and error bars are the standard deviation across two independent replicates.

B) 2D Class averages of Influenza H1+designed VHH with clearly defined secondary structure elements and a full-sampling of particle view angles. C) Cryo-EM local resolution map calculated using an FSC value of 0.143 viewed along two different angles.

Structure-based design permits the rational combinatorial assembly of heavy and light chains, assembling only heavy and light chains from structurally similar pairs. A) Fine-tuned RoseTTAFold (left), and AlphaFold3 (right) validate that pairing heavy and light chains from structurally similar (i.e. high pairwise TM score) designs yields scFvs that are more likely to be predicted to bind with high confidence (RF2 pBind, left; AF3 ipTM, right) than heavy and light chains from structurally-dissimilar (low pairwise TM score) designs. Note that the extremely high pBind distribution of the “designed pairings” (rightmost bar of left plot) is an artifact of those designs being specifically filtered for high pBind scores prior to the library being ordered. B-C) combinatorial assembly leads to dramatically larger library sizes. Plots show the number of clusters (pink) at different TM score similarity thresholds for TcdB (left) and Phox2b (right) scFvs. For the amplification strategy to work, each “cluster” becomes a PCR subpool, requiring independent PCR reactions (3 per subpool). Hence, we limit ourselves to large subpools (>= 100 designs), which maximizes the combinatorial amplification for the amount of additional library assembly work. We additionally plot the theoretical library size for each target (blue), calculated as number_of_clusters x cluster_size2. Gray lines indicate the TM threshold chosen for library assembly, where library sizes approximately match the transformation efficiency of yeast (107)52.

A-C: TcdB-binding scFvs. A) (left) Results of flow cytometry of yeast samples displaying scFv4-C-Myc construct. Each sample was treated with a titration of soluble biotinylated TcdB fragment (1285-1804) (bn-TcdB) concentrations and visualized with anti-C-Myc FITC + SAPE. (right) Percentage of expressing cells which are within the gate increase with bn-TcdB concentration. B) scFvs were designed to bind to the Frizzled epitope and therefore should compete with Frizzled-7. Designed scFvs should not compete with CSPG4, which binds at a different epitope on full-length TcdB. C) Yeast displaying scFv4-C-Myc were incubated with 1 nM TcdB and either no competitor, 100 nM Frizzled-7, or 100 nM CSPG4. Binding signal specifically decreases when Frizzled-7 is added, supporting that scFv4 binds at the Frizzled-7 epitope. Binding signal does not significantly decrease when CSPG4 is added.

The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical driver of prostate cancer (PCa). Here, to study regulators of AR protein levels and oncogenic activity, we developed a live-cell quantitative endogenous AR fluorescent reporter. Leveraging this AR reporter, we performed genome-scale CRISPRi flow cytometry sorting screens to systematically identify genes that modulate AR protein levels. We identified and validated known AR protein regulators, including HOXB13 and GATA2, and also unexpected top hits including PTGES3—a poorly characterized gene in PCa. PTGES3 repression resulted in loss of AR protein, cell-cycle arrest and cell death in AR-driven PCa models. Clinically, analysis of PCa data demonstrates that PTGES3 expression is associated with AR-directed therapy resistance. Mechanistically, we show PTGES3 binds directly to AR, regulates AR protein stability and is necessary for AR function in the nucleus at AR target genes. PTGES3 represents a potential therapeutic target for overcoming known mechanisms of resistance to existing AR-directed therapies in PCa.

The androgen receptor (AR) is a central driver of tumorigenesis and disease progression in prostate cancer (PCa)1,2. Most PCas express AR throughout the course of the disease2,3,4,5, and AR has been shown to promote transcriptional programs governing critical oncogenic phenotypes, such as proliferation, migration and invasion6. Moreover, many key genes that drive PCa, such as FOXA1 or HOXB13 (refs. 7,8), promote tumor progression by regulating how AR binds to or activates its target genes. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of AR biology in this disease.

Multiple phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of AR-targeted therapies on patient survival9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. AR signaling inhibitors (ARSI) are now the standard of care for locally advanced12, recurrent13, nonmetastatic castration-resistant9,17,18, metastatic castration-sensitive14,15,16 and metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC)10,11. However, aggressive PCa frequently escapes these therapies by reactivating AR signaling19. Recent analyses of clinical samples have demonstrated that the vast majority of mCRPC samples from patients resistant to ARSI agents abiraterone and enzalutamide exhibit robust AR/nuclear AR staining20,21. Therefore, identifying new approaches to target AR is critical to improving survival outcomes for patients with AR-driven mCRPC.

We and other groups have identified tumor alterations that reactivate AR signaling during treatment with an ARSI2,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29. These mechanisms of resistance include AR gene amplification22,23, AR enhancer amplification2,24,25, AR mutation26, AR genomic structural rearrangements27, AR splice variants28 and polymorphisms in androgen metabolism genes29. These alterations invariably result in increased expression or increased activity of the AR protein. Thus, strategies for reducing AR protein levels and AR activity represent a promising approach to overcoming known mechanisms of resistance in ARSI-therapy-resistant AR-driven mCRPC. To identify such strategies, we sought to systematically and quantitatively identify genes that regulate AR protein levels with the goal of identifying next-generation AR-targeting strategies for patients with aggressive AR-driven PCa.

Accurate reporters of AR activity in PCa cells are essential to developing the next generation of therapeutic approaches that target AR. Existing methods that fuse a full-length fluorescent reporter protein to an endogenous or exogenously overexpressed target protein can affect target function, and are not ideal reporters30,31. We previously developed a split fluorescent protein tagging strategy, enabling us to visualize and measure the expression of endogenous genes without antibodies32. This approach has advantages, including reduced perturbation to the genomic locus and the protein–protein interactions of the target compared to traditional methods32,33,34. We set out to establish PCa cell line models expressing an endogenous AR split fluorescent reporter fusion protein. To tag AR endogenously, we utilized a two-component split fluorescent protein tagging strategy that breaks the sequence of the monomeric NeonGreen (mNG2) protein between the 10th and the 11th β-strand into two parts: mNG2_1-10 and mNG2_11, with mNG2_11 being a short, 16-amino-acid peptide. Fluorescence arises only when the two protein fragments noncovalently bind, creating a fluorescent protein capable of serving as an endogenous reporter if knocked into the genome in frame to a human gene. We knocked mNG2_11 into the 5' protein coding exon of AR, in the C42B cell model of aggressive PCa, creating an N-terminally tagged mNG2_11-AR fusion gene. We then stably expressed mNG2_1-10 in trans using a lentivirus and observed mNG2_1-10 complexes with mNG2_11-AR protein resulting in a bright fluorescent AR protein complex (Fig. 1a–d and Extended Data Fig. 1). We characterized multiple knock-in AR reporter clones (C42BmNG2-AR) by extensive genotypic and phenotypic approaches to confirm that tagged AR expression and stability as well as AR biological activity were unperturbed (Fig. 1c–i and Extended Data Fig. 1). Our approach allows us to measure endogenously expressed AR protein rapidly and quantitatively in live or fixed PCa cells, which should enable robust characterization of genetic or chemical perturbations that increase or decrease AR protein levels and localization.

a, Diagram of the self-assembling split mNG2 fluorescence protein AR tagging approach. A DNA sequence encoding 16-amino-acid 11th β-strand of the fluorescent protein NeonGreen (mNG2_11) is knocked into the N terminus of AR by cotransfection of a homology-directed repair DNA donor and Cas9 RNPs targeting the AR locus. When the remainder of mNG2 (mNG2_1-10) is expressed in trans in the same cell, it binds noncovalently to mNG2_11, producing a fluorescent mNG2-AR protein complex. b, mNG2 IP followed by western blotting for AR shows formation of mNG2-AR protein complex in mNG2-AR endogenously tagged cells but not in controls. c, C42BmNG2-AR cells were treated with DMSO, 10 nM R1881 (androgen), 10 nM R1881 plus 10 μM Enz (anti-androgen) or 100 nM ARD-61 (AR degrader, PROTAC) for 24 h. Representative confocal microscopic images showed mNG2-AR localization (green). Nuclear fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ. Ten cells per experimental condition were collected from different fields (n = 10; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-test (***P < 0.001). d, C42BmNG2-AR cells were treated with DMSO (CTRL, green), 10 nM R1881 (brighter green) or 100 nM ARD-61 (gray) for 24 h and then mNG2-AR fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. e, C42B and C42BmNG2-AR cells were treated with transcription inhibitor 1 μM actinomycin D for 0 h, 8 h or 16 h. RNA was collected to measure AR mRNA levels using real-time PCR (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.; NS, no significant difference by two-way ANOVA analysis). f, C42B and C42BmNG2-AR cells were treated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 5 μM) with or without proteasome inhibitor 5 μM MG132 for 0 h, 12 h or 24 h. AR protein levels were detected by western blotting. g, C42B and C42BmNG2-AR cells were transfected with androgen response element (ARE)-Luc to enable measurement of AR transcriptional activity. Cells were then treated with DMSO (gray) or 10 nM R1881 (green). ARE-Luc over Renilla was normalized by control (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-test (**P < 0.01). h, C42B and C42BmNG2-AR cells were fixed by formaldehyde. ChIP experiments were performed using an IgG (gray) or AR antibody (green). Precipitated DNA fragments were used as templates to amplify the PSA enhancer and TMPRSS2 promoter by real-time PCR (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-test (***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01). i, Total RNA from C42B and C42BmNG2-AR cells were collected for RNA-seq. Gene expression values were calculated as ln(TPM + 0.1). Pearson correlation was calculated comparing AR pathway genes57 (n = 22) between the two cell lines. Panel a created with BioRender.com.

We next set out to use our C42BmNG2-AR cell lines to identify genes that regulate AR protein abundance. We first stably expressed a dCas9-KRAB fusion CRISPRi construct in C42BmNG2-AR cells. Control experiments targeting TP53 and AR demonstrated CRISPRi gene silencing activity (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). We next performed genome-scale CRISPRi screens in two C42BmNG2-AR clonal cell lines using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to identify genes whose repression would decrease or increase AR protein levels (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2d). Genome-scale pooled genetic screens were performed by transducing C42BmNG2-AR stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (C42BimNG2-AR) with a genome-scale CRISPRi library35. Samples were collected, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and then sorted to isolate cells in the top and bottom quartile of AR fluorescent signal. We extracted genomic DNA and amplified the sgRNAs present and quantified sgRNA abundance in each sample by quantitative sequencing to identify genes that regulate AR levels. We confirmed that our screening strategy could robustly capture phenotypes induced by repression of genes such as AR or other commonly essential genes that induce strong growth phenotypes when repressed using timecourse fluorescent competition growth assays and by analysis of the abundance of commonly essential and nonessential single-guide RNA (sgRNA) in our CRISPRi genome-scale screening data (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). We chose to focus solely on genes required for maintenance of AR levels, as such genes, if targetable, would be therapeutically relevant to PCa therapy. As expected, sgRNAs targeting AR were enriched strongly in the low AR screen sample, meaning that repression of AR resulted in the greatest decrease in AR protein levels. We also identified other known AR regulators including HOXB13, GRHL2 and GATA2 as top hits suggesting our screen robustly identifies genes required for AR protein abundance (Fig. 2b). Top hits required for AR abundance include genes involved in chromatin transcription, RNA transportation, transcription factor and post-translation regulation, indicating that numerous biological processes influence AR protein levels. Top gene hits included protein complexes such as PAF and proteins such as HOXB13 and GATA2 known to interact directly or indirectly with AR36 (Fig. 2c). Among them, FKBP4, PTGES3, UBE2I, HOXB13 and GATA2 showed evidence for physical subnetwork interactions with AR37. Several genes known to be regulated transcriptionally by AR were identified as hit genes, suggesting AR protein levels may be regulated by AR target genes, as has been demonstrated previously for select examples such as FKBP438.

Negative controls are shown in orange. A comparable number of negative control (NC) genes were generated by randomly sampling five nontargeting sgRNAs (with replacement) and analyzed as true genes (n = ~19,000). Empirically derived thresholds (log10 P × phenotype z ≥ 13; dashed lines) were calculated as shown, using the NC gene distribution to derive the background s.d. for z-scoring. Only a limited number of hits were labeled due to the size of the plot. c, A plot showing top positive AR regulator hit (n = 51) protein interaction networks analyzed by STRING. Proteins without protein interactions among any of the top 51 hits were removed. Lines between the proteins indicate a confident interaction. Line thickness indicates the strength of data support. Proteins were also unsupervised clustered, indicated by their color. d, C42BimNG2-AR were infected with sgRNA targeting control or indicated hit genes. After puromycin selection, median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of mNG2-AR fluorescence from the treated cells was measured by flow cytometry. The percentage of AR protein abundance was calculated as AR protein abundance % = (MFIsg Individual gene − MFIC42B)/(MFIsgCTRL − MFIC42B) × 100 + 100 (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-test (***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; NS, not significant). e, C42Bi cells were infected with indicated individual sgRNAs targeting hit genes.

Cell lysates were collected. AR and GAPDH levels were detected by western blotting. Panel a and the STRING plot in c created with BioRender.com.

We validated individual top hit genes including ARID1A, GATA2, GRHL2, HOXB13, PTGES3, FKBP4, SAE1, PAF1, MAP3K19 and CSNK2A1 in two C42BimNG2-AR clonal cell lines demonstrating our screen results were reproducible and identified genes that modulate AR levels (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). As a control we confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) that CRISPRi knockdown of top hits decreased the mRNA expression of each targeted hit gene as expected (Extended Data Fig. 3b). To extend our results beyond the C42BimNG2-AR model, we confirmed repression of top hits identified in the screen decreased AR protein levels in parental C42B and LNCaP cells expressing dCas9-KRAB (hereafter C42Bi and LNCaPi), demonstrating the tagged mNG2-AR protein and unmodified AR protein are regulated by the same genes and further confirming the mNG2-AR model as a robust tool for studying AR biology (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). We also validated our screen results using orthogonal genetic and chemical strategies, (ARD-61 for AR, ML-792 for SAE1, siPTGES3 for PTGES3 and CX-4945 for CSNK2A1). In each case, perturbation of candidate genes reduced AR protein levels (Fig. 2f). Our results demonstrate genome-scale fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based CRISPRi screens utilizing the C42BmNG2-AR model robustly identified both known and unexpected genes that regulate AR levels.

We were intrigued by the identification of PTGES3 as a top regulator of AR levels. Using unbiased whole cell mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis, we demonstrated significant downregulation of AR protein upon PTGES3 knockdown, which confirms our western blotting results (Fig. 3a). We also observed downregulation of transcripts and proteins whose expression is associated with AR activity upon PTGES3 knockdown (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Repression of PTGES3 did not alter AR mRNA levels as measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or RT–qPCR, suggesting that PTGES3 regulates AR protein translation or protein stability (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4d). Knockdown of PTGES3 does not alter the mRNA or protein half-life of AR (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). PTGES3 knockdown also decreased levels of AR protein in additional cell models of aggressive mCRPC including 22RV1 cells, AR gene amplified VCaP and ARSI (enzalutamide) resistant MR49F cells (Fig. 3c). PTGES3 knockdown also decreased levels of AR splice variant 7 (V7) in 22RV1 cells that express high levels of both full length and V7 AR protein (Extended Data Fig. 4g). We observed that PTGES3 knockdown increases apoptotic cell populations and induces the expression of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3d,e). Collectively, these in vitro preclinical PCa models represent common clinically relevant AR statuses and our data lead us to speculate that a PTGES3 inhibitor could inhibit AR function in diverse high-risk AR-driven mCRPC clinical scenarios.

Having established that PTGES3 regulates AR levels in a variety of aggressive AR-dependent mCRPC cell models, we set out to decipher the mechanism by which PTGES3 supports AR protein levels and thus promotes AR signaling. In the absence of androgen ligands, AR protein is bound by protein chaperones such as HSP90 and localized in the cytosol39. Upon androgen stimulation, AR translocates into the nucleus, binds to genomic androgen response elements and modulates gene expression of target genes40. As PTGES3 potentially regulates AR in a post-translational manner, we were interested in the protein function as well the localization of PTGES3. PTGES3 protein is reported to have several protein functions and to be localized to both the cytosol and nucleus41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49 (Fig. 3f). PTGES3 is reported to have a cytosolic HSP90-dependent protein chaperone function for steroid nuclear receptors, but its activity in PCa is poorly characterized41,43,44,45,46. PTGES3 is also reported to be a cytosolic prostaglandin synthase that converts Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)47; of note, other prostaglandin synthases in the same family as PTGES3 have been implicated in the production of androgens48,49. The proposed PGE2 enzymatic site is at the N terminus of the protein whereas the proposed HSP90 interaction motif is at the C terminus of the protein41,47.

To investigate the mechanism by which PTGES3 regulates AR, we confirmed that repression of PTGES3 or known co-chaperones of cytosolic AR, HSP90 or FKBP4, resulted in decreased AR protein levels as expected (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Repression of PTGES3 but not PTGES or PTGES2 reduced total AR protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). To dissect which of the two proposed PTGES3 protein functions regulates AR levels, we constructed lentiviral doxycycline-inducible TET-ON C-terminal flag-tagged constructs expressing wildtype PTGES3 (WT), PTGES3 with a proposed PGE2 enzyme activity disrupting mutation47 (Y9N) and PTGES3 with a HSP90 interaction site mutation (W106A) (Fig. 3g). We transduced LNCaP (TET-ON PTGES3) with these constructs and created isogenic stable cell lines that overexpressed PTGES3 or PTGES3 mutant proteins upon addition of doxycycline (Doxy) (Fig. 3g). We performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) western blotting experiments on each PTGES3 construct and confirmed that the PTGES3 W106A mutation but not the Y9N mutation abrogates the interaction between PTGES3 and HSP90, indicating that the Y9 site might not interact with HSP90 and that the Y9 site could be critical for HSP90 independent function of PTGES3 (Fig. 3h). To test which of these PTGES3 mutations modulates endogenous AR levels, we knocked down endogenous PTGES3 in LNCaPi and then inducibly overexpressed the PTGES3 WT or W106A or Y9N mutant proteins. As expected, we observed that expression of wildtype PTGES3 rescued AR protein levels. Expression of either the Y9N or W106A mutant PTGES3 protein failed to rescue AR protein levels, suggesting that both sites/functions are required to maintain AR (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we observed that loss of AR following PTGES3 knockdown is not rescued by inhibition of either the ubiquitin-proteasome or the lysosomal degradation pathway and is not fully restored in the presence of androgen or enzalutamide (Extended Data Fig. 5e–g).

PTGES3 has also been reported to localize to the nucleus and previous publications showed nuclear PTGES3 is a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) co-factor that modulates GR activity in the nucleus at GR response elements44,45. We set out to evaluate whether PTGES3 is localized to the nucleus in PCa tumors. We measured PTGES3 localization by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a validated PTGES3 antibody on a tissue microarray containing 120 PCa tumor biopsies. PTGES3 was present at both cytosolic and nuclear locations with increased PTGES3 protein expression in more advanced/aggressive PCa tumors (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Integrated analysis of PTGES3 localization with clinical outcomes data demonstrated patients with a high nuclear PTGES3 score had worse prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-recurrent free survival, demonstrating that nuclear PTGES3 protein levels are correlated with a more aggressive PCa phenotype (hazard ratio = 2.655, P log-rank = 0.0014; Fig. 4a).

Source data

We further measured PTGES3 localization in the cytoplasm, membrane and nuclear compartment of LNCaP cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PTGES3 was localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus of LNCaP cells (Fig. 4b). As expected, AR was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus whereas HSP90 was localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6b). To investigate whether PTGES3 modulates AR in the nucleus, we first tested whether PTGES3 interacts with AR in the nucleus by co-IP western. Our results demonstrated that PTGES3 interacts physically with AR in the nucleus (Fig. 4c). We then demonstrated by proximity ligation assay that PTGES3 and AR interact in the nucleus of cells (Fig. 4d). AR is composed of an unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD) and central DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (Fig. 4e). To determine which region of AR binds to PTGES3, we expressed domain mutant AR transgenes in cells and then measured the PTGES3/AR interaction by co-IP western blot. We observed that PTGES3 interaction with AR depends on the DBD and LBD (Fig. 4e).

To determine whether AR and PTGES3 directly interact, we performed biochemical reconstitution using recombinant PTGES3 and AR (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). As we determined that the AR NTD is not implicated in the AR–PTGES3 interaction (Fig. 4e) and because the NTD has been shown to be dispensable for dimerization and DNA binding50,51, we assayed AR variants lacking this disordered domain (ARΔNTD and ARDBD). We first demonstrated that PTGES3 and ARΔNTD directly interact by mass photometry (Fig. 4f,g), which is supported by structural modeling of cytosolic complexes where PTGES3 is predicted to interact with the AR LBD in the absence and presence of the chaperone HSP90 (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 7c). As we observed PTGES3-AR interactions in the nucleus (Fig. 4c,d), we next queried whether PTGES3 alters the ability of AR to interact with DNA. We measured that PTGES3 promoted the ability of AR to bind double-stranded DNA bearing androgen response element (ARE) sequences, despite PTGES3 having no intrinsic DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 7d–f). PTGES3 addition appears to chaperone DNA binding of AR, restricting formation of heterogenous complexes50 as observed by mass photometry (Fig. 4j). Productive PTGES3 interaction with DNA-bound AR is supported by structural modeling, where PTGES3 does not clash with known AR allosteric or DNA-binding interactions, and is wedged between both the AR LBD and DBD, seemingly reinforcing these contacts (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 7i). In support of these structural models, we demonstrated that PTGES3 can also augment DNA binding of the AR DBD (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h), consistent with our observation that PTGES3 promotes stabilization of AR splice variant 7 (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PTGES3 and AR interact in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in cells, and that these interactions can be reconstituted in vitro and shown to alter the ability of AR to bind ARE DNA.

We next wanted to test whether PTGES3 promotes AR transcriptional activity and binding to DNA containing AREs in cells. Overexpression of PTGES3 increased AR activity significantly as measured by an ARE–luciferase transcriptional response reporter activity assay, further supporting the hypothesis that PTGES3 expression promotes AR activity (Fig. 5a). We observed repression of PTGES3 does not perturb the abundance of p300, KAT2A or FOXA1, which are transcriptional regulators of AR activity (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Consistent with a previous report44, among the transcriptional regulators p300, KAT2A and FOXA1, nuclear PTGES3 interacts with histone acetyltransferase KAT2A by co-IP western (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Knocking down KAT2A inhibited the enhanced AR activity observed upon overexpression of PTGES3 (Extended Data Fig. 8c). This evidence demonstrates that PTGES3 potentially facilitates interactions with AR and transcriptional machinery in the nucleus.

a, LNCaP cells containing ARE–luciferase reporter were transfected with pCDH-control vector (gray) or pCDH-PTGES3 (blue). Cells were treated with DMSO, 1 nM DHT or 1 nM DHT plus 5 μM apalutamide (APA). Luciferase activities over Renilla were normalized with control (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-test (DMSO group *P = 0.0435; DHT group ***P = 0.0002; DHT + APA group **P = 0.0040). b, LNCaP cells were fixed sequentially by EGS and formaldehyde. Dual crosslinking ChIP experiments were performed using indicated antibodies. Precipitated DNA was used as a template to amplify the indicated genomic regions by real-time PCR (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided t-test (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; NS, not significant). c, Venn diagram showing overlaps of AR ChIP–seq peaks in LNCaP(sgCTRL) and LNCaP(sgPTGES3). d, Peak distribution of ChIP-AR peaks in LNCaP(sgCTRL) and LNCaP(sgPTGES3) across different genomic locations. e, ChIP-AR read-density heatmaps of LNCaP(sgCTRL) and LNCaP(sgPTGES3) centered at combined ChIP-AR peaks (n = 38,122). f, The five most enriched known HOMER motifs in the top 2,000 significant ChIP-AR peaks in LNCaP(sgCTRL) and LNCaP(sgPTGES3). g, An IGV screenshot of ChIP-AR enrichment in LNCaP(sgCTRL) and LNCaP(sgPTGES3) at enhancer and promoter sites of KLK3 and KLK2 genes. h, LNCaPi cells were infected with sgCTRL, sgPTGES3 or sgAR. Cells were collected for ATAC-seq (n = 2 as biological replicates). The heatmap shows the differentially accessible ATAC-seq peak regions in sgPTGES3 or sgAR as compared to that in sgCTRL. Each ATAC-seq peak region was scaled to the same size from the start to the end region. Flanking ±500 bp regions are also shown. The top panel shows the corresponding ATAC-seq signal intensity. i, The volcano plot shows the differentially accessible ATAC-seq peak regions upon PTGES3 knockdown as compared to controls. Each dot represents an individual ATAC-seq peak. Differentially accessible ATAC-seq peaks are highlighted in red color (P < 0.05 and log2 Foldchange >1 or <−1). The nearest gene to several representative differentially accessible ATAC-seq peaks have been highlighted. j, A graph depicting the overlap in genomic loci with differentially accessible ATAC-seq peaks upon PTGES3 knockdown that are or are not also bound by AR as measured by ChIP–seq in LNCaP cells52 (Stello2018). The figure shows the percentage of these differentially accessible ATAC-seq peaks that overlapped with the AR ChIP–seq dataset. k, Plots showing ATAC-seq peak coverage in the KLK3 gene body and flanking ±5 kb region. sgCTRL ATAC-seq peaks are colored in blue and sgPTGES3 ATAC-seq peaks in red. The upstream promoter region of KLK3 contains overlapping ATAC-seq peaks and AR Chip–seq peaks52. AR binding motif was identified in this region.

To test the hypothesis that a PTGES3/AR protein complex is localized to canonical endogenous AREs and AR target genes in cells, we assessed PTGES3 genomic localization by indirect protein–DNA interactions by dual crosslinked immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by real-time PCR for DNA sequences of interest (Dual × chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP–seq)). Our results demonstrated that PTGES3 is specifically enriched at AREs that are hallmark AR targets but not in non-AR binding region or control regions (Fig. 5b). We observed that HSP90 is not enriched at hallmark AREs, further supporting the hypothesis that nuclear PTGES3 plays an HSP90-independent role in promoting AR activity (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We next used ChIP–seq to examine AR occupancy across the genome in the presence or absence of PTGES3. We observed loss of AR binding at more than 85% of AR binding sites across the genome upon PTGES3 knockdown, including a near complete loss of AR binding at hallmark AREs such as KLK3 (Fig. 5c–g). Loss of AR binding occurred broadly without trends for specific genomic annotations such as promoters, introns or intergenic regions (Fig. 5d). We observed that AR binding annotations in the presence and absence of PTGES3 were similar suggesting loss of PTGES3 reduces AR binding across the genome but does not induce an unexpected AR cistrome (Fig. 5f). To test whether PTGES3 activity promotes chromatin accessibility and therefore potentially AR binding to regulatory elements, we performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) comparing PTGES3 knockdown or AR knockdown to controls or to each other (Fig. 5h). We observed repression of PTGES3 results in far more loss of open chromatin regions (OCRs) than gain of OCRs, consistent with observations from AR knockdown (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 9a). We also compared the differentially accessible regions observed upon knockdown of AR or PTGES3 to each other. We observed the changes in chromatin accessibility were highly similar, indicating repression of AR and PTGES3 phenocopy each other (Extended Data Fig. 9b). We then mapped the differentially accessible DNA regions to the nearest gene promoter and observed a strong enrichment for genes that are hallmark androgen response genes (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Integration of our ATAC-seq data with AR ChIP–seq data52 demonstrated that more than 80% of the differentially accessible ATAC-seq peaks overlapped with AR ChIP–seq peaks (Fig. 5j). For example, knockdown of PTGES3 significantly reduced the chromatin accessibility at the canonical ARE of the KLK3 promoter (Fig. 5k). These data support the hypothesis that nuclear PTGES3 forms a protein complex with AR that is required for AR protein stability and transcriptional activity in AR-driven PCa. Furthermore, our results suggest PTGES3 biology is distinguished from cytoplasmic AR co-chaperones such as HSP90, as PTGES3 knockdown does not alter expression of HSF1 target genes linked to the HSP90 pathway (Extended Data Fig. 9d), supporting the notion that an anti-cancer strategy targeting PTGES3 will not phenocopy targeting HSP90.

We next asked whether PTGES3 expression is associated with PCa disease progression in mCRPC patient cohorts. We utilized a clinical-grade Affymetrix Human-Exon microarray to determine PTGES3 expression levels in 641 prostatectomy samples from patients with high-risk PCa. When we matched patients by clinicopathologic variables, including Gleason score, PSA, tumor stage and nodal status, we determined that PTGES3 overexpression was associated with significantly worse metastasis-free survival (MFS) in patients who received adjuvant first-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (with leuprolide or an GnRH agonist) after prostatectomy, but not in patients who did not receive adjuvant ADT after prostatectomy (Fig. 6a,b). Furthermore, higher tumor expression of PTGES3 was correlated with worse overall survival in mCRPC patients treated with a first-line AR-targeted therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide or apalutamide) (Extended Data Fig. 10a).

a,b, In a previously established cohort matched for eight clinicopathologic prognostic variables59, high PTGES3 expression was associated with worse MFS in prostatectomy patients who received adjuvant ADT (HR:1.71, log-rank P = 0.0039) (a), but not in prostatectomy patients who did not receive adjuvant ADT (HR:1.24, log-rank P = 0.22) (b). c–h, C42B (c), 22RV1 (d), Enzalutamide (Enz) resistant cell line MR49F cultured with 5 μM Enz (e), VCaP (f), PC3 (g) or DU145 (h) cells were treated with siRNA targeting control (gray) or PTGES3 (blue). Cell viability was measured by WST1 and normalized over control (n = 3 as biological replicates; mean ± s.d.). Statistical significance of siPTGES3-1 versus siControl (compare 1) and siPTGES3-2 versus siControl (compare 2) were determined using two-way ANOVA. In C42B cells (c), 1 **P = 0.0016 and 2 **P = 0.0019; in 22rv1 cells (d), 1 **P = 0.0016 and 2 **P = 0.00196; in MR49F cells (e), 1 **P = 0.0016 and 2 **P = 0.001; in VCaP cells (f), 1 P = 0.0015 and 2 **P = 0.0013; in PC3 cells (g), 1 P = 0.4228 (NS) and 2 P = 0.2013 (NS) and in DU145 cells (h), 1 P = 0.1017 (NS) and 2 P = 0.05265 (NS). i, Mice bearing LNCaP(TET-ON dCas9-KRAB) stably expressing CTRL or PTGES3 sgRNAs were treated with doxycycline when tumors reached ~200 mm3. Average tumor volume was plotted (n = 8; ± s.e.m.) mean and two-way ANOVA was used to measure statistical significance (***P = 0.0002).

Source data

With these clinical biomarker results, we further evaluated PTGES3 as a therapeutic target in several models of aggressive PCa. We knocked down PTGES3 in multiple AR-dependent and AR-independent PCa cell lines and measured cell survival and proliferation. We found PTGES3 is required for cell proliferation in multiple AR-driven PCa models (C42B, 22RV1, VCaP and MR49F cells) but not AR-independent PCa models (PC3 and DU145 cells) (Fig. 6c–h and Extended Data Fig. 10b). Notably, analysis of PTGES3 gene essentiality upon Cas9 knockout across 1,070 diverse cancer cell lines present in the Cancer Dependency Map53 demonstrated that PTGES3 is not classified as a commonly essential gene (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Furthermore, CRISPRi experiments in other cancer cell types (AML, CML, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer cell lines54,55,56) demonstrated that, unlike PSMA1, which is a positive control commonly essential gene, PTGES3 is not an essential gene upon knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 10d–g). To test whether PTGES3 is required for AR-dependent PCa cell growth or survival in vivo, we transduced an inducible CRISPRi LNCaP cell model (TET-ON dCas9-KRAB) with sgRNAs targeting PTGES3 or controls and transplanted cells into mice. At tumor onset we administered doxycycline to the mice to induce PTGES3 repression and tracked tumor size over time. We observed that repression of PTGES3 significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo relative to controls (Fig. 6i). Analysis of AR protein levels in tumors demonstrated PTGES3 repression resulted in decreased AR protein abundance in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 10h). Together, these results demonstrate that PTGES3 is required for AR levels and activity, is conditionally essential in diverse AR-driven PCa models but not in non-AR-driven cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis in PCa patients

We have developed an AR endogenous reporter and used this resource together with genome-scale CRISPRi screens to systematically identify networks of genes that sustain AR protein levels and thus the oncogenic activity of AR in PCa. Our results point to unexpected biological activities that promote AR biology in aggressive PCa. Specifically, we determined that PTGES3 affects AR levels and the activity of AR in the nucleus through a direct interaction with the AR LBD and DBD. Our results reveal that the PTGES3/AR interaction is required for mCRPC cell proliferation and viability in vitro and in vivo, including in models of patients with intrinsic and acquired AR-directed therapy resistance. These findings emphasize the critical role of PTGES3 in the regulation of AR signaling and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target. Future therapeutic strategies targeting PTGES3 could be transformative for treating patients with AR-driven metastatic PCa, especially those resistant to current US Food and Drug Administration-approved ARSIs. By targeting PTGES3, we may be able to overcome the significant challenge of drug resistance, addressing a principal unmet medical need and ultimately improving survival outcomes for patients suffering from this lethal disease.

All experiments detailed in this paper were performed in compliance with the Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of California, San Francisco and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. All animal studies were conducted in compliance with UCSF IACUC guidelines with protocol number AN182067.

Cell lines LNCaP, C42B, 22RV1, VCaP, DU145, PC3 and 293T were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured per ATCC protocols in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) or DMEM (ATCC) with 10% FBS (Gibco) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. MR49F cells were a gift from A. Zoubeidi (Vancouver Prostate Center) and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS containing 10 μM Enzalutamide. Cell line short tandem repeat authentications were conducted (University of California (UC) Berkeley DNA Sequencing facility). All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Enamine, Combi-blocks or Astatech. Enzalutamide and Apalutamide were purchased from Selleckchem. ML-792 was purchased from MedKoo. AR PROTAC degrader ARD-61 was a gift from S. Wang (University of Michigan).

Synthetic sgRNAs (Supplementary Table 1) and Cas9 2NLS nuclease were purchased from Synthego. For the knock-in of mNG2_11, 200-nt homology-directed recombination templates were ordered in single-stranded DNA form as ultramer oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies). C42B cells were treated with 50 ng ml−1 nocodazole (Sigma) for 14 h before electroporation. Cas9–sgRNA RNP complexes were assembled with 100 pmol Cas9 protein and 130 pmol sgRNA before electroporation and combined with 375 pmol homology-directed recombination template and 1 µg pCE-mp53DD (Addgene, cat. no. 41856) in a final volume of 25 µl. Electroporation was carried out following the protocol of SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza, cat. no. V4XC-2024). Nocodazole-treated cells (1 × 106) were collected and resuspended to 75 µl SF solution. RNP/template/pCE-mp53DD mix (25 μl) was then added to cell suspension. Cells were electroporated immediately with 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza) program EN-120 and transferred to a six-well plate with prewarmed medium. Electroporated cells were recovered for 5 days before infection with lentivirus expressing mNG2_1-10 (Addgene, cat. no. 82610). At 72 h after infection, mNG2 fluorescence positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry into single clones. Genomic DNA from AR reporter single clones were extracted for sanger sequencing (MCLab) as well as exome sequencing (QB3 UC Berkeley) to verify the mNG2-11 insertion.

The genome-scale CRISPRi screens were performed following the Weissman laboratory protocol (weissmanlab.ucsf.edu) as we reported previously60. In brief, two individual clones of C42BmNG2-AR cells (clone 1 and clone 2) were infected with a lentivirus encoding the CRISPRi dCas9-BFP-KRAB protein (Addgene, cat. no. 46910). Following infection, CRISPRi BFP+ cells were sorted to purity, expanded and CRISPRi silencing activity was confirmed. These cells which stably express CRISPRi were used for both the genome-scale screens and subsequent experiments58. The genome-scale CRISPRi-V2 library (Addgene cat. no. 1000000091) virus was generated and titered following the large-scale lentivirus production protocol (https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/) (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Approximately 150 million C42BimNG2-AR cells were then infected at 30% infection in duplicate with the CRISPRi-V2 lentiviral library with 8 µg ml−1 polybrene (TR-1003-G), to achieve an average of 500× cells per library sgRNA after transduction. After 3 days, cells were selected using 8 µg ml−1 puromycin (−03) for 3 days and then allowed to recover without puromycin for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and fixed in 3% PFA (5 million cells per 1 ml of PFA solution) at room temperature for 20 min, washed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), quenched by 30 mM glycine/PBS (pH 7.5), washed and resuspended in cold FACS buffer (PBS + 10% FBS) and sorted based on mNG2-AR expression levels on a BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter to collect the 25% highest and 25% lowest cells. Genomic DNA was harvested with the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (cat. no. 56404). A standard genomic DNA PCR (22 cycles) was performed using NEB Next Ultra II Q5 master mix and primers containing TruSeq Indexes for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. NGS libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000. The genome-scale CRISPRi screens were performed in two independent C42BimNG2-AR clones. Clone 1 was tested in a single replicate as a pilot screen experiment, while Clone 2 was tested in two screen replicates. Common hits identified in both clones were nominated for follow-up.

Raw sequencing data were processed using the Weissman laboratory ScreenProcessing35 protocol and GitHub pipeline (https://github.com/mhorlbeck/ScreenProcessing). After setting up the Python environment and required library files as outlined in the tutorial document, sgRNA counts were generated from the raw sequencing files using the command: ‘run fastqgz_to_counts.py -p 6–trim-start 1_end 29 library_reference/CRISPRi_V2_human.trim_1_29.' To calculate sgRNA-level and gene-level phenotypes and p-values, the process_experiments.py function was used. The corresponding configuration files are available at GitHub (https://github.com/haolongli87/ptges3_resources). Raw sgRNA counts and phenotype scores are provided in Source Data Fig. 2. To validate the nominated hits, gene-level phenotype scores were also calculated using the MAGeCK pipeline61 based on sgRNA raw counts from both clones, and results are provided in Source Data Fig. 2.

PTGES3 ORF (Addgene, cat. no. 108224) was cloned into pLVX-TetOne-Puro-C-Flag vector using Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). PTGES3 mutant constructs were cloned with Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis (NEB). Guide RNAs expression vector targeting CTRL or individual genes were cloned into pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-mCherry or Lenti-sgRNA-blast (Addgene, cat. no. 104993). Cloning primers sequences were listed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. HA-tagged AR construct plasmids were obtained from Addgene, HA-FL-AR (Addgene, cat. no. 171234), HA-AR-NTD (Addgene, cat. no. 171235), HA-AR-NTD-DBD (Addgene, cat. no. 171236), HA-AR-DBD-LBD (Addgene, cat. no. 171236). The ARE was cloned from ARR3tk plasmid (Addgene, cat. no. 132360) into pGL4 vector (Promega) to construct the ARE–luciferase reporter (ARE-luc). Luciferase activities were determined using the luciferin reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. For siRNA knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA against control (siNTC, Dharmacon, cat. no. D-001810-10-05), PTGSE3 (siPTGES3-1 Dharmacon, cat. no. J-004496-10-0002, siPTGES3 Dharmacon, cat. no. J-004496-10-0002), or AR (siAR-1 Dharmacon, cat. no. J-003400-06-0002, siAR-2 Dharmacon, cat. no. J-003400-07-0002), Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) at the final concentration of 50 nM, and incubated for at least 48 h. Detailed siRNA information is listed in Supplementary Table 4.

For protein network analysis, the top 51 positive AR regulator hits from the screen were submitted to STRING37 (v.11.5). Genes without gene interactions among any of the top 51 hits were removed. Physical subnetwork was chosen. Connections were based on confidence. Line thickness indicates the strength of data support. Genes were clustered by unsupervised Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL clustering, inflation parameter = 3).

For RNA-seq, gene set enrichment analyses were performed using the preranked method implemented in the fgsea R package (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.GSEABase), and Hallmark gene sets were downloaded from the molecular signatures database (MSigDB), genes were ranked by the Wald-statistics from DESeq2.

RNA was extracted from the cells per manufacturer's protocol using the Zymo Quick-RNA extraction kit (cat. no. R1054). cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (cat. no. 18080). mRNA expression was measured using primers (Supplementary Table 5) and SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mixes (Thermo) in the QuantStudio Flex Real-Time PCR system.

Protein was extracted with either RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor (Thermo, cat. no. 78430). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 78833) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were quantified by BCA assay before downstream analysis. Western blots were performed as described previously62. For immunoprecipitation, protein lysates were incubated with primary antibody overnight and performed as previous described62. Antibody information is listed in Supplementary Table 6. Each experiment was performed twice to determine reproducibility, representative images were shown.

A total of 1 × 107 22RV1 cells were lysed and then reduced and alkylated at 90 °C for 10 min while shaken at 1,000 rpm per manufacturer's protocol (PreOmics iST Kit). Clarified protein samples (100 μg) were digested enzymatically using Trypsin/Lys-C mix at 37 °C for 90 min and peptides were desalted and dried down in a speedvac overnight at room temperature (CentriVap, Labconco). Peptide samples were resuspended in Solvent A (2% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid (FA)) and quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). A total of 1 μg of peptides from each sample were loaded on to an EASY-Spray nanocolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. ES900) installed on Dionex Ultimate 3000 NanoRSLC coupled with Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated over a 95-min gradient of ACN ranging from 2% to 30% ACN followed by a quick ramp up to 80% ACN. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scans were performed over mass range of m/z 350–1,500 with resolution of 17,500. The isolation window was set to 4.0 m/z and the charge state was set to 2.

The MS/MS raw data (.raw files) were processed using MSFragger within FragPipe63 with default label free quantification settings and searched against the human uniprot database. The contaminant and decoy protein sequences were added to the search database using Fragpipe. The computational tools PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet were used for statistical validation of results and subsequent mapping of the peptides to the proteins respectively with 1% false discovery rate. The label free quantification intensities were considered for secondary data analysis. Features having missing values of more than 50% were eliminated, and k-nearest neighbor was used to impute the missing values. The data were log transformed, normalized and subjected to Welch's t-tests (Source Data; Fig. 3). Proteins with P values less than 0.05 were used to identify the differentially expressed (DE) proteins. Statistical analysis and data visualization were performed in R studio and MetaboAnalyst 5.064.

The prostate tumor microarray (TMA) with correlated clinical information from 120 clinically localized PCa patients was constructed by the University of Michigan Center for Translational Pathology as previously reported65. IHC was performed as described previously66. Briefly, paraffin-embedded TMA slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated following standard protocols. Antigen retrieval was carried out with HIER EDTA buffer. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 1% hydrogen peroxide. Slides were probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-PTGES3 (1:20, Sigma cat. no. HPA038672), washed, incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson cat. no. 111-065-144, 1:2,000), followed by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Invitrogen cat. no. SA10001, 1:250). Staining was visualized using DAB developing kit (Vector Laboratories) and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories). The stained TMA slide was scanned by a Leica Aperio AT2 scanner and digital images were evaluated independently and scored blindly by two pathologists (B.A.S. and J.Z.). IHC scores of nuclear PTGES3 were calculated by IHC signal intensity (0–1 as weak and 2–3 as strong).

Protein expression constructs, expression and purification of recombinant mouse AR constructs, including the DNA-binding domain (ARDBD, residues 548–651) and a variant lacking the N-terminal domain (ARΔNTD, residues 548–909) were performed as described previously50,51. Full-length human PTGES3 was engineered with a Smt3 N-terminal tag and cloned into pET28a (Gene Universal), transformed into BL21DE3 codon plus cells (Novagen) and grown in lysogeny broth, with expression induced by addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside and overnight shaking at 18 °C. Cells were lysed by French press (Constant Systems) and supernatants purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen), followed by purification by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Cytiva), overnight cleavage of the Smt3 tag by Ulp1 (when assaying the tagless variant) and final purification by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Cytiva) in a final buffer of 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), 5% glycerol and 0.005% IGEPAL CA-630.

Duplex DNAs (36-base-pair) with 5′ fluorescein-labels were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The sense strand of the duplex DNAs had the following sequences, with AREs in bold: ARE: /56-FAM/TAAAATGTAAACAACGTAGAACATCAGGAACTCCGG, Canonical ARE: /56-FAM/TAAAATGTAAACAACGTAGAACATCATGTTCTCCGG; binding buffer for fluorescence polarization (FP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM TCEP, 1 μM DHT, 10% glycerol and 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630. Unless otherwise indicated, equimolar amounts of ARΔNTD (FP) or ARDBD (EMSA) and PTGES3 variants were preincubated on ice for 30 min at 8 μM before mixing with the 100 nM of the indicated DNA. For EMSAs, gel shifted products were resolved on 4% to 20% Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) PAGE, data from n = 3 experiments were analyzed by densitometry using Fiji software, and fit to a two-phase specific binding model (GraphPad Prism). To calculate apparent Kd values for the FP data, a model for receptor depletion was applied, and data presented as mean ± s.d. from n = 4 experiments. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, with ****P < 0.0001; NS (not significant), P > 0.05.

Complex formation between ARΔNTD and Smt3-PTGES3 in the absence and presence of unlabeled 36-base-pair double-stranded ARE DNA (bearing the sequence TAAAATGTAAACAACGTAGAACATCATGTTCTCCGG, with AREs in bold) was assessed by mass photometry (Refeyn TwoMP). Tagged PTGES3 was used as its molecular weight is within the linear range of the Refeyn TwoMP assay (32 kDa), and because we determined that the Smt3 tag does not interfere with the ability of PTGES3 to alter AR's DNA binding activity. Individual proteins and AR–PTGES3 complexes were prepared at 5 μM and incubated on ice for 30 min in DNA binding buffer the presence or absence of DNA. Samples were subsequently flash diluted into PBS to a final concentration of 10 nM. Video recordings were performed immediately to detect single particles over the course of 1 min at a rate of 100 frames per second in ratiometric acquisition settings. Ratiometric counts were converted to molecular weight in kilodaltons using a standard curve generated with ovalbumin (43 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa) and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Data were analyzed with Refeyn DiscoverMP software to produce histograms of mass values representing the bulk population and represented as normalized counts. Data shown are representative of at least three independent measurements.

Structural models of PTGES3 and AR chaperone and DNA-bound complexes were generated using a combination of experimentally derived structural models (PDB: 1XOW; PDB: 1R4I; PDB: 7KRJ)43,50,67,68 and Alphafold 369. For Alphafold models, structural models are color coded according to pLDDT confidence estimates, where red is very high and blue is very low confidence. PyMOL (Schrödinger) was used to perform structural alignments and for figure rendering.

ChIP and Dual X ChIP assays were performed as described previously62,70. In brief, 1 × 107 cells were collected, washed and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 mins and then quenched in 125 mM glycine. For Dual X ChIP crosslinking, cells were treated with 1.5 mM ethylene glycol bis (EGS in PBS, Sigma) for 30 mins, subsequently crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 mins, and quenched with 1.25 M glycine for 5 mins. Genomic DNA extraction and ChIP assay were then performed using Bioruptor Pico sonication (Diagenode) and HighCell# ChIP kit (Diagenode, cat no. C01010061). Antibodies used for ChIP–qPCR are listed in Supplemental Table 6. Bound DNA was quantified by qPCR (SYBR Green master mix, Invitrogen) using the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table 7. The qPCR results are presented as fold enrichment over control IgG antibody and normalized based on the total input (nonprecipitated chromatin). Primers for the GAPDH promoter were used as a negative control.

RNA was extracted from the cells and reverse transcribed to DNA as described above. The QuantSeq 3'mRNA-Seq library prep kit FWD (Lexogen, cat. no. 015.24) was used to prepare NGS gene expression libraries per the manufacturer's protocol. Quality control was performed by using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system and the samples were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000. The entire RNA-seq experiment was done in two biological replicates. The RNA-seq single-end fastq data generated by Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing system were first trimmed to remove adapter sequences using Cutadapt v.2.6 with the ‘-q 10 -m 20' option71. After adapter trimming, FASTQC v.0.11.8 was used to evaluate the sequence trimming as well as overall sequence quality. Using the splice-aware aligner STAR72 (v.2.7.1a), RNA-seq reads were aligned onto the Human reference genome build GRCh38decoy using the ‘–outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate–outSAMunmapped Within–outSAMmapqUnique 50–sjdbOverhang 65–chimSegmentMin 12–twopassMode Basic' option and exon–exon junctions, with human gene model annotation from GENCODE v.30. Gene expression quantification of uniquely mapping reads was performed using the ‘featurecount' function within Rsubread R package73 with ‘GTF.featureType = ‘exon,' GTF.attrType = ‘gene_id,' useMetaFeatures=TRUE, allowMultiOverlap=FALSE, countMultiMappingReads=FALSE, isLongRead=FALSE, ignoreDup=FALSE, strandSpecific=0, juncCounts=TRUE, genome=NULL, isPairedEnd=FALSE, requireBothEndsMapped=FALSE, checkFragLength=FALSE, countChimericFragments=TRUE, autosort=TRUE' option. Cross-sample normalization of expression values and differential expression analysis between the PTGES3 knockdown and control was done using DESeq2 R package74. Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P < 0.05 and log2 foldchange >1 or < −1 were considered statistically significant. All pipelines for RNA-seq data processing are described previously75 and available at https://github.com/haolongli87/ptges3_resources.

Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then quenched in 125 mM glycine. Nuclei were sequentially isolated using ice-cold LB1 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100), followed by ice-cold LB2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA). Subsequently, nuclear lysis was performed on ice for 10 min using ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Chromatin was sheared to approximately 300-bp fragments with a Bioruptor Plus Sonicator (Diagenode). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-AR antibody (ab108341). Protein–DNA complexes were reverse crosslinked overnight at 65 °C. ChIP and input DNA samples were purified the following day with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 28104). Sequencing libraries were constructed from approximately 0.8 ng ChIP DNA using the ThruPLEX DNA-Seq Prep Kit (Takara Bio, cat. no. R400675) with 12 cycles of PCR amplification. Libraries underwent NGS (100 bp, paired-end) on an Illumina NovaSeq X instrument at the Fred Hutch Genomics Core.

Raw FASTQ sequencing data were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v.0.39) and aligned to the human genome (hg38) using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner76 (BWA-mem, v.0.7.17). Alignments with MAPQ scores lower than 30 were filtered out using SAMtools77, and ENCODE blacklisted regions78 were excluded using BEDTools79 (v.2.31.0). Duplicate reads were identified and removed using Picard MarkDuplicates (v.2.25.1) (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Peak calling was performed using MACS380 (v.3.0.0) with a Q value cutoff of 0.01. Normalized BigWig files were generated by bamCoverage from deepTools81 (v.3.5.4) using RPGC normalization. Coverage heatmaps centered around genomic features of interest were produced using the computeMatrix and plotHeatmap modules within deepTools (v.3.5.4). Visualization snapshots were obtained using Integrative Genomics Viewer82 (IGV, v.2.19.1). Motif analyses utilized HOMER83 (v.4.11), applying the Known Motif Discovery approach.

ATAC-seq was performed as described previously84,85 with the following modifications. Cells were resuspended in buffer (Illumina, cat. no. 20034198), incubated on ice for 10 min and lysed using a dounce homogenizer. A total of 50,000 nuclei were incubated with 25 µl 2× TD Buffer and 1.25 µl Transposase (Illumina Tagment Enzyme/Buffer, cat. no. 20034210) shaking at 300 rpm at 37 °C for 30 min. Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator 5 kit (cat. no. D4014) was then used to purify DNA. Transposed DNA was amplified using PCR master mix and indexes from Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (cat. no. 15028211) for five cycles and then assessed using qPCR. Final cleanup was performed using 1.8× AMPure XP beads (cat. no. A63881) and libraries quantified using the DNA High Sensitivity Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System. Samples were sequenced at the UCSF Core Facility on a HiSeq4000 as PE100 libraries. The entire experimental setup was performed in two technical replicates.

The ATAC-seq paired-end fastq files were first trimmed to remove Illumina Nextera adapter sequence using Cutadapt v2.686 with the ‘-q 10 -m 20' option. FASTQC v.0.11.887 was used to evaluate sequence trimming and overall sequence quality. Bowtie2 v.2.3.5.188 was used to align ATAC-seq reads against the Human reference genome build GRCh38decoy using the ‘–very-sensitive' option. Uniquely mapped reads were obtained in SAM format. Samtools version 1.989 was used to convert SAM to BAM file and sort the BAM file. Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was then used to flag duplicate reads using the MarkDuplicates tool using ‘REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true' option. The resulting BAM file reads position were then corrected by a constant offset to the read start (‘+' stranded +4 bp, ‘−' stranded −5 base pairs) using deepTools2 v.3.3.281 with the ‘alignmentSieve–ATACshift' option. This resulted in the final aligned, de-duplicated BAM file that was used in all downstream analyses. ATAC-seq peak calling was performed using MACS2 v.2.2.580 to obtain narrow peaks with the ‘callpeak -f BAMPE -g hs –qvalue 0.05–nomodel -B–keep-dup all–call-summits' option. The resulting peaks that map to the mitochondrial genome or genomic regions listed in the ENCODE hg38 blacklist (https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR636HFF/) or peaks that extend beyond the ends of chromosomes were filtered out. Nonoverlapping unique ATAC-seq narrow peak regions were obtained from all samples analyzed. Only those nonoverlapping unique peak regions present in at least two samples were considered for further analysis. Sequencing reads mapped to these nonoverlapping unique regions were counted using ‘featurecount' function within Rsubread72 R package with the ‘isPairedEnd=TRUE, countMultiMappingReads=FALSE, maxFragLength=100, autosort=TRUE' option. Further library-size normalization of the feature counts and differential OCRs between sgPTGES3 and sgCTRL were obtained using the DESeq274 R package. Only those peak regions with Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P < 0.05 and log2 foldchange >1 or <−1 were considered statistically significant. The ATAC-seq peaks were annotated using ChIPseeker90 R package based on hg38 GENCODE v.30 annotations.

The genes nearest to the ATAC-seq peaks that mapped within the promoter regions of the corresponding gene were considered for this analysis. These genes were tested for enrichment against Hallmark gene sets in Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) v.7.0. A hypergeometric test-based over-representation analysis was used for this purpose. A cutoff threshold of false discovery rate ≤ 0.01 was used to obtain the significantly enriched gene sets.

The differentially accessible ATAC-seq peaks that mapped to promoter and intergenic regions were used for TF binding analysis. The MEME tool91 was used to discover TF binding motifs de novo. These potential TF binding motifs were annotated for known TF motif from the JASPAR92 database using the TomTom tool within the MEME tool suite. All pipelines for ATAC data processing are described previously93 and are available at https://github.com/haolongli87/ptges3_resources.

Publicly available gene expression data from a matched cohort established previously59 or mCRPC was downloaded from cBioportal (20 May 2021)94,95,96. Samples were grouped based on expression levels above or below the 25th percentile for PTGES3 separately for poly-A or capture-based RNA-seq, and the capture-based results were used if a sample had sequencing data available from both methods. Differences in survival between groups were visualized using the Kaplan–Meier method and a log-rank test was used to test for differences in survival, using the survival and survminer R packages97,98. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

All animal studies were conducted in compliance with UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. NOD-SCID-Gamma (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratory, strain code 005557) were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 18–23 °C and 40–60% humidity. All in vivo experiments used male mice aged 6–8 weeks. Doxycycline-inducible LNCaPi cells established previously99 were lentiviral transfected with constructs encoding sgPTGES3 or sgCTRL and puromycin selected. Cells were mixed with Matrigel (Corning, cat. no. 354230, 1:1) and 2 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously on each flank of male NSG mice. Once the tumors were palpable, mice were randomized into two groups receiving either doxycycline diet (Bio-Serv, cat. no. S3888) or control diet. Tumors were measured using digital calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the equation: volume = length × width2 × 0.52, where the length represents the longer axis. Average tumor volume was plotted and two-way ANOVA was used to measure statistical significance denoted by asterisk (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). The mice were humanely euthanized per UCSF LARC protocol once the tumor volume reached 1,000 mm3.

Cell viability assays were performed as described previously62 using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Sigma) according to the manufacturerʼs protocol. Clonogenic assays were performed as described previously99. In brief, 1,000 cells were seeded in a six-well plate and treated as indicated for 10 days. The cell colonies were then washed with PBS and fixed/stained with 25% methanol plus crystal violet (0.05% w/v). Images were scanned and analyzed using a GelCount (Oxford Optronix). Average number of colonies was counted. For IncuCyte experiment, cells labeled with Nuclight red were seeded to 96-well plates. The time relapse images were captured and analyzed with by the Incucyte S3 live-cell analysis system.

Proximity ligation assays were performed using the Duolink in situ red starter kit mouse/rabbit (Sigma). LNCaP cells were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used for proximity ligation assays are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Secondary probe, ligation and amplification reactions were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence images were captured by Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss).

Spearman's correlation was used to determine statistical significance for all the correlation plots. For gene expression and correlation, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences between two groups, unless otherwise stated. Unpaired t test were used to determine statistical analysis for the column plots, denoted by asterisk (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). Two-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance in the in vivo data. In RNA-seq data, the Benjamini–Hochberg test was performed. Corrected P < 0.05 and log2 foldchange >0.5 or <0.5 were considered statistically significant. In ATAC-seq data peak regions with Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P < 0.05 and log2 foldchange >0.5 or <0.5 were considered statistically significant. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes for any experiments. For all analyses, data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested.

Pyridine derivatives are one of the most common heterocycles in chemistry. The 3-halopyridines are generally synthesized by indirect methods, including functional group conversion or a temporary dearomatization–rearomatization process. Although the direct electrophilic halogenation of pyridines provides straightforward access to 3-halopyridines, it has been rarely reported owing to the poor π nucleophilicity of pyridines. Here we describe a general direct regioselective C-3 halogenation of pyridines promoted by an ether solvation effect. This radical process enables the regioselective reaction to occur at the C-3 position of pyridines, rather than other aromatic C–H bonds, and can be applied to the late-stage halogenation of complex molecules. The mechanistic studies show that the interaction between the pyridine substrate, ether solvent and haleniums plays a dominant role in the reactivity and regioselectivity.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani may have an ambitious policy agenda, but overhauling the self-governing and deeply dysfunctional behemoth that is the New York City Police Department is not on the list. Mamdani surprised supporters by asking current Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on after his inauguration early next year. Tisch, a technocrat heir to a vast real estate fortune, clashes with Mamdani on several fronts, including policy (she believes New York State's bail reforms caused rising crime) and the geopolitics that inevitably make their way into New York City's streets. (Tisch's family are key figures in the Israel lobby; Mamdani is vociferously pro-Palestinian.)

One area where Mamdani is guaranteed to clash with Tisch is on the NYPD's massive technical surveillance apparatus and intelligence-gathering methods, which have metastasized since 9/11 to levels that rival the capabilities of a midsize country. More than one observer has characterized the NYPD as operating more like a US intelligence agency—at one point, the department's Intelligence Division was run by a CIA veteran, and at least one CIA analyst was embedded at NYPD—than a police department.

While Mamdani's public safety proposals center on the creation of a $1 billion Department of Community Safety that will handle non-emergency 911 calls in place of armed cops, some of his other stated positions conflict directly with Tisch's own positions and background with the NYPD, where she got her start in the department's controversial intelligence division during the height of its “mosque-raking” mass surveillance of Muslim New Yorkers.

Experts say the stakes in the current moment are far higher with regard to surveillance, largely due to the federal government's nationwide immigration blitz using surveillance data gathered by police departments to track down and arrest targeted people.

Andrew Guthrie Ferguson of George Washington University Law School studies the use of high-tech surveillance by law enforcement and is the author of The Rise of Big Data Policing. He has studied the NYPD's sweeping buildout of networked CCTV, gunshot detectors, license plate readers, and video analytics since 9/11. The current wave of federal immigration raids, he says, have made clear how local police data such as fingerprints and license plate scans can be weaponized by an authoritarian administration and makes the current moment ripe for a reckoning on police surveillance.

“In a horrible way, the sense of how technologies can be weaponized against people has expanded,” Ferguson tells WIRED. “When the government expanded its targeting, it also expands the conversation beyond the poor Black communities that were initially targeted by things like CCTV networks and predictive policing.”

Mamdani's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

The NYPD's turn toward mass surveillance was begun in earnest by Commissioner Raymond Kelly during the immediate aftermath of September 11, buoyed by hundreds of millions of dollars in federal anti-terrorism grants. However, Ferguson says Kelly's rival, former commissioner William Bratton, was a key architect behind the NYPD's reliance on “big data,” by implementing the CompStat data analysis system to map and electronically collate crime data during the mid-1990s and again during his return to New York City in 2014 under Mayor Bill de Blasio. Bratton was also a mentor to Jessica Tisch and has spoken admiringly of her since leaving the NYPD.

Tisch was a main architect of the NYPD's Domain Awareness System, an enormous, $3 billion, Microsoft-based surveillance network of tens of thousands of private and public surveillance cameras, license plate readers, gunshot detectors, social media feeds, biometric data, cryptocurrency analysis, location data, bodyworn and dashcam livestreams, and other technology that blankets the five boroughs' 468-square-mile territory. Patterned off London's 1990s CCTV surveillance network, the “ring of steel” was initially developed under Kelly as an anti-terrorism surveillance system for Lower and Midtown Manhattan before being rebranded as the DAS and marketed to other police departments as a potential for-profit tool. Several dozen of the 17,000 cameras in New York City public housing developments were also linked through backdoor methods by the Eric Adams administration last summer with thousands more in the pipeline, according to NY Focus.

Though the DAS has been operational for more than a decade and survived prior challenges over data retention and privacy violations from civil society organizations like the New York Civil Liberties Union, it remains controversial. In late October, a Brooklyn couple filed a civil suit along with Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), a local privacy watchdog, against the DAS, alleging violations of New York State's constitutional right to privacy by the NYPD's persistent mass surveillance and data retention. NYPD officers, the suit claims, can “automatically track an individual across the city using computer vision software, which follows a person from one camera to the next based on descriptors as simple as the color of a piece of clothing.” The technology, they allege, “transforms every patrol officer into a mobile intelligence unit, capable of conducting warrantless surveillance at will.”

“It's a really open question about whether he'll push policies that'll dismantle the infrastructure of mass religious and racial profiling and the pseudoscience of surveillance as safety, and focus on evidence based alternatives, or he'll be too afraid of the NY Post,” says Albert Fox Cahn, the founder in residence of STOP. Referring to Tisch as the “mother of the DAS,” Fox Cahn questioned why Mamdani would choose to retain a police commissioner with a record on privacy and criminal justice that runs contrary to the mayor-elect. For instance, Mamdani has vowed to get rid of the NYPD's controversial gang database—an elimination Tisch strongly opposes.

“This raises a fundamental question: When mayors are so terrified of firing police commissioners who are inconsistent with their own agenda, do we really have democratic oversight of policing?” Fox Cahn says. “Are they overseeing police in name only, and if not, what does that say about the state of democracy in America? Forget Trump; this is on the local level.”

Municipal oversight of the NYPD's massive surveillance arsenal is indeed lacking. Even though New York City passed a relatively mild oversight law for the NYPD's surveillance gear in 2020 that required the agency to disclose the purchase and deployment of new surveillance technologies, the department refused to comply. As a result, there is still no public accounting for the contracts, use policies, and deployments of many of the NYPD's most invasive tools, including drones and robot dogs.

Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the UC Davis School of Law who has long studied police intelligence and surveillance practices, says that Mamdani's progressive ideals are on a collision course with the NYPD's operational model, which is founded on pervasive surveillance of the city.

“What does it mean to be the mayor of a big American city, where the police have absolutely embraced techno-solutionism as policing, as the dominant attitude toward policing?” Joh says.

One potential inflection point for NYC could be future immigration sweeps like those in Los Angeles and Chicago, where police are making use of data collected by local cops and biometric software to hunt down undocumented people. “Immigration enforcement will almost certainly be a flash point: The use of technology in that context is alarming people, and I'm not surprised feds are using live facial recognition,” Joh says.

A New York Department of Investigation report last year lambasted Mayor Eric Adams and police officials for buying and deploying several new tools, including a semiautonomous robotic dog; an entirely useless Knightscope “security” robot; the StarChase GPS system, which allows officers to fire a tracking projectile designed to stick to a car; smartphone fingerprinting technology; and an augmented-reality program police officers can download on their phones.

In August, the Legal Aid Society urged the city Department of Investigation to scrutinize the NYPD's use of facial recognition technology after The City reported that the NYPD used an FDNY account with Clearview AI to identify a pro-Palestine protester at Columbia University. The NYPD also maintains a facial recognition database that includes photographs of juveniles, according to 2019 reporting by The New York Times.

Three bills are currently in front of New York's city council to ostensibly strengthen its visibility into the NYPD's surveillance arsenal (including a requirement to draft formal facial recognition use and audit policies). However, the City Council has far less power to scrutinize and set policy for the police department's spying capabilities than many other cities that passed legislative reforms in the 2010s thanks to intense lobbying by the NYPD against a stronger bill.

Beyond creating a Department of Community Safety, Mamdani's other rare point of policy clarity on public safety concerns the department's repressive approach to protests and the role of its controversial intelligence division in conducting mass surveillance on Muslim New Yorkers.

The Demographics Unit, created under former commissioner Ray Kelly by a CIA officer loaned to the NYPD in the mid-2000s, went about mapping Muslim and Middle Eastern communities in the city's five boroughs. Meanwhile, undercover officers were sent to infiltrate religious congregations and student groups as far afield as Connecticut and New Jersey.

Although the Demographics Unit has been disbanded, and the department's “mosque-raking” operations led to a legal settlement, activists and legal workers say the department's surveillance in Middle Eastern and South Asian communities is still prevalent.

Notably, Tisch's family is best known around New York City for its philanthropy, with the family name adorning concert halls, museum wings, and university departments. The family is also known for donating heavily to Israeli causes (Jerusalem's Tisch Biblical Zoo, for example), with Jessica's father playing key roles in the US Israel lobby and donating heavily to both pro-Trump Republican congressional candidates and GOP political action committees. Her extended family threw at least $900,000 into supporting Andrew Cuomo's failed NYC mayoral bid—including her mother, former New York state regent Merryl Tisch.

Jessica Tisch got her start at the NYPD in the Kelly-era Intelligence Bureau building dossiers on Muslim extremism. In January, she gave the opening remarks at a training on “combatting antisemitism” that labeled participants in Students for Justice in Palestine as “campus extremists” and claimed that SJP was responsible for a 300 percent increase in antisemitism at American colleges and universities. At the training, keffiyehs and watermelons were branded as “antisemitic symbols” that “incite hatred, violence, or discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities.”

The NYPD's violent repression of pro-Palestinian protests, documented extensively by The Nation, will almost certainly be an issue for Mamdani. Senior NYPD officials have attended trainings and events held by far-right Zionist organizations, and the agency is still fighting court-ordered restrictions on protest policing imposed as part of a settlement for its behavior during the 2020 George Floyd demonstrations.

Another open question is the NYPD's ongoing use of the New York City Police Foundation as a conduit for controversial surveillance technology and the underwriting of its overseas detectives program by foreign governments. The foundation still foots the $1,204,126 bill for the NYPD Intelligence Bureau's “international liaison” program that posts detectives overseas to 11 countries, including Israel, Spain, France, Australia, and Singapore. That cost rose significantly from $948,261 in 2023.

In the past, corporations that did business with the NYPD also contributed money to the foundation, raising questions about quid pro quos and the use of the police “booster” nonprofit as a way to circumvent public procurement procedures, particularly for surveillance equipment. The United Arab Emirates also paid $1 million to the NYC Police Foundation, according to 2012 tax records, which was the same amount that covered the entire overseas detectives program that year, according to a report by The Intercept. An NYPD detective has been posted to Abu Dhabi since 2009.

The Police Foundation also serves as a key nexus for the local business community's influence over the NYPD. Two members of Tisch's family sit on the NYCPF's Board, according to the nonprofit's latest tax filings. Per reporting by veteran police scribe Leonard Levitt, one of Tisch's relatives convinced then-commissioner Ray Kelly to give her a posting in the NYPD in the late 2000s, leading to her hiring. Kelly denied Levitt's reporting in a 2015 interview with Bloomberg. Tisch did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late 2024, Tisch said that a “friend” made the key connection with Kelly and steered her to the intel division job.

The Police Foundation is also involved in the NYPD's rapid expansion of its drone unit under Mayor Eric Adams. In 2024, the foundation spent $230,750 to buy drones for the NYPD's transit command. At the time, the department's drone expansion was overseen by Kaz Daughtry, a controversial police official and Adams ally who faces accusations of heavy drone surveillance by pro-Palestine activists and residents of Brooklyn neighborhoods subjected to blanket drone patrols during Labor Day cookouts in 2023.

Although Mamdani's mayoral campaign was defined by his relentless emphasis on affordability, the looming battles with the Trump administration over immigration enforcement and the breakneck buildout of the NYPD's already formidable surveillance arsenal under Adams means he will be forced to reckon with the police department's spying programs.

​​”Mass surveillance endangers all values at the heart of our democracy, and I do hope that our next mayor is willing to be a spokesperson for this cause,” says STOP's Fox Cahn. “You can't be a sanctuary city and a surveillance state—you can't promise to protect undocumented neighbors and provide a data pipeline to ICE.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Microsoft is creating a new internal mechanism for employees to report concerns about how its technology is developed and used — making the process similar to how workers already flag incidents of workplace misbehavior, security issues, or legal concerns.

In a message to employees Wednesday morning, company President Brad Smith said Microsoft was expanding its internal “Integrity Portal” to let workers raise issues related to the development and deployment of its technology. The new feature, called “Trusted Technology Review,” will allow employees to report information or concerns about potential policy violations.

Smith said the company is also changing its processes to “strengthen our existing pre-contract review process for evaluating engagements that require additional human-rights due diligence.”

The moves come after months of pressure inside and outside Microsoft over Israel's use of the company's technology in military and surveillance activities linked to the war in Gaza.

Microsoft has faced repeated protests from employees and activists, including a group called No Azure for Apartheid, which has accused Microsoft of enabling human-rights abuses through its cloud and artificial-intelligence services.

The company has said it is committed to upholding its human-rights principles and does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. 

In September, the company confirmed it had found evidence supporting parts of a Guardian investigation that Israeli military intelligence used Microsoft's Azure cloud to store and analyze large volumes of intercepted Palestinian phone calls. Microsoft said it had since cut off access to certain cloud and AI services used by Unit 8200, Israel's military intelligence agency.

“We continue to consider lessons learned and apply them to how we run our business and advance our mission in an increasingly complex world,” Smith wrote in the new message. He noted that employees can submit information anonymously, and Microsoft's non-retaliation policy will also apply. 

Separately, the Guardian recently reported that Israel's cloud deals with Amazon and Google include a secret mechanism allowing the government to be alerted if a foreign legal order seeks its data. The report said Microsoft's unsuccessful bid for that contract, known as Project Nimbus, faltered because the company refused to accept all of Israel's demands.

Amazon responded at the time: “We do not have any processes in place to circumvent our confidentiality obligations on lawfully binding orders.”

Here is the full text of Smith's message, obtained by GeekWire.

Hello Everyone –  

You'll recall that on September 25, I shared with you actions we took after investigating a news story that reported that Azure was being used to store phone call data obtained through mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. In that message, I also said we'd continue to share lessons learned and how we will apply these going forward. Today I want to share additional steps we are taking to enhance our due diligence and governance processes. This is a part of an ongoing process and, as we continue to learn more, we'll share further steps with you.   

Today we are strengthening our diligence processes by expanding how employees can report information and concerns about how Microsoft technology is developed and deployed. These build on our long-established reporting and investigations processes on workplace behavior, legal and ethical concerns, and digital and physical security — all of which make it easy for employees to raise concerns through the Microsoft Integrity Portal.   

We're adding a new and easy way for employees to report information about practices that you believe may violate the company's policies regarding the development and deployment of our technology. This is through a new section in the Microsoft Integrity Portal called “Trusted Technology Review.” Moving forward, if you have information on these topics, simply go to the portal and select the “Trusted Technology Review” when asked for type of report. We will then follow up to address this information. Our standard non-retaliation policy applies and you can raise concerns anonymously.  

As part of our commitment to ongoing improvement, we are also taking new steps to enhance other aspects of our governance processes. As one step in that work, we are working to strengthen our existing pre-contract review process for evaluating engagements that require additional human rights due diligence. 

As I've shared before, Microsoft is a company guided by principles and ethics. We continue to consider lessons learned and apply them to how we run our business and advance our mission in an increasingly complex world. We'll continue to listen and learn and share new steps with you along the way.

The image meant you basically got whatever state the developer ended up with, frozen in time, with no indication really of how they got there.Think of today's modern systems and open source, with so many libraries easily downloadable and able to be incorporated in your system in a very reproducible way. Smalltalk folks derided this as a low tech, lowest-common-denominator approach. But in fact it gave us reusable components from disparate vendors and sources.The image concept was a huge strength of Smalltalk but, really in the end in my opinion, one of the major areas that held it back.Java in particular surged right past Smalltalk despite many shortcomings compared to it, partially because of this. The other part of course was being free at many levels. The other half of Smalltalk issues beyond the image one, was the cost of both developer licenses ($$$$!) and runtime licenses (ugh!).

The problem with an image based ecosystem that I see is that you are inevitably pushed towards using tools that live within that image. Now granted, those tools are able to be very powerful because they leverage and interact with the image itself. But the community contributing to that ecosystem is far smaller than the communities contributing to filesystem based tools.The result is that people who are considering coming into the system, have to start with abandoning their familiar toolchain. And for all of the technical advantages of the new toolchain, the much smaller contributor base creates a worse is better situation. While the file-based system has fundamental technical limitations, the size of the ecosystem results in faster overall development, and eventually a superior system.

You don't do that with Smalltalk, either, at least not for the last 30 years or so. Smalltalk has worked with version control systems for decades to maintain the code outside the image and collaborate with others without needing to share images.

They wanted to get away from syntax and files, like an inert recipe you have to rerun every time so I think if you do away with the image you do away with the core aspect of it.Computing just in general didn't go the direction they wanted it to go in many ways I think it was too ambitious of an idea for the time. Personally I've always hoped it comes back.

The thing is that the ""scripting"" approach, is just so much easier to distribute. Just look at how popular python got. Smalltalk didn't understand that. The syntax is worse than python IMO (and also ruby of course).

The transition from ""websites"" to ""web apps"" was well underway by the time the dev tools became a built-in browser feature - Chrome was notable for being the first browser to release with the console, inspectors, etc out of the box, but that came later. The developer experience was quite a bit rougher in the early days, and then better but still not native in the days of plugins like Firebug.The web becoming the premium app distribution platform was, firstly, because the web was the lowest-common-denominator distribution channel. Javascript was just the tool that was available where everyone wanted to run.

That should make the Smalltalk family popular with free software proponents. That makes me curious why that is not the case in history. The efforts of FSF on Smalltalk pale in comparison with those on C, Lisp and other languages.

One thing to keep in mind is that smalltalks all have the same ability to save & load code to & from disk, just as any other programming environment. But, they also have the option of just using the image to persist, and iterate on that.Squeak overdid that aspect of it, such that over time, it became hard to prune older side projects & and it just became increasingly bloated. Both Pharo & Cuis forked from squeak at about the same time.Pharo images are fully bootstrapped from a seed.Cuis is not quite there yet, but cuis from its inception went on a ruthless simplification drive (the number of classes in the system was reduced by about 500% !), so that it's base is effectively a ""seed"", and the rest of a cuis image is built up by importing projects (from disk & git) on demand.But yeah, curating a set of images over time is remarkably enticing & friction free. Even in cuis, I find I have to force myself to keep flushing changes to my own packages.Its not that the tools to use files are limited. In cuis, they're not. You can work on multiple different things WITHIN THE SAME IMAGE (changes to some builtins, a couple of your own projects, etc), and the system will keep track of what belongs where. So a couple of mouse clucks will fileout the relevant code to the relevant changesets & packages.And yet - just banging on the same image is just ... fun, easy, enticing.

When, as a dev, I use Smalltalk, it opens up what's effectively a virtual machine on my desktop. The whole Smalltalk GUI runs inside its own frame, none of the controls are native, etc. And it's a development environment - I have access to a class browser, a debugger, a REPL, and so on. I can drill down and read/modify the source code of everything. Which is great as a dev, but may be intimidating for an end user.Is that what the end user experience is like as well? I think that's what OP is asking. I've never used a Smalltalk application as an end user to my knowledge, so I can't say myself.

The application packager removes everything that is related to Smalltalk as developer environment, and possibly other classes that are also not used by the application, so you get a slimmed down image.Then you have the VM boot code, as native executable, that is responsible for starting the image execution.Thanks to the way executable files work in most platforms, the packing tool merges that boot loader and the slimmed down image into a single executable.When the executable starts, the loader locates the image inside the executable, loads it, and transfers execution to the runtime.Java and .NET also have similar techniques available, see jlink, or Single-file deployment respectively.

It means going through the image and remove most code that isn't directly needed by the application, or only exists to support developer workflows.Usually needs a bit help for fine tuning, regarding what code to keep, and what to delete.You also find this on Java (jlink, ProGuard, D8/R8 on Android), and .NET (trimming, .NET Native manifests).

Elixir kind of got close too (prettier ""erlang"") - to have fault-tolerant mini-CPUs (""objects"", aka similar to biological cells). The problem is that even people with grand ideas, such as Alan Kay, are not automatically great language designers. Matz is a better language designer than Alan Kay, for instance, whereas Alan Kay has the better ideas. It's a trade-off.Note: I myself would not know how a language should look like that would follow Alan Kay's vision closer. It is definitely not smalltalk; it is also not ruby, though ruby is very good. I know I would suck as language designer, but as an improvement I would have a language similar to ruby (no, not crystal - crystal is a worse ""ruby""), with a stronger focus on speed (perhaps have a second language that can be as fast as C here and be similar) and with a much stronger focus on what erlang brought to the table; that would get us close to, say, around 85% or 90%. And then add the rest that could fulfil Alan Kay's vision. Of course we need a specification too, because just saying ""90% of his vision"" is also pointless. I would perhaps start from erlang, retain the good bits, make it a modern variant of OOP (and OOP is also defined differently in different programming languages, so we need to define that term too, in the specification).

I've experienced this a few different times: with Microsoft BASIC-80 (and GW-BASIC), with SBCL and SLIME, with LOGO, with GForth, with OpenFirmware, with MS-DOS DEBUG.COM, with Jupyter, and of course with Squeak.  It really is nice.It used to be the normal way of using computers; before memory protection, it was sort of the only way of using computers.  There wasn't another memory space for the monitor to run in, and the monitor was what you used to do things like load programs and debug them.  This approach continued as the default into many early timesharing systems like RT-11 and TENEX: there might be one virtual machine (memory space) per user, but the virtual machine you typed system commands into was the same one that ran your application.  TENEX offered the alternative of running DDT (the debugger) in a different memory space so bugs in the application couldn't corrupt it, and that was the approach taken in ITS as well, where DDT was your normal shell user interface instead of an enhanced one.All this seems very weird from the Unix/VMS/Win32 perspective where obviously the shell is a different process from your text editor, and it's designed for launching black-box programs rather than inspecting their internal memory state, but evolutionarily it was sort of the natural progression from a computer operator single-stepping a computer (with no memory protection) through their program with a toggle switch as they attempted to figure out why it wasn't working.One of the nicest things about this way of working is halt-and-continue.  Current versions of Microsoft Visual Studio offer sometimes halt and continue.  In MBASIC you could always halt and continue.  ^C halted the program, at which point you could examine variables, make arbitrary changes to the program, GOTO a line number, or just CONT to continue where you'd interrupted it.  Smalltalk, SLIME, or ITS allows you to program in this way; if you like, you can refrain from defining each method (or function or subroutine) until the program tries to execute it, at which point it halts in the debugger, and you can write the code for the method and continue.This is an extremely machine-efficient approach; you never waste cycles on restarting the program from the beginning unless you're going to debug program initialization.  And in Smalltalk there isn't really a beginning at all, or rather, the beginning was something like 50 years ago.Myself, though, I feel that the hard part of programming is debugging, which requires the experimental method.  And the hard part of the experimental method is reproducibility.  So I'm much more enthusiastic about making my program's execution reproducible so that I can debug faster, which conflicts with ""you're in the running environment"".  (As Rappin says, ""Code could depend on the state of the image in ways that were hard to replicate in deploys.""  I experience this today in Jupyter.  It's annoying to spend a bunch of time trying to track down a bug that doesn't exist when you restart from scratch; worse is when the program works fine until you restart it from scratch.)  So I'm much more excited about things like Hypothesis (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45818562) than I am about edit-and-continue.Paul Graham wrote somewhere (I can't find it now) about how in Viaweb's early days he would often fix a bug while still on the phone with the customer who was experiencing it, because he could just tweak the running CLisp process.  But you can do the same thing in PHP or with CGI without sacrificing much reproducibility—your system's durable data lives in MariaDB or SQLite, which is much more inspectable and snapshottable than a soup of Smalltalk objects pointing to each other.

PHP is similar, but not the same. You can't (or at least I can't) stop a request in progress and change its code; but you can rapidly change the code for the next request. Make a change in the editor, hit reload in the browser is a productive short loop, but stop at a breakpoint, inspect the state and change the code is a more powerful loop. Stopping at a breakpoint is challenging in systems with communication though, and I've learned to live without it for the most part.

reply

Database transactions bridge some of the gap between ""change the code for the next request"" and ""stop at a breakpoint and change the code"": as long as your request handler code keeps failing, it will abort the transaction, so the database is unchanged, so you can restart the transaction as many times as you want to get to the same point in execution, at least if your programming language is deterministic.  By providing a snapshot you can deterministically replay from, it allows you to add log entries before the point where the problem occurred, which can be very useful.Stopping at a breakpoint can be more productive, especially with edit-and-continue, but often it isn't.  A breakpoint is a voltmeter, which you can use to see one value at every node in your circuit; logs are a digital storage oscilloscope with a spectrum analyzer, where you can analyze the history of millions or billions of values at a single node in your circuit.

What happened was: over the 8 years between 2006 - 2014, a particularly vocal and organized group of fringe singletarians promoted the idea that once AGI is achieved (the originally well-defined conception of AGI), it will rapidly undergo recursive self-improvement and emerge as a singularly powerful entity with absolute power and control. The debate was whether this would happen in mere hours/days (fast takeoff) or months (slow takeoff). These nutcases would go on to take founding roles first at DeepMind, then OpenAI, and later Anthropic & other foundational labs.That they would achieve AGI and then neither of those outcomes come to pass was not in their range of predictions. Rather than admit to themselves that their analysis was wrong, they move goal posts: ChatGPT isn't real AGI. Real AGI would have taken over the world, so that can't be it. It is circular reasoning.No, it is real AGI. Real AGI didn't cause a singularity because intelligence actually doesn't matter as much as a bunch of autistic smart internet people think it does.

Even America has become a socialist country. The current Republicans are doing their best (thankfully) to slowly roll this back, but it's a long, slow process.As evidence that America has become a socialist country, you just need to look at the massive expansion of medicare/medicaid and social security.Here is a great place to start (Scroll down to the table called ""Historical Social Security Tax Rates"" and see how the numbers have just exploded): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States...

For example, in Germany, the socialist/left/green pretty dominate and control almost all power here. Democracy is one of the few last standing barricades to germany becoming a full-blown communist state.Yet, even democracy is starting to fade here.Besides Germany, most of europe is well grounded in democracy. Therefore, I wouldn't call most of european countries communist states.However, once socialism reaches a certain point, societies start to fail, and economies start to stagnate or even go backwards. We are starting to witness this here in European. Stagnating or retreading economies. Germany's economy hasn't grown in years.

Why is Medicare proof of the US being a socialist country and not the existence of e.g. the US Army? The former is a formal agreement of the majority to spend money on citizens' health, the latter a formal agreement to spend money on citizens' protection from invasion by a foreign country. Obviously everyone agrees an army is needed, so why not health care?

reply

Therefore, the continual dramatic expansion of Social Welfare (especially for the old) means america has become a shitty social state.

reply

Why is spending money on people's health social welfare, and spending money on their safety not social welfare, whether it's financing the army, police, fire department? Should it not be the responsibility of each individual to protect their life, family, home etc. from danger? Why should these dangers and the protection from them be SOCIALIZED? I for one am perfectly capable of protecting my property of fire, if someone is not, well it's their problem.

In ideal world you have it all, thats what Star Trek and similar utopias were based on. In reality, the more you push to the left, the worse system gets since it always fails on the same premise - it expects ideal human beings, rather than greedy selfish real people(TM) with their own priorities that may diverge from common good.I've seen the mix of socialism and communism dictatorship in my home country (so a vastly different concept than you describe even if spiritually in same direction), it destroyed the spirit and work ethics of entire nation so deeply that even 2 generations after it all collapsed its not back in any way, and maybe never will be (to detriment of entire nation).While capitalism doesn't care, it pushes everybody to their max, for better or worse, weak or unlucky are allowed to fail all the way to the bottom and all the glory to the best and only the best.

New X3D chip surfaces in fresh benchmark leak


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is currently the best CPU you can buy for gaming, offering outstanding performance that easily surpasses Intel's best. A new leak now suggests that a more affordable alternative could be on the way in the form of the Ryzen 7 9700X3D. According to the PassMark benchmark database, the unreleased 3D V-cache-equipped processor has 8 cores and 16 threads and leverages the AM5 platform.

The boost clock speed of the Ryzen 7 9700X3D is listed at 5.8 GHz, a substantial jump over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which tops out at 5.2 GHz. That's a substantial increase that could indicate a number of possibilities, such as a higher clock to attain faster speeds, a data entry error, or that the benchmark testing was done on an overclocked chip. As for the benchmark itself, the CPU scored 40,438 points in multi-threaded and 4,687 points in single-threaded benchmarks. The result is pretty much in line with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in the same tests, where the existing chip scored 39,982 in multi-threaded and 4,427 in single-threaded.

The benchmark database additionally lists a brand new Strix Halo part, namely the Ryzen AI MAX+ 388. This chip scored 31,702 points in multi-threaded and 4,145 points in single-threaded benchmarks on PassMark. By the looks of it, this particular chip should sit between the Ryzen AI MAX+ 390 and AI MAX+ 385 and could potentially be a China-exclusive SKU.

Additional information from the listing suggests that it features a total of 8 cores and 16 threads, 32 MB of L3 cache, and 8 MB of L2 cache. Interestingly, it also comes with the Radeon 8060S iGPU, featuring 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units, similar to the flagship Ryzen AI MAX+ 395. In case you missed our coverage, the Radeon 8060S is currently the most powerful integrated GPU solution offering performance that is very similar to an RTX 4060.

The introduction of a new X3D chip is definitely exciting, especially since the Ryzen 7 9800X3D currently goes for around $450. A potentially cheaper option would give users more choice when upgrading or building a brand-new gaming rig. Having said that, leaked benchmark results are not proof of existence; however, we expect AMD to make some sort of announcement at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2026. Till then, take all of the information above with a pinch of salt.

More power, more expensive cooling.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The total value of liquid cooling components in Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 rack-scale AI system is $49,860, according to a recently released report from Morgan Stanley that was obtained by @Jukanlosreve. The cost of the liquid cooling system for the company's next-generation Vera Rubin NVL144 solution is set to increase by a further 17% to $55,710, as next-generation Rubin GPUs and NVLink switches will get more power hungry, the report claims.

Morgan Stanley stated in its latest report that the total value of cooling (thermal) components in a single GB300 (NVL72) server cabinet amounts to approximately $49,860.For the next-generation Vera Rubin (NVL144) platform, as the cooling demand for both the computing trays and… pic.twitter.com/668Mb01WE5November 3, 2025

The bill of materials (BOM) cost of the cooling system for Nvidia's NVL72 'Oberon' rack — that includes 18 compute trays (each consuming at least 6.6kW* of power, but requiring cooling for 6.2kW*) and 9 switch trays — totals $49,860.

Cooling contents of a compute tray are valued at around $2,260; hence, cooling components for all 18 compute trays cost $40,680. By contrast, a cooling system for an NVSwitch tray costs $1,020, so all cooling components for switch trays are priced at around $9,180. As expected, the most expensive cooling components for AI servers are tailor-made high-performance cold plates for CPUs and GPUs that cost $300 per unit, as well as for NVSwitch ASICs that cost $200 per unit.

Thermals will grow further in the Vera Rubin NVL144 platform that will rely on hotter Vera CPUs, Rubin GPUs (up to 1,800W per unit), and next-generation NVSwitch 6.0 ASICs, bringing the cost of the rack-scale cooling system to $55,710, up 17% compared to the cooling system for the GB300, according to Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley expects the cost of the compute tray's cooling system to increase by 18%, to $2,660 per tray, bringing the total per-rack compute cooling to $47,880. The number of trays remains the same, but each one now includes higher-capacity cold plates that cost $400 per unit. By contrast, the switch tray cooling system is expected to get cheaper: $870 per tray and $7,830 per rack.

As CPUs and GPUs gain performance, they also gain power consumption, so they require more and more advanced cooling solutions. The transition from GB200 NVL72 to GB300 NVL72 (+20% for the cooling system) and from GB300 NVL72 to Vera Rubin NVL144 (+17%) marks this upward trend very noticeably.

Starting with Rubin Ultra GPUs, Nvidia is set to transition to four compute and 16 HBM4E chiplets per package, thus increasing TDP to 3,600W, which will require new cold plates or even the use of immersion or embedded cooling, at least for some use cases. Nvidia itself is preparing an all-new liquid-cooled NVL576 'Kyber' rack-scale solution with 144 GPU packages that will double performance compared to Vera Rubin NVL144 (which carries 72 GPU packages), but at the cost of much higher thermal draw. Exotic cold plates for Nvidia's Rubin Ultra GPUs and other enhancements to their cooling system will likely increase the cost of NVL576's cooling system. How much will it cost is something that remains to be seen, but high-performance cold-plates capable of removing 3.6kW of thermal energy from a GPU package will certainly cost significantly more than $400 per unit.

Projects using government funds must now deploy only domestic accelerators.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China has reportedly issued a sweeping ban on foreign AI chips in any data center backed by government money, according to a report by Reuters. The move applies retroactively to builds still in early stages, meaning accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel may need to be removed or replaced if already installed.

The report, citing unnamed sources with direct knowledge, claims regulators have instructed state-funded projects to use only Chinese-made silicon going forward. That includes domestic chips from Huawei, Cambricon, and Enflame, among others.

While the official directive has not been published, the guidance would mark a formal shift from earlier policies that merely discouraged foreign chip purchases. Under the new dictat, even parts like Nvidia's H20 — a model specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls — will now be off the table. This follows Chinese port crackdowns on all Nvidia imports in early October.

Projects that are less than 30% complete are allegedly being told to abandon or remove any foreign chips already in use. For Nvidia, which once held more than 90% of China's AI accelerator market, that effectively kills prospects for a comeback via more custom silicon. Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's Chinese market share has effectively plummeted to zero.

The guidance appears to target not only the H20, but also Nvidia's higher-end H200 and B200, which are restricted under U.S. export rules but have still made their way into Chinese data centers through unofficial channels. That flow of gray-market parts may now face stricter internal scrutiny, with implications for training clusters already under construction.

Over the past two years, China has funneled more than $100 billion into AI infrastructure projects, most of them aligned with provincial or national goals for data sovereignty. That public investment is what gives Beijing's directive real teeth. But while Chinese chipmakers have made strides, they continue to trail Nvidia and AMD in software tooling and performance density. Huawei's Ascend line, often cited as the most mature domestic option, still lacks full parity with CUDA-based stacks.

The directive comes amid heightened U.S.-China tech tensions and a broader global reordering of AI supply chains. It remains unclear whether the new policy will eventually extend to privately funded deployments.

Motorized AI webcam makes life feel dynamic again.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new documentary featuring ALS patient Brad Smith has been published today. You may already know of Smith, as he was featured by Tom's Hardware back in May after successfully using the Neuralink brain computer interface (BCI) to edit videos with added AI-voice narration. Now, Smith has teamed up with Insta360 to produce “a second pair of eyes,” as you can see in the short film below.

Smith's powerful 8-minute video documents both the practical and heart-warming benefits of movable AI camera technology for those afflicted by ALS. Having a second pair of eyes has been life-changing for this devoted husband and father's experience of family life.

ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease (in the U.S.), or Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in the UK. Scientists don't know the cause of ALS, nor a cure. However, even with the best treatment, those afflicted can reach a stage where they are unable to eat or breathe.

Smith has been confined to a wheelchair for the last seven years. In November 2024, he became the third-ever Neuralink BCI patient. As indicated in our intro, this new technology was quickly embraced by Smith, and back in May, we reported on his newfound YouTube video editing skills. These were augmented by an AI recreation of Smith's voice, allowing the non-verbal ALS patient to provide narration.

As well as not being able to move around or speak, Smith began to feel particularly constrained by being unable to turn his head, to engage naturally with his children during conversations. “Trapped in a static world, while life continued dynamically around me,” is how Smith poetically describes this situation. Moreover, he feared being an absent father “even while being physically present.”

 




At around five minutes into the documentary, we hear that Smith's research into solutions led him to investigate the Insta360 Link 2. He sums up the appeal of this well-regarded webcam as a “small, movable webcam… to regain a view of my surroundings.”

Using one of the best webcams and with the engineering help of Insta360, Smith has happily been able to start to “look around, take photos and videos, and engage with my family in ways I couldn't before, restoring a sense of mobility in my gaze.”

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Some examples of the enhanced presence and interaction opportunities are shown in the documentary. For example, the video shows Smith panning the camera view to see his children's merrymaking, becoming more of a part of daily family life.

Actually, Smith comments that he has felt a “dramatic change” in interactions with his children and wife since the Insta360 Link 2 became integrated with his MacBook and Eyegaze system setup. He feels more connected, more useful in the family, and can even participate to outdoor events. Overall, Smith seems especially satisfied that his Insta360 collab has helped him in “reclaiming my role as the family storyteller.”

Steph  Weber

 November 05, 2025  

A group of Montana healthcare workers says the state-mandated monitoring program designed to help them recover from addiction instead subjects them to “punitive, expensive, and clinically unwarranted” practices, according to a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court on October 28.

These programs were first developed as physician health programs (PHPs) for doctors struggling with substance use and mental health disorders. Over time, states and licensing boards expanded them to nurses, pharmacists, and other clinicians to help them recover and ensure safe practice.

The lawsuit reflects broader concerns from healthcare workers who say that seeking this type of help is prohibitively costly and threatens their professional reputations. 

States take different approaches to monitoring programs, with some administering them internally and others contracting with vendors, leading to variation in oversight and enforcement.

The plaintiffs — anesthesiologist Christopher Thacker, MD, and 10 nurses — allege that Montana's program vendor, Maximus, Inc., a Virginia-based government contractor, “placed profit ahead of participant safety and recovery” by imposing requirements that were not evidence-based, blocking access to records, and interfering with their ability to work.

The plaintiffs' attorney, Gregory Pinski, declined to comment or make his clients available for an interview. A Maximus spokesperson said the company cannot comment on pending litigation.

Maximus manages Medicaid and other state and federal contracts, but details about its role in clinician-monitoring programs are limited. The company has paid more than $48 million in penalties since 2000, including False Claims Act settlements over its handling of government contracts.

Concerns about how Maximus monitors clinicians are not unique to Montana. 

Nurses in California raised concerns last year about high program costs, including $300 per month for drug testing and fines exceeding $3000, as reported by KQED. Some nurses said they were forced to forfeit their licenses because they could not comply with the strict, expensive guidelines.

Another nurse told CalMatters that she paid more than $8000 in drug testing fees and thousands more for medical and psychological evaluations. Posters on Reddit called the company's practices “draconian” and a “racket,” with one nurse alleging to have paid Maximus $26,000 in fees.

J. Wesley Boyd, MD, PhD, senior lecturer at the Department of Global Health and Science Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, told Medscape Medical News that there is increasing awareness of “very real flaws” in how monitoring programs function. 

“Before 2012, you couldn't find a single piece of peer-reviewed literature or media critical of PHP practices,” said Boyd, who researches physician impairment and rehabilitation. “Now folks who realize that they are not being treated fairly can [see] they are not alone, they're not crazy, and they actually have legitimate concerns.”

Montana approved a 3-year, $1.63-million contract with Maximus in late 2022, with operations beginning in January 2023. 

State lawmakers expressed reservations about the partnership earlier this year after a Legislative Audit Division report found that the monitoring program experienced “significant organizational instability” from 2021 to 2023 during multiple vendor changes.

For more than three decades before that, a Billings-based nonprofit ran the program for physicians, later expanding to include dentists and, in 2017, nurses and pharmacists, the report noted. The state declined to renew the longtime contract in late 2021, after employees accused the nonprofit's director of harassment and discrimination, and an investigation found reasonable cause to believe that sex-based discrimination and retaliation occurred. 

After the contract ended and the nonprofit dissolved, Montana's Department of Labor and Industry (DLI) assumed program administration in 2022 until the for-profit vendor Maximus took over in 2023, the audit report said. 

“Injecting the profit motive into a situation where folks generally have no choice but to comply with any and every recommendation you make if they want to be able to continue practicing is a recipe for abusive practices,” said Boyd. 

Guidelines from the Federation of State Physician Health Programs (FSPHP) recommend that monitoring programs be based in the same state as the regulatory agency and operate without “the purpose of making a profit.”

Members of Montana's Board of Medical Examiners questioned whether the abrupt transition left some participants unsupported and, at times, unmonitored, according to the audit. Participants told audit officials that Maximus' approach felt punitive, citing unfair treatment, inconsistent guidelines, and unrealistic expectations for perfect compliance. 

The complaint claims the company lacks meaningful appeal processes, imposes arbitrary sanctions that prolong treatment, and engages in “excessive monitoring and profiteering” by using costly toxicology tests that are not clinically indicated. The plaintiffs say those practices cause financial and emotional harm that threatens their livelihood.

The lawsuit also alleges that one participant died by suicide in January and that Maximus did not appropriately report the incident to DLI.

Despite criticisms, many clinicians still find value in the programs. A 2022 study in the American Journal on Addictions found that 85% of physicians viewed their PHP experience favorably 5 years after completing it but noted out-of-pocket costs ranged from $250 to $321,000.

Monitoring programs should remove financial conflicts of interest with treatment centers and adhere to enforceable national standards with independent audits, said Boyd. Clinicians also need an affordable, timely way to appeal decisions, he said, beyond hiring attorneys and going to court.

Christopher Bundy, MD, MPH, FAPA, FASAM, executive medical director of the Washington Physicians Health Program and chief medical officer of FSPHP, told Medscape Medical News that monitoring programs should contain key safeguards, such as regulatory independence, transparent policies, and individualized, evidence-based monitoring.

He said that Washington's program sets clear expectations from the outset, including mechanisms for reviewing or appealing decisions and for accessing second-opinion assessments.

“While PHPs are often criticized as being costly, the reality is that the lion's share of the cost burden is attributable to the specialized evaluation and treatment that physicians and other safety-sensitive workers require in order to credibly verify their safety to practice,” he said. “This is not a problem of the PHPs' making. Rather, it underscores opportunities for healthcare employers and health insurance plans to do more to alleviate these cost burdens and support the workforce.”

In October, a state advisory council unanimously recommended extending Maximus' contract through 2026 while it reviews the program, according to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. It is unclear whether the recommendation has been approved.

Provincial governments that partnered with for-profit virtual healthcare companies, and those considering doing so, must be cautious to protect public trust, experts warned in a new analysis.

“To address the primary care access crisis, some provincial governments have partnered with virtual care corporations to provide formalized pathways to phone-, video-, and text messaging-based medical care,” wrote Lauren Lapointe-Shaw, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues.

“However, there are risks associated with direct-to-consumer virtual ‘walk-in' care, related to access, quality of care, and data privacy,” they wrote. “These risks require careful consideration, particularly as formal partnerships could further entrench corporate virtual care within Canadian healthcare systems.”

Lapointe-Shaw noted that corporate partnerships “arose out of provincial governments facing primary care access challenges for their populations. Partnerships offered a way to quickly expand some form of primary care access.

“However, where healthcare budgets are fixed, increasing access to one form of primary care can come at the cost of further investment in other forms of care, such as high-continuity primary care, which has demonstrated benefits across a range of outcomes,” she told Medscape News Canada. “As well, the relatively frictionless nature of corporate virtual care means that there is a greater risk of supply-induced demand, where patients seek more care for minor and self-resolving conditions, such as viral upper respiratory tract infections.” 

The analysis was published November 3 in CMAJ.

Researchers identified current partnerships between corporate care platforms and provincial or territorial governments after doing a structured Web search in November 2024. They defined a corporate virtual care partnership with a provincial government as cases that met the following criteria: Virtual healthcare services were provided by a shareholder-owned corporation, such as Telus or Teladoc Health Canada, not a physician medical professional corporation; they had a formal contract; and they provided services endorsed on the government's official health services website.

Ongoing corporate virtual care partnerships were identified in the following four Canadian provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Even though the stated reason for establishing corporate virtual care partnerships was to support primary care access, the partnership models varied and had benefits and risks.

For example, although virtual care services were provided free of charge to patients who were not registered on a primary care clinician's roster (ie, unattached patients), New Brunswick offered two corporate-provided virtual care programs, one of which offered services to both unattached and attached patients. Another program offered virtual and in-person appointments to patients on the primary care wait list. By contrast, in Nova Scotia, the corporate provider had two tiers of care, one of which was available to unattached patients for on-demand virtual visits. 

Information on other services and pricing was sparse for all the programs.

The potential benefits of these partnerships, according to the authors, may include increased convenience and access for patients who cannot travel to their nearest primary care clinic or hospital, such as those with mobility issues, those who can't take time off work, and those who need to arrange childcare.

The authors identified several potential risks, however. One relates to access to and equity of care, since video- and text-based visits benefit those who are confident working digitally, have high internet bandwidth, and have a device that can connect to the internet. Virtual-only walk-in care also can create demand that might not otherwise have existed, which has implications for healthcare system use and costs.

These partnerships also entail risks related to the safety and quality of care, particularly when access to medical records is limited and there is no physical examination or relationship between the patient and physician. Privacy and transparency risks also arise, since virtual care corporations are private, investor-owned third-party companies with an incentive to generate profits. Finally, the partnerships entail higher risks for patients with limited fluency in the clinician's language, those with disabilities, and those with complex pre-existing conditions.

Governments must be aware that when they partner with corporate care providers, “endorsement of the quality of services they provide is implied,” the authors wrote. 

“Corporate virtual partnerships may also further entrench private companies within the broader healthcare system, becoming a permanent fixture even if provinces later improve access to full-service longitudinal primary care,” they continued. “Ongoing checks and balances are necessary to ensure standards are met and rules are not breached.”

Furthermore, Lapointe-Shaw said, “ We do not know how well on-demand virtual care works in comparison to other forms of last-resort care, such as walk-in clinics and going to the emergency department.

“Walk-in clinics and emergency departments have higher operating costs but allow for a physical exam to be completed, which is essential in the assessment of many conditions,” she continued. “Information on the effectiveness and efficiency of last-resort care across these settings for those without a regular source of primary care could inform the development of better care pathways.” 

For now, she said, “Most important is improving overall transparency [of these partnerships], including being transparent about the terms of virtual care contracts as well as ensuring independent evaluation of corporate virtual care processes and health outcomes achieved.”

Onil Bhattacharyya, MD, PhD, director of the Women's College Hospital Institute for Health Systems Solutions and Virtual Care and associate professor at the University of Toronto, Canada, commented on the article for Medscape Medical News.

“While there are legitimate risks in partnering with the private sector, particularly regarding data privacy and security, the ability to respond quickly may be advantageous, given staffing constraints and rising demand in many regions,” he said. Bhattacharyya did not participate in drafting the article. 

“If the overarching goal in Canada is to increase patient attachment and strengthen capacity for comprehensive primary care, it is essential to ‘right-size' episodic virtual care programs, corporate or not, so they do not take away human resources from comprehensive primary care delivery,” he said. “For this to happen, these programs need to be flexible and responsive to changing demand, which may make corporate partnerships attractive at certain points in time.”

That said, he added, many of the issues highlighted in the article (ie, limited access, lack of system integration, usability challenges, costs, and concerns around safety and quality) also apply to noncorporate, government-funded virtual care programs. “The main difference is that these programs are not driven by profit or data monetization, though they also tend to move more slowly, which can limit their ability to scale.”

Corporate healthcare partnerships are not limited to virtual care, he noted, pointing to Medavie Health Services New Brunswick, which provides land and ambulance services, home health services, community paramedic programs, 911 services, and telehealth services. 

“These models thrive in part because current primary care models are underdesigned and often subscale, because of the ad hoc structure of most clinics,” he said. “Incorporating a range of communication channels such as voice, video, and text, as well as in-person care, with new workflows could increase access, comprehensiveness, and continuity, but it will require substantial investment and ongoing iteration on how care is organized and delivered.”

Lapointe-Shaw reported receiving research funding from the PSI Foundation and a grant from INSPIRE-PHC. She also reported salary support from the PSI Foundation Graham Farquharson Knowledge Translation Fellowship and the Myrna Daniels Seniors' Emergency Medicine Centre at the University Health Network. Bhattacharyya reported no relevant financial relationships.

The competitiveness of different specialties is constantly changing. Let's talk about which specialties are becoming increasingly more competitive.

Number one is psychiatry. Psychiatry is becoming more and more popular, and this could be for a number of reasons. It could be for its availability to be a telemedicine practice or an in-person practice, and its quality of life is very favorable to many applicants; therefore, it's becoming more competitive.

Another specialty that is also becoming more competitive is ob/gyn. People think this might be due to the state of politics right now in our country and more people wanting to go into this field.It actually had a 99% fill rate, which is higher than most other years for ob/gyn residencies. That is just showing how much people are really wanting to go into this field.

How on-pitch talent and behind-the-scenes support helped Cape Verde become the second smallest nation to reach the World Cup

The scenes at the Estadio Nacional were jubilant last month. More than 15,000 fans, draped in Cape Verde blue, roared in the stands. The players on the pitch - hailing from all over the world but united to play for this side - hugged, danced and partied. They were from Ireland, North America and Cape Verde itself. 

The tiny island country had, improbably, qualified for the World Cup. It was a human triumph, the culmination of a footballing nation that had built year on year. Cape Verde had flirted with World Cup qualifying a few years before. They were a rising power in the African Football Federation. Their own governing body had made strides on and off the pitch to piece together a side - and a system - that would allow for sustained success. 

But behind it all was a real, sincere sense of global support. Cape Verde's success was certainly organic, but was also buoyed by the financial support and extensive infrastructure of FIFA Forward. Yes, the players on the pitch deserve the credit. But they wouldn't have a pitch to play on, facilities to train in, or exhibition fixtures to fine tune their craft without FIFA, which benefited one of the best footballing stories in recent memory. 

It must be emphasized, first, that this was very much a victory for the people of Cape Verde. They are the second smallest nation by population to qualify for a World Cup (pipped narrowly by Iceland to the top spot). They achieved independence from Portugal in 1975. They have had a football federation since 1982.

They didn't join FIFA until 1986. And they have been involved in World Cup qualification fixtures for just more than 20 years. 

Recency has certainly has its impact. But this has also been a quick rise to global prominence. They qualified for the African Cup of Nations in 2013. That year, they made the quarterfinals. In 2023, they also advanced to the last eight - and lost to South Africa on penalties. And under current qualifying criteria, they would have had a shot to play on the world's stage four years ago. 

“With the first World Cup campaign, it was the old format where only five teams could qualify,"" defender Roberto Lopes said. ""I mean, I already missed out on the play-off spot to Nigeria. But I think, off the back of our two Africa Cup of Nations (performances), we gained some confidence, saying that we can mix with the best teams. So, we didn't fear who was in our group.""

There was an overwhelming sense that this has been coming. But that takes nothing away from what has happened this year. Head coach Pedro Leitao Brito, ""Bubista"", was born in Cape Verde and played for the national team for 16 years. He understands what this all means.

""It's a victory that will lift our self-esteem,” Bubista said after his side secured qualification. “We know we're still dealing with a lot of difficulties here. We're a small country, but it's only small on the map… a small country with a big heart.""

That they are. But for as much as Bubista and Co. have made all of the right moves - scouting, tactics, performing on the pitch - they have needed help. That is where FIFA comes in. There are countless countries every year that apply for membership, or that make the right moves to do so. But the barriers, mostly infrastructure and financial support, often lead to denials.

FIFA has tried to change that, federation by federation, and country by country. That takes money. The governing body has come up with ways to help, starting with the FIFA Forward program, a designated fund that works to ensure that football development is possible in the nations that might not have the pieces in place to grow.

It could mean anything from pitches to play on to kits to wear. Africa, in particular, has been a beneficiary. FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced last month that more than $1 billion has gone towards the African Football Federation and its 54 member associations in the last decade.

As part of the project, FIFA estimated they would open 20-30 football academies by 2027. As of 2025, they have established 40, and 10 African teams could qualify for the World Cup. Representatives from 19 African nations competed at the Club World Cup last summer. 

""Huge success this summer with four African teams,"" Infantino said last month. ""But almost, I would say, more important, with African countries represented in the 32 clubs from all over the world.""

And Cape Verde is no different. Bubista said that when he first represented the national team, the country quite literally did not have kits to play in. This was a scrappy unit, with little money, scraping together what it could to organize friendlies and exhibitions. Growth, to be sure, has been organic. But FIFA has given them a lift. 

They have established artificial pitches on Santiago Island - one of a dozen islands that form the archipelagic state in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of West Africa - that have been used extensively for youth soccer. Their funding supported the renovation of the Aderito Sena Stadium, adding dressing rooms and seating that allowed the nation to host a 2022 World Cup qualifying fixture on home soil. 

More broadly, they have benefitted from participating in a pilot version of the FIFA Series, which allows teams from different federations to play friendlies against each other. There has been a backbone of support, with qualification coming due to their talent, their nous, and their belief. 

""This victory also belongs to everyone who did their part and helped us,"" Bubista said after the final whistle. ""In terms of organization, the federation has been doing a good job for everyone. When everything is in harmony, the players are united… all that helped us to get to this moment.""

Cape Verde might not be the only country to benefit. Getting into football federations is increasingly difficult. Staying there, though, is getting easier. And with every World Cup, the task gets a little lighter. FIFA Forward money comes from the global body's revenues, mostly the World Cup. It is distributed equally to member associations. 

The more money FIFA makes, in theory, the more it is able to distribute. A 48-team World Cup will have its critics, but there could be more Cape Verdes in the future. Member associations that have smaller revenues get more support for the basics: travel, accommodation, equipment. 

First time qualifiers Jordan and Uzbekistan have seen their soccer structures improved with financial injections. And last month, on a tiny island, a human triumph got a helping hand. And Cape Verde just might be the blueprint for sustained success.

“I always said - I've already had the chance to say this at a CAF Conference - that if there were more spots, the smaller countries would have a bigger chance to fight,"" Bubista said. ""It's not only us. There are other countries fighting for a place in other parts of the world.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

There are many ways to explain why so many managers connected to Pep Guardiola are running Europe's elite clubs at the same time. The simple version is that they all speak a common football language built on positional play, pressing triggers, and intense control of the ball and space. 

That language has forked into distinct dialects under different pupils and former players, yet the grammar remains Pep's. Tactical analysts have tracked how Guardiola's ideas have spread across the Premier League and into Europe, from the box-to-box midfield and inverted full-backs to more recent evolutions around rest defense and control without chaos. 

The league itself has publicly credited his influence on how English football thinks and trains, a shift that has made the top level faster and smarter. The coaching pipeline itself is well-documented. Mikel Arteta worked as Guardiola's assistant for three and a half years before taking Arsenal. Enzo Maresca coached within Manchester City's structure and adopted a possession-first model that mirrors Pep's principles. 

Two other heads of super clubs actually played under Guardiola and chose to learn at close range in their final years. Xabi Alonso said explicitly that he went to Bayern to learn from Pep, a line that has aged well now that Alonso is making major calls from Real Madrid's bench. 

Mikel Arteta's Arsenal are not a carbon copy. The framework is Guardiola's, but the application is Arteta's. Arsenal lean into wide overloads, ferocious pressing waves, and an obsession with set-piece gains, a notable divergence from Pep's City this season. 

Analysts who follow coaching detail have shown how Arteta has expanded the model rather than merely borrowing it, blending positional play with English tempo and muscular duels. 

The updated context matters. As of today, Arsenal sit at the top of the Premier League table after ten matches with an 8-1-1 record and a goal difference of plus 15. 

The pack is tight behind them, yet the Gunners have earned clear early control of the race. This is not nostalgia for last season, it is the present state of the league table on November 5, 2025. 

The line that connects Arteta to Guardiola is visible on the grass. Arsenal can morph into a box midfield, ask a full back to step inside, and compress the match into a 30-meter block. 

They also differ in emphasis. City have famously not leaned into heavy set-piece returns this campaign, while Arsenal squeezes value from them whenever the flow stalls, a neat illustration of how pupils adapt the teacher's blueprint to their own squad build. 

Vincent Kompany captained Guardiola's greatest City sides, then took the ideas to the touchline. Bayern Munich hired him in 2024 and doubled down by extending his deal through 2029 this autumn. 

The result is a juggernaut that has recovered its familiar aura without losing a modern feel. Bayern have started the 2025 26 Bundesliga with perfection, and they are top of the table after nine league games with maximum points and a goal difference that looks like a champion's. This is not a prediction, it is what the official table shows as we speak. 

It is not just math. Reporters described Bayern's 3 0 statement against Bayer Leverkusen last weekend as another mile marker in a record winning run, achieved even while resting stars to manage the Champions League rhythm. They beat PSG 2-1 last night with 10 men to make it 16/16. 

That blend of ruthless control and smart load management feels very familiar to anyone who watched Guardiola build City's winning machine. Kompany is not just copying routines. 

He has simplified Bayern's high press into repeatable triggers, asked his center backs to be brave at the line, and kept a vertical threat on at least one wing so the possession never becomes sterile. 

The big idea is continuity shaped by personality. Kompany absorbed Pep's insistence on field occupation and circulation speed, then fused it with his defender's eye for defensive distances. 

The outcome is a team that denies counterattacks before they start and still explodes when the opening appears. That is the Guardiola school in a nutshell. 

Xabi Alonso is the most elegant proof that Pep's tree is thriving beyond Manchester. Alonso did not coach under Guardiola; he studied under him as a player at Bayern and said he had come to learn. 

A decade later, he is the head coach at Real Madrid, appointed on a three-year contract in May, and his team is currently leading La Liga after 11 games. The mix is Alonso's own, with Madrid leaning into vertical switches and early releases to the front, yet the positional discipline from those Bayern years remains. 

The lesson is that Guardiola's influence is not a clone factory. Alonso's Madrid look like Madrid should look, with more direct punch and a willingness to race through open doors. 

The shared DNA shows up in how they compress space around the ball, how the sixes and eighths keep passing lanes alive, and how the back line holds nerve in build-up. That is coaching lineage, not imitation. 

Enzo Maresca is the other branch to watch in England. Chelsea hired him on a five-year deal after his Leicester title, betting on a defined identity. His Chelsea have embraced a patient positional game that at times tests the crowd, yet the principles are coherent.

The high rest defense, the focus on third man runs, and the precise spacing out of possession are all hallmarks of the school. The learning curve is real with a young squad, and yet the league table has them in the European chase pack right now. 

Stacked with a Conference League title and the FIFA Club World Cup trophy, his time at London has been a success. 

Chelsea's current spot is not a headline position as of today yet this is where the Guardiola tree is most interesting. The project stage does not contradict the idea that the tree is thriving. 

It shows how demanding the method is without the cohesion and seniority that City or Madrid enjoys. When the spacing is right and the midfield rotates on time, Chelsea look like a team that can pin opponents and create waves of advantage. 

When it is off by a beat, the structure can feel slow. That is the nature of this model in year one and year two. 

The wider picture is impossible to miss. Arsenal are first in England. Bayern are first in Germany. Real Madrid are first in Spain. All three are led by coaches who either worked under Guardiola or explicitly studied him up close. 

There is no need to force a myth. Guardiola is still competing, still adapting, still arguing with the trends he does not rate. His former assistants and former players are not simply running copies of the Etihad code. They are riffing on it. That is what real coaching trees do. They do not just grow, they branch in directions that prove the trunk is alive.

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens debate who are the 2026 World Cup favourites. (1:58)

FIFA has announced the creation of a peace prize, which it plans to award at the draw for the World Cup on Dec. 5 in Washington.

The award, called the FIFA Peace Prize, will ""recognize exceptional actions for peace,"" football's governing body said Wednesday.

""In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said.

FIFA said the award, which Infantino will present this year, will be bestowed annually ""on behalf of fans from all around the world.""

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has a close relationship with Infantino, was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize last month despite lobbying from fellow Republicans, various world leaders and himself. Infantino and Trump were both scheduled to speak at an unrelated event in Miami on Wednesday.

FIFA recently added another link to Trump by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100 million education project part-funded by 2026 World Cup ticket sales.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Tottenham defender Micky van de Ven has finally opened up on the moment he snubbed head coach Thomas Frank after the club's 1-0 loss to Chelsea last weekend. The Dutchman, who captained the side on the night, was part of a Spurs team that registered their lowest-ever expected goals tally in a Premier League match. Clearly frustrated, the defender blanked his manager and headed straight down the tunnel at full-time, to a chorus of boos in north London.

It was a night to forget for every Spurs player and fan as their fierce rivals, Chelsea, picked up another win at their home stadium. In the six years it has been open, the Blues have only ever lost once to Tottenham, and they barely had to get out of second gear to collect three points in the latest instalment. Van de Ven was caught up in the moment when their opponents scored their goal, losing the ball to Moises Caicedo before Joao Pedro opened the scoring. And with the crowd clearly frustrated at full-time, the giant defender, alongside team-mate Djed Spence, offered no appreciation for those who had sat and watched a difficult 90 minutes, despite Frank appearing to tell his players to show some recognition. 

However, the Spurs boss did reveal both players came and apologised the morning after. He said: ""Micky and Djed came into my office yesterday and just said they wanted to say sorry for the situation. They didn't want it to look bad or any misconception that you can get in this beautiful media world. So there was no disrespect meant at all towards me or the team. They were just frustrated with the performance from us and the booing during the game.

""If they didn't come in, of course I would have had to ask them about the situation they are working in. How they are feeling, why they are doing it? Because we all have a perception,"" he said. ""Whether it was because their mum wasn't well or they didn't like the head coach or they were irritated by the performance because they lost, or whatever. Of course, I am happy that they were coming in because that means they care - I think that is very good. They care about the team, the club and, in this case, me. I am happy with that.""

Tottenham responded admirably to the weekend's setback, with Van de Ven starring in the 4-0 win over Copenhagen in the Champions League. The performance included a Puskas Award contender from the defender, who channelled his inner Heung-Min Son, running the length of the pitch, beating a handful of players and slotting past the goalkeeper like a seasoned frontman. A wave of emotion could then be seen leaving the former Wolfsburg ace as he screamed in relief while sliding towards the celebrating Spurs fans.

Unsurprisingly, Van de Ven was summoned for post-match interviews with multiple media sites after the game, but he was also forced to answer for his actions at the end of Saturday's game. He said: ""To be honest it's in the past so I don't want to make it bigger than it is. Djed and I walked off, we were just frustrated after the game and everything got really exploded by the media, it was nothing big. Everyone thinks it was the gaffer - there was nothing to do with the gaffer. We were just frustrated after the game because of a bad performance, from myself as well. We want to play well and I didn't play well in my opinion so I was just frustrated and I just wanted to go quick inside. As I said, it got exploded by the media out of nowhere.""

Tuesday night's win comes at a timely moment for Spurs, who are home again on Saturday when they welcome Manchester United. The Red Devils will be looking for revenge, having lost four times to the London club last season - including in the Europa League final. Tottenham currently sit sixth in the Premier League table, only ahead of United on goal difference.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich mantain their perfect record so far in the Champions League after beating defending champion, PSG 2-1 this midweek. Meanwhile, Liverpool continue their positive result as they beat Real Madrid 1-0 at Anfield.

The Bavarians have been showing an impressive form in this early stage of the season, both in the Bundesliga and Europe. Vincent Kompany's side extended their winning run to 16 games in a row on Tuesday following an impressive win against PSG.

Playing away from home didn't stop Bayern from taking an attacking initiative as they went on the attack from the get-go. Bayern's aggressive approach was eventually rewarded as they went 1-0 up after just four minutes through Luis Diaz.

The Colombian international doubled his tally and put his team two goals up on 32 minute, but got himself sent off just before the half-time break following a tackle on Achraf Hakimi. Playing with 10 men forced Bayern to defend more as PSG increased their pressure to get back into the game.

The home team did manage to pull one goal back through Joao Neves in the 75th minute, but Luis Enrique's men couldn't get that equalizing goal. It's an impressive win for Bayern as they maintain their perfect record so far this season.

In the other Tuesday big match, Arne Slot's men were looking to continue their positive weekend result with another victory. Liverpool set up a more conservative approach against Los Blancos, and the Reds' strategy was a success.

Xabi Alonso's men struggled to break down the home team's defense, allowing Slot's boys to hit on the counter. Liverpool finally struck the blow midway into the second half with a goal from their star midfielder, Alexis McAllister.

That goal was enough to secure all three points for the Reds as they held down Madrid's barrage comfortably. It was an important result for Liverpool, especially after ending their recent Premier League winless drought last weekend.

The win against Los Blancos should give an extra confidence and motivation for the Reds for their upcoming matches.

UEFA Champions League Tuesday Results:

Napoli 0-0 Eintracht Frankfurt; Slavia Praha 0-3 Arsenal; Atletico Madrid 3-1 Union Saint-Gilloise; Olympiacos 1-1 PSV; Juventus 1-1 Sporting; PSG 1-2 Bayern Munich; Liverpool 1-0 Real Madrid; Bodo/Glimt 0-1 AS Monaco.

Sara Sorribes Tormo is to make her return to tennis this month following a six-month hiatus in which the Olympic doubles bronze medalist was diagnosed with depression. The former No. 32 plans to play the WTA 125 event in Colina, Chile starting on Nov. 17.

The Spaniard has not played since the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers in April, in which she won both her singles and doubles rubbers. In an interview with El Mundo, she said that after losing her passion for the sport, she was unsure if she would ever return.

""I couldn't even step onto a tennis court,"" Sorribes Tormo said. ""I'd wake up in the morning and think that the more hours I had until I could train, the better. I'd step onto the court and want to leave immediately. I'd go to training and not last more than 10 minutes. I'd burst into tears in the middle of training. After I'd been out for a month, I came to play here with my mother and lasted three minutes; I had a panic attack and we had to leave.

""It was killing me not to enjoy it, because I've always loved tennis and I've always played to try and improve. I lost that passion. I just wanted the hours to pass. It was like coming to clock in. I didn't want to be there. I didn't want to go to tournaments. That, combined with a lot of anxiety, made things very difficult.""

At first, almost completely out of energy, Sorribes Tormo could do little more than sleep all day. Whenever she thought she felt better, she'd relapse and need even more rest. For a player who'd made her reputation by tirelessly outlasting opponents on tour -- the 29-year-old's matches habitually passed the three-hour mark -- this was not a situation she was accustomed to.

""It was like nothing made sense,"" Sorribes Tormo told El Mundo.

Gradually, matters improved. There was ""a lot of therapy, a lot of internal reflection and a lot of personal work."" Sorribes Tormo set up a home gym so she could stay fit without leaving the house. She began to discover a love of hiking and headed out to do the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage solo -- an experience she describes as ""wonderful.""

A post shared by Sara Sorribes Tormo (@sarasorribes)

Getting away from the all-consuming nature of life as a tennis pro turned out to be the key to finding her way back to the sport. Sorribes Tormo returns to the circuit with an identity beyond her results.

""f things don't go well, if I decide this isn't what I want to do, I'm at peace,"" she said. ""Because I know there are other things out there, and I've already experienced them. I know that Sara can live without playing tennis, that I really enjoy life outside of tennis. I think that's fundamental to starting with. When you carry less baggage, you feel much lighter.""

Even with her semifinal spot secured, Elena Rybakina treated her final group match as unfinished business -- and closed out an undefeated run in Riyadh with her trademark precision.

Elena Rybakina had already secured a spot in the WTA Finals semifinals before taking the court Wednesday, but her final round-robin match still carried weight. Ranking points were on the line, along with the chance to preserve her perfect record in Riyadh.

Standing in her way: Ekaterina Alexandrova.

WTA Finals: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Despite entering the match with a losing record against Alexandrova, Rybakina continued her dominant run, winning 6-4, 6-4 in 1 hour and 14 minutes. The victory allowed her to finish with a perfect 3-0 mark in Serena Williams Group play. Rybakina was later joined by Amanda Anisimova, who ousted Iga Swiatek in three sets. 

“Every match I play, I want to win,” Rybakina said after the match. “Each win gives you confidence, so I'm really happy with that for now. The last few matches have been great and hopefully I can continue that.”

Rybakina had originally been scheduled to face Madison Keys, but tournament officials announced Keys had withdrawn hours before the match due to a viral illness.

""Really disappointed to not be feeling my best and ultimately having to withdraw from the tournament,” Keys said in a statement. ""Huge accomplishment to make it this far and very proud of myself for doing that and having a great year. I hope to be back next year.”





 WTA
                        

Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, went 0-2 in Riyadh, most recently falling in three sets to Amanda Anisimova. She had already been eliminated from semifinal contention.

The first alternate Mirra Andreeva declined to play, citing fitness concerns. That opened the door for second alternate Alexandrova to make her WTA Finals debut at age 30.

Still, the odds were stacked against Alexandrova. Rybakina had already acclimated to the conditions at King Saud University Indoor Arena and looked every bit a title contender through the early stages of the tournament.

Alexandrova arrived ready to play, winning the first six points and staying level with Rybakina through the first eight games. But Rybakina struck at the most opportune time, seizing her first break opportunity for a 5-4 lead before holding at love to close out the opening set in 35 minutes.

That break proved decisive, as Rybakina converted her lone chance while Alexandrova went 0-for-3.

In the second set, Alexandrova regrouped, holding serve to open with a 1-0 lead. But Rybakina broke twice to surge ahead 5-2. Serving for the match, she was broken for the first time, then faced two more break points while attempting to serve it out at 5-4.

Ultimately, a pair of aces -- her seventh and eighth of the match -- helped seal the win.

It was a strong effort from Alexandrova in her debut at the year-end championships, earning praise from her opponent.

“Ekaterina is always a tough opponent,” Rybakina said. “She has a big serve, and especially in the beginning it was difficult to return, so I'm pretty happy that I managed to win in two sets in the end.”

Rybakina finishes group play as the outright winner of the Serena Williams Group, dropping just one set en route to three consecutive top-10 victories.

Her latest win was her ninth over a Top 10 opponent in 2025, extending her career-high mark for a season. Since 1990, it's the most in a season by any player representing an Asian country, surpassing Li Na's eight in 2011 and 2013.

Even with her semifinal spot secured, Elena Rybakina treated her final group match as unfinished business -- and closed out an undefeated run in Riyadh with her trademark precision.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Following their engagement announcement, we take a closer look at Alexandra Saint Mleux –⁠ the art historian, fashion muse, and dog mum, whose stand-out looks over race weekends have made her a familiar face across the paddock.

On Sunday November 2, in an Instagram post that has over 6.3 million likes at the time of writing, Charles Leclerc announced his engagement to long-term parter Alexandra Saint Mleux.

A familiar face in the paddock, Alexandra is often seen cheering on her Ferrari-driver partner Leclerc from the garages. But beyond the world of F1, Alexandra is an art historian, influencer, and fashion icon in her own right.

So, who is the future Mrs Leclerc?

Born in Calais, France, in 2001, Alexandra has both French and Mexican roots. She pursued a degree in Art History at the prestigious Ecole du Louvre, where she specialised in the 20th-century art, studying the works of artists including Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe, Andy Warhol, and Henri Matisse.

Before her relationship with Charles Leclerc brought her into the F1 spotlight, she kept a modest online presence, where she occasionally shared moments from her life and travels while studying in Paris.

One of the couple's first public appearances was at Wimbledon in 2023, where the pair sat with friend Pierre Gasly and his partner, Francisca Gomez. And the rest, as they say, was history.

Known for her polished highly styled online presence, Alexandra maintains a carefully considered approach to social media. Her posts often highlight her interests, such as fashion, art, and travel, as well as appearances at events with friends and fellow paddock regulars, including Rebecca Donaldson, partner of Carlos Sainz.

Her passion for art history continues beyond her studies, and is evident on her dedicated Instagram account, @alexandramalenart, where she shares artwork and exhibitions that resonate with her. Professionally, she serves as Art Coordinator & Public Relations lead at Kamil Art Gallery in Monaco, reflecting her commitment to the art world.

Alongside her art career, Alexandra has become increasingly recognised within the fashion space. She has collaborated with brands such as Meshki, Rhode, and Nina Ricci, and has appeared in publications such as Vogue, People Magazine, and ELLE.

In the ELLE interview, Alexandra promoted her charitable fund, Corazones Unidos, which supports children across Mexico by providing access to quality education. Here, she spoke about the importance of giving back and explained that social media has given her “a sense of independence”, and that with that came a desire “to turn gratitude into action”.

The acknowledgement of the privilege that comes with her platform, and her commitment to using it for a positive impact, has resonated strongly with fans who admire both her talent and her purpose-driven outlook.

Alexandra is undoubtedly a fashion force to be reckoned with. Her style is effortless, chic, and elevated. Her fashion sense is the perfect mix of aspirational and attainable; you could imagine yourself wearing something similar at half the price. Alexandra also uses fashion to pay homage to the location she is in.

She regularly nods to local tradition or takes inspiration from cultural icons such as Frida Kahlo or Grace Kelly, weaving her art-historian's perspective into her approach to fashion. Here are some of her top fashion moments so far.

No story about Charles and Alexandra would be complete without mentioning their dog, Leo. The miniature long-haired dachshund joined the couple in April 2024 and has since become a familiar face in the paddock and on social media.

Whether he's running about the paddock on a race weekend or relaxing at their home, Leo is very much a member of the Leclerc-Saint Mleux family, even playing a small role in Charles' proposal!

Here are some of our favourite Paddock Pup moments.

After nearly three years of dating, Charles proposed in a romantic candlelit setting surrounded by red roses. The proposal included some thoughtful and personal touches – even Leo was part of the moment, adorably sporting a tag announcing “Dad wants to marry you!”

Since the announcement, the news has been met with joy and well-wishes from fans, friends, and others in the paddock. Drivers such as Carlos Sainz, Oscar Piastri, Esteban Ocon, and team mate Lewis Hamilton have all publicly congratulated the couple.

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

The final F1 driver to help Amelia Dimoldenberg learn to drive in her ‘Passenger Princess' series is Carlos Sainz.

First it was George Russell. Then Ollie Bearman. Then Oscar Piastri. And now, in the final episode of Passenger Princess, it's time for Carlos Sainz to teach Chicken Shop Date star Amelia Dimoldenberg how to drive like a proverbial boss.

Aboard a Mercedes SUV at the fearsome Spa-Francorchamps circuit, Sainz summons up all the expertise and knowledge gained from his four wins, six pole positions and 28 podiums overall in F1 to teach driving licence-less Dimoldenberg the skills she needs to finally pass her driving test.

Can the Williams racer succeed in turning Dimoldenberg from a passenger princess into a bona fide queen of the road?

28 times F1 drivers made incredible saves

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Interlagos is a circuit built for drama – high elevation, fast laps, and unpredictable weather. Which drivers and teams are ready to master the mayhem and deliver big in F1 Fantasy?

Formula 1 heads to Brazil for one of the most iconic stops on the calendar – the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. The historic Interlagos circuit is known for producing unpredictable races, with sudden rain showers, late Safety Cars, and bold overtakes shaping countless moments. So, who's set to thrive in F1 Fantasy this weekend – an F1 Sprint weekend too – as we approach the pointy end of the season?

At just over 4.3 kilometres long, Interlagos (officially the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace) is compact but relentless, with elevation changes and technical corners that punish mistakes. After a run of high-powered yet contrasting tracks that has led us through Europe, Asia and North America since the summer break, Brazil demands a different balance – one that rewards driver rhythm, set-up precision, and strategy under pressure.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Don't forget, George Russell's ‘Russell's Rivals' mini-league is still open to enter. The exciting three-race league, running from the US Grand Prix through to Las Vegas, will see the winner get an exclusive pair of Russell's race-worn boots! Keep your eyes peeled for exciting mini leagues opening throughout the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more opportunities to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

Interlagos' mix of medium and high-speed corners makes it one of the most balanced tracks of the year, favouring cars with both aerodynamic efficiency and mechanical grip. Overtaking is frequent but risky, and with unpredictable weather always in play, consistency and adaptability will be key for those hoping to capitalise on any late-race chaos.

Catch up on the Mexico City highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying begins on Saturday, November 8 at 1500 local time (1800 UTC).

A dominant display across the Mexico City weekend not only notched Lando Norris his sixth victory of 2025, but also propelled him back to the top of the World Drivers' Championship standings.

The McLaren driver recorded his 13th score of 30 or more fantasy points this season – a metric he leads all drivers in.

He has also recorded six fastest laps to his name in 2025 and will be well-positioned to add to his tally in both the Sprint and Grand Prix sessions, based on the strong pace he has demonstrated in recent weeks.

Norris will continue to flex his racing muscle in Brazil, now that he has wrestled the championship lead back in his favour.

This weekend  at Interlagos sees George Russell return to the site of his maiden Formula 1 race victory in 2022.

The Briton has been a pillar of consistency in F1 Fantasy this campaign. He has registered more than 15 fantasy points in 18 of the 20 race weekends this season – better than all other drivers on the grid in this benchmark.

The Mercedes star, who recently re-signed with the team, is the only driver on the grid to score at least 19 fantasy points in all four Sprint weekends this season.

Expect another reliable performance from the five-time Grand Prix winner, who has finished every race this season.

After an unfortunate expedition into the gravel trap during the formation lap in last year's Sao Paulo Grand Prix, Lance Stroll will be looking to make amends this time around in Brazil.

Encouragingly, Stroll averages 21 fantasy points in rain-affected race weekends this season (Australia, Miami, Silverstone), with this average in these races bested only by the McLaren pair and Nico Hulkenberg.

Although perhaps a luxury transfer for teams with a higher cost cap value because of his $8.5m price tag, the Aston Martin driver has flown under the radar recently, with fantasy scores of 14 and 10 in two of his last three race weekends.

Owned by a mere 10% of players in the game, Stroll can be an attractive differential asset – and a safe pair of hands – in what could be treacherous conditions across the race weekend.

Oliver Bearman's recent purple patch has netted him three consecutive points finishes in the World Drivers' Championship, which most recently included a career-best P4 last time out in Mexico.

Between the US and Mexico City Grands Prix, the rookie driver has banked 50 fantasy points, outpaced by only Charles Leclerc (77) and Max Verstappen (74) in that time.

The Haas racer is the best value driver in F1 Fantasy this season, averaging 1.25 points per $1 million spent for Bearman. He also requires at least -20 fantasy points for a $0.6m price rise this weekend.

On a weekend where we have previously witnessed wet weather wreak havoc along the grid, Bearman – a driver that is likely protected by a low points threshold for a price rise – is ready-made for your fantasy line-up.

Gabriel Bortoleto will be motivated by a wave of local support on home soil this weekend.

The Kick Sauber racer averages 10.3 fantasy points dating back to Hungary and has proven to be a fan favourite in his short Formula 1 career, posting two Driver of the Day awards in 2025 – he could be in contention for a third in front of a home crowd.

A word of warning: Bortoleto has failed to finish the Grand Prix in all three rain-affected weekends this season (Australia, Miami and Silverstone).

Encouragingly though, the rookie driver only needs -2 fantasy points or more for a $0.6m price rise this weekend and with an additional session to score points on the cards with the Sprint, he should be in the box seat for it.

Other drivers to monitor: Max Verstappen, Esteban Ocon

After several weeks dogged by inconsistency, McLaren turned things around in Mexico City to record their first victory since the Netherlands.

The disappointment of its 45% in-game ownership over the last three weekends, enduring fantasy scores of less than 65 points, was quickly erased with an 85-point haul on the back of a Norris race win and Piastri finishing fifth.

The Woking-based outfit also lead all teams in fast pit stop points per race between Singapore and Mexico City, averaging 10 fantasy points. With the two-stop strategy typically the most common in Brazil, this offers more opportunities for McLaren to continue their pit stop point stream this weekend.

Expect McLaren to once again feature at the front, as Norris and Piastri continue to tussle for the lead in the World Drivers' Championship.

Where other teams have struggled to string together consistent fantasy performances in recent weeks, Mercedes have been remarkably reliable.

The Toto Wolff-led team has scored at least 58 fantasy points in each of the last four race weekends, including posting the fastest lap (+10 points) in the last two.

As budgets tighten and chip use increases with the upcoming Sprints, value for money assets (Mercedes are the fourth-best constructor in the game at 1.86 points per $1 million) are going to be priority targets.

For F1 Fantasy players who may be a little behind on building their team cost cap, Mercedes can be a set-and-forget premium constructor at a relatively attainable price for the remaining races on the calendar.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Aston Martin

With rain in the forecast for Sao Paolo at the time of writing, the No Negative chip becomes extremely valuable if you are yet to use it this season. This chip resets any negative scoring categories (i.e., DNFs, positions lost) incurred by drivers and teams over the weekend to zero.

Negative scores tend to be more common in race weekends affected by wet weather. With an extra session of fantasy scoring too, which increases the likelihood of driver retirements and the dreaded -20 points assigned to a DNF, the No Negative protects you from that when activated.

Autopilot also provides an insurance policy on your 2X DRS Boost driver. In the event your selected driver struggled to post a competitive score in changeable conditions, this chip automatically re-assigns the 2X points multiplier to the highest scoring driver in your team.

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the earlier sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

	This Next Gen class is behind some of the year's biggest entertainment. You can thank Carina Sposato for the tears you cried watching the Netflix drama Adolescence, while Olivia Heighten spurred your car obsession after that Imax screening of F1.


	But maybe more impressive than their credits and A-list clients — CAA's Ben Levine handles all things Martha Stewart — is their ability to navigate an industry that continues to experience gale-force headwinds.


	There are fewer names from traditional studios like Warner Bros. and Paramount, as corporate cost-cutting continues to cull young talent, but these 35 upstarts are building their own companies (see: Mad Realities' Alice Ma and Redefine's Max Goldfarb) and making award-winning projects independently, like Anora producer Alex Coco. Just like the alums of this list — Donna Langley, Bela Bajaria and Ari Emanuel — they no doubt will lead this industry. And if they can survive (and thrive!) in Hollywood in 2025, then the future is in steady hands.

In a time when experiences are as important to Hollywood as film slates, the Emerson grad has built the ideal résumé, filling his workdays producing films like the upcoming Netflix holiday movie Jingle Bell Heist and ideating new podcasts with talent like Owen Thiele. After starting his career at Hello Sunshine, Bochner was hired by Unwell co-head Matt Kaplan and produced his first feature, Tommy Dorfman's I Wish You All the Best, which wrapped right before the Hollywood-halting labor strikes. With production shut down, Bochner, a self-proclaimed lover of tennis and “overpriced sweatpants,” was tapped to plan Cooper's first multi-city tour and produce what would become a multi-part documentary, Call Her Alex: “I'd never done a tour or a documentary, and now I'm doing both of these things at the same time.” The tour sold out, and the doc sold to Hulu.

Head of scripted TV and film, Omaha


LOGLINE Growing scripted offerings with crowd-pleasers like Chad Powers at the Peyton Manning outfit.


THE ARC Brown has long been confident in his ability to impact the sports world. Back in middle school, this led the lifelong Laker fan and son of a William Morris agent to write late owner Jerry Buss with suggestions for fixing the team. After a few more letters, Buss actually responded. “He said, ‘Don't worry, the Lakers will be on top again soon,' ” Brown recalls. “A couple of weeks later, they traded for Pau Gasol. It taught me persistence.” Now, the uber-ambitious University of Oregon grad, who did time at CAA and WWE, is busy building out Omaha's slate via its deal with 20th TV. First up was the Glen Powell-starring Hulu comedy series, which Brown executive produces. Brown says Omaha's slate won't be strictly sports-focused, and he praises the NFL Hall of Famer head, saying, “You could not have more of a dream boss than Peyton.”

Domestic programming exec, Apple TV


LOGLINE Helps steer shows like Shrinking and Margo's Got Money Troubles for the streamer.


THE ARC Burton's first love was theater. Growing up in San Jose, she was, by her own admission, a huge theater nerd, though she knew early on that, as she puts it, “I was not meant to be in front of any sort of camera.” So, she began producing plays in high school, and, later, made her way to Chapman University, where she set her sights on becoming a TV exec. After a series of internships (Sony, The Late Late Show) and early gigs (Paradigm, Lionsgate), Burton found herself on the ground floor of Apple TV. She remembers those early days fondly. “Six of us in a room being like, ‘What are we going to do?' It was so blue-sky and, honestly, so magical,” she says. In the eight years since, the now married exec, who still carves out plenty of time for theater, has been integral to projects like Shrinking, which, with all due respect to her husband, she calls “the love of my life.” Up next: a Margo's Got Money Troubles adaptation with Elle Fanning and a half-hour thriller with Tatiana Maslany.

Film exec, A24 


LOGLINE Acquires the indie outfit's award-winning offerings like Sing Sing and Aftersun. 


THE ARC The Washington, D.C., native long thought she would end up teaching film, not making films. After getting a master's from Kings College in London, she landed a gig at the Guggenheim, where she curated multimedia installations. (A personal favorite exhibit was “One Hand Clapping,” filled with Chinese video artists.) She had plans of getting a Ph.D. when a friend sent her a job opening at A24. While the jump from storied New York art institution to one of Hollywood's coolest film studios was not a well-worn path, Castaneda applied anyway. “I was like, ‘Why not?' They might find something interesting in my résumé,' ” she says. The exec is now a mainstay on the film festival circuit, from Park City to Berlin, acquiring titles like Talk to Me and Sorry, Baby. Castaneda also works on homegrown productions like the upcoming Glen Powell-John Patton Ford team-up and Robert Pattinson starrer Primetime. She says, “What drives me is being the home for these storytellers and championing them and their vision.”


FICTIONAL CHARACTER I IDENTIFY WITH “Ripley [from Alien].”


Senior vp production and development, Vertigo


LOGLINE Shepherds high-end horror like New Line's Companion and the Stephen King adaptation The Long Walk.


THE ARC After graduating from the University of Kansas, he made the move to L.A., where his biggest challenge came in adjusting to the city's parking: “I never got a single ticket in Kansas or Missouri and then got one every single day here.” The Joplin, Missouri, native has been at Vertigo since 2015, beginning as an assistant to horror megaproducer Roy Lee, getting a close-up look at making hits like It. Now, the father of a 4-month-old is packaging a remake of Possession with Robert Pattinson and a Night of the Living Dead revival for Amazon, where he is also overseeing Ronald D. Moore's God of War series. “I love the idea of having the latitude to move from passion projects and elevated genre movies to franchises and the IP that I love,” says Childs.

Producer


LOGLINE After years (and a best picture win) with Sean Baker, he brings his producing chops to first-time and veteran indie filmmakers. 


THE ARC What do beloved auteur Baker and TikToker turned pop star Addison Rae have in common? Coco. Last year, the Connecticut native, who found his love for filmmaking in high school, had producing credits on Baker's Anora, which netted him an Oscar, and Rae's music video for “Diet Pepsi,” directed by Sean Price Williams (Coco also produced Williams' Cannes-bowing The Sweet East). Coco, who last year welcomed his first child, met Baker as a grad student at USC's film school. “A couple days after I graduated, I drove out to Florida to work on The Florida Project as Sean's assistant,” says Coco. He jumped to full-fledged producer on the next film, Red Rocket, and reteamed for Anora. Says Coco, who's wrapping up production on Jordan Firstman's feature debut, Club Kid, “I want to keep supporting these filmmakers, whatever the budget or scale.”

Director, drama series, Netflix


THE ARC While other teen boys in Sydney, Australia would be on their phones looking up sports scores, Flannery remembers checking his for overnight ratings of U.S. TV shows. By 14, the son of an Aussie news reader was already obsessed with the machinations of TV pilot season, which he'd follow closely from afar – even making his own grids with predictions about which pilots would get picked up. Out of what he calls “a mix of delusion and ambition” in his early 20s, he applied and was accepted into the prestigious Peter Stark Producing Program at USC. From there, a brief stint at WME made clear agency work wasn't his calling. In 2018, Flannery jumped to Netflix, where he has risen swiftly. In that time, the exec – who swears by an extracurricular diet of pilates and travel – has been integral to shows like Maid, You and XO Kitty, along with upcoming, high-profile adaptations of Harlan Coben and Dan Brown novels.

Manager, Underground


LOGLINE Finds hidden gems before anyone else— like YouTuber turned TIFF breakout Curry Barker


THE ARC Late one night, Folbe was skimming Reddit when he came across a 4-year-old horror story written by English teacher Joe Cote. The movie buff and history major from Michigan knew the Gone Girl-style tale would make a good movie and DM'd the teacher. Now, it's set up at Warner Bros. with Sydney Sweeney and Forrest Gump scribe Eric Roth. In his 18 months as a manager, Folbe, who did early stints at ICM and Artists First, has sold a stunning number of projects. In many ways, he is like his clients, upstarts who punch above their weight class. The Cooper Brothers sold a high-concept short story to Amazon and Ryan Gosling, while Daniel Gold, Folbe's friend from summer camp, sold Tough Guys to Amazon with Gosling and Will Ferrell starring. His splashiest deal yet came at TIFF, where client Barker, whom he discovered years earlier thanks to his YouTube comedy sketches, sold his horror Obsession to Focus Features for nearly $15 million just days after Blumhouse and Weapons producer Roy Lee preemptively bought Barker's next script. The manager keeps his client list small, and is known for two-hour notes meetings to hone ideas.

Talent agent, UTA


LOGLINE Steers the careers of skyrocketing performers like Monica Barbaro. 


THE ARC Seeing the musical Wicked at age 15 was a turning point for Gates. “I became completely obsessed with this actress named Idina Menzel,” she says. Now, Gates is obsessed with her own clients, serving as a guiding force for talent like the Oscar-nominated Barbaro, Anora breakout Yura Borisov and Severance favorite Britt Lower. When she's not negotiating deals, Gates can be found reading (her Kindle, stacked with Kristin Hannah and Dolly Alderton titles, is never far) or hanging out at her West Hollywood home with her husband, fellow UTA agent Joe Grossman, and their 75-pound cuddly pit bull, Hippo.

Partner, Range 


LOGLINE A master of all things digital, Gayoso manages talent like streamer Valkyrae and recently launched a marketing division. 


THE ARC “I was fully convinced I was going to be Ryan Seacrest,” says Gayoso of his longtime love of singing competition shows. That plan changed after meeting the head of the agent trainee program at UTA during his last year at Notre Dame. After a stint as an assistant in the agency's digital department, the O.C. native jumped to Meta, where he courted creators like MrBeast to Facebook and helped launch Reels on Instagram. In 2020, Gayoso, who could have a side hustle as a matchmaker, having set up 26 of his friends who are now either married or in long-term relationships, joined Range to lead the company's digital efforts, guiding clients like Brooklyn Beckham. Most recently, he launched a social media-focused marketing division targeting a young audience for clients that range from Neon to Applebee's. 


MOST HOLLYWOOD EXPERIENCE “I didn't have any money to move to L.A. after college, so I auditioned for the Heads Up! game show and subsequently won the grand prize of $10,000. That money became my deposit for my first apartment and helped subsidize my mailroom salary.”

Co-founder & manager, Redefine Entertainment


LOGLINE After co-founding his own company, Goldfarb manages a stable of fast-rising writ – ers like Blue Beetle's Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. 


THE ARC Goldfarb's English degree from Bates College with a concentration in poetry writing “was every parent's nightmare,” says the manager. “But it gives me an appreciation of the writers I work with — the blank page is terrifying.” Filling his own blank page took some doing. After starting in the Gersh mailroom, stints at CAA and the Gotham Group followed. It was at the latter that he signed Juel Taylor and landed the scribe a co-writing gig on Creed II, all while he was still an assistant. Since leaving to launch Redefine in 2021, his clients have worked nonstop: Dunnet-Alcocer is creating The Boys: Mexico City spinoff for Amazon, while Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier are writing the Hot Wheels movie for producer J.J. Abrams at Warner Bros.

Co-head of film, Picturestart


LOGLINE Wrangling projects like the Sundance hit Together and Kim Kardashian's Bratz movie. 


THE ARC Hammer's dad had a decidedly non-Hollywood path in mind for her when encouraging her to study Mandarin in middle school.  “Doing diplomatic work was always the Sliding Doors path for me,” she says. Instead, the NYC native wrote her Princeton undergrad thesis on Chinese avant-garde theater and then spent a year earning her master's in China. While she was there, she picked up a gig tutoring a Chinese actress in English on a film set. With this taste of filmmaking under her belt, Hammer soon moved to L.A., where she now shepherds features like the Sundance hits Theater Camp and Together. Up next is A24's Edgar Allan Poe adaptation Masque of the Red Death with Mikey Madison. When she's not working, Hammer and her husband spend time with their border terrier, who came into their lives after the puppy wrapped on a Picturestart production, Will Ferrell's talking dog comedy Strays.

LOGLINE Entrusted with big-budget blockbusters, from F1 to a Highlander reboot.


THE ARC The Dallas-raised exec grew up on a diet of Jerry Bruckheimer blockbusters, so it was particularly special to travel the world as a studio exec on the uber-producer's latest, F1, shooting at real races. Heighten's Hollywood résumé also includes stints at CAA and Netflix's big-budget movie division, where she worked on the Julia Roberts starrer Leave the World Behind. Now, Heighten's happily reunited with former boss Scott Stuber at his revived legacy label United Artists, where she's shepherding projects from Benny Safdie, Chad Stahelski's Highlander reboot and psychological thriller The Tennant. “Building a slate from scratch at UA has been really, really cool. We all have very diverse tastes here,” says Heighten. “I watch Nancy Meyers movies on repeat as much as I watch Pirates of the Caribbean.” Other big life milestones in 2025 include welcoming her first daughter (born on F1's opening weekend!).

LOGLINE Juggles up-and-comers like Friendship writer-director Andrew DeYoung and established players such as Alexandre Aja and M. Night Shyamalan. 


THE ARC The Washington, D.C.-born Hoagland was sleeping on his sister's couch in Santa Monica when an encounter at a bar led him to a WME mailroom gig. As he rose over the past 12 years, he signed auteur hopefuls (see: Kneecap director Rich Peppiatt) and developed a reputation for exceptional taste, to the point that he was brought on the teams of bigger players like Scott Derrickson, Shawn Levy and David S. Goyer. Recently, Hoagland found himself in a multi-agency pursuit for Ian Tuason, the hot filmmaker behind The Undertone, while he was at the hospital awaiting the birth of his first child with his Fifth Season film executive wife (she was supportive of the in-hospital agenting). He signed Tuason and welcomed his son in August.

Talent agent, Paradigm


LOGLINE Guides the careers of talent like Danielle Deadwyler and Yvonne Strahovski. 


THE ARC Thanks to entertainmentjobs.com, Izzo got her foothold in Hollywood. Through the site, the former ballerina landed a receptionist gig at Rebel Entertainment, where an agent later referred her to an opening at Paradigm. An early goal: landing on THR's Next Gen list. “I wrote in my goals that I want to be on this list,” says the soon-to-be-married rep. “What do I need to do to get there?” Fast-forward a decade, and the East Coast native now handles a roster of rising stars like Brec Bassinger (Final Destination: Bloodlines), Hannah John-Kamen (Thunderbolts) and Deadwyler, whom she signed after seeing her in a 2018 episode of Atlanta. She's since guided the star through a career that now includes awards contenders (Station Eleven, Till) and commercial hits (Carry-On).

Manager, 2AM


LOGLINE Steers talent like Arkasha Stevenson through indies and studio titles. 


THE ARC As an undergrad at Northwestern, Jaeger, a lifelong basketball player, knew he wouldn't make the Division 1 men's team. “I'm decent, but I'm 5-foot-10 on a good day,” he jokes. So instead, he approached the women's basketball team, which offered him a spot as a practice player. It's that out-of-the-box thinking that Jaeger has extended to his business as a manager for clients like Emmy-winning The Pitt writer Cynthia Adarkwa and playwright turned HBO writer Eboni Booth. When he was an agent at ICM, Jaeger learned that he didn't “have to sign established voices in order to have big business.” His focus has long been on helping emerging talent level up their careers. When he signed Raffi Donatich, she was still the assistant of 2AM client Jeremy O. Harris. This year, she wrote Maude Apatow's directorial debut, Poetic License, and sold the Sarah Paulson-starring Sex Act to Netflix. As for basketball, Jaeger still plays on weekday nights at Fairfax High School.

Associate, Schreck Rose


LOGLINE Helps broker deals for The Studio co-creator Frida Perez and comedians John Mulaney and Robby Hoffman. 


THE ARC When Lamba was first starting out in Hollywood, she was often placed in film buyers screenings after gaining a reputation for, as she puts it, being an “easy laugh.” Back then, Lamba, who'd dabbled in improv herself, knew she wanted to work in entertainment but didn't know exactly where she fit. Graduating from Columbia Law School, she's since carved out a niche signing comedy talent like Perez and The Paper actor Eric Rahill while also working with firm clients (see: Mulaney). Like her clients, Lamba, an audience staple at L.A.'s comedy venues who's been to 34 shows this year already, has a good sense of humor. While her law degree has stayed packed away, she often jokes about hanging her graduation certificate from UCB's improv courses in her office.

Film exec, Amazon MGM 


LOGLINE From The Idea of You to Spaceballs 2, the exec is on the streamer's most-watched and anticipated films. 


THE ARC “I go wherever the Lululemon belt bags are,” Ledonne says of her female-forward projects, including hits Red, White & Royal Blue and The Idea of You. The Boston native was initially pre-med at USC, but the theater kid inside of her couldn't be denied as she started dabbling in film classes for fun. When she made the formal switch to film school, her Italian-born parents were supportive, if not a little worried. When she got a job in the WME mailroom, she described it to them as “what Anne Hathaway does in Devil Wears Prada except in movies.” They promptly sent her a suitcase filled with food. Now, Ledonne helps shepherd projects like The Love Hypothesis with Lili Reinhart and the Bratz movie with Kim Kardashian. The married exec and mother of one, who commutes from Palos Verdes, is also overseeing the Spaceballs sequel.

THE ARC When Levine was 13, his mother dropped him off in the village of Scarsdale, New York, where she urged him to find a job. “I said to her, ‘I'm 13, I don't have working papers yet,' ” he recounts, “and she's like, ‘Figure it out.' ” Levine's been figuring it out ever since. He talked his way into a gig with Anderson Cooper while still at Boston University, then moved to Oxygen and, later, CAA. The rep has negotiated with cardinals so that client Pharrell Williams could perform the first-ever concert at the Vatican. He also packaged Padma Lakshmi's next cooking competition, put CAA clients Jimmy Fallon, Johnny Knoxville and Savannah Guthrie into game shows and reinvigorated Martha Stewart's career. In fact, Levine now drives Stewart's vintage Aston Martin, which she agreed to give him if he got her a deal worth $5 million. So, during the pandemic, he brokered a pact for Stewart to be the face of Pfizer's COVID vaccine — “$5.1 million just to make sure she couldn't back out,” he says with a megawatt smile.

Theater agent, CAA


LOGLINE Guides theater artists like Celine Song, Ashley Park and Darren Criss from the stage to screen.


THE ARC There's a surprising amount of overlap between working in a science lab and working at an agency. Or so says Lin, who was “shocked by how nerdy everyone was — in the best way,” when he made the transition from Harvard biology major to CAA intern. “There's that hunger for information.” Born to science PhDs from China, Lin was happy spending long hours in the lab and planned on following in his parents' footsteps. Then, a friend invited him to check out Harvard's American Repertory Theater. He was hooked. At CAA, Lin signed Past Lives and Materialists filmmaker Celine Song and Red White & Royal Blue filmmaker Matthew López when they were known as playwrights, and as a 25-year-old, convinced Leslie Odom Jr. — hot off of Hamilton — to entrust him with his career. “It's been amazing to watch these artists take their craft and spread it to so many more people around the world,” says Lin, who is also active in the company's agent training program.

LOGLINE Reps filmmakers like Novocaine directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen and Air scribe Alex Convery.


THE ARC The third-generation agent has formative memories of hours-long drives with his dad to Dodger Stadium as his father rolled calls. “It might sound boring,” says the L.A. native, who is married to a fellow UTA agent, “but I started to understand how you get somebody a job, who is the power and who is Amy Pascal.” Lonner interned at UTA (the only agency his father hadn't worked) during summer break from studying political science at the University of Arizona before climbing his way up to agent, where he's carved out a niche tapping filmmakers before they lift off. Among them is Francis Galluppi, who soon will shoot a new Evil Dead movie, Seth Whirley (Sketch), Curry Barker, director of the TIFF horror title Obsession.

LOGLINE Building the MTV of the internet generation, with shortform shows like Hollywood IQ that land A-listers as Emma Stone. 


THE ARC Producer. Creator. Executive. Ma wears many hats for her Soho-based startup — the digital producer/distributor of popular social shows like Shop Cats — but what sets her apart from her do-it-all peers is her engineering know-how. Back at UC Berkeley, where she was a computer science major (and Arabic minor), she founded an online platform that offers a verification tool for journalists to authenticate public data — and won a medal from the Department of the Treasury. While building out that venture, she came to a realization: “News is effective as a form of entertainment,” says Ma. “If you want to reach Gen Z at scale, you have to meet them where they're having fun.” Mad Realities was born from the software Ma built and now has a number of popular series hosted by TikTok and Instagram creators like Hollywood IQ and Shop Cats. Up next: a standalone app and live events.

LOGLINE The YA whisperer guides the careers of up-and-comers like Ginny & Georgia star Antonia Gentry. 


THE ARC As a teenager in the San Fernando Valley, Mausner, the daughter of a lawyer and a stay-at-home mom, often said she wanted to be a talent agent. The one problem? “I had absolutely no idea what that was,” she recalls with a laugh. She's since learned, and virtually all of the hottest YA shows are filled with Mausner's clients. Among them: XO Kitty lead Anna Cathcart and The Summer I Turned Pretty breakout Isabella Briggs. “The niche that I've carved out,” she says, “is identifying the actors who are a single job away from being able to define their careers,” says the rep, whose viewing habits run the gamut from Dodgers to Real Housewives (Mausner named her dog Andy Cohen). Mausner also gets brought onto the teams of the agency's legacy clients like Christopher Lloyd and James Remar to offer, as she puts it, “fresh eyes.” Remar's busy year includes It series Welcome to Derry and Christopher Nolan's next feature, The Odyssey.

THE ARC Growing up, Mitchell couldn't wait to leave her native Orange County. Back then, the fashion school student envisioned a big career in visual merchandising. But a gap year temp gig working in specials at CBS threw a wrench in Mitchell's plans. Eleven years later, the self-described “fashion school dropout” is now running the network's specials division, which has her overseeing a mix of legacy awards shows and one-offs like Nate Bargatze's holiday special. “My goal is to honor that incredible legacy and history but also help usher in a new era with fresh perspective and energy,” says Mitchell. Not too long ago, Mitchell moved back home to the O.C. And while the commute can be gnarly, it's allowed her to be closer to family and have an identity outside of Hollywood. To hear her tell it, her primary source of pride is not, say, growing this year's Emmy ratings but rather being an aunt to her sister's almost four-year-old.

THE ARC After stints at The Weinstein Co. and Bron, Moldo landed at Mandalay Pictures, where the first thing he did was find Alex Convery's script about the making of Air Jordans. Nine months later, the movie was in production with Affleck and Matt Damon. Moldo, an L.A. native and self-professed Diet Coke addict, joined Mandalay boss Jason Berman at the newly launched banner A/Vantage in the spring with the goal of “wanting to apply the indie mentality to studio filmmaking.” He next goes into production on a Ramin Bahrani drama. “I love the idea of bringing dreams to life,” says the West Hollywood resident. “This is one of the few jobs in the world where you can do that.”

THE ARC While growing up on a farm in rural Indiana with four sisters, Rose embraced the statewide adoration for native son James Dean, watching all of his movies. She then made her way through the catalogs of other greats like Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. Studying an individual actor's body of work was an appropriate foundation for Rose, who worked her way up the ranks with casting legend Maisler. Rose's recent projects include Challengers, Sinners and The Running Man, and she has put her stamp on forthcoming features like Aaron Sorkin's The Social Reckoning. She is particularly proud of her work on the Netflix hit Rebel Ridge, which became a breakout for star Aaron Pierre.

THE ARC Rosenbaum had dreams of making it big with the screamo band he formed with his Arizona high school pals, but after majoring in business with a minor in music industry at USC, he landed in the WME mailroom, and then on to the assistant route. “I have to wear a suit and tie every day, and then they see me just screaming and jumping around on stage,” he recalls of coworkers (and even the bosses) coming to see him gig around town. While at WME, he met Ken Kao, the Waypoint founder and son of billionaire Min Kao. “Ken asked me, ‘Do you know anyone who wants to help me run this company?' And I was like, ‘Yeah! Me.'” A decade later, he's now negotiated a co-financing deal with Neon for films in the $10 million-$25 million range (see: Sentimental Value) and also produces titles like the horror film Cuckoo. Upcoming features include Boots Riley's I Love Boosters. The newly engaged Rosenbaum still jams with his band during Thanksgiving breaks. Says the exec: “We call it Screams-giving.”

Now, the Minnesota native is working on blockbuster deals for MacFarlane and his Fuzzy Door Entertainment, which produced The Naked Gun, plus up-and-comers like Bowman and Jeremy Davies (Black Phone 2). Among the deals he's most proud of is Cristo Fernández's pact for Ted Lasso season three. “He was a fan favorite,” he says of the actor who plays football-loving Dani Rojas, “but his life, financially at least, changed overnight.”

LOGLINE KPop Demon Hunters writing duo Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan look to the rep for guidance.


THE ARC A high-pressure summer job as a busy lifeguard helped prepare Shenfield for his pressure-cooker entry into Hollywood: the WME mailroom. “It was such a funny cheat code,” says the Santa Cruz, California, native of feeling ready for the stress of the 14-hour days. After moving over to Mosaic, he showed a knack for comedy — scouring the internet and L.A. shows for untapped talent. Among his discoveries: the KPop Demon Hunters scribes fresh out of college, along with Austin Kolodney, who penned the Gus Van Sant awards contender Dead Man's Wire, and Liam Cullagh and Billy Langdon, part of the sketch comedy group Almost Friday TV, who sold the series Last Night Was a Movie to FX.

THE ARC Shepard Orozco arrived at UCLA to study musical theater, because, for as long as she could remember, the Pittsburgh area native was told that that was her path. “I joke that I was an obedient child in the sense that people were like, ‘This is your thing,' and I was like, ‘Oh, okay, great, this is my thing,” she says. But her interests expanded over four years, and, upon graduating, she took a job at a music video production company, where she got boots-on-the-ground producorial experience. From there, she worked for Giovanni Ribisi – “he was my film school,” she says – before segueing to LuckyChap, where she was intimately involved in hits like Maid and Sirens. In June, Shepard Orozco moved to Netflix, eager to learn the buyer side of the business. And while she has big plans, she's currently on maternity leave, having given birth to a son she shares with her sports agent husband in August.

From there, she landed at Scott Free, where she spent six years at the height of peak TV, then moved to Plan B, where she secured a greenlight (and later an Emmy) for the Netflix smash hit Adolescence.

She lined up internships at Universal and WME while still in school, then landed a full-time gig in the agency mailroom immediately after. In the 11 years since, Szurgot built a formidable list of clients, which includes showrunners Kim Rosenstock (Dying for Sex), Dario Scardapane (Daredevil: Born Again) and Alison Schapker (Dune: Prophecy), and met her husband, who's also a WME agent.

So he pivoted, writing and directing a comedy web series with a friend, which proved fortuitous. Not only did it sell to former digital media company Fullscreen, but also, through it, he met OBB founder (and now boss) Michael D. Ratner. At OBB, Tanner works at the intersection of branded (think: Allbirds and Old Spice) and traditional narrative content, like Sabrina Carpenter's A Nonsense Christmas and Stanley Tucci's latest with National Geographic.

Her desire was never to be in front of or behind the camera, but rather to ensure things got made – and made well. She ultimately made her way to Northwestern, where she studied film and, as she puts it, “found my people.” In LA, she he landed on a comedy desk at CAA, and later segued to a gig as Casey Bloys' assistant at HBO. Now, Wasserman's a cornerstone of the network's small but mighty comedy team, where she's been instrumental to critical darlings like Betty and How To with John Wilson. More recently, her focus has been I Love L.A. from creator/star Rachel Sennott, who she's been courting for years, along with upcoming entries from Michaela Coel and Sharon Horgan.

Now, the pop star says she's ""never felt this connected"" to her art.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Ariana Grande has been open about the fact that portraying Glinda in the Wicked films has been healing for her as an artist. But in a recent interview, the pop star — who was previously managed by Scooter Braun — shared that signing with a new team of representatives has also played a big part in her falling back in love with making music.

	











	In a New York Times profile published Wednesday (Nov. 5), Grande was candid about feeling unhappy with her music career before she was cast in Wicked a few years ago, noting that she once thought she'd never go on tour again after her exhaustive 2019 Sweetener trek. “There was something broken about my relationship to pop music that was healed recently through the time away,” she told the publication.


	“I think it got away from me in a way I didn't expect,” she continued. “There's a thing that comes along with your dreams coming true that feels dangerous at times … Nothing prepares you for what comes with it. Until quite recently, it was really hard for me to navigate and I think it stripped a lot of joy out of this for me.”


	Despite her prior reservations, the Grammy winner is now gearing up to hit the road again in 2026 for a small tour supporting 2024 Billboard 200-topper Eternal Sunshine, which she dropped after previously thinking that she'd never make an album again. She's said before that recentering acting after primarily focusing on her pop-star duties was essential to her, but while speaking to NYT, she also hinted that the people she used to work with discouraged her from pursuing a balance between her two passions.

	











	“By the way, I have a different team now,” she said on the subject. “Said with love, but that was a piece.”


Billboard has reached out to Braun's rep for comment.


	The interview comes more than two years after Grande parted ways with SB Projects, where she had been managed by Braun on and off since 2013. The departure came at a time when several major clients were also announcing their splits from the music mogul, including Demi Lovato and J Balvin.


	In June 2024, Braun revealed that he was retiring from music management altogether. At the time, he said that he would “continue to root” for all of the big names that had once been on his roster, which also included Justin Bieber and Tori Kelly. 


	This past June, Braun echoed those sentiments while guesting on The Diary of a CEO podcast. “To see Justin move forward and succeed, to see Ariana with what's happened with Wicked in this past year … Everybody that I've ever had a chance to work with, to see them go on and do great things on their own, it's awesome,” he said at the time.


	Shortly after leaving SB Projects, Grande signed with Brandon Creed's company, Good World Management. A source told Billboard at the time, “She wants the focus to be her art and [Creed] puts her artistry and vision before anything else.”


	Two years later, it seems as though Grande has been able to do just that with her new team behind her.


	“I've never felt this connected to my art or inspired, and that's just been such a tremendous gift,” she told NYT. “It's like, oh, I don't actually have to take on those things that were projected onto me. I can focus on my art, and that can be a separate entity. But I had to give myself the permission to think that.”

YouTube's dispute with Disney is part of a larger pattern, writes Azoff, one that mirrors how it treats musicians and media companies alike.

	Irving Azoff



	David Israelite's guest column on October 23, 2025 explained how little music creators get paid across different streaming services. I just want to lay out the facts and be clear: YouTube pays the least for music, full stop. They always have and always will unless someone stands up to them. They'll throw up smoke screens and tempt you to look the other way, but let's not be fooled.


	YouTube recently touted that it paid artists $8 billion over the past year. This sounds impressive, but it's not. During the same period, Spotify generated roughly $18 billion in revenue and paid about $12 billion to music rights holders — nearly 67% of its revenue. By contrast, YouTube generated $60 billion in revenue and paid only $8 billion to rights holders — about 13%. YouTube will say they're not just a music service. But I would argue that YouTube never would have become such a successful platform without music, and even if only one-third of their revenue comes from music (and it's likely higher), they certainly should be paying more than Spotify, not 50% less.


	How does YouTube pay less than their competitors? They are a behemoth bully. They have 2.7 billion monthly active users and more than $60 billion in annual revenue. It's the dominant video platform, with more hours streamed than Netflix. It's the largest music service, with more users than Spotify. And in the “traditional” TV space, it's on track to surpass Comcast as the largest U.S. cable provider. This company now owns audience and content delivery in a way the world has never seen before.


	Their tyranny isn't just limited to music. If you read the headlines, you will see a pattern of coercion: YouTube vs. Televisa/Univision. YouTube vs. NBCUniversal. YouTube vs. Fox. YouTube vs. Paramount. And now YouTube vs. Disney. The playbook is always the same: if you refuse to accept YouTube's below-market terms, YouTube threatens to go dark until you capitulate. They then shift the blame and spin the story — when in reality, YouTube just wants to pay less.


	And now they're trying to dictate terms to consumers too. If you're a YouTube TV subscriber, you received an email saying “if Disney's content is unavailable for an extended period of time,” YouTube will give you a paltry $20 credit. So, YouTube gets to unilaterally decide for consumers how long is too long and how much ESPN is worth to them? They bully the people creating the content and then they bully the consumers who want access to it.


	Disney understands that “content is king,” but at YouTube, content is just a pawn in their game. And the game at YouTube is clearly about aggregating services and market power (across Google and YouTube) and using that market power to strong-arm everyone in the ecosystem — rights holders, content creators, advertisers, everyone — for their own financial gain. YouTube is showing us what happens when unchecked power and greed collide.


	Thankfully, Disney is standing up to YouTube, and we all need to support Disney because enough is enough. As artists, consumers, and companies, let's voice our support for Disney in this battle with YouTube. And in parallel, Washington needs to take a good hard look at YouTube's abuse of market power and explore whether it's time to break up Google so that YouTube, YouTube Music, and YouTube TV are separate businesses that finally have to compete on a level playing field.


	YouTube: without the artists, athletes, and actors, there is no business.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: David Arquette (Scream), Nick Stahl (Sin City), Vincent Kartheiser (Mad Men), and Rainey Qualley (Shut In) headline 80's-set thriller Green River Killer about the hunt for serial killer Gary Ridgway.


	Set against the backdrop of the Pacific Northwest in the early 1980s, Green River Killer “follows two conflicted detectives (Arquette and Stahl) as they descend into the murky depths of an investigation that would define their careers and haunt their lives. As they pursue a predator who blends seamlessly into everyday life, a man who is no one and everyone. The line between justice and obsession blurs, revealing the true cost of confronting evil.”

	‘The Green River Killer' was the name given to infamous U.S. serial killer Gary Leon Ridgway who was convicted of murdering forty-nine women between 1982 and 1998. At the time of his arrest in 2001, he was believed to be the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history. Most of Ridgway's victims were sex workers or other women in vulnerable circumstances.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The feature recently wrapped production in Washington State and Idaho and is directed by Johnny J. Tabor (Winter: Battleground) from an original screenplay by Timothy Michael Hayes (Mary). 


	Rounding out the ensemble are Julie Ann Emery, Robert Belushi, Kevin Makely, Lew Temple, and Costas Mandylor, with Mitchell Bourke portraying Ted Bundy.


	The project is produced by Jeffrey Decker and executive-produced by Vasilios Viores marking a co-production between Viores' Macova Media and Decker's Ave One Entertainment. David Guglielmo served as casting director.

	











	Director Johnny J. Tabor said: “What drew me to this story was how long it haunted those who lived it. For twenty years, investigators carried the weight of a case that seemed endless, refusing to let it be forgotten. Working with the production team from Macova Media gave me the opportunity to tell this story not to glorify a killer, but to honor the men and women who never gave up and to bring justice to those who no longer had a voice. I was lucky enough to be graced with an incredible cast ensemble who gave everything to bring that truth to life.”


	David Arquette is repped by Greene Talent and Lighthouse Entertainment; Nick Stahl is repped by Greene Talent and Link Entertainment; Vincent Kartheiser is repped by Untitled Entertainment; Rainey Qualley is with MPE and Paradigm.

					By Jill Goldsmith 

Co-Business Editor


	The Motion Picture Association has warned Instagram parent Meta to cease and desist the recently introduced Teen Accounts that are “guided by PG-13,” which the organization says exploits its ratings brand. 


	“The MPA's ratings program is a rigorous, human-driven process where every film is carefully assigned an individualized rating and content descriptors. Whatever mechanism Meta uses to moderate content cannot responsibly be compared to that comprehensive process. The MPA's program rates roughly 500 films a year; millions and potentially billions of images and videos are posted to Instagram each day,” it said, asking for the social media giant to implement remedial measures.

	“For more than half a century, the MPA has maintained the well-known motion picture rating system to guide moviegoers and parents alike regarding the content of films they are about to watch. All of the ratings underlying the system are registered certification marks owned by MPA, including the famous PG-13 certification mark,” said the letter that includes certifications it said are “incontestable and constitute conclusive evidence of the validity of the PG-13 mark and of the MPA's exclusive right to use that mark in commerce.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Last month, Instagram touted a revamp of its often-controversial teen accounts with a new default feature that it said limits content to what's appropriate for a PG-13 movie as set by Hollywood's ratings system. “Teens under 18 will be automatically placed into an updated 13+ setting, and they won't be able to opt out without a parent's permission,” the company announced in blog post.

	











	In its letter today, the MPA said, “The only reason Meta invokes the PG-13 rating is because it knows that rating is an established standard long trusted by the public and wants to exploit that trust for Meta's own benefit,” calling the claims “literally false and highly misleading.” “The MPA's ratings are determined by an organic and consensus-based process driven by an independent group of parents who view the entirety of a film and evaluate various factors in context. Meta's attempts to restrict teen content literally cannot be “guided by” or “aligned with” the MPA's PG-13 movie rating because Meta does not follow this curated process. Instead, Meta's content restrictions appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence or other automated technology measures.”


	In a statement to Deadline, a Meta spokesperson said, “Parents tell us they want to better understand what their teens see on Instagram. To make things simpler for them, we updated our teen content policies to be closer to PG-13 movie standards— which parents already know. We know social media isn't the same as movies, but we made this change to support parents, and we hope to work with the MPA to continue bringing families this clarity.” 


	Meta said its intention was never to suggest that it had officially partnered or been rated by the MPA and that it never made this claim. Rather, the social media giant said, it explained that it had drawn inspiration from the movie industry and reviewed its age-appropriate guidelines against the MPA's official, public standards. 


	New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, whose Department of Justice sued Meta for design choices it alleges put children at risk of sexual abuse, human trafficking and mental health harms, also weighed in.  


	“Rather than actually make its platforms safe for young people as the law requires, Meta continues to roll out half-baked PR initiatives that … lull families into a false sense of security,” he said. “Meta's ratings game is difficult to square with Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that he has rolled back oversight of the content of its platforms and is inconsistent with a platform driven by recommendation algorithms.”


	The lawsuit, which is set to go to trial in February, alleges that Meta repeatedly misled the public about the dangers its products pose to children.

Randy Madden, a contestant on “American Idol” Season 8, has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a minor.

On Monday, Madden, 45, was charged with six felony counts including unlawful sexual intercourse, oral copulation of a person under 18 and anal and genital penetration by a foreign object.

He's also facing charges of sending harmful matter, luring and dissuading a witness from reporting a crime, according to TMZ, who was the first to report the news.

Court documents obtained by the outlet claim the charges are in relation to at least one sexual encounter that  took place sometime between July and September.

The victim's age remains unclear at this time. 

Madden pleaded not guilty to the charges and was taken into custody with the help of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.

Page Six has reached out to both Madden and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, but did not immediately receive a response.

“American Idol” fans may remember Madden from his wild Season 8 audition on the reality singing competition in 2009.

Madden auditioned in Phoenix, where he performed his rendition of “Livin' On a Prayer” by Bon Jovi in front of judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson and Kara DioGuardi.

However, he was unsuccessful in his attempt to go to Hollywood as all four judges voted “no,” and his journey on the show ended.

That year, Kris Allen went on to win the competition after facing off against Adam Lambert and Danny Gokey.

Expect some serious air guitar and dance-floor fireworks tonight on “Dancing With the Stars” season 34, as the remaining couples will be taking on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Night on “DWTS” 2025. After the performances and team dances are done, one of the couples will be facing elimination when co-hosts Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough reveal the “Dancing With the Stars” results. Watch with us tonight during our “Dancing With the Stars” season 34 live recap below and find out with us.

Things are going to get riled up in the ballroom for Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Night on “DWTS.” After all of the couples perform individually tonight, we will then get to see the team dance before another couple is sent home. After another shocking elimination last week, will it be another week of surprised faces when the show ends? Find out with us during our Live Recap below!

We start with a troupe performance. The couples are on the dance floor, and then Flavor Flav hits the dance floor, as he serves as a guest judge tonight. Time to get this started!

He said he has PTSD from his broken nose, but here we are. For tonight, they are dancing a Jive to “I'm Still Standing” by Elton John. Bruno was actually a dancer in the music video, so he is going to be judging this closely.

I really enjoyed this one. He looked like he was having so much fun with it, and even teased Bruno a little bit. He busted out the abs too, so can never go wrong with that.

Judges' Feedback: Flavor Flav said that the dance right there was the proof. Bruno said his feet were very good, but he did miss a pass. Carrie Ann said he had all the elements, but three moments where he got stuck on the kicks. Derek said when in doubt, get your abs out. It was high-energy and a great way to start the show.

Judges' Scores: 36 out of 40, he got a 10 from Flavor Flav

She asked Val to push her harder last week on “Dancing With the Stars” 2025, and it turned into a 39 out of 40 for the night. For tonight, they are dancing a Paso Doble to “Livin' On a Prayer” by Bon Jovi. He is from New Jersey, and she is from New Jersey, so she is feeling good about this one. She even got a special message from Bon Jovi.

They have definitely become a very solid couple. Good choreography and such a strong dancer. This was another solid week for her.

Judges' Feedback: Bruno said the Paso Doble bombshell. Be careful, she is almost too hot to handle. Carrie Ann said she is in her fierce girl era, and what a way to set the Paso Doble standard for tonight. Derek said Paso power, and it was amazing. She was a rock and roll goddess out there. Flavor Flav said their timing; they were so good. 

Judges' Scores: 39 out of 40; Flavor Flav gave a 9 on this one

He got his best score last week on “Dancing With the Stars” season 34, but he's still at the bottom of the leaderboard. Andy had a touching moment, as he had his birthday and people were celebrating around the country for him. He shared his love for that, which was touching to see. For tonight, they are performing a Contemporary to “God Only Knows” by The Beach Boys.

It's Andy, so you know it's going to be a little slower than the rest. But this was a cute one, and his fans will soak it up.

Judges' Feedback: Carrie Ann said it was a beautiful tribute to this touching partnership. Derek said we've seen you become something beautiful. Flavor Flav said they did a real good job out there. Bruno said so charming, so tender. It had a childlike honesty.

Judges' Scores: 30 out of 40

After last week, she is feeling proud. Whitney is feeling a lot better now. For tonight, they are dancing a Paso Doble to “No More Tears” by Ozzy Osbourne. The top three couples are dancing the Paso Doble this week, so there is no room for error.

Great song choice on this one! They are very solid together also. Second Paso Doble of the night, and both couples did really well. They are strong and fierce, and I really liked them on this one.

Judges' Feedback: Derek said it was classic, edgy, and totally metal. That was perfection. Flavor Flav said the charisma was great, the moves were great. Bruno said ferociously intense, yet artistically exquisite. Carrie Ann said no doubt, this is game on. That was sick and amazing, but there were a few stumbles with her feet.

Judges' Scores: 39 out of 40

For tonight, they are performing a Contemporary to “Dream On” by Aerosmith. Her cancer diagnosis last year has made her live life. She wants to take on hardships and rise above.

Carrie Ann wanted her to take up more space with her body on the dance floor. That was their focus tonight, but I feel she did not hit it. There were moments when I wanted to see her reach out more, but she fell short.

Judges' Feedback: Flavor Flav said it was great, and they were on point. Bruno said there was a tiny mishap in the dance, but she should be proud of herself. Carrie Ann said you told the story, and well done. Derek said she is someone they all root for, and she glows on that dance floor. It felt a little disjointed tonight.

Judges' Scores: 34 out of 40

She was cleared to perform again by doctors, so Elaine is back this week on “Dancing With the Stars” season 34. It was a definite emotional week, but here we are. She couldn't dance for a couple days to rest her ribs. For tonight, they will be performing a Viennese Waltz to “What the World Needs Now Is Love” by Dionne Warwick.

What injury? Yes, she was injured last week, but she held it together for this performance. She was very solid, and if in pain, she hid it very well!

Judges' Feedback: Bruno said that it was a sumptuous performance, extremely elegant. Carrie Ann said it feels so familiar to her, and she feels like she knows her so well when she dances. Derek said she is resilient, remarkable, and the way she dances is a breath of fresh air. Flavor Flav said she does not move like she was hurt. She healed up beautifully.

Judges' Scores: 37 out of 40; a 10 from Flavor Flav

The harness last week worked against them, for which Ezra apologized. For tonight, they are doing a Jazz to “River Deep – Mountain High” by Ike & Tina Turner. Carrie Ann said she reminded her of Tina Turner in a previous dance, so now is her chance to take on Tina directly.

She wanted to come back strong after the lower scores last week. The flips to start the dance were a great way to start it out, that's for sure! This was a high-energy, and she was having fun with it.

Judges' Feedback: Carrie Ann said she did not disappoint. She is ballsy, and she takes the risk, and this one paid off. Derek said the Queen of rock and roll, and the Queen of the ballroom. Flavor Flav said every battlefield she goes on, she is a warrior, and she comes out with a win. Bruno said it was so good to see her wild side.

Judges' Scores: 38 out of 40

He got his first 10 of the season last week. Robert said it gives him a boost of confidence heading into the homestretch. He loves rock and roll, so this is his week to shine. For tonight, they are performing a Paso Doble to “Icky Thump” by The White Stripes.

The flags at the beginning were intense, but he was a little off from everyone else, and that threw me off. He then seemed to be a little off with Witney when she first came out, but then they seemed to get it back together, and the routine went on.

Judges' Feedback: Derek said he didn't just dominate, he owned this arena. Flavor Flav said he is the brand new Fred Astaire out here, and they are absolutely amazing. Bruno said he dominated the dance all the way through. Carrie Ann said incredible choreography. He has momentum and is in the zone.

Judges' Scores: 38 out of 40

Before the team dances, we find out that Whitney & Mark get immunity for next week's relay dance because they are on top of the leaderboard tonight and have the highest total points for the season.

Then we see the teams being picked, as Andy and Danielle were team captains. We have Team Chicago, which is Danielle & Pasha, Whitney & Mark, Jordan & Ezra, Dylan & Daniella, and Alfonso. For Team Kool, it's Andy & Emma, Robert & Witney, Elaine & Alan, Alix & Val, and Julianne. The stars will have to dance without their partner and with the co-host for some of the dance.

Team Chicago – A lot is going on here, but they all did a good job. I thought Jordan definitely stood out on this one, as she was a strong performer. Then I loved them working the Carlton into the dance, as Alfonso not only did it, but they all did it.

Judges' Feedback: Flavor Flav said they are great. Bruno said it was so slick and so cool. Carrie Ann said that it was so tight and so clean. Derek said very well done.

Judges' Scores: 40 out of 40

Team Kool – This team was definitely having a good time. It was so fun to watch all of them smiling and just having a grand ol' time. Their individual parts were good, and it was just fun to watch.

Judges' Feedback: Bruno said it was so much fun, and it was a celebration of friendship. Carrie Ann said it was fun and enjoyable. Derek said the other team was tighter, but the energy, he loved it. Flavor Flav said Team Kool was cooler than four blocks of ice cubes.

Judges' Scores: 38 out of 40

We have finished Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night, and it's time for the results. The couples are all on the dance floor. The couple eliminated tonight on “DWTS” 2025 is:

Andy does it again! He survives, as another couple is eliminated tonight. What do you think of the results on “Dancing With the Stars” season 34 tonight?

I like Andy but c'mon.  Enough is enough already.

Andy is great but he is no dancer. The title of the show is Dancing with the Stars. Dancing is the word and Andy can't dance.

For the thousands and thousands of people that work to make a film or TV show come to life, even the biggest online film database in the world hasn't completely recognized their contributions. This week, however, IMDb is undergoing a big overhaul to its credits section to give 12 different below the line positions some more attention, as well as adding one entirely new credit category to recognize the global scope of the industry.

IMDb and IMDbPro, beginning just after 11:59 p.m. PST on Sunday, November 9, will update its credits pages to display full name and title pages for 12 different professional credits. Those new categories are: Choreography; Color Department; Craft Services; Health and Safety Department; Intimacy Coordination; Legal; Production Department; Production Finance and Accounting; Property Department; Publicity; Puppetry; and Voice Actor — Dubbing.

 








Related Stories ‘Atropia' Trailer: Alia Shawkat and Callum Turner Have a Romance in a Fake Middle East See Luis Buñuel's Once-Banned, Sacrilegious ‘Viridiana' Anew in 4K — Watch the Trailer 

It's not that these titles were absent from IMDb in the past, but you had to scroll way down to the “Additional Crew” category on a film or show's “All Cast & Crew” page in order to find their name. Now they'll be organized in the same way you would see with folks in the sound department or visual effects and dozens of other categories. And with these additions, IMDb now features 45 professional credit categories.

 










The big new one among that group of positions is Voice Actor — Dubbing, which is completely new. IMDb now accepts credits for dubbing foreign-language versions of movies and TV shows, which is just much better for those professionals to showcase their global work. Credits are now accepted for dubbing into English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. To submit dubbing credits, IMDb provided instructions and a tutorial video here.

Name pages will automatically generate specific entertainment professions based on what that individual specializes in based on their credits, but IMDbPro premium members can select their professions from a newly expanded list of 500 options. 

IMDb worked with a number of industry guilds to make this happen and hopes to add more in the future: the Choreographers Guild, Colorist Society, I.A.T.S.E. Local 161, I.A.T.S.E. Local 871, National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA), Property Masters Guild, and SAG-AFTRA. 

“Our vision is to ensure every profession involved in making movies and TV shows receives equal recognition,” said Nikki Santoro, CEO of IMDb. “We're grateful to our IMDbPro customers and industry collaborators who helped shape these updates, and we look forward to continuing this important work together.”

 










“When our members work on a production, it's important that they be credited in the right way — not just because it feels good to see our names connected to our titles, but because it's a professional resource that the community looks to, to be informed,” said Sean Astin, SAG-AFTRA President. “It's important that IMDbPro has made this commitment to recognizing the many professionals whose creativity and dedication make film and television possible. This is an important step toward creating an accurate and more inclusive reflection of the industry we all create, and we thank them for working to ensure that every contributor to a production is visible and valued in their own right.”

IMDb in 2022 did a massive redesign of its name pages, which IndieWire reported at the time impacted 11 million celebrities, filmmakers, and crew professionals. That revamp dramatically changed the way you viewed and could discover info on an individual's page, as well as making it easier to view credits pertaining to podcasts and music videos. It also came at a time in which the website allowed actors and other individuals to remove their ages from the database following the passage of a California law. That privacy update followed in the footsteps of a 2019 move to remove birth names from an individual's page after outcry from the transgender community.  

 










Representatives for several of the aforementioned guilds weighed in on what this added recognition means below: 

Choreographers Guild

“Having the Choreography credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro is a sign of respect for our profession and the value we bring to the entertainment industry,” said Mandy Moore, Executive Board Member of Choreographers Guild. “We are excited and grateful to see one of the collective goals of our community realized.”

“On behalf of myself and the members of Choreographers Guild, we're grateful to the IMDbPro team for collaborating with us to make this milestone possible,” said Kathryn Burns, President of Choreographers Guild. “From the silent era to the first talkies, choreographers have shaped film and television, often without proper credit. We're proud that choreographers will now be as visible by name as their work on screen.”

Colorist Society

“Colorist Society enthusiastically celebrates the creation of a dedicated Color Department credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro,” said Kevin Shaw, President of the Colorist Society, Head of Color at Mission, Colorist, and Consultant. “This makes it easier to identify talented colorists and supports the work of the Colorist Society to advance the art of color grading through collaboration and knowledge sharing. Our members are united by their passion and commitment to the craft and will be thrilled that this new credit category recognizes the unique role we play in modern filmmaking, from the earliest stages of production through final delivery.”

 










“The Colorist Society International and its local chapter The Colorist Society Hollywood advocate for the role of the color finishing artist, and we are beyond excited about the establishment of a Color Department credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro,” said Lynette Duensing, Colorist Society International Fellow and Colorist Society Hollywood Board Member. “This new category provides a straightforward way to find talent and give credit to members of the color pipeline in individual roles. The very important contribution that the Color Department brings to a production will be given a chance to shine in the valuable resource that is IMDb!”

I.A.T.S.E. Local 161

“As a Production and Travel Coordinator, it's important that our crafts get the same recognition as our brethren,” said Molly Merrell, Production/Travel Coordinator and President of I.A.T.S.E. Local 161. “I.A.T.S.E. Local 161 supports this launch because Coordinators and Accountants spend countless weeks making sure productions run smoothly; assist other departments with their needs; make the impossible happen with little notice; and more. To have the Production Department and Production Finance and Accounting credit categories added to IMDb and IMDbPro means we are an equal member of the film crew who contribute just as much as anyone else.”

 










“IMDb and IMDbPro have been used for many years by the entertainment industry to display project information and credits for filmmakers,” said Jennifer Wilbert, Accountant and Vice President of I.A.T.S.E. Local 161. “The new Production Department and Production Finance and Accounting credit categories on IMDb and IMDbPro bring immeasurable recognition to our profession. I am excited about the updates and look forward to the new look! Thank you, IMDb and IMDbPro!”

I.A.T.S.E. Local 871

“I.A.T.S.E. Local 871 is thrilled to support the launch of the Production Department and the Production Finance & Accounting credit categories on IMDb and IMDbPro,” said Scott Root, I.A.T.S.E. Local 871 Vice President, Production Coordinator (9-1-1 season 3), and Second Assistant Accountant. “Production and Accounting professionals are the bridge between creative vision and reality. We're on each project from the first hire through final wrap, and our work is part of the essential logistics that turn ideas into motion pictures. We build the structure, rhythm, processes, and trust that keep productions on track and on budget. These new credit categories provide proper recognition for the people who make movies and TV possible.”

“The Production Office is the hub of any show,” said Billy Ward, Assistant Production Coordinator and I.A.T.S.E. Local 871 member. ”Production Coordinators and Assistant Production Coordinators, along with our teams, support all departments, big or small, crew or corporate. We're an integral part because we're always communicating, organizing, and putting out fires (usually metaphorical). We have to know everyone and everything that is happening. Creating the Production Department credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro means the importance of our work is being recognized.”

 










National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA)

“Voice actors are often the unknown voices behind your favorite performances, and IMDb is an important and vital source that brings credibility and visibility to our art form,” said Tim Friedlander, Co-founder and President of NAVA and Voice Actor. “We are grateful to work with IMDb and IMDbPro to recognize the people whose voices bring stories to life, and we applaud the addition of professional credit categories that are more reflective of the full range of creative talent across the entertainment industry.”

“Voice acting is a unique craft that has defined some of the most memorable moments in entertainment,” said Cissy Jones, BAFTA Award-winning Voice Actor and NAVA member. “By expanding credit categories, IMDb and IMDbPro are helping shape a future that fully acknowledges the talent and creativity voice artists deserve.”

Property Masters Guild

“This is a proud moment for our craft,” said Jeffrey Johnson, President of Property Masters Guild and Property Master. “Recognizing Property Masters within the new Property Department credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro highlights the artistry, precision, and collaboration that bring every movie and TV show to life. It celebrates the creative leadership our members bring to productions of every size and helps ensure their work is seen, valued, and connected across the global entertainment industry.”

 










“Seeing Property Masters represented in this way is deeply meaningful,” said Brad Einhorn, Property Masters Guild member. “Our work touches every frame of a production yet it is often invisible to audiences and even peers. The Property Department credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro gives us the opportunity to be properly credited for our creative contributions and help future generations of Property Masters connect their artistry to the projects that inspire them.”

SAG-AFTRA

“SAG-AFTRA applauds IMDbPro for taking this meaningful step toward recognizing the breadth and diversity of creative work that powers our industry,” said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator. “From dubbing performers and puppeteers to intimacy coordinators, choreographers, and so many others, every professional contributes to the magic of storytelling. While these updates directly impact some of our members today, we know this is just the beginning. We look forward to future enhancements that will recognize additional roles — those that have long been grouped under ‘Additional Crew' — and ensure that every contributor to a production is visible and valued in their own right. This progress represents an important step toward a more accurate and inclusive reflection of the industry we all help create, and we are proud to continue collaborating with IMDbPro to elevate and celebrate the full spectrum of talent that brings stories to life.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Death Grips Are Working on a New Album","https://pitchfork.com/news/death-grips-are-working-on-a-new-album/","Wed, 05 Nov 2025 17:25:32 GMT","

Death Grips are working on a new album. “The Writing and recording of our next album is underway,” Stefan “MC Ride” Burnett and Zach Hill shared on Instagram, along with a carousel of photos from the recording studio. “We're looking forward to the new Death Grips record.”

Death Grips have not released a new album since 2018's Year of the Snitch. The band toured in 2023, and, this past April, resurfaced to confirm that Death Grips remain “active.” The note came after seemingly now-former member Andy Morin suggested privately that the project ended.

Since the last Death Grips album, Zach Hill launched a band called Undo K From Hot. He also reissued the Hella album Hold Your Horse Is in 2023. And, just last week, he and the Australian experimental musician Lucas Abela released an album titled Bag of Max Bag of Cass.

	“Everyone in this room is delusional.”


	Tom, an Arte Cafe regular who claims he snuck into the private party being held there Tuesday night, is fighting for purchase around the packed bar. “It's the Disneyland of delusion to be a Sliwa victory party,” he adds. 


	The crowd packed into the Upper West Side Italian restaurant on election night to celebrate Curtis Sliwa —  a conservative, tough-on-crime fixture in New York City for decades, and the Republican Party's nominee for mayor — is a comical mix of New Yorkers. Members of The Guardian Angels (Sliwa's controversial volunteer crime prevention group) mingle in their red berets and blazers. Attendees sporting the jerseys of various New York sports franchises eye each other from across the room. Twenty-somethings who look like they may have lost their way on the way to a DSA victory party mingle near the door.  A man in a “TRUMP” sweater and a cowboy hat floats through the throng. George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York, is there, too. At one point, attendees started dancing to reggaeton so loud it drowned out most conversations.












	Everyone knows their candidate is not going to win. Yes, the televisions above the bar are broadcasting news coverage of the election results, but no one is really watching. Sliwa will not be delivering his victory speech tonight, and perhaps that's why there doesn't seem to be even an ounce of anxiety amid the revelry. Appetizers and small bites abound (“The meatballs are two for one!” one attendee jokes when a server approaches), and everyone is behaving like they've consumed more than their allotted drink tickets.

	











	The energy in the room matches the candidate himself: irreverent, loud, earnest perhaps to a fault. The scene feels like a parody of a campaign and candidate transplanted out of a sitcom — but that nevertheless felt critical to a landmark mayoral race that would either usher in a new era of young, progressive leadership in the nation's largest city, or double-down on scandal, and the establishment, by installing the state's disgraced former governor.

	The race for City Hall was bizarre and heated, with many believing Sliwa's presence would tank any chance Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, had of defeating Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa was of course running to win, but he was also running on principle. He and Mamdani were the only two of the three main candidates to actually be nominated for the job by their respective parties. He wasn't going to bow out on behalf of the second-place finisher in the Democratic primary.


	Cuomo chose to remain in the race with the backing of ultra-wealthy donors, and his strategy relied heavily on demanding that Sliwa bow out. In September, the cat-loving, ball-busting Republican claimed he had received at least “seven offers so far to give me more money than my father and I ever made in a lifetime of work,” in order to drop out. 


	“Cuomo already lost the nomination,” one young attendee at Sliwa's election party tells me, adding that while they ideally would have liked Sliwa to win, they could respect that — like the people of New York —  “Mamdani and Curtis [both] acknowledge that Cuomo isn't the right leader for New York City.” 


	Sliwa remained steadfast in his commitment to remain a candidate, to mixed reactions from even his own supporters. Two attendees described themselves as “Curtis supporters who voted for Cuomo.” He had “no chance,” one says. “Nobody on the face of the Earth thought he was going to win,” the other adds. In their view, the defection was justified over the need to “defeat Mamdani at any cost.”

	In a more bizarre exchange, a young man insists to me that “Mamdani is a harbinger of something terrifying in American politics,” who “takes advantage of the contempt people have for white people and white civilization.” 


	“I might be a white guy, but I didn't ask to be put in this position,” he adds. Another guest caught in the gaggle peeks over my shoulder and chuckles, slightly aghast, “You're writing this all down?” 

	











	Others feel Sliwa's campaign had more in common with the Mamdani platform than Cuomo's — and a better memory about the former governor's time in office than his supporters. Perhaps the most sober attendee I encounter the entire night looks me dead in the eye and says that he would take practically anyone over Cuomo, who “killed more people during Covid than Hamas did on October 7.” 


	Cuomo, like Sliwa, lost. With far less grace. At his own election watch party, the former governor's supporters chanted “shame on Sliwa” when the race was called. Cuomo supporters can be upset with Sliwa, but it doesn't seem like it mattered. Mamdani won over 50 percent of the vote. Cuomo would have lost even if all of Sliwa's voters went his way. Mamdani told NY1 on Wednesday that he did not receive a congratulatory call from either Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams, but that Sliwa did ring him up on election night. 


	During his concession speech on Tuesday — given before most major outlets had even called the race for Mamdani — a teary eyed Sliwa, accompanied by his wife Nancy Regula, spoke to the crowd as if he'd suffered only the narrowest, most contested of losses — not a blowout for third. 


	He blasted the “billionaire” class that backed Cuomo and “decided” he had no right to run his campaign. 


	“Let me warn our new leader: If you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police weak and impotent, if you forsake the people's public safety, we're not only organizing, but we are mobilizing,” he said. “We will become the mayor-elect and his supporters' worst enemy.


	“Good luck,” he offered Mamdani, amid chants of “fight, fight, fight,” from his supporters.

	There's a scene in School of Rock where drummer Freddy Jones asks Katie, the bassist, to name two great “chick drummers.” Katie (played by Rivkah Reyes) quickly replies, “Sheila E? Meg White from the White Stripes?” Jones (played by the late Kevin Clark), looks aghast. “She can't drum!” he tells her. 


	“She's a better drummer than you!” Katie quips in response. “At least she has rhythm.” 


School of Rock was released in October 2003, six months after the White Stripes released Elephant, the explosive garage-rock masterpiece that won Jack and Meg White several Grammys and turned the peppermint-candy-themed duo into household names. Those households loved to discuss the band's quirkiness (“Why are they always in those matching outfits?”) and their mystery (“Are they siblings or ex-spouses?” It was the latter). 


	But many, if not most, of those conversations back then resembled Freddy and Katie's, arguing over Meg and whether or not she deserved to be there. This week, that debate will hopefully be laid to rest, when the White Stripes are inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame — and Meg will finally get her due. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The White Stripes broke up almost 15 years ago, but discussions of Meg's drumming are still taking place. Just two years ago, a viral tweet calling the drummer “terrible” sparked outrage online, with everyone from Jack White himself to Questlove coming to her defense. (Jack's other ex-wife, musician and model Karen Elson, said it best: “Keep my ex husband's ex wife's name out of your f-cking mouth.”) 

	











	But you'll never find Meg, one of the most famously private and reclusive musicians in rock, speaking about any of this herself. Even during the White Stripes' run from 1997 to 2011, she rarely gave interviews, usually nodding along and smiling while Jack did the talking. In 2007, the White Stripes released their final album, Icky Thump, and canceled their tour for the album due to “health issues.” In a letter to fans, they explained that Meg was “suffering from acute anxiety and is unable to travel at this time.” At the time, this explanation raised eyebrows; it's now a common reason to postpone or cancel tours, with artists like Chappell Roan and Shawn Mendes prioritizing their mental health, another way that Meg was ahead of her time.

	Meg's mystery only grew after the White Stripes officially called it quits, and she retreated from the public eye and became every music journalist's white whale interview, alongside artists like the Smashing Pumpkins' D'arcy Wretzky and Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha. In 2014, Jack admitted to us that he was barely in touch with her. “I don't think anyone talks to Meg,” he said. “She's always been a hermit.”


	Meg's decision not to weigh in on ridiculous arguments about her talent only make her more awesome, especially in the age of social media, when younger artists regularly reply to criticism in sometimes ill-advised ways (see the recent TikTok drama with Sombr). She knows the power of not speaking. “Meg always says, ‘The more you talk, the less people listen,'” Jack told Rolling Stone's David Fricke in the band's 2005 cover story. “She's right. She doesn't open her mouth very much.”


	Meg did, however, talk about her approach to her instrument in 2002, when she gave a rare interview to Modern Drummer. “I get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me,” she said. “But then I think about it, and I realize that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible.”

	That fun is felt all over the White Stripes' six albums, with Meg's raw, deceptively simple technique serving as the linchpin of the band. Her brilliance shines on songs like “Little Room” (White Blood Cells), “The Hardest Button to Button” (Elephant), and “My Doorbell” (Get Behind Me Satan), and that's just when she's drumming. She provides backing vocals on several songs, too, like on Icky Thump's “I'm Slowly Turning Into You” and White Blood Cells' “This Protector.” But her singing highlight will always be “In the Cold Cold Night,” her deliciously haunting moment from Elephant. It's a sparse cut, with little else besides Jack's guitar and Meg's voice, begging for a lover to return. It's the magic of the White Stripes bottled into one track: profound beauty in the minimalism, and Meg White.

Supernatural creator Eric Kripke revealed that he originally had a very different ending in mind for the Supernatural season 5 finale, and it's entirely unlike anything we ultimately saw in season 5 or season 15. Supernatural fans know that the season 5 finale was the original ending of Supernatural but that the show then carried on for another 10 seasons.

Because of that, the show technically has two endings: the season 5 finale, ""Swan Song,"" which is largely considered one of Supernatural's masterpiece episodes, and the Supernatural finale in season 15 (the show's true conclusion). Each finale certainly has its pros and its cons, and debate remains regarding which ending was better.

Yet, there was apparently a third option that never saw the light of day, or seemingly was even commonly known, that would have meant an entirely different ending for Sam and Dean Winchester—and everyone should be very relieved that it never happened. 

God/Chuck actor Rob Benedict and Loki/Gabriel/Trickster actor Richard Speight Jr. co-host a Supernatural rewatch podcast, Supernatural Then and Now, on which they speak with the show's actors, writers, and creators, along with various other professionals who worked on the show.

In an episode earlier this year, titled ""Swan Song Part 2: Kripke Reloaded,"" Benedict and Speight Jr. sat down with Supernatural creator Eric Kripke, who revealed that there was yet another alternate ending for the show. Kripke explained:

""Sam goes into hell, Dean works his a** off to try to get him out in montage, kind of similar to what's there, but ultimately can't because Dean's big emotional movement was he had to learn to let go of his brother, right? ...So, I think it was probably more like, oh, where did he go? But I'm gonna let him go.""

This was far from the end of Dean's story in this alternate ending, though. Instead, Kripke revealed that the season 5 finale would have shown history repeating itself for Dean Winchester in a truly horrifying way. Kripke explained:

""Then, Dean goes back to [Lisa] and then they have a baby, and it's a girl, and he names the baby Samantha. And then the final image would be, like, he's got Samantha, and he kisses Samantha, and he kisses, you know, [Lisa], and he puts the baby in the crib, and they leave, and they turn out the light, and then a dark figure comes over the crib, and it goes back to the teaser of Supernatural, and so there's a dark figure, and then it's like a hard blackout, and the strong implication is it's all gonna start all over again. So, Dean is gonna become John, and Samantha is going to be the new demon hunter, and his wife is gonna be on the ceiling, and Sam is obviously gonna get back in.""

This ending would have drastically changed Supernatural's conclusion in a host of ways. For one, obviously, Dean would have had a baby, which never happened in the show. In fact, the real finale of Supernatural essentially flipped this narrative, with Sam being the one to have a child and name him after Dean. 

In addition to that significant shake-up, though, this conclusion wouldn't have seen Dean and Sam's story move forward; instead, everything would have begun again, dragging a brand-new generation along with it. It's true that the actual Supernatural finale was controversial, but this would have been an even worse ending for the show. 

Having history repeat itself would have been a thoroughly unsatisfying ending. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this story arc would have been Dean becoming his father. The fanbase is largely split when it comes to opinions on John Winchester. Some viewers empathize with him and believe he did his best, whereas others think he was a terrible father.

Even Supernatural stars' hot takes have referenced John's fatherhood, and, in the show itself, it's a topic that the brothers have to grapple with. Yet, it feels safe to assume that most viewers would have an issue with Dean becoming his father. After all, one of the things that defined Dean's relationship with Sam was how differently he treated him.

In many ways, Dean was Sam's actual father figure, as he always looked after him; John, by contrast, seemed to always put hunting first. Seeing this happen to Dean, who had always been so against his father's behavior, would have been truly heartbreaking and betrayed the characterization of Dean that had been built up for five seasons. 

Moreover, knowing that the brothers hadn't really escaped anything in the end and were doomed to enter the same brutal, tragic cycle would have been more than a little depressing. In a way, this would have made it feel like everything they'd done was for nothing. Even Eric Kripke seems aware of this, as he told Benedict and Speight Jr.:

""That was the ending, it was a lot of question marks and not a happy ending. Like, it was gonna be that horror movie, you know, Jason pops out of the water at the end.""

The fanbase remains divided on whether Supernatural ended the show well—and I will admit to having some issues with the season 15 finale myself—but, had this alternate ending really been the conclusion of the show, it would have been so much worse than the finale we got in either season 5 or season 15.

Many consider ""Swan Song"" to be one of the best episodes of Supernatural, for good reason. Although it was heartbreaking in its own way, this episode brought Sam and Dean's story full circle, and it felt like the true culmination of all that had happened up to that point in the show.

In fact, the story never really became as cohesive as it was in that five-season arc, wherein Sam and Dean became tangled up in Lucifer and Michael's epic showdown. Even so, many were happy to get more time with Dean and Sam, which ended up being an entire extra decade containing some of Supernatural's most beloved stories and characters. 

Particularly because of how Dean died in the series finale, though, the season 15 ending proved considerably less popular as a conclusion. Many were unhappy to see that Dean died fighting a common vampire rather than in some heroic, epic way, and knowing that Sam lived decades without his brother was salt in the wound. 

No matter how disappointing some may find that conclusion, however, Eric Kripke's original plan would have been the worst ending of the three. Yes, Dean's death was devastating (and frustrating in many ways), but it at least did not undermine the show. Arguably, it did the opposite, by killing Dean off in the way he'd always expected to die. 

Hitting the reset button on Sam and Dean's story, now with a brand-new generation also subjected to the horrors they endured, would have felt like such a slap in the face to fans, so I'm actually incredibly glad that Eric Kripke's original Supernatural ending never came to be.

This Gen Z walking club has built a loyal following, and a stable of haters, for treks they share on social media. They took The Globe for a stroll

Like The Beatles or The Wiggles, the five friends from Oakville, Ont., go by a single-name moniker: The Walkers. And, depending on whom you ask – most notably the age of the person you're asking and how they're inclined to feel, generally, about Gen Zs and young people these days – The Walkers are either brilliant, or brilliant at wasting time.

The group consists of Sebastian Karall, Michaela Purcell, Sophia Franc, Katie Wang and Hayden Chan. They're all in their early 20s, and have been friends for the better part of the last decade, since attending high school together at Garth Webb Secondary School.

Together, they've walked from Oakville to Toronto, a 46-kilometre trek that took them 12 hours. They walked over the entirety of Toronto's 26-kilometre Bloor-Danforth subway line. They've documented each of these walks and others on Instagram and TikTok, performing goofy skits and parody songs along the way. One day, they hope to walk across all of Canada.

A post shared by The Walkers (@meet_thewalkers)

The walks aren't for anything. They're not walking to raise awareness around any specific issue. They're not, typically, raising funds for charity (though they did hold a walk in support of Fort York Food Bank in late October). 

They post the walks on social media, but they're not influencers, and not earning income off of it.

Instead, they walk for the sake of walking.

The response The Walkers receive is in itself illuminating. They have many, many online supporters – who write to say “I love whatever that's wrong with y'all” and compliment their “chill vibes.” 

But there are also critics – those who roll their eyes at Gen Zs for “discovering” walking, and frittering away their time.

The discussion, said 23-year-old Michaela, is kind of the point. “I guess walking, the way we do it, is performance art.”

“It inspires thought. It inspires debate. If people think it's stupid, well, why is it stupid?”

The Walkers are Sophia Franc, Katie Wang, Hayden Chan, Sebastian Karall and Michaela Purcell.

I met The Walkers at Toronto's Union Station on a Sunday morning. It was just before 9 a.m. and the station, usually packed on weekdays with harried commuters, was all but empty. So it was impossible to miss the five Walkers as they approached in their extremely impractical – extremely Gen Z – walking clothes: flippy skirts and tank tops, baggy T-shirts and even baggier pants.

My plan was to tag along on this day's walk. They were tackling the route above the 38-kilometre Yonge subway line in Toronto. I wanted to see if, by the end of it, I might learn something – yes, about walking, but also about how this group of friends had become a kind of Rorschach test on today's young people. 

All around us, Gen Zs (those born between 1996 and 2010) have become the new punching bag – the next set of budding adults to sneer at. Across popular culture, they're derided as entitled and difficult to work with, as anxious and antisocial – this, despite the fact that we know so little about them. Unlike their millennial predecessors, they seem, at least for now, less interested in broadcasting their me-ness to the world.

What we do know about Gen Z is that they face a mountain of challenges. Just look at the headlines. The youth employment rate is at its lowest in decades. Affordability is on a long-term decline. Gen Zs can't get a job, or buy a home. They're more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. And it's these same young people who, as adults, will be expected to shoulder the burden for the rest of us in the coming years.

But that's only if they ever do become full-fledged adults. Because of the struggling economy, because of the pandemic, because of a long list of reasons The Walkers would spend the next many hours telling me about, they, like many other young people today, are facing a delayed start to adulthood.

And that ties back to the walks, too. “I definitely feel more kid-like than adult-like,” said 22-year-old Sebastian. “These walks, I guess, embody the values of kids. We're discovering. Exploring.”

If you had to label The Walkers back in high school, you might have called them the theatre kids. The five friends spent most of their time hanging out in Hayden's basement, dreaming up skits and scripts for films they might one day make together.

“I don't know which clique you'd call us,” said Hayden. “Glee?”

They started walking together in senior year. It was in March of 2020, during the COVID lockdowns, so there wasn't much else to do. They'd build fires at Bronte Creek park, and go for long, meandering walks designed around spending time together, experiencing new places together.

“It was like one last hurrah of childhood,” said Sebastian.

Today, all of them have completed undergraduate degrees. Still, all but one continue on as full-time students. 

There's Sebastian, who's in grad school at the University of Toronto, and Michaela, studying musical production at Seneca College. (They're the group mom and dad, and have been dating since they were 16.) Hayden is in teacher's college, as is Sophia, who shoots and edits all of their videos. And Katie is spending the year travelling, a gap year before pursuing a PhD.

We set off from Union Station just a few minutes after 9 a.m. It was early October, but felt like late summer. The sun was already beating down on us.

The five friends had completed the first half of their walk the day before – 43 kilometres and 49,374 steps from Vaughan to Union Station. It had taken them eight-and-a-half hours. I was joining them for the second half of their trip, from Union to Finch. I'd prepared my 42-year-old self meticulously. I'd gone to bed early and calculated the grams of protein in my breakfast to give myself maximum energy. Slathered on sunscreen and worn New Balance sneakers with soles so wide and thick they looked like bumper cars.

By comparison, the Walkers had spent the night before watching AI slop together until 2 a.m. They'd ordered in discount sushi, then crashed on each other's couches. On this day, Michaela had brought her phone and nothing else – not even a water bottle – with her.

As we carved a path between the grey-and-glass towers of the Financial District, I asked the group what made their videos so popular. This past summer, as they began planning their walk from Oakville to the CN Tower, they started an Instagram account called “Meet The Walkers.” They've since gained over 13,000 followers. They were interviewed for their local Oakville newspaper. Max Kerman from the band Arkells called them “his favourite celebrities on the internet.”

Part of it, said Katie, might be nostalgia. To their older followers, she theorized, The Walkers are a reminder of a different time, and of what it was like to be young and discovering the city for themselves.

“I think our content does well with middle-aged moms,” she told me. (A comment that was received, I hope, with a very straight face).

“They think we're cute and wholesome,” said Sophia.

Another reason, Katie added, might simply be their optimism. Times are tough. Everything feels bad. And yet, with their goofy, punny singalongs and wide, gummy smiles, The Walkers respond to the world with unfailing cheer.

And it's not just an act, she said. She studied ecology as an undergrad, looking at the effects of climate change on our planet. So she understands that there's a lot to be pessimistic about. And yet, that doesn't keep her and the other Walkers down.

“I think even though we have had our share of doom, we do still have hope,” she said. “Even though we're screwed, we're still gonna try.”

At about 10 a.m., after passing the screaming billboards and double-decker buses around Eaton Centre, Hayden said he had another theory to explain their online popularity. He was about to launch into it when something caught his eye at the intersection of Yonge and College. He stopped.

“Guys, there's a Bulk Barn!” he shouted. It had become a regular stop on their walks. Mostly just to buy snacks for cheap.

Hayden made a beeline towards the yellow storefront. But as he neared it, he froze. “OH NO!!” he shouted.

The others caught up. A chorus of the same: “OH NOOOOOOOOOO.”

The store was closed and wouldn't open for 15 minutes.

Hayden looked genuinely crestfallen. “Aw, I wanted dried mango,” he said. “That's so tough.”

He let himself brood for just a moment before carrying on. There would be other Bulk Barns.

He remembered his train of thought from earlier, about their popularity.

Over and over again, he said, they get the same question in the comments: Can I come?

“We're extremely lucky to have friends like this,” he said.

“People want to come walk with us. But really, I think what they want is friends like us.”

It's a good theory. Gen Zs are, statistically, the loneliest generation. A survey from 2023 found that over half of young people in Canada – 51.7 per cent – reported feelings of social isolation.

After the pandemic, he said, many of their peers continue to live in largely the same way they did in lockdown: alone, and trapped in their own digital bubbles. So, to many of these young followers, The Walkers might feel aspirational.

“What they want is friends to go for walks with,” he said. “Friends to waste time with.”

At about noon, we were making our way through midtown. It was a stretch where the city felt especially unrelenting. The concrete towers, spaced far apart, offered little shade from the sun, and the noise of road construction was incessant, interrupted only by the occasional honk, or blare of a car alarm.

My feet were starting to slow down, even as The Walkers continued on at a swift pace. If this were an ordinary leisurely walk, this was the point where I'd have turned back.

Instead, to distract myself, I asked them a question to which I thought I already knew the answer. I asked which historical event they felt had shaped Gen Z the most. Most of them responded, as I'd suspected, with the pandemic.

The morning after Michaela's 18th birthday, she said, the world shut down. All of her classes moved online. There was no prom, and their graduation ceremony consisted of a YouTube video, with teachers sending in self-recorded messages of congratulations.

“Every single teacher's video ended with ‘carpe diem,'” she said, shaking her head and giving a sad laugh. “It was a hard time for everyone.”

Still, she considers them lucky. The lockdowns happened late enough that they were able to have a mostly normal high school experience.

But Hayden had an answer that surprised all of us. He argued that the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has been just as impactful on their young lives.

He said Trump's first election in 2016 – which took place when they were 14 – made for a confusing backdrop to adolescence.

“Suddenly, you felt pressure to have opinions on everything,” he said. “We were in grade nine, and suddenly we were supposed to have a view on trans rights.”

He said it became “cool” for young men among them to espouse alt-right views – to follow online “manosphere” figures like Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan.

“It was ‘cool' to make fun of ‘SJWs',” he said, the online shorthand for “Social Justice Warriors.” 

“It was like, you are a loser because you care about social justice.”

Sebastian nodded and added that many of their male friends spend much of their time interacting only with other young men. And the online algorithms only exacerbate this.

This is one reason The Walkers prefer to keep their walks phone-free. Aside from shooting their videos or using their phones to navigate, the walks are, for the most part, screen-free time. A rare opportunity to unplug and focus on the environment – and on each other.

“We'll shame each other,” said Katie. “Like, ‘Stop, you're being a screenager!'”

Instead, they talk about pop culture. School. The city around them. They try to enjoy each others' company. The irony that they're now making online videos isn't lost on them. They're still figuring out how to reconcile it.

“Now we're contributing to the scroll,” said Hayden. “We're on the scroll.”

They saw recently that one of their most popular videos has been viewed for the equivalent of two full years of time.

“We took two years out of peoples' lives,” said Katie, shaking her head. “Like, is this moral?”

By around 2 p.m., we'd reached the northernmost edge of the old city of Toronto.

The sidewalk led into a tunnel – an underpass beneath Highway 401 – where the street widened to six lanes of traffic. Aside from the lip of the sidewalk, there was no barrier, no concrete block, nothing to separate us from the speeding cars.

“This is crazy. This is so stupid,” said Sebastian.

They'd come across similarly dangerous stretches before, including places where the sidewalk or road would just suddenly end and then they'd have to walk across a highway.

These were the moments where Sebastian put on his urban explorer hat. He's taking a course at U of T on psychogeography – the study of the effect that urban environments have on our psychology – and likes to share his learnings with the group.

“These walks have really exposed to us that huge parts of the city are not really built for walking,” he said. He hopes their online platform will help spread this message.

“We're getting to the part that's not for us anymore,” said Hayden. “We're reclaiming spaces for the people!”

At the other end of the tunnel, Sophia turned and pointed behind us. We'd made it so far we could see the downtown skyline off in the distance. The CN tower was so small she could pinch it between her thumb and index fingers.

It was the home stretch. Just another hour or so to go. We'd walked, by this point, about 15 kilometres. I was tired, but doing my best not to show it. Each time The Walkers huddled for a photo, or paused to strategize, I'd find a wall or concrete planter to lean against.

The conversation drifted to a familiar subject, one that comes up on just about every walk they go on. They talked about what they want their lives to look like when they're adults.

But, I asked, aren't you adults now? For generations past, the early 20s marked the beginning of adulthood. Twentysomethings had careers, and houses. Often, they were married, with kids.

“We're not there yet,” said Hayden, flatly.

“We're young adults,” said Katie. 

They do have jobs and bills. But the old markers of adulthood – like full-time salaries, homes, families – are milestones they don't expect to reach anytime soon. In her case, Katie said, she didn't expect to finish her doctorate studies until well into her 30s.

So how will they know when they're adults?

“No roommates would be a sign of adulthood,” said Sebastian. (He, along with the rest of the group, said he doesn't expect ever to be able to buy a home.)

“I just want a salary,” said Hayden. He's never had one before, never really felt comfortable spending.

Take coffee, for instance – which he doesn't drink, largely because it costs at least $3 a day.

“Maybe once I have a salary that kind of money won't mean anything to me anymore,” he said. “Maybe once I have a salary, I'll drink coffee.”

What they're still reckoning with is whether they even want those things, given what they view as the trade-off. They're not sure those traditional markers of adulthood – like a stable income, or a mortgage – are worth giving up this moment of freedom and exploration for. They're still young enough to think it has to be one or the other.

“I want people to know that we're hard workers. We're not just goofing off,” said Sebastian. 

“But we think about our parents and their lives, and see that taking the safe route doesn't always mean being fulfilled.”

“We want to be productive, but we don't want to be miserable in order to be successful,” added Katie.

Ultimately, this difference in values is what makes The Walkers divisive. It's the sentiment behind the commenters who say they're wasting their time. Who criticize them for devoting all of this energy on a project as pointless, as unproductive, as walking. For spending all this time walking when instead they could be studying, or working.

“But it is productive,” said Sebastian. “We're performing bonds with each other.”

A few minutes after 3 p.m., Katie pointed to the next intersection. We had been walking by then for over six hours.

There, at long last, was the sign for Finch Station. It was about 20 yards away, next to a Persian restaurant and a Korean hair salon.

“We're so close!” she shouted.

We made our final, weary steps. We were there. Finch Station. 24,374 steps. We'd made it.

The afternoon sun was reflecting off of a nearby glass building, casting a sepia glow around them. Sophia pointed. “Look at that!” she shouted. “It's so beautiful.”

It was a group of birds – I can't say for sure how many, let's just say five – about to take flight. They watched together as the birds lifted off. On their faces was something like contentment, or awe, or both.

And then they put their arms around each other.

Sebastian was the first to break off. “We're having so much fun,” he said. “Let's just walk all the way back.”

If walking is too sedate a sport for you, distance running is an increasingly popular way to work out. Last year, The Decibel's running club took stock of the changing sport with Ben Kaplan from iRun Magazine and Allison Hill of Hill Run Club. Subscribe for more episodes.

Former DNC vice chair David Hogg spoke to Fox News Digital at mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's election night party.

As Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City, former DNC vice chair David Hogg told Fox News Digital that Democrats heading into the midterms should focus on restoring voters' faith in the American Dream.

After losing up and down the ballot in 2024, Democrats secured victories in the most-watched races of this off-year election cycle — from a socialist shockwave in New York City, Democratic-led redistricting success in California and gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia.

""No other city is like New York City,"" Hogg said Tuesday night. ""No other state is like Virginia or New Jersey. The lesson that will be learned here tonight is not that every policy in New York should be replicated around the country. It's that listening and telling voters what you are actually going to do to lower prices works.""

The former DNC vice chair, who stirred up a Democratic Party rift earlier this year when he vowed to invest millions to primary older, incumbent Democrats in blue congressional districts, was among those celebrating Mamdani's success in New York City's high-stakes mayoral election Tuesday night.

""Having a clear message, asking them what you can do for them and wanting to genuinely serve them and actually delivering on that, does work,"" Hogg told Fox News Digital.

New York City's mayoral race exposed an ideological and generational divide within the Democratic Party.

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned from office in 2021 amid multiple controversies, including several sexual harassment allegations which he has denied, was staged to land his political comeback this year.

But plan was interrupted when Mamdani shocked the political establishment and won the Democratic primary in June.

A self-described democratic socialist, Mamdani will be New York City's youngest mayor in more than a century. His campaign focused on affordability, vowing to deliver fast and free buses, free childcare, rent freezes and city-run grocery stores to New York City.

""The truth is, there's a quiet civil war going on in the Democratic Party right now,"" Cuomo told Fox News last week. ""You have an extreme left. Radical left. Bernie Sanders, AOC — Mamdani is just the banner carrier for that movement — versus the mainstream moderate Democrats.""

Hogg, who endorsed Mamdani's campaign ahead of the primary, told Fox News Digital that Mamdani's success signals less about socialism and more about how to run a successful campaign.

""I think the lesson you learn here is not about policy, it is about tactics,"" he said. ""It's about listening. It's about clearly communicating what you're going to do to actually address voters' main concerns, and in New York City that may be somebody that's a lot more to the left, like Zohran, but in Virginia maybe somebody who is a lot more moderate, like Abigail. I think that's totally fine.""

Heading into the midterm elections, Hogg said Democrats ""need to show voters how we are the party of the working class by talking about policies that directly address the economy and making their life easier.""

""What this election is about is making the American Dream possible again,"" Hogg said.

Hogg was ousted as DNC vice chair earlier this year following a procedural challenge to his candidacy, which came on the heels of announcing his outside political action committee, Leaders We Deserve, would invest $20 million into primary challenges against incumbent Democrats he claimed were ""asleep at the wheel.""

""While this vote was based on how the DNC conducted its officers' elections, which I had nothing to do with, it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote,"" Hogg said in May.

Hundreds of supporters celebrated Mamdani's win at the Brooklyn Paramount theater on Tuesday night, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Rep. Jamaal Bowman, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Attorney General Letitia James, actress Cynthia Nixon, anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil and Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza.

Mamdani will be the first millennial mayor of the nation's largest city. He made strategic use of social media throughout his campaign, including TikTok, to build a recognizable brand and motivate a swath of low-propensity voters.

Like President Donald Trump in 2024, Mamdani centered his mayoral campaign on affordability, vowing to deliver a New York City that voters could actually afford to live in.

﻿Trump's tariffs appear to be in trouble.

The Supreme Court's Wednesday morning argument on President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariffs went better for him than the 2025 elections, but only slightly so.

At least two of the Court's Republicans — Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — appeared very likely to join the three Democratic justices in striking down those tariffs, and they will likely be joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. Though that does leave three votes for Trump, three is not enough.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

If the tariffs do, indeed, fall, it will be a dramatic turn from a Supreme Court that has largely behaved as lickspittles to the Republican president. This is, after all, the same Court that held that Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. And it's spent most of the last year handing down dozens of unexplained decisions in favor of Trump on the Court's “shadow docket.”

But one thing that sets the tariffs cases, known as Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, apart from those other Trump-related cases is that there are many voices within the Republican Party — and especially within its de facto legal arm, the Federalist Society — that oppose Trump's tariffs. One of the lead lawyers challenging the tariffs is Michael McConnell, a former George W. Bush appointee to the federal bench. At a Federalist Society conference last spring, many speakers doubted the tariffs' legality. Several prominent Republicans joined briefs attacking the tariffs.

It's worth noting that the strongest argument against the tariffs involves the Supreme Court's “major questions doctrine,” a limit on presidential power that was recently invented by the Court's Republicans, and that is so new that it has only ever been used against one president: Joe Biden. V.O.S. Selections and its companion case potentially give the Republican justices a chance to legitimize this doctrine by applying it to one of their fellow Republicans — potentially in an opinion joined by all three of the Court's Democrats.

In any event, it is always dangerous to predict that this Supreme Court will break with Trump, given the extraordinary loyalty its Republican majority has shown toward him in the past. It is always possible that, once the justices meet to discuss this case in private, they will retreat into their partisan camps and Trump will eke out a victory.

But, based on the questions the justices asked on Wednesday, it at least seems more likely than not that Trump's tariffs will fall.

V.O.S. Selections turns on a federal law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” This power may only be exercised to “deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.”

The plaintiffs challenging the tariffs, who include several state governments and also small businesses, argue that the word “regulate,” as it is used by IEEPA, does not include the power to impose taxes on imports. They also argue that Trump has not identified an unusual and extraordinary threat that can justify the tariffs. (Trump, for example, claims that many of his tariffs are necessary to address trade imbalances that have existed since the 1970s — which means these imbalances are both usual and ordinary.)

The plaintiffs also point to the major questions doctrine, which is supposed to prevent the executive branch from imposing policies that have “vast ‘economic and political significance,'” even when an existing federal statute could be read to authorize those policies.

Early in the argument, Barrett appeared persuaded by the argument that the power to regulate is distinct from the power to tax. She asked Solicitor General John Sauer to identify a Supreme Court case that read a statute that uses this word to permit taxation, and appeared unpersuaded by his responses. Barrett opened her question by pointing out that the only case he previously identified wasn't a Supreme Court case at all; it was a lower court decision interpreting a law that Congress replaced with IEEPA.

Gorsuch, by contrast, appeared completely unpersuaded by the plaintiffs' statutory arguments, at one point asking plaintiffs' lawyer Neal Katyal, “Do you need major questions to win?” before answering his own question with: “I kind of think you might.”

Yet, despite this letdown for the plaintiffs, Gorsuch's exchange with Katyal came after an absolutely blistering exchange with Sauer, where Gorsuch warned that if Congress could give Trump the tariffing power he seeks today, it could permit him to do virtually anything. “Could Congress delegate to the president” its entire power to “regulate commerce with foreign nations?” Gorsuch asked. Could it give him its entire power to “declare war”?

Gorsuch has historically been one of the Court's most vocal skeptics of laws giving expansive policymaking authority to the executive branch. And he appeared deeply troubled by the scope of the power Trump is claiming in this case.

Roberts appeared to share those concerns. At one point, he told Sauer that the major questions doctrine appears to be “directly applicable” to this case, pointing out that IEEPA has never been used before to justify tariffs, and that Trump now claims the power to impose tariffs “on any product, from any country, in any amount, for any length of time.”

So if any two among Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett hew to these views, it is almost certain that the tariffs will fall — although it is less clear whether the Court will rely on a statutory argument or the major questions doctrine. All three of the Court's Democrats also appeared very likely to oppose the tariffs.

Though Trump appears likely to lose this case, a Supreme Court decision against him is unlikely to end his trade war. There are other statutes he can rely on to impose tariffs, although those laws give him limited authority. One, for example, permits tariffs of up to 15 percent that must expire after 150 days.

It's also worth noting that Barrett asked several questions — that were frankly very difficult to parse — about a separate provision of IEEPA allowing the president to regulate trade “by means of…licenses.” Though Trump's lawyers did not rely on this provision at all in defending the tariffs, she seemed to think that it might permit Trump to revive at least some tariffs in the form of “licensing fees.”

In any event, it's unclear how this licensing fee loophole, which may allow Trump to revive some tariffs under another name, would work. But the legal fight over the tariffs is likely to continue for much — if not all — of Trump's remaining time in office. And that's assuming that this Court, which is ordinarily hyper-deferential to Trump, does not uphold his tariffs under IEEPA.

Based on Wednesday's argument, however, it appears more likely than not that two or three Republican justices will make a rare break with the leader of their political party.

In this article

Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have given the country's retailers another cost to manage during a period of persistent inflation.

While many are navigating the change with limited price increases, marketplace giant Amazon is hiking more than others.

Price increases are common for retailers trying to blunt higher costs from tariffs. Companies including Walmart and Target have said they are employing a portfolio approach to pricing following the tariff hikes, meaning they have raised prices on some items but not others.

But the companies rarely detail how much they're increasing prices or on what items. 

Amazon prices have risen 12.8% this year on average as of the end of September, according to an analysis of online pricing data from third-party research firm DataWeave. Prices at Target were up 5.5% since the start of the year, and prices at Walmart were 5.3% higher, according to the analysis.

DataWeave reviewed roughly 16,000 items each on Amazon's, Walmart's and Target's websites to conduct its analysis. The firm says it continuously collects publicly available data and captures live product and pricing information. Its data spans categories, locations and time periods, according to DataWeave's methodology.

While each of the three retailers increased prices throughout the year, the sharpest increase came from Amazon between January and February, when prices on the surveyed SKUs — a retail industry term meaning stock keeping units — rose 3.7%, according to DataWeave's analysis.

That jump actually came ahead of the majority of President Donald Trump's tariffs, announced in April, and could be the result of price normalization and a pullback in discounts after the 2024 holiday selling season, DataWeave found. However, Target and Walmart increased prices by an average of 0.97% and 0.85%, respectively, during the same time frame.

DataWeave's pricing analysis compares each retailer to its own prices over time and not to competitors — and to be sure, lower initial prices could show a higher percentage increase — but there is a common trend.

""Together, these trends show a clear hierarchy: Prices rose fastest where consumers shop by choice, not necessity, and most cautiously where they shop by need,"" Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder and CEO of DataWeave, said in a statement.

Apparel prices, for example, rose 11.5% on average between January and the end of September at Amazon, Target and Walmart. Indoor and outdoor home goods prices climbed an average of 10.8% across the three retailers. Prices for pet goods and consumable products increased by an average of 6.1%, and health and beauty items saw prices jump 7% on average. Prices for hardlines, a category that tends to include goods like electronics, furniture and appliances, rose 8.3%.

At Amazon, however, prices for those same categories rose more on average than at Target or Walmart.

Apparel prices increased 14.2%, indoor and outdoor home goods prices rose 15.3%, pets and consumables prices rose 11.3%, health and beauty prices rose 13.2%, and hardlines category prices rose 11.9%.

Guru Hariharan, founder and CEO of AI-driven e-commerce data platform CommerceIQ, told CNBC he's not surprised to see larger price increases on the marketplace leader.

""Third-party sellers are far more exposed to tariff-driven cost increases,"" Hariharan said. ""They don't have the scale, inventory flexibility or private-label leverage that large retailers like Walmart or Target can use to offset costs.""

As a result, marketplace sellers often have no choice but to pass higher costs onto the shopper, he said.

While Target and Walmart also have online marketplaces, third-party sales make up a much smaller percentage of their revenue than Amazon's, according to executives and earnings reports.

Many economists say the full impact of tariffs has yet to be felt throughout the economy as retailers work through inventory that came into the country at lower tariff levels.

""If we consider Amazon as the bellwether for U.S. commodity goods pricing, this trend is obviously expected to have a significant impact to the holiday season and economy in Q4,"" Hariharan said.

Amazon's shoppers don't appear to be fazed by the pricing. The company said its online store sales grew 10% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Third-party seller services — the revenue Amazon collects on third-party sales, including commission, fulfillment, shipping and advertising fees — increased 12% over that same time.

During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said, ""We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers.""

The company's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky added, ""Our sharp pricing, broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers.""

In response to the DataWeave price analysis, an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, ""The reality is that we offer competitive, low prices for Amazon customers and, based on our comprehensive analysis of millions of popular products customers are purchasing, we have not seen increases in price outside of normal fluctuations.""

Investors and shoppers will get their latest insights into how the largest U.S. retailers are handling pricing when Target and Walmart report their third-quarter results in mid-November.

Target has said on several occasions this year it would raise prices ""as a last resort"" as it combats rising costs. A company spokesperson, in response to the DataWeave findings, pointed CNBC to the example of holding prices on back-to-school items like crayons, notebooks and folders steady from 2024 to 2025.

Walmart told CNBC, ""We will do everything we can to keep prices as low as possible for as long as possible."" The company noted it has permanently lowered prices on 2,000 items since February – as opposed to its temporary cuts known as Rollbacks.

In early September, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said tariffs have created cost hikes for the company.

""We've seen a steady march up, kind of a gradual increase as it relates to our cost levels in general merchandise, which has created the single-digit inflation that we find ourselves dealing with now,"" McMillon said at the Goldman Sachs global retailing conference.

The Federal Reserve estimates tariffs are contributing five-tenths or six-tenths to the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the central bank's preferred measure of inflation, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week. Excluding tariffs, Powell said core PCE could be in the 2.3% to 2.4% range, rather than the 2.9% that was recorded in August.

The widely watched consumer price index, a broader measure of inflation, showed a 3% increase year over year for September. Direct CPI comparisons for the categories in DataWeave's study are difficult to pinpoint, but prices for household furnishings rose 3.7% from January through September of this year. Personal care items increased 3.5% over the same period, and apparel prices were up 2.1%, according to CPI data.

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, play a defining role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. The microglial response to amyloid plaques in AD can range from neuroprotective to neurotoxic2. Here we show that the protective function of microglia is governed by the transcription factor PU.1, which becomes downregulated following microglial contact with plaques. Lowering PU.1 expression in microglia reduces the severity of amyloid disease pathology in mice and is linked to the expression of immunoregulatory lymphoid receptor proteins, particularly CD28, a surface receptor that is critical for T cell activation3,4. Microglia-specific deficiency in CD28, which is expressed by a small subset of plaque-associated PU.1low microglia, promotes a broad inflammatory microglial state that is associated with increased amyloid plaque load. Our findings indicate that PU.1low CD28-expressing microglia may operate as suppressive microglia that mitigate the progression of AD by reducing the severity of neuroinflammation. This role of CD28 and potentially other lymphoid co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptor proteins in governing microglial responses in AD points to possible immunotherapy approaches for treating the disease by promoting protective microglial functions.

Alzheimer's disease is associated with diverse phenotypic changes in microglia5,6, resulting in distinct microglial states, including protective (aimed at amyloid clearance and neuroprotection7,8,9) and harmful (associated with microglia-driven neuroinflammation and toxicity)10,11. These opposing states are accompanied by broad changes in gene expression12,13,14,15,16,17, suggesting that defined transcriptional programs in microglia may govern their neuroprotective or neurotoxic functions. Here we present evidence that the neuroprotective state of microglia is governed by reduced expression of PU.1, a non-canonical pioneer transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of myeloid and lymphoid lineage differentiation18,19,20. PU.1 regulates lineage-specific gene expression in a dose-dependent manner21,22,23. More recently, PU.1 abundance in microglia has been linked to AD risk. Human genetic data show that a common variant, located within the 3′ untranslated region of the PU.1-encoding gene SPI1 and associated with reduced PU.1 expression in myeloid cells, correlates with delayed disease onset and reduced severity24.

We found that PU.1 expression in microglia is regulated not only genetically but also epigenetically by the microenvironment. Using the amyloid-based 5xFAD mouse model of the disease25, we identified a distinct subpopulation of microglia, among the previously described disease-associated microglia (DAM)12 or neurodegenerative microglia13, that displays lower PU.1/Spi1 expression compared with the rest of the population (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Table 1). These PU.1low microglia preferentially co-localized with amyloid plaques, in both 5xFAD mice (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1i) and individuals with AD (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2), and increase in numbers with disease progression (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Unlike non-plaque-associated (distal microglia; Extended Data Fig. 1b) or PU.1high plaque-associated microglia, this subpopulation appears independent of the activity of the essential microglial survival receptor CSF1R26,27 (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). The CSF1R-independent survival of PU.1low microglia at plaques may reflect either their non-microglial origin or the engagement of alternative compensatory survival pathways. Lineage-tracing experiments using a microglia-specific genetic approach (translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) mice28; Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3) confirmed that the plaque-associated CSF1R-independent PU.1low cells, despite showing low Csf1r gene expression (Supplementary Figs. 1h and 2f), are bona fide microglia. 

a, Uniform manifold approximation and projections (UMAPs) of ex vivo isolated forebrain microglia from 8-month-old wild-type and 5xFAD mice (two males per group) show distinct PU.1 expression states (PU.1low, PU.1med and PU.1high) among DAM12 (red). b,c, PU.1 protein is reduced in a subset of plaque-associated microglia in the cortex of 6-month-old 5xFAD mice (n = 5; one female and four males) (b) and in the frontal cortex of individuals with AD (79–91 years; n = 3; one female and two males) (c).

The PU.1low microglial population at amyloid plaques may be established either through a pre-existing PU.1low microglial subpopulation that is recruited specifically to plaques or by the downregulation of PU.1 expression in microglia in response to plaque-associated cues. Our data support the latter mechanism. Microglial accumulation at plaques and plaque-driven morphological and transcriptional responses depend on microglial surface receptor-mediated signalling8,12,13,29, which involves activation of the tyrosine kinase (SYK)9,30 and one of its key downstream targets (PLCγ2)31,32. Microglia-specific inactivation of either SYK (5xFAD;Cx3cr1CreERT2/+;Sykfl/fl; referred to as 5xFAD;SYK-KO) or PLCγ2 (5xFAD;Cx3cr1CreERT2/+;Plcg2fl/fl; referred to as 5xFAD;PLCγ2-KO), which impairs microglial engagement with the plaques9,30,32 (Fig. 1f), also significantly reduces the number of PU.1low microglia (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1e) and averts their CSF1R-independent survival at the plaques (Extended Data Fig. 1f).

Activation of SYK–PLCγ2-dependent signalling pathways in plaque-associated microglia occurs following the engagement of surface receptor proteins, including TREM2, CLEC7A and FcγR33. To confirm that PU.1 downregulation is driven by surface receptor-mediated signalling, we exposed ex vivo isolated microglia to phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (PS/PC)-containing liposomes31 or β-1,6-glucan pustulan34, which engage TREM2 and CLEC7A, respectively. Both ligands induced PU.1 downregulation (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d), which was attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition of downstream phospholipase C (PLC) activity35 (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Conversely, activation of PLC36 was sufficient to downregulate PU.1 even in the absence of external ligands (Extended Data Fig. 2e), confirming that activation of the SYK–PLCγ2 signalling pathways triggered by plaque-associated cues can regulate PU.1 expression in microglia.

The PU.1low plaque-associated microglia displayed gene expression patterns that, in addition to promoting lipid metabolism and lysosomal function37,38,39,40 (Extended Data Fig. 3a), showed a resemblance to lymphoid lineage cells (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Microglial single-cell (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 1), lineage-traced single-nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 3c–e and Supplementary Table 3) or spatial transcriptomics analyses (Fig. 2b,c, Extended Data Fig. 3f,g, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4) revealed that PU.1low plaque-associated microglia express genes encoding immunoregulatory lymphoid receptors and signalling proteins, such as CD28, PD-1 (Pdcd1), PD-L1 (Cd274), CD5, CTLA-2A, CD52, LAT2 and CD72 (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The transcripts encoding these proteins are associated with ribosomes in 5xFAD microglia (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting their translation and protein expression. Microglial lymphoid gene expression in PU.1low disease-associated microglia (DAM) is not restricted to mice but is also observed in individuals with AD15 (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 5).

To test the causal role of PU.1 downregulation in mediating the transcriptional shift towards a lymphoid gene expression pattern, we engineered mice with genetically altered PU.1 expression levels in microglia. Microglia-specific Cre-dependent deletion of one Spi1 allele41 (PU.1-low mice; Cx3cr1CreERT2/+;Spi1fl/+) resulted in an approximately 50% PU.1 reduction (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Conversely, PU.1-high mice were generated by Cre-dependent activation of an extra FLAG-tagged Spi1 gene (Cx3cr1CreERT2/+;Rosa26LSL.FLAG-Spi1/+), showing an approximately 25% increase in PU.1 expression (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). The changes in PU.1 expression levels were induced postnatally between 4 and 6 weeks to avoid developmental confounds.

Reduction of PU.1 expression in microglia was sufficient to recapitulate the lymphoid gene signature observed in plaque-associated PU.1low microglia, even in the absence of amyloid pathology (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4d–f and Supplementary Table 6). Moreover, PU.1low microglia, although maintaining an overall microglial lineage-specific chromatin accessibility pattern (Extended Data Fig. 4g, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 7), showed more T cell-like accessibility changes (Fig. 3c,d, Extended Data Fig. 4g–i, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 7). This transcriptional shift towards lymphoid gene (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4d–f and Supplementary Table 6) and protein expression (Extended Data Fig. 5), which is associated with an increase in microglial SYK–PLCγ2 signalling capacity (Extended Data Fig. 6), can be triggered in vitro by acute PU.1 knockdown through RNA interference in microglia-like BV2 cells39 (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Table 8), primary mouse microglia (Extended Data Fig. 5d) or human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (induced microglia-like cells (iMgls); Extended Data Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Tables 2 and 9). These data support a role for reduced PU.1 expression in a microglial shift towards lymphoid-associated gene expression in mice and humans. By contrast, increased PU.1 expression in microglia is associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype38,39 both in the non-diseased brain (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Figs. 4d–i and 5c and Supplementary Tables 6 and 8) and in response to amyloid pathology (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 4; single-cell sequencing, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 10).

Lowering PU.1 in the context of amyloid pathology (5xFAD; PU.1-low mice) has a protective effect on disease progression; it enhances microglia–plaque interactions42 by nearly doubling the number of plaque-associated and quadrupling the number of lymphoid gene-expressing/CD28+ microglia (MERFISH (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 3f,g, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 7 and Supplementary Table 4), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 10), TRAP sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 11), morphological analysis (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9a) and protein analysis (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9b)). These microglia display phenotypes linked to reduced neurotoxic activity10,43,44, marked by decreased expression of type I interferon-stimulated genes (such as Mx1) and complement (such as C1q), at both RNA (MERFISH (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 4), single-nucleus RNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 10) and TRAP sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 11)) and protein (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9c,d) levels, as well as a decline in neutral lipid droplet accumulation (Extended Data Fig. 9e). PU.1low microglia abundance was further associated with decreased amyloid burden and enhanced plaque compaction (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). In addition, PU.1low microglia are more effective in blocking the spread of injected human Tau aggregates in the brain of 5xFAD mice, leading to an overall reduction in pathogenic Tau accumulation (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 9g).

PU.1low microglia preserved synaptic integrity and associated cognitive function. Although 5xFAD mice were characterized by a significant loss of presynaptic neuronal terminals (Bassoon+ and VGLUT2+) in layer V of the cortex (Fig. 4h), impaired synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation (LTP)) in the hippocampus (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 9h) and behavioural deficits in the open-field and novel object recognition tasks45,46,47 (Fig. 4j,k and Extended Data Fig. 9i,j), lowering PU.1 level in microglia was sufficient to prevent these disease-associated alterations and preserve near-wild-type-like phenotypes (Fig. 4h–k and Extended Data Fig. 9h–j). PU.1low microglia, in contrast to PU.1high microglia, also significantly extended the lifespan of 5xFAD mice (Fig. 4l).

The PU.1low microglial expression of lymphoid receptor proteins with potent signalling capacity raised a question about the contributions of these receptors to PU.1low microglia activity and neuroprotection. We demonstrated that CD28, a well-known T cell co-stimulatory signalling protein3,4, which is induced by PU.1 downregulation and in response to plaque-associated cues in mouse (Figs. 2a,d, 3b,d and 4d and Extended Data Figs. 4e, 5, 9b and 10a,b) and human microglia (Fig. 2e), contributes to microglial activation during AD. We found that despite being expressed in only a small fraction of total microglia in 5xFAD brains (Fig. 5a, Extended Data Fig. 10c,d and Supplementary Table 12), CD28 plays an important regulatory role in broader microglia activation and disease progression. Microglia-specific deletion of CD28 in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 11a,b) increased amyloid plaque burden (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 11c,d) and microglial activation, characterized by a broad pro-inflammatory type I interferon response in approximately 30% of all microglia (Fig. 5d,e, Extended Data Fig. 11e,f, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 12). The frequency of microglia that display an inflammatory response during early disease progression exceeds the number of cells that express Cd28 by more than 10-fold (Fig. 5a,e). One interpretation of the observed broad inflammatory microglia activation is a possible trans-regulatory role for CD28+ PU.1low microglia in restraining neuroinflammation48 and associated amyloid plaque propagation.

The importance of CD28 (refs. 3,4) and probably other functionally related immunoregulatory receptors in governing microglial responses is underscored by recent findings identifying the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) receptor as a novel regulator of microglial activity in AD49. TIM3 deficiency promotes a protective microglia state in 5xFAD mice, characterized by increased phagocytic and reduced pro-inflammatory activity. One of the distinct microglial populations that is expanded upon TIM-3 deficiency expresses CD28 alongside other immune activity regulators, including Pdcd1 (PD-1), Cd274 (PDL-1), Cd5, Btla and Lat2 while exhibiting markedly reduced PU.1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 13). These findings raise the possibility that the neuroprotective effects of TIM-3 deficiency may involve CD28+PU.1low microglia, and that the coordinated activity of lymphoid-associated receptor gene expression in plaque-associated microglia underlies neuroprotection in AD.

Our observations support a model in which the switch towards a neuroprotective microglial state depends on the expression of immunoregulatory lymphoid receptor proteins that potentially govern microglial activity in a manner analogous to T cell regulation3,4,50. It is tempting to speculate that PU.1low microglia expressing lymphoid gene signatures contribute to neuroprotection not only in mice but also in humans. A gene expression analysis from large cohorts of human microglia17 revealed that individuals carrying the PU.1-lowering protective allele (GG/GA versus AA), which was previously associated with improved cognitive performance and reduced AD severity24, have an increased abundance of the lymphoid gene-expressing microglia subset (Mic. 13; Fig. 5f,g). The surface expression of CD28 and other lymphoid co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory receptor proteins on neuroprotective PU.1low microglia highlights a new opportunity for antibody-based microglia-driven immunotherapy in AD.

Post-mortem human brain tissue samples for immunohistochemistry were obtained from patients who had enrolled in and provided consent for a brain donation programme through the Neuropathology Brain Bank and Research CoRE at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. These samples were collected in accordance with ethical guidelines and institutional review board approval at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, ensuring the privacy and dignity of the donors while supporting ongoing neurological research. Tissue was obtained from donors who had provided written informed consent for research use either directly or through their next of kin. Three post-mortem brain samples (frontal cortex) were obtained from patients affected by Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. Neuropathological assessments were performed at the respective centres using standardized criteria, including the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuritic plaque assessment and Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging51,52. In this study, we did not recruit participants; we only de-identified post-mortem brain samples from individuals. Research with de-identified autopsy material does not meet the federal regulatory definition of human subject research, as defined in 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46. However, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements still apply.

Mice were housed in cages with two to five animals per cage, with a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 0700 to 1900 hours), a constant temperature (23 °C) and ad libitum access to food and water. Humidity averaged 38%, with a high of 58% and a low of 31% over a 24-h period. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and performed according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.

To achieve ectopic expression of the Spi1 gene, a floxed transcriptional STOP cassette followed by FLAG-tagged mouse Spi1 complementary DNA (cDNA) was targeted into the Rosa R26 locus of embryonic stem cells using the TV-targeting vector for homologous recombination at the ROSA26 locus, generously provided by K. Rajewsky58 and available at Addgene (plasmid no. 11739), as previously described. A schematic is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4a. In brief, a transcriptional STOP cassette consisting of six SV40 polyadenylation sites was flanked by loxP recognition sequences to facilitate Cre-mediated deletion and subsequent activation of exogenous FLAG-tagged Spi1.

To generate SYK-KO mice, Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt) (ref. 53) mice were crossed with Sykfl/fl (ref. 54) mice. To generate PLCγ2-KO mice, Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt) mice were crossed with Plcg2fl/fl (ref. 56) mice. To generate CD28-KO mice, Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt) mice were crossed with Cd28fl/fl (ref. 55) mice. To achieve microglia-specific PU.1-low and PU.1-high mice, microglia-specific Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt) (ref. 53) mice were crossed with Spi1fl/+ (ref. 41) or R26FLAG-Spi1/+ mice. Microglia-specific ribosomal profiling and single-nucleus sequencing were performed on mice further crossed with Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice60. For ISRE-reporter, Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);Spi1fl/+;5xFAD mice were additionally crossed with Mx1::GFP mice57. Unless otherwise specified, Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt) mice were used as controls. For all experiments involving disease models, mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice25. To control for potential differences in expression levels arising from paternal versus maternal transmission of the 5xFAD transgene61, litter-matched animals were used for comparison when applicable. Given the reported sex differences in some disease pathology phenotypes46,47,62, mice from both sexes were used unless otherwise specified. When both male and female mice were used, an analysis for sex differences was performed; unless otherwise noted, no sex differences were observed. All mice used in the experiments were backcrossed into the C57Bl/6 background for six or more generations.

To activate tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreErt2), all mice were gavaged at 4–6 weeks of age with six doses of 100 mg kg−1 of tamoxifen (T5648; Sigma) in corn oil (C8267; Sigma), administered at intervals of at least 48 h. For microglia ablation, 5xFAD mice (4–5 months old) were treated with CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (1,200-ppm diet, generously provided by Plexxikon) or vehicle for 4–6 weeks. PLC inhibitor (PLCi) injections were performed intraperitoneally daily for 5 days at 8.7 mg kg−1. PLCi U73122 (refs. 35,63) was first dissolved in chloroform at 100 mM. This solution was aliquoted and dehydrated using nitrogen. The dehydrated film was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 5 mM, diluted 1:8 in saline and injected.

AD-Tau was isolated, as previously described, from the brain of a human with AD64,65. Using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 23225), the total protein concentration of the AD-Tau preparation was 21.1 µg µl−1. The Tau concentration in the AD-Tau preparation was determined, as previously described, using a Tau-specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was found to be 5.4 µg µl−1 (refs. 64,65). The AD-Tau preparation was diluted to 0.4 µg µl−1 before the injections and sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Qsonica; Q700) for 30 s at 60% amplitude at 4 °C. The 7-month-old 5xFAD (seven females and five males) and 5xFAD;PU.1-low mice (four females and five males) were anaesthetized with isofluorane, immobilized in a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments) and unilaterally injected with a total of 2-µg AD-Tau (1 µg per injection site) in the dentate gyrus (Bregma, −2.5 mm; lateral, −2.0 mm; depth, −2.2 mm) and overlying cortex (Bregma, −2.5 mm; lateral, −2.0 mm; depth, −1.0 mm) using a Hamilton syringe (80265–1702RNR; needle, 7803–07). The mice were allowed to recover on a 37 °C heating pad and monitored for the first 72 h after surgery. Although male mice show overall slightly lower levels of amyloid and Tau pathology62,66, significant differences between genotypes were preserved as trends in both sexes when the sexes were separated.

Human iPSCs (see Supplementary Table 2 for demographic information) generated by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, UCI ADRC and WashU ADRC Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core from subject fibroblasts or PBMCs were maintained on Matrigel-coated six-well plates (BD Biosciences) in complete StemFlex (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A3349401). iPSCs were passaged every 5–6 days using ReLeSR dissociation reagent (STEMCELL Technologies; 05872) and used for haematopoietic stem cell differentiation with STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit (STEMCELL Technologies; 05310), followed by differentiation to iMgls using a previously published protocol67. The iMgls were maintained and fed with a microglial medium supplemented with three factors (3F medium containing 100 ng ml−1 of interleukin (IL)-34, 50 ng ml−1 of transforming growth factor (TGF)β and 25 ng ml−1 of macrophage colony-stimulating factor) for 25 days. On day 25, cells were collected for nucleofection using P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza; V4XP-3024) and 4D-Nucleofector System (Lonza; AAf-1003X). The cells were nucleofected with 50 nM of SMARTpool ON-TARGETplus short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human SPI1 (Dharmacon; L-010537-00-0005) or non-targeting pool (Dharmacon; D-001810-10-05). After nucleofection, the cells were transferred into iMgl medium with five factors (5F medium containing 100 ng ml−1 of IL-34, 50 ng ml−1 of TGFβ, 25 ng ml−1 of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 100 ng ml−1 of CXCL1 and 100 ng ml−1 of CD200) for an extra 3 days.

Microglia were isolated from neonatal (postnatal day P7–P10) mice for ex vivo cell culture and RNA isolation, as previously described68. The mice were rapidly killed, brains were extracted and meninges were removed before extracting the forebrain. Tissue was mechanically dissociated in glass homogenizers, and live cells were enriched by centrifugation over 20% Percoll (17-0891-02; GE HealthCare). Microglia were selected using anti-CD11B-coated microbeads (130-093-636; Miltenyi Biotec) with the QuadroMACS separator, following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were manually counted with a haemocytometer using trypan exclusion staining. For immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization, the microglia were plated at 250,000 cells per well using DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; 16140) and 100 U ml−1 of penicillin–streptomycin (Pen/Strep; Gibco; 15140) and allowed to adhere for 3–4 days before any experimental treatments. For immunocytochemistry and in situ experiments, cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (8774384; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Initial validation of the protocol for microglial purity was described previously68. In each experiment, microglial purity was visually determined by IBA1 or CD11b immunostaining. Cultures were consistently found to be purely microglia. These microglia were used to determine the regulation of PU.1 or CD28 levels following TREM2, CLEC7A or PLC stimulation in Extended Data Figs. 2 and 10a,b.

Primary microglia were isolated from postnatal days 2–3 CD1 mouse pups, as described previously69. In brief, brains were collected in Leibovitz's L-15 medium, and cortices were dissected. Cortical tissue was lysed at 37 °C for 25 min using 2.5% trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 15090046). Afterward, DNase I (Sigma; D4263-1VL) was added, and cells were pelleted at 270g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11965092) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco; 10437) and 1% Pen/Strep/l-glutamine (Gibco; 10378016) and passed through a 70-μm cell strainer. The cells were seeded into poly-d-lysine-coated T75 flasks and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The medium was changed on day in vitro (DIV)2 and supplemented with L929-conditioned medium on DIV6 and DIV10. On DIV11–14, microglia were collected and seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated plates using TGF-β, IL-34, and Cholesterol medium (DMEM/F12 phenol red-free (Gibco; 21041), 1% Pen/Strep/l-glutamine, 5 µg ml−1 of N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma; A9165), 5 µg ml−1 of insulin, 5 µg ml−1 of apo-transferrin, 5 ng ml−1 of sodium selenite (Roche; 11074547001), 2 ng ml−1 of TGFß2 (PeproTech; 100-35B), 10 ng ml−1 of colony-stimulating factor 1 (PeproTech; 315-02), 1.5 µg ml−1 of cholesterol (Sigma/Avanti; 700000 P) and 1% FBS. These microglia were used for PU.1 or CD28 quantification following siRNA magnetofection, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5d.

Primary microglia were magnetofected 24 h after seeding using the Glial-Mag magnetofection kit (GL00250), following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, siRNA (non-targeting control pool (scramble), Spi1 and Cd28; Horizon Discovery; D-001810-10-05, L-041420-00-0005 and L-058630-00-0005, respectively) was diluted in DMEM (Gibco; 11-965-092) and mixed with Glial-Mag transfection reagent. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the solution was added to each respective well in a dropwise manner. The Glia-Boost reagent was added directly to cells to a final concentration of 1×. The final concentration of siRNA was 25 nM. Cells were then incubated on top of a magnetic plate (OZ Biosciences; MF10000) inside a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. The magnetic plate was removed, and cells were incubated for an extra 3 h. Afterward, the medium was removed and replaced with 50% collected conditioned medium + 50% fresh TGFβ–IL34–cholesterol medium. Knockdown efficiency was analysed 48 h after magnetofection using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot.

The BV2 mouse microglial cell line was provided by M. Diamond (UT Southwestern Medical Center). It has been maintained by the Goate Laboratory for the past 15 years and by the Schaefer Laboratory for the past 10 years, with long-term storage in liquid nitrogen. BV2 cells have been authenticated on the basis of their characteristic microglia-like morphology, positive immunolabelling for microglia markers (CD11B, IBA1 and PU.1) and gene and protein expression analysis using RNA-seq and proteomic analysis. Mycoplasma contamination testing was performed on a regular basis every 3 months, and all cell lines tested negative. The BV2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco; 11965) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS and 100 U ml−1 of Pen/Strep. We have previously generated BV2 cells stably overexpressing mouse PU.1 and respective empty frame control, as well as BV2 cells with knockdown of PU.1 with the respective scrambled control39. Cells were used for western blot measurement of PU.1 and CD28 (Extended Data Fig. 5b), mass spectrometry analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and signalling phospho-protein analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

For TREM2 activation, PS/PC liposomes (70% DOPC and 30% POPS) resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from CD Bioparticles (CDECPS-1676). Microglial cultures were treated with liposomes resuspended in PBS at 0.1 mg ml−1 and 1 mg ml−1 for 12 h and 3 days, unless otherwise stated. For washout experiments, cells were treated with PS/PC liposome or vehicle for 3 days, the liposome-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium and cells were analysed 4 days later. Liposome-treated cells were imaged at the end of the 3-day treatment. For PLCi and PLC activator (PLCa) experiments, we used 0.1 μM U73122 (PLCi; Tocris) and 40 μM m-3M3FBS (PLCa; Tocris). U73122 was first dissolved in chloroform at 100 mM. This solution was aliquoted and dehydrated using nitrogen. The dehydrated film was dissolved in DMSO at 5 mM. m-3M3FBS was prepared using DMSO. The final DMSO concentration in the medium was 0.2%. PLCi was added 1 h before liposome treatment. For CLEC7A activation, pustulan (InvivoGen; tlrl-pst) was resuspended in PBS. Microglial cultures were treated with 50 μg ml−1 of pustulan for 3 days.

The 5-μm-thick paraffin-embedded post-mortem brain sections from individuals with AD (see Supplementary Table 2 for demographic information) were pretreated using Cell Conditioning CC1 antigen retrieval buffer (Tris/borate/EDTA buffer; pH 8.0–8.5; 950-224; Roche Diagnostics) and incubated in rounds of staining with primary antibodies against PU.1 (clone 9G7; Cell Signaling Technology; 2258S; 1:50), IBA1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; PA5-27436; 1:500) to label microglia, β-amyloid (clone 4G8; BioLegend; 800701; 1:4,000) and secondary antibody Multimer HRP OmniMap Anti-Mouse and Multimer HRP OmniMAP Anti-Rabbit (760-4310 and 760-4311; Roche Diagnostics; 1:1). Detection was performed using the DISCOVERY Purple HRP Kit, DISCOVERY Green HRP Kit and DISCOVERY Yellow HRP Kit (760-229, 760-271 and 760-250, respectively; Roche Diagnostics). Sodium citrate antigen retrieval (pH 6.0) was used between rounds to remove the antibody from the previous round and avoid cross-reactivity. Haematoxylin and bluing reagent (760-2021 and 760-2037; Roche Diagnostics) were used as a nuclear counterstain.

Digital images of the stained sections were captured at ×40 using the Aperio GT 450 high-resolution scanner (Leica Biosystems). Images were also acquired using the Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope at ×20 and ×40 magnification. Images were analysed using QuPath (v.0.5.1). For each sample, three regions of interest (ROI) were annotated in plaque-dense areas, and three ROI were annotated in plaque-depleted areas in the cortical grey matter, with each ROI measuring 1 mm2. Microglia were manually counted in each ROI. Microglia were considered plaque-associated if there was at least one IBA1+ process co-localized with an amyloid-β plaque. If microglia did not meet these criteria, the cell was considered distal. PU.1 level was manually scored as either low or high on the basis of the staining intensity of PU.1 within microglia nuclei.

For PU.1 and CD28 quantification, primary microglia isolated by anti-CD11B antibody were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 15 min, followed by three more PBS washes. Coverslips were washed and permeabilized with 0.2% PBS–Tween, followed by a 1-h blocking step with 4% normal goat serum in 0.2% PBS–Tween. The coverslips were then incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: PU.1 (1:200 Cell Signaling Technology; 2258), CD11B (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 14-0112-85) and IBA1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia and/or CD28 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology; 38774).The coverslips were washed three times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit 1:500 and goat anti-rat 1:500), conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546 or Alexa Fluor 568. To label nuclei, the coverslips were washed twice in PBST and once in PBS and then stained with DAPI (1:10,000 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature.The coverslips were then embedded on a microscopy slide using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen) and dried overnight. Imaging was performed using an LSM 780 confocal microscope (ZEISS). For z-stack images, 20-μm z-stack confocal images were acquired at 2-μm intervals, with ×20 objective at ×1 zoom. Image processing was performed using ZEN 2011 software (ZEISS). Image quantification of CD28 in vitro, z-section confocal microscopy images were applied to custom ImageJ macros. Using the maximum intensity projected z stack of the CD28 channel, the CD28 signal was detected using the default ImageJ threshold and measured using integrated density (as shown in figure quantifications unless otherwise specified) and mean grey value, both of which yielded comparable results.

Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 min, followed by three more PBS washes. Coverslips were then dehydrated in 50%, 70% and 100% ethanol and allowed to dry before in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope custom-designed probes for Spi1 in combination with the RNAScope 2.0 RED Kit, according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). After completing in situ hybridization, sections were rinsed with double-distilled water and a gradient concentration of PBS (0.1×–1×) before the colorimetric reaction, blocked in 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: PU.1 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology; 2258) and CD11B (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 14-0112-85) to label microglia. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBST and incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit 1:500; goat anti-rat 1:500, conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546) for 1 h at room temperature. To label nuclei, the coverslips were washed twice in PBST and once in PBS and then stained with DAPI (1:10,000 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed with a gradient concentration of PBS (0.1×–1×) and ddH2O, subjected to colorimetric reaction, dried for 15 min at 60 °C, mounted using EcoMount (EM897L; Biocare Medical) and dried overnight. Z-stack images were taken on a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope with 20-μm z-stack confocal images acquired at 2-μm intervals and ×20 objective at ×1 zoom. Image processing was done using ZEN 2011 software.

Z-section confocal microscopy images were applied to custom ImageJ macros. Nuclei in the DAPI channel were segmented using the default ImageJ threshold, followed by the ‘AnalyzeParticles' function without size and circularity constraints to identify all microglia nuclei. These DAPI ROI were then projected onto PU.1 maximum intensity projected z stack of the corresponding PU.1 channel to measure the nuclear PU.1 signal through mean grey value (as shown in figure quantifications unless otherwise specified) and integrated density measurements, both of which yielded comparable results in PU.1 signal in treatment versus control conditions. For the quantification of microglia Spi1 signal from in situ hybridization and correlation analyses between PU.1 versus Spi1 signal within microglia, the ImageJ freehand selection tool was used to manually outline the borders of individual microglia (ROI for Spi1) along with their corresponding nuclei (ROI for PU.1). Within these microglia, the ROI mean grey value and integrated density measurements were calculated, yielding comparable results in Spi1 and PU.1 signal in treatment versus control. At least 30 microglia from each coverslip from each condition were quantified this way, and the average mean grey value of these cells is shown in the figure quantifications unless otherwise specified.

For immunofluorescence and RNA in situ hybridization of mouse tissue, mice were anaesthetized with ketamine (120 mg kg−1) and xylazine (24 mg kg−1) and perfused transcardially with 10-ml PBS and 40 ml of 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences), as previously described70. Fixed brains were removed and dehydrated in 15% and 30% sucrose in PBS. Following dehydration, the brains were frozen in Neg-50 (Life Technologies) on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until further processing. The brains were cut using a cryostat, and 10-μm or 30-μm sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which were stored at −80 °C until staining.

For immunohistochemistry of AT8 and amyloid-β, 10-month-old 5xFAD (seven females and five males) and 5xFAD;PU.1-low (four females and five males) mice were killed through intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (200 mg kg−1), 3 months after the AD-Tau injection. Whole brains were extracted and fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h before being transferred to 30% sucrose and stored at 4 °C until sectioned. The brains were cut coronally into 30-μm sections on a freezing sliding microtome (Microm; HM 400) and stored in a cryoprotectant solution (0.2 M PBS, 15% sucrose and 33% ethylene glycol) at −20 °C until use. A notch on the left hemisphere at the piriform cortex ensured proper identification of the ipsilateral AD-Tau-injected side.

For immunohistochemical staining of AD-Tau64,65 and amyloid-β, sections were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 5 min and incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. After washing, sections were blocked for 30 min in 3% milk in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100. The primary antibody was diluted in 1% milk in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100, and sections were incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (AD-Tau (AT8; mouse monoclonal; 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; MN1020B) and amyloid-β (HJ3.4 biotinylated; anti-amyloid-β N terminus 1–16; mouse monoclonal; 2 µg ml−1 generated in-house71). The next day, sections were washed three times and then incubated in ABC Elite solution (Vectastain; PK-6100) for 1 h, prepared following the manufacturer's instructions, followed by another washing step. Sections were developed in DAB solution (Sigma; D5905 for AT8; anti-amyloid-β N terminus 1–16 antibody; clone HJ3.4), washed and mounted on slides. After drying overnight, the slides were dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations followed by xylene and coverslipped with CytoSeal 60 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 8310).

For microglia size and number quantification, plaque-associated microglia quantification, 6E10, ThioS and boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) imaging, 30-μm slides from 5xFAD;PU.1-low, 5xFAD–SYK-KO, 5xFAD;PLCγ2-KO or 5xFAD;CD28-KO mice with sex-matched and age-matched littermate control 5xFAD mice were washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBST and blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBST. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies in 2% normal goat serum in PBST overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies included CD11B (1:1,000; MCA711GT; Bio-Rad) and IBA1 (1:750; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia and 6E10 (1:500; 803004; BioLegend) to label amyloid-β. The slides were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-labelled, 546-labelled or 568-labelled goat anti-rat IgGs heavy and light chains (H + L); 1:500; Life Technologies) in 2% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed and incubated with Thioflavin S for 2 min (1% Thioflavin S diluted 1:1,000 in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich; T1892) to label dense-core plaques, followed by DRAQ5 for 20 min (1:2,500 in PBS) to label nuclei. For neutral lipid droplet imaging, BODIPY 505/515 (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; Thermo Fisher Scientific; D3921) was used to label lipid droplets, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Imaging was performed using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope. Confocal z-stack images (20 μm) were acquired at 2-μm intervals using a ×40/1.3 oil objective. Image processing was performed using ZEN 2011 software (ZEISS). Compressed z-stack immunofluorescence images were used as representative images unless otherwise specified.

For PU.1 quantification, 30-μm slides from 6-month-old sex-matched control, 5xFAD, CSF1Ri-treated 5xFAD, 5xFAD–SYK-KO, 5xFAD;PLCγ2-KO, SYK-KO, PLCγ2-KO, PU.1-low and/or PU.1-high and 20-month-old control mice were washed with PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed using 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 10 min at room temperature, followed by DNAse treatment of the fixed tissue to increase nuclear accessibility to primary antibodies. The slides were blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBST and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in the same blocking solution. The primary antibodies included PU.1 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology; 2258) and CD11B (1:500 Thermo Fisher Scientific; 14-0112-85) or IBA1 (1:750; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia. The slides were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-labelled, 546-labelled and 568-labelled goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat, goat anti-chicken, goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat IgGs (H + L); 1:500; Life Technologies) in 2% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. To label nuclei, the slides were incubated with DRAQ5 (1:2,000 in PBS; Life Technologies; 62254), washed, coverslipped using ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen) and dried overnight. For images containing plaques, the plaques were stained with Thioflavin S for 2 min after secondary antibody incubation (1% Thioflavin S diluted 1:5,000 in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich; T1892) to label dense-core plaques. Nuclei were labelled using DRAQ5 (1:2,000 in PBS) for 20 min. Imaging was performed using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope. Confocal z-stack images (20 μm) were acquired at 2-μm intervals using a ×40/1.3 oil objective. Image processing was performed using ZEN 2011 software (ZEISS). Compressed z-stack immunofluorescence images were used as representative images unless otherwise specified.

For CD28 quantification, 30-μm slides from 5xFAD;CD28-KO and 5xFAD;PU.1-low mice with sex-matched and age-matched littermate control 5xFAD mice were washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBST and blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBST. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies in 2% normal goat serum in PBST overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies included IBA1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia and CD28 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology; 38774). The slides were then washed with PBST and incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h (Alexa Fluor 488-labelled goat anti-chicken IgG (H + L); 1:500; Life Technologies). Tyramide amplification for CD28 using 568 tyramide conjugate was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Tyramide SuperBoost Kit goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific; B40922) and Tyramide Conjugate (Invitrogen; B40956)). The slides were washed and incubated with DRAQ5 (1:2,000 in PBS) for 20 min to label nuclei, followed by Thioflavin S staining (1% Thioflavin S diluted 1:5,000 in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich; T1892) for 2 min to label dense-core plaques. Imaging was performed using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope. Confocal z-stack images (20 μm) were acquired at 2-μm intervals using a ×40/1.3 oil objective. Image processing was performed using ZEN 2011 software (ZEISS). Compressed z-stack immunofluorescence images were used as representative images unless otherwise specified.

For VGluT2, Bassoon and C1Q quantification, 10-µm coronal brain sections from control, 5xFAD and 5xFAD;PU.1-low mice were blocked and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature in 10% normal goat serum/0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (all from Sigma). Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature overnight. The following primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been used: mouse monoclonal anti-Bassoon (Enzo Life Sciences; ADI-VAM-PS003-F; 1:500) and guinea pig polyclonal anti-VGLUT2 (Synaptic Systems; 135404; 1:2,000) to label presynaptic axonal terminals and C1Q (Abcam; ab182451; 1:500). The following day, sections were incubated with appropriate Alexa-fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and β-amyloid plaques were visualized using 0.0005% Thioflavin S in 1× PBS (Sigma-Aldrich; T1892) to label dense-core plaques. After thorough washing, sections were mounted using VECTASHIELD without DAPI (Vector Laboratories).

For Mx1–GFP+ microglia quantification, 30-μm slides from 5xFAD;Mx1–GFP (two females and two males) and 5xFAD;Mx1–GFP;PU.1-low mice (two females and one male) were washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBST and blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBST. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies in 2% normal goat serum in PBST overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies included CD11B (1:500; eBioscience; 14-0112-82) to label microglia and turboGFP (1:5,000; Evrogen; AB513) to label Mx1–GFP+ interferon-responsive cells. The slides were then washed, and the signal for turboGFP was amplified for 10 min using tyramide signal amplification with SuperBoost (Invitrogen; B40922). The slides were washed and incubated with Thioflavin S for 2 min (1% Thioflavin S diluted 1:10,000 in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich; T1892) to label dense-core plaques and then with DRAQ5 for 20 min (1:2,000 in PBS) to label nuclei. For BODIPY imaging, the manufacturer's recommendations were followed. Imaging was performed using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope. Confocal z-stack images (20 μm) were acquired at 2-μm intervals using a ×40/1.3 oil objective. Image processing was performed using ZEN 2011 software (ZEISS). Compressed z-stack immunofluorescence images were used as representative images unless otherwise specified.

For most image analyses (with the exception of the analyses indicated below), single eight-tile z-stack images with a ×20 objective (×1 zoom) were analysed using Imaris software (Bitplane). First, a surface for plaques was generated. Next, microglia surfaces (processes) within 5 μm of the plaque surface were generated to select for plaque-associated microglia. We used this cutoff to select for microglia virtually touching the plaques. Finally, surfaces were generated for plaque-associated microglial nuclei. The number of nuclei per plaque, the surface area of plaques and the volume of plaques were calculated. The distal microglia were counted similarly for those more than 5 μm from the plaque surface. They were normalized to cortex volume minus total plaque volume. The total microglia numbers were calculated similarly. For volume calculations, the volume of the microglia surface was divided by the number of nuclei. For BODIPY quantification, a microglia surface was generated, and then a BODIPY+ surface was generated within microglia. The volume of the BODIPY surface per microglia volume was calculated. Mx1::GFP+ microglia were quantified manually.

For Bassoon and VGLUT2 density quantification, three to four stained sections from each sample containing the somatosensory cortex were imaged using a ZEISS Observer Spinning Disk Confocal microscope equipped with diode lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 594 nm and 647 nm) and ZEN Blue acquisition software (ZEISS). Two to three randomly chosen ×63 fields of view within the somatosensory cortex were acquired with five z-stack steps at 0.68 µm spacing for each hemisphere. Identical settings were used to obtain images from all samples within one experiment, and data analyses were performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, v.1.53k), as described previously, with some modifications72. In brief, a consistent threshold range was first determined using sample images for each genotype and condition. All images were subjected to background subtraction. Then, single z-planes of the z-stacks (five z-planes per animal) were subjected to the same background subtraction and thresholding. Finally, the total area of presynaptic inputs was measured from the thresholded images using the AnalyzeParticles function of ImageJ. Data from single z-planes were averaged for each z-stack of each field of view, and the mean of all fields of view from one animal was determined and normalized to control animals to assess changes in synaptic densities. For inhibitor experiments, manual thresholding, blinded to condition and genotype for each channel within one experiment, was performed (ISODATA segmentation method; 85–255).

For AT8 and HJ3.4–amyloid-β immunohistochemistry quantification, images were obtained from two to three sections per mouse. Slides were scanned on the NanoZoomer 2.0-HT system (Hamamatsu Photonics). The images were further processed using NDP viewing software (Hamamatsu Photonics) and Fiji software v.1.51 (National Institutes of Health).

For 6E10–amyloid-β/ThioS ratio quantification from the hippocampus and subiculum, z-stack images of approximately 20-μm thickness acquired with a ×40 objective at ×1 zoom were used to quantify the area of the respective signals in maximum intensity Z projections in ImageJ.

For PU.1 immunofluorescence quantification by CellProfiler (Figs. 1e and 3a), approximately 20 μm of mouse brain tissue stained for PU.1, CD11B, DRAQ5 and ThioS was captured by z-section confocal microscopy. The z sections were projected as summed slices and converted to 16-bit. Images stained for CD11B (microglia marker) were normalized to 0.35% pixel saturation to standardize microglia segmentation (outlining) in Fiji/ImageJ73. The z-projected images were then loaded into CellProfiler v.4.2.1 (ref. 74), in which microglia nuclei were identified, the nuclear outline was applied to the PU.1 channel and measurements of individual nuclei were recorded. CellProfiler classified nuclei as belonging to microglia using FilterObjects if they exceeded an upper quartile intensity threshold in the CD11B stain and passed spatial form factor and eccentricity thresholds. To further constrain microglia nuclei, CellProfiler was used to generate a properties file containing DRAQ5 nuclei objects and the associated CD11B and DRAQ5 measurements. The classifier feature in CellProfiler Analyst v.3.0.4 (ref. 75) was then trained using the properties file by visually selecting representative microglia and non-microglia nuclei, applying the training and saving a .model file. A separate CellProfiler pipeline was then created to incorporate this classifier model under ClassifyObjects. Nuclear outlines were reduced in size for consistency. Microglial PU.1 values, merged images containing outlines and mean intensity measurements to allow visual inspection were recorded.

For PU.1 immunofluorescence quantification by Imaris (Fig. 1b,f and Extended Data Fig. 1a,e), approximately 20 μm of mouse brain tissue from control, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;SYK-KO and 5xFAD–PLCγ2-KO, as well as PU.1-low and PU.1-high mice (as reference mice), stained for PU.1, IBA1, DRAQ5 and Thioflavin S, was captured using z-section confocal microscopy. The z sections were analysed using Imaris software (Bitplane). First, a surface for IBA1+ microglia was generated, and the DRAQ5 nuclei channel was masked within this surface. Next, microglia nuclei were specifically detected by creating a surface for the masked DRAQ5 channel. The mean signal intensity for the PU.1 channel was measured within the microglia nuclei DRAQ5 surface. Low and high PU.1 cutoffs were defined on the basis of the fold change in mean PU.1 signal between nuclei from PU.1-high and PU.1-low microglia. The fold change (calculated as the mean PU.1 signal in PU.1-high nuclei divided by the mean PU.1 signal in PU.1-low nuclei) was determined to be 1.25. For each experiment, the high cutoff was set by multiplying and the low cutoff was set by dividing the mean PU.1 signal across all microglia of 6-month-old 5xFAD mice. Nuclei between these cutoffs were considered to have medium PU.1 signal. Quantifications represent the proportion of microglia within each of these PU.1 intensity categories normalized to the total number of microglia analysed.

For CD28 quantification, approximately 20 μm of mouse brain tissue stained for CD28, IBA1, DRAQ5 and ThioS was captured by z-section confocal microscopy. The z sections were analysed using Imaris software (Bitplane). Microglia nuclei in each image were detected and counted using the Spots function. IBA1+CD28+ microglia were counted and normalized to the total number of microglia per image.

In situ hybridization was performed on 30-μm cryosectioned slides from 5xFAD;CD28-KO mice with sex-matched and age-matched littermate control 5xFAD mice using RNAscope probes for Cd28 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics; 1070671-C1) and Mx1 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics; 474931-C1) to label interferon-responsive cells, with the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 according to the manufacturer's recommendation for fixed-frozen tissue samples. After completing the in situ hybridization, sections were rinsed in PBST for 15 min and blocked in 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody IBA1 (1:1,000; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia. Sections were washed three times with PBST for 10 min and incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-chicken; 1:500; conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 488) and DAPI (1:10,000) to label nuclei for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed twice in PBST and once in PBS, dried, mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (P36930; Invitrogen) and dried overnight. Z-stack images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope with 30-μm z-stack confocal images acquired at 0.8-μm intervals and ×20 objective at ×1 zoom, and image processing was done using Fiji software. Microglia were identified by IBA1. Cd28+ or Mx1+ microglia were manually identified by at least five dots (Cd28) or three dots (Mx1) of in situ signal within the microglia nuclei.

For MERFISH, we used two control (Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt)), three 5xFAD (Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD), two 5xFAD;PU.1-low (5xFAD;Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);Spi1fl/+) and one 5xFAD;PU.1-high (5xFAD;Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);R26FLAG-Spi1/+) male mice (8–10 months old). After sacrificing the mice, the brains were immediately placed in a cold O.C.T. Compound (Fisher; 23-730-571) and frozen. The samples were then processed following the Vizgen Fresh Frozen Tissue Sample Preparation protocol. Briefly, brains were sagittally sectioned into 10-µm-thick slices and placed on a functionalized coverslip covered with fluorescent beads (Vizgen; 20400001). Once the tissue adhered to the coverslip, we fixed the tissue (4% PFA in 1× PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. After aspiration, we added 70% ethanol to permeabilize the tissue for 24 h at 4 °C. The samples were photobleached for 3 h in 70% ethanol (MERSCOPE Photobleacher; Vizgen; 10100003), followed by incubation with a blocking solution (Vizgen Blocking Buffer C premix; 20300100; and 10% RNase inhibitor; New England Biolabs; M0314L) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the samples were incubated with a primary antibody solution (purified azide-free anti-β-amyloid 6E10; 803004; BioLegend; and 1:100 plus 10:100 of RNase inhibitor; New England Biolabs; M0314L). The samples were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody solution (Vizgen; Anti-Mouse Aux 4 20300101; and 1:100 plus 10:100 of RNase inhibitor; New England Biolabs; M0314L) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed three times with 1× PBS, fixed (4% PFA in 1× PBS) for 15 min at room temperature and washed two times with 1× PBS. Following staining, the samples were incubated in formamide wash buffer (30% formamide in 2× saline–sodium citrate (SSC) buffer), and the MERFISH library mix was added and left for hybridization for 48 h. We then washed the samples twice and incubated them at 47 °C with formamide wash buffer. Then, the tissue was embedded in a polyacrylamide gel, followed by incubation overnight at 37 °C using a tissue clearing solution (2× SSC, 2% SDS, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 and 1:100 proteinase K). The tissue was washed (2× SSC) and incubated with DAPI and PolyT solution (Vizgen) for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslip was assembled into the imaging chamber and placed into the microscope for imaging. The MERSCOPE 500 gene imaging kit (Vizgen; 10400003) was activated by adding 250 μl of Imaging Buffer Activator (Vizgen; 203000015) and 100 μl of RNase Inhibitor (New England Biolabs; M0314L). Mineral oil (15 ml) was overlaid on top of the imaging buffer through the activation port. The instrument was primed, and the imaging chamber was assembled according to the MERSCOPE user guide. A ×10 low-resolution mosaic of the sample was acquired. The imaging area was then selected, and the sample was imaged. The settings for the MERSCOPE antibody image acquisition were set to high.

Following image acquisition, the resulting data were decoded using Vizgen's analysis pipeline incorporated in MERSCOPE. Vizgen's post-processing tool was then applied to obtain the cell segmentation on the basis of the DAPI staining using the Cellpose algorithm. Segmentation was performed on the middle z plane (fourth of seven), and cell borders were propagated to z planes above and below. The following gene sets have been used to identify cell types in the representative images: macrophage-identifying gene (Mrc1), endothelial cell-identifying gene (Cldn5), T cell-identifying genes (Cd3e and Cd8a), microglia homeostatic genes (Cx3cr1, Tmem119, P2ry12, Csf1r, Hexb, Aif1, Tnf, Trem2, Itgam, C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Sall1 and Selplg), neuron-identifying gene (Meg3), oligodendrocyte-identifying genes (Mog, Sox10 and Mag), lymphoid genes (Pdcd1, Cd274, Cd28, Cd72, Tnfsf13b and Cd4) and DAM-identifying genes (Itgax, Clec7a, Igf1, Cst7 and Spp1) (Extended Data Fig. 3g).

Single-cell gene expression matrices were obtained by counting messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules within segmented cell boundaries and were further analysed in RStudio using R 4.2.2, Seurat 5.0.3 and custom-made scripts (https://github.com/SchaferLabUMassChan/Ayata-et-al_2025). We excluded cells containing fewer than 40 transcripts or a volume of less than 100 µm3. To account for global differences in mRNA counts between samples, we normalized data to the total transcripts per cell of each sample. We then normalized the gene expression of each cell by its volume to compute counts per cubic micrometre. Cells with less than 11 unique genes were further excluded.

For annotation of cell types and nearest-neighbour analysis relative to plaques, data from all samples were merged into a single Seurat object for clustering and cell type annotation following a modified Seurat pipeline. Data were normalized by dividing gene counts per cubic micrometre for each cell by the total count per cubic micrometre for that cell, multiplied by 10,000 and log-transformed. Data were then scaled, and the principal components were calculated on all 398 measured genes. Thirty-nine principal components were used to calculate the UMAP embedding and perform clustering analysis using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 2.4. Clusters were manually annotated on the basis of the spatial distribution of the cells in the tissue and expression of cell-type-specific marker genes. Owing to imperfections in cell boundary segmentation, a small fraction of cells expressed cell type markers for several cell types. Clusters composed of these ‘hybrid' cells and clusters consisting of imaging artefacts were removed from the analysis. UMAP embedding and clustering analysis were iteratively repeated until all hybrid clusters were removed.

Microglia sub-cluster analysis was performed using the same modified Seurat pipeline. Before the removal of clusters containing hybrids, all clusters expressing microglia cell type markers (Tmem119, Hexb, P2ry12, Trem2, C1qa and Cx3cr1) were separated out and sub-clustered. Sub-clusters composed of hybrid cells and sub-clusters composed of border-associated macrophages (Mrc1, Lyve1 and Cd163) were removed from the analysis. Seventeen principal components were used to calculate the UMAP embedding and perform clustering analysis using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.7.

The X and Y coordinates of all amyloid-β plaques in the cortex of two 5xFAD MERFISH samples were manually recorded using MERSCOPE visualizer software (Vizgen) to visualize anti-β-amyloid 6E10 immunofluorescent signal. For each plaque, because plaques varied in size, 4 points along the perimeter were recorded. The X and Y coordinates outlining the cortex were acquired by manual tracing in the MERSCOPE visualizer software (Vizgen) using DAPI signal and Meg3, Cux2 and Rorb transcripts as landmarks. For all microglia within the cortex, the distance between each microglia and the nearest plaque was calculated using a custom Python script (find_nearest_neighbors2.py). The nearest-neighbour distance was calculated as the distance between the centre of the microglia and the edge of the plaque (defined using four points around the perimeter of each plaque). Microglial nuclei within 15 µm of a plaque were defined as ‘plaque-associated', whereas those further than 15 µm from the nearest plaque were defined as ‘distal'. We used a larger distance cutoff for nuclei to account for the soma and processes.

The MERFISH analysis plots were generated using Seurat 5.0.3 and scCustomize 3.0.1 R packages. MERFISH-processed data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are publicly available as of the date of publication. Processed MERFISH.vzg files for browsing on MERSCOPE visualizer software (Vizgen) and the MERFISH raw output files are available upon request. Any further information required to reanalyse the data reported in this paper is available upon request.

For microglia phospho-protein analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6a), PU.1-low, wild-type and PU.1-high mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and brain regions were immediately removed. Frozen tissue was mechanically dissociated in glass homogenizers in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with protease and RNase inhibitors. The homogenate was filtered through a 70-μm mesh filter. Myelin removal was performed using Percoll (pH 7.4) density gradient separation. The homogenate was supplemented with 90% Percoll (17-0891-02; Amersham) with PBS (pH 7.4). The resulting homogenate in a 21% Percoll gradient was centrifuged at 500g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed and resuspended in HBSS. Microglia were gated as live cells expressing YFP+ in Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt) mice (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Roughly 120,000 cells were used per sample.

For ATAC-seq, wild-type, PU.1-low and PU.1-high mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine, transcardially perfused with 12 ml of cold HBSS. The brains were collected, and the cerebellum and olfactory bulb were removed. Tissue was mechanically dissociated in glass homogenizers in HBSS. Myelin removal was performed using Percoll (pH 7.4; GE-17-0891-02) density gradient separation in 30% Percoll centrifuged at 500g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed and resuspended in magnetic-activated cell sorting buffer (2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS) with DAPI and sorted on the FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Microglia were gated as live cells expressing YFP+ (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Roughly 50,000 cells were used per sample.

For single-cell sequencing and CD28 analysis, wild-type and 5xFAD mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and brain regions were immediately removed. Fresh tissue was mechanically dissociated in glass homogenizers in HBSS and then supplemented with fluorescently conjugated antibodies (rat anti-mouse APC-CD11B; eBioscience; 17-0112-82; 1:100; and rat anti-mouse PerCP-Cy5.5-CD45; Invitrogen; 45-0451-82; 1:100) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice (300g centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin). Cells were sorted on the FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Microglia were gated as live cells expressing CD11B+ and Cd45low (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Roughly 250,000 (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and 700,000 (Extended Data Fig. 9b) cells were used per well for CD28 western blotting.

For ATAC-seq, wild-type mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with 12 ml of cold HBSS. Spleens were collected and homogenized on ice using a 70-µm strainer. Red blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience; 00-4333-57) for 5 min at room temperature, followed by a PBS wash and centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in magnetic-activated cell sorting buffer, incubated with Fc blocker (Bio-Rad; BUF041B; 1:100) on ice for 10 min, stained with Thy1.2 (eBioscience; 17-0902-82; 1:100) and DAPI and sorted on the FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). T cells were gated as live cells expressing THY1+. For western blot analysis, cells were snap-frozen and prepared, as described below. Roughly 250,000 (Extended Data Fig. 5a) cells were used for CD28 western blotting.

For protein preparation from tissue, 6-month-old PU.1-low (three females and two males), control (two females and three males) and PU.1-high (three females) mice, as well as 6-month-old control (six males), 5xFAD (four males) and 5xFAD–PU.1-low mice (three males) were killed, and brain tissue was dissected and frozen immediately. The frozen brain tissue (cortex or hippocampus) was resuspended in 1% SDS (Ambion) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche), sonicated at 4 °C using a Bioruptor on high-power 30-s on/30-s off cycles for a total of ten cycles and boiled for 10 min in 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 200 mM (Sigma).

For protein preparation from cells, BV2 cells, iMgls, ex vivo microglia or T cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The BV2 cells were detached from the culture plate using PBS + 2 mM EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, whereas the primary microglia required further scraping. Protein was lysed in cold RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 89900) with protease inhibitors (Roche; 11873580001), phosphatase inhibitors (Roche; 4906845001) and benzonase (MilliporeSigma; 71206) for 1 h on ice. Samples were then brought to 0.35 M NaCl, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and spun at 14,000g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was moved to a fresh tube.

The protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein samples were diluted in equal volumes of 2× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 200 mM (Sigma). Protein samples (20–40 μg) or concentrated culture supernatant (100 μg) was separated on 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris precast denaturing gels or 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast denaturing gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For CD28 and PU.1 immunoblotting of primary microglia, NuPAGE Antioxidant (Invitrogen) was added to the running buffer. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)– or milk–TBST solution overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (GE; 1:10,000), anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (GE 1:10,000) or anti-sheep IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer) and exposed on film. Exposed films were scanned, and protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Protein quantities were normalized using β-actin or histone H3. Full scans of western blots (uncropped) are provided in Supplementary Figs. 9–11.

The primary antibodies used were Syk (Cell Signaling Technology; 2712; 1:500), phospho-Syk Y352 (Cell Signaling Technology; 2717; 1:500), PLCG2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 3852; 1:500), phospho-PLCG2 Y1217 (Cell Signaling Technology; 3871; 1:500), PU.1 (Cell Signaling Technology; 2266; 1:500), CD28 (Abcam; ab243228; 1:500), ACTB (Abcam; ab8227; 1:2,000), H3 (Abcam; ab1791; 1:5,000), IBA1 (1:500; Wako; 016-20001) and C1Qa (1:500; Proteintech; 11602-1-AP).

Sample preparation and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry measurements were performed, as previously described76. In brief, BV2 cells were lysed in sodium deoxycholate buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM tris(2-carboxy (ethyl)phosphine), 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide and 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5)), heated at 95 °C for 10 min and sonicated to shear DNA. Proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C and 1,000 rpm using trypsin and LysC (1:100 enzyme/protein ratio; w/w). Digests were desalted using in-house-made SDB-RPS StageTips. Desalted peptides were dried in a vacuum concentrator and resolubilized in 0.1% formic acid. Concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and normalized between samples for equal peptide injection. Peptide mixtures were analysed using an EASY-nLC 1000 chromatographic system coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated by 120-min chromatographic gradients using a binary buffer system comprising buffer A (0.1% formic acid in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-grade water) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-grade water) on a 50-cm in-house-made column (75-µm inner diameter) packed with 1.9-µm ReproSil C18 beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH) at a flow rate of 300 nl min−1 and 60 °C maintained by an in-house-made column oven. Spectra were acquired with data-independent acquisition using full scans with a range of 300–1,650 m/z.

Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry raw files were processed using DIA-NN77 (v.1.8) with FASTA digest for library-free search and deep learning-based spectra, retention time and ion mobility prediction enabled. Precursor false discovery rate was set to 1%, and default parameters were used with the following changes: the precursor range was restricted to 300–1,650 m/z and the fragment ion range to 200–1,650 m/z. The ‘--relaxed-prot-inf' option was enabled through the command line. Match between runs was enabled, and the neural network classifier was set to ‘double-pass mode' and the quantification strategy to ‘robust liquid chromatography (high accuracy)'. Spectra were matched against the UniProt FASTA database for mouse (December 2022 release).

Exported peptide data were filtered for a false discovery rate of less than 0.01 (‘Lib.Q.Value' and ‘Lib.PG.Q.Value') and proteotypic peptides before applying a sample-wise median normalization on log10 normalized precursor quantities and recovering the original value range. Protein intensities were normalized using the MaxLFQ78 algorithm using an in-house script, with a minimum of more than one peptide. Bioinformatics analyses were performed using Perseus79 (v.1.6.15.0) and R (v.4.1.2). Before performing statistical analysis, quantified proteins were filtered for at least three valid values in at least one group of replicates.

Primary microglia (250,000) were lysed in TRIzol (Life Technologies) for 5 min, followed by phase separation with chloroform. After extraction, RNA was precipitated for 30 min at −20 °C in isopropanol with 0.15 M sodium acetate and GlycoBlue (Life Technologies). The pellet was then washed three times with 70% ethanol, air-dried and suspended in nuclease-free water. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression of the cDNA was assayed by qPCR using recommended TaqMan gene expression assays (Life Technologies) and following the manufacturer's recommendations (Cd28, Ifnb, Mx1, Ifitm3, Gapdh and Actb). Cycle counts for mRNA quantification were normalized to Gapdh or Actb. Relative expression (ΔCT) and quantification (RQ = 2−ΔΔCT) for each gene were calculated.

RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN; 74136) following the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the libraries was assessed by a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent). Multiplexed libraries were directly loaded on NovaSeq X Plus (Illumina) with paired-end sequencing. Raw sequencing data were processed using Illumina bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v.2.17.

Raw sequencing reads were first quality checked and trimmed using Trim Galore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ v.0.6.4, a wrapper program implementing Cutadapt v.2.9 (https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200) and FastQC v.0.11.9 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and mapped to the human genome (hg38) using the HISAT2 package (v.2.2.0) (ref. 80). Reads were counted using featureCounts (v.2.0.0) (ref. 81) against the Ensembl 99 annotation. The raw counts were processed through a VST procedure using the DESeq2 package82 to obtain transformed values that were more suitable than the raw read counts for certain data mining tasks. A pairwise comparison was performed on the count data of entire gene transcripts using the DESeq2 package (v.1.36.0) (ref. 82). Heat maps were made using R (v.3.1.1; https://www.R-project.org), in which the expression of each gene in VST was normalized to the mean across all samples (z-scored).

ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the Omni-ATAC protocol83,84,85. In brief, nuclei were isolated from 50,000 isolated YFP+ ex vivo microglia or THY1.2+ T cells. Transposition was performed using Tn5 transposase (Illumina) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by DNA purification using the ZYMO DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit. Libraries were pre-amplified for five cycles using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix. Further amplification cycles were determined through qPCR. Double-sided size selection was performed using AMPure XP beads. Libraries were quantified through Qubit and analysed using Bioanalyzer or TapeStation. Final libraries were pooled equimolarly and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (2 × 150 bp), targeting approximately 40 million reads per sample.

A total of 11 ATAC-seq libraries from PU.1-low microglia (n = 3), PU.1-high microglia (n = 3), wild-type microglia (n = 3) and wild-type T cells (n = 2) were processed using the same pipeline for compatibility. Read quality was assessed using FastQC (v.0.11.8)86. Reads were trimmed for adaptor sequences using Trim Galore (v.0.6.6)87 and aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38; GENCODE M25) using Bowtie 2 (v.2.2.8) with a maximum fragment length of 2,000 bp (−X 2000) with default sensitivity settings88. Reads aligned to mitochondrial DNA and non-canonical chromosomes were removed. Picard (v.2.2.4) was used to remove duplicated reads. Post-filtering Binary Alignment Map files for all samples were merged using the merge function from Samtools (v.1.11), followed by peak calling using MACS2 (v.2.1.0) with parameters --nomodel, --nolambda, --keep-dup all and --slocal 10000, optimized for paired data (−f BAMPE) using the mouse genome (−g mm)89. Blacklisted regions were removed before downstream analysis. Peak summits were extended ±200 bp, and quantification of reads in peaks was performed using featureCounts from Subread (v.2.0.1). Peaks that fell below the top 67% of peaks across all samples were filtered out as low-signal regions. Coverage tracks were generated from Binary Alignment Map files using deepTools (v.3.2.1) bamCoverage with parameters –normalizeUsingRPKM –binsize 10 (ref. 90).

Differential accessibility in the analysis was performed using the DESeq2 (v.1.34.0) R package82. A peak was considered differentially accessible if the Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05, and the absolute log2 fold change was greater/lower than 1.

Heat maps of the union of all differentially accessible regions across multiple comparisons were generated using heatmaply (v.1.2.1), displaying DESeq2 VST-normalized ATAC read counts. Read counts were z-scored by row, and hierarchical clustering was applied to rows only. Heat maps and profile plots of peak signals were generated using deepTools (v.3.2.1) in reference-point mode to visualize peak signals across differentially accessible regions using RPKM-normalized bigWig files as input90.

For peak-to-gene associations, annotated peaks were obtained using ChIPseeker (v.1.30.3). Peaks were first converted into a GRanges object using the makeGRangesFromDataFrame() function from GenomicRanges (v.1.46.1), retaining all relevant metadata (keep.extra.columns=TRUE). Peak annotation was performed with the annotatePeak() function using a TxDb object derived from the mouse reference genome (GRCm38; GENCODE M25). Peaks were mapped to gene features at the ‘gene' annotation level, with the transcription start site region defined as ±1,000 bp.

Principal component analysis (PCA) variance-stabilized counts were generated using DESeq2 (v.1.34.0) and used as input for PCA. For each analysis, the top 5,000 most variable peaks were selected on the basis of row variance using matrixStats (v.0.62.0.9003). PCA was performed using prcomp in R (v.4.1.0). For visualization of microglia-only samples, PCA plots were generated using Plotly (v.4.9.4.1). To visualize both microglia and T cells in a combined PCA space, the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were plotted using ggplot2 (v.3.3.5) with fixed axis scaling to preserve relative distances.

Transcription factor motif enrichment was done using HOMER (v.4.10). The findMotifsGenome.pl tool was applied to significant peaks within 200 bp around the peak summit using the parameter −size 200. Motifs were considered on the basis of P value (P < 1 × 10−12). HOMER de novo motifs are shown.

The TRAP approach91,92 relies on the genetic labelling of the ribosomal protein L10a with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) using Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice60. Crossing these mice to microglia-specific Cre mice allows for the isolation of ribosome-associated mRNAs in a cell-type-specific fashion using eGFP-based immunoaffinity purification28,91,93. Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ control (three females and three males), Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ (three females and three males on control diet or two females and two males on PLX5622 CSF1Ri diet), Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);Spi1fl/+;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ PU.1-low mice (four females and two males), Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);R26FLAG-Spi1/+;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ PU.1-high mice (three females and one male), Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD;Spi1fl/+;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ 5xFAD–PU.1-low (one female and three males) and Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD;R26FLAG-Spi1/+;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ 5xFAD–PU.1-high mice (one female and two males) were euthanized with CO2, and brain ROI were dissected. Ribosome-associated mRNA from microglia was isolated from each region, as previously described92, in which each sample corresponds to a single mouse. Briefly, the brain tissue was thawed in an ice-cold Wheaton 33 low extractable borosilicate glass homogenizer containing 1-ml cell lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μg ml−1 of cycloheximide and 10 μl ml−1 of RNasin (Promega) and SUPERase·In (Invitrogen). The samples were first manually homogenized using a polytetrafluoroethylene homogenizer (grinding chamber clearance of 0.1–0.15 mm) with three to five gentle strokes, followed by homogenization in a motor-driven overhead stirrer at 900 rpm with 12 complete strokes. The samples were then transferred to chilled Eppendorf tubes. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. NP-40 (final concentration of 1%) and DHPC (final concentration of 30 mM) were added to the supernatant. A post-mitochondrial supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (200 μl; Invitrogen), conjugated to 1 μg μl−1 of biotinylated Protein L (Pierce) and 50 μg each of anti-eGFP antibodies Htz–GFP–19F7 and Htz–GFP–19C8 (bioreactor supernatant from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Monoclonal Antibody Facility) was added to each supernatant. The unbound fraction was collected using a magnetic stand after overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end rotation. The polysome-bound beads were washed with a high-salt buffer (20 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.3), 350 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT and 100 μg ml−1 of cycloheximide).

RNA clean-up from isolated microglial cells (50,000), TRAP samples and 5% of the unbound fractions from TRAP samples was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was assayed using an RNA Pico chip on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent), and only samples with RNA integrity number greater than 9 were considered for subsequent analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was generated from 1–5 ng of RNA using the Ovation V2 kit (NuGEN) following the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries for sequencing were prepared using the Nextera XT Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the libraries was assessed by a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent). Multiplexed libraries were directly loaded on NovaSeq (Illumina) with single-read sequencing for 75 cycles. Raw sequencing data were processed using Illumina bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v.2.17.

Raw sequencing reads were first quality checked and trimmed using Trim Galore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ v.0.6.4, a wrapper program implementing Cutadapt v.2.9 https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200 and FastQC v.0.11.9 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and then mapped to a mouse genome (mm10) using the HISAT2 package (v.2.2.0)80. Reads were counted using featureCounts (v.2.0.0)81 against the Ensembl 99 annotation. The raw counts were processed through a VST procedure using the DESeq2 package82 to obtain transformed values that were more suitable than the raw read counts for certain data mining tasks. PCA was performed on the top 500 most variable genes across all samples on the basis of the VST data to assess for visual outliers. All pairwise comparisons were performed on the count data of entire gene transcripts using the DESeq2 package (v.1.36.0)82.

For comparisons of baseline samples with 5xFAD samples, a cutoff of the adjusted P value < 0.1 and mean expression greater than 10 (DESeq2) was applied. For comparisons involving drug treatments, genetic manipulations and ageing, a cutoff of uncorrected P value < 0.05 and mean expression greater than 10 was applied (DESeq2). Additionally, TRAP-enriched genes were calculated using a cutoff of P value < 0.05 and fold change greater than 2 over their respective unbound fraction. All heat maps and scatter plots for bulk sequencing were made using R (v.3.1.1; https://www.R-project.org). For all heat maps, the expression of each gene in VST was normalized to the mean across all samples (z-scored).

Gene Ontology term enrichment, cell type enrichment and kinase co-expression ARCHS4 (ref. 94) analyses were performed using Enrichr95,96,97. Pathway and upstream regulator analyses were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (v.01-22-01; QIAGEN). Selected and significantly enriched (P value < 0.05 with Benjamini–Hochberg correction) Gene Ontology terms for biological processes are represented in balloon graphs and were made using R (v.3.1.1; https://www.R-project.org). Pie charts for functional characterization of genes were built manually on the basis of Gene Ontology term enrichment analyses and a literature search. Gene expression data were further analysed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA 4.2.3 software; number of permutations = 1,000) using the DAM gene set from Keren-Shaul et al.12 (Supplementary Table 3).

Microglial nuclei were isolated from microglia-specific TRAP mice bred to Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice60 on the basis of the eGFP–L10a fluorescence of newly formed ribosomes in the microglia nucleoli, as described28. In brief, 6-month-old Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ mice (one female on control diet or two males on PLX5622 diet) or Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ 5xFAD (female), Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD;Spi1fl/+;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ 5xFAD–PU.1-low mice (male) and Cx3cr1CreErt2/+(Litt);5xFAD; R26FLAG-Spi1/+;Eef1a1LSL.eGFPL10a/+ 5xFAD–PU.1-high mice (male) were euthanized with CO2. Brain regions were quickly dissected and frozen immediately. The frozen cortex tissue was homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM tricine (pH 7.8), supplemented with protease and RNase inhibitors with a glass Dounce homogenizer (1984-10002; Kimble Chase). The buffers were supplemented with 10 μl ml−1 of RNasin, SUPERase·In and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (11836170001; Roche). The homogenate was then spun through a 29% iodixanol cushion. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM tricine (pH 7.8), supplemented with 10 μM DyeCycle Ruby (V10304; Invitrogen) and 10% donkey serum (017-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Microglial nuclei were sorted in a BD FACSAria Cell Sorter by gating for the lowest DyeCycle Ruby, which indicates nuclei singlets and a high GFP signal. For single-nucleus RNA-seq, isolated nuclei were used immediately. More than 10,000 nuclei were used for 10× sequencing.

We used the Chromium platform (10x Genomics) with the 3′ gene expression v.2 kit with a targeted input of 5,000 nuclei or cells per sample on average. In brief, gel bead in emulsions (GEMs) were generated on the sample chip in the Chromium controller. Barcoded cDNA was extracted from GEMs using Post GEM-RT Cleanup and amplified for 12 cycles. The amplified cDNA was fragmented and subjected to end-repair, poly-A-tailing, adaptor ligation and 10x-specific sample indexing following the manufacturer's protocol. Libraries were quantified using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) analyses and then sequenced in paired-end mode on a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina) targeting a depth of 50,000–100,000 reads per nucleus per cell.

The raw read data were demultiplexed, aligned and analysed using 10x Cell Ranger (v.2.1.0). To capture the unspliced pre-mRNA in the single-nucleus RNA expression assay, intronic regions in the 10x Cell Ranger mm10 v.1.2.0 reference were marked as exonic, as suggested by 10x for pre-mRNA reference generation. Data from two experiments were used to generate Seurat objects in R. Quality control cutoffs (nFeature of more than 1,500; pct.mt of less than 5) were used to generate final datasets. The following clustering pipeline steps were applied: NormalizeData(), FindVariableFeatures(), ScaleData(), RunPCA(), FindNeighbors() and FindClusters(). Clusters that do not express Hexb (highly expressed pan-microglia gene marker) were excluded. Cluster quality was confirmed by VlnPlot() for nFeature, nCount and pct.mt (percentage of mitochondrial DNA). Three datasets were generated from single-cell RNA-seq: control versus 5xFAD (8-month-old mice; Figs. 1a and 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1), time course of control and 5xFAD (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10c) and control, 5xFAD versus 5xFAD;Cd28-KO (Fig. 5d,e, Extended Data Fig. 11e and Supplementary Fig. 8).

For single-cell sequencing (Figs. 1a, 2a and 5a,d,e, Extended Data Figs. 3a, 10c,d and 11e and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 8), cell counts were as follows: 3-month-old control (5,240 cells), 3-month-old 5xFAD (4,172 cells in replicate 1 and 2,966 cells in replicate 2), 3-month-old 5xFAD;Cd28-KO (2,466 cells in replicate 1 and 2,812 cells in replicate 2), 6-month-old control (6,249 cells), 6-month-old 5xFAD (4,351 cells), 6-month-old 5xFAD;CD28-KO (4,361 cells), 8-month-old control (351 cells in replicate 1 and 6,635 cells in replicate 2) and 8-month-old 5xFAD (785 cells in replicate 1 and 7,539 cells in replicate 2). The following clustering pipeline steps were applied: FindIntegrationAnchors() with dims = 1:20, IntegrateData() with dims = 1:2, ScaleData(), FindVariableFeatures() with selection.method = ‘vst', nFeature = 3,000, RunPCA() with npcs = 30, RunUMAP() with reduction = ‘pca' and dims = 1:20, FindNeighbors() with reduction = ‘pca' and dims = 1:20 and FindClusters() with resolution = 0.6. Cluster marker genes were identified using FindAllMarkers() with logfc.threshold = 0.25 and min.pct = 0.0. Sub-clustering of DAM microglia in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 was performed after unbiased cell clustering and manual annotation of cluster identification on the basis of genes (Cst7, Apoe, Lpl and Itgax) driving the clustering. For the sub-clustering of DAM microglia, the DAM cluster was isolated and reclustered into three sub-clusters following the clustering pipeline steps: ScaleData(), FindVariableFeatures() with selection.method = ‘vst', nFeature = 3,000, RunPCA() with npcs = 30, RunUMAP() with reduction = ‘pca' and dims = 1:20, FindNeighbors() with reduction = ‘pca' and dims = 1:20 and FindClusters() with resolution = 0.4. Further differential analysis was performed using the Seurat package in R. Differential expression between the Spi1low and Spi1high (PU.1low and PU.1high) clusters was performed using FindMarkers(), with a log2fc cutoff of 0.25, with min.pct = 0.01. Differential expression between the homeostatic and DAM clusters was performed using the ‘FindMarkers' function, with a log2fc cutoff of 0.25 and min.pct = 0.01. For pseudobulk analysis comparing genotypes in Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 11e, Seurat identities were set to ‘genotype' using the feature Idents(). Pseudobulk analysis was performed with the FindMarkers() function with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in Seurat with the following parameters: min.pct = 0.01 and logfc.threshold = 0.25.

For single-nucleus sequencing (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2), data were obtained from 6-month-old 5xFAD mice fed with control diet (7,286 nuclei) and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice fed with CSF1Ri diet (3,995 nuclei). The following clustering pipeline steps were applied: Merge(), ScaleData(), FindVariableFeatures with nFeature = 3,000, RunPCA() with npcs = 30, RunUMAP() with dims = 1:20, FindNeighbors with dims = 1:20 and FindClusters() with resolution = 0.6. Cluster marker genes were identified using FindAllMarkers() with logfc.threshold = 0.25 and min.pct = 0.0. Sub-clustering of DAM microglia (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2) was performed in the same fashion as single-cell sequencing. In brief, the DAM cluster was isolated and reclustered into three sub-clusters by applying the following clustering pipeline steps: ScaleData(), FindVariableFeatures() with selection.method = ‘vst', nFeature = 3,000, RunPCA() with npcs = 30, RunUMAP() with reduction = ‘pca' and dims = 1:20, FindNeighbors() with reduction = ‘pca' and dims = 1:20 and FindClusters() with resolution = 0.3. Differential expression between all microglia from the control and CSF1Ri-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e) was performed using pseudobulk analysis. Seurat identities were set to ‘genotype' using the feature Idents(). Pseudobulk analysis was performed with the FindMarkers() function with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in Seurat with the following parameters: min.pct = 0.0 and logfc.threshold = 0.25.

For single-nucleus sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 7), cell counts were as follows: 6-month-old 5xFAD (4,541 cells), 6-month-old 5xFAD;PU.1-low (4,866 cells) and 6-month-old 5xFAD;PU.1-high (6,190 cells). The following clustering pipeline steps were applied: FindIntegrationAnchors() with dims = 1:40, IntegrateData() with dims = 1:2, ScaleData(), FindVariableFeatures() with nFeature = 1,000, RunPCA(), RunUMAP() with dims = 1:20, FindNeighbors() with dims = 1:20 and FindClusters() with resolution = 0.5. Cluster marker genes were identified using FindAllMarkers() with logfc.threshold = 0.2 and min.pct = 0.05.

To perform differential expression analysis of PU.1low and PU.1high microglia in independent experiments, the filtered UMI count matrices from two independent experiments, each containing one control and one 5xFAD sample, were loaded into R (v.4.3.2)98 using SingleCellExperiment99 package (v.1.24.0) and Seurat (v.5.0.1)100. Low-quality cells and presumed doublets were removed using the R package Scatter101 (v.1.30.1). Non-microglia cells were identified by Seurat clustering after SCTransform102,103 on the basis of the expression of known microglia signature genes Hexb and Fcer1g. For each of the 5xFAD samples, one PU.1high cluster and one PU.1low cluster of cells were identified by Seurat clustering on the basis of known marker genes (PU.1high: Spi1, Il7r, Csf1r, Cd33, Tlr4, Il1a and C3ar1; PU.1low: Cst7, Cd274, Igf1, Apoe, Spp1, Csf1, and Pdcd1). The differential expression analyses between PU.1high and PU.1low clusters were conducted with the function ‘findMarkers()' of the Seurat package with default parameters, except min.pct = 0.01, on ‘data' layer of ‘RNA' assay after ‘NormalizeData()' transformation. The log2 fold changes of overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared between the 5xFAD samples in experiments 1 and 2 in a scatter plot highlighting key genes related to lymphoid or myeloid lineage or inflammation.

In single-cell sequencing of 5xFAD;CD28-KO, we observed a paradoxical increase in Cd28 mRNA expression. This increased expression is seen randomly across all microglial clusters and is likely to reflect mRNA expression downstream of the deleted exons 2 and 3 in the CD28-KO. The ablation of Cd28 RNA and CD28 protein in these mice was confirmed using in situ hybridization (Extended Data Fig. 11f) and immunofluorescence protein staining (Fig. 5b).

Similarly, we did not detect significant differences in Spi1 level in single-nucleus sequencing data. Instead, upon removing one allele of the Spi1 gene, the non-microglia-expressed, co-regulated and adjacent Mybpc3 gene24 was upregulated, which serves as a positive indicator of Spi1 downregulation. Changes in PU.1 protein levels in PU.1-low and PU.1-high mice have been validated by western blotting (Extended Data Fig. 4b) and immunostaining (Fig. 3a).

For all experiments, plots were generated using the DimPlot(), FeaturePlot(), VlnPlot() and DotPlot() functions. Lymphoid (Cd28, Cd274, Pdcd1, Ctla2a, Cd5, Sox5, Cd48, Cd52 and Cd72) and interferon (Ifitm3, Ifit3, Isg15, Ifit2, Ifi27l2a, Ifi204, Irf7, Usp18, Stat2, Ifitm2, Rsad2, Isg15, Ifit1, Bst2, Isg20 and Xaf1) scores were calculated using the AddModuleScore() function. Volcano plots were made using R.

For the analysis of human microglia scRNA-seq15 (shown in Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 5), data were obtained from Synapse syn21438358. The gene count matrix and corresponding cell barcodes for human ex vivo microglia were processed using a similar approach, as described by the authors. Briefly, UMI counts and cell annotations were imported into Seurat v.5.0.1 for downstream analysis. Cells annotated as non-microglial by Olah et al.15 (such as monocytes, T cells, B cells, red blood cells and GFAP-positive cells) were excluded to focus on microglial cell populations. Data normalization and scaling were performed using the Seurat default parameters and included regression of UMI counts to account for technical noise. Subsequently, variable features were identified, and clustering was performed using the default Seurat settings, with a final resolution of 0.6 to determine cluster identities. Clusters were visualized using UMAP. Gene set module scores were computed per cell using the AddModuleScore function in Seurat to assess the relative expression of predefined gene sets, DAM, homeostatic and lymphoid genes (Supplementary Fig. 5). Clusters were categorized into two main groups (homeostatic and DAM) on the basis of the average ratio of DAM to homeostatic module scores. The DAM group was further subdivided on the basis of the expression of lymphoid marker genes. DAM clusters were categorized as either lymphoid-positive or lymphoid-negative, depending on the levels of lymphoid-related gene expression. Finally, gene expression patterns and functional module scores across clusters were visualized using dot plots and UMAP projections to identify and compare gene signatures associated with different microglial clusters. New clusters were annotated on the basis of marker gene expression profiles and compared to the original Olah et al.15 cluster annotations. A Sankey plot was generated to visualize the redistribution of cells from original clusters to new clusters using the scmap R package. A confusion matrix was constructed to quantify the percentage overlap between the two clustering schemes. For each original cluster, the percentage of its cells found in each new cluster was calculated and plotted using a heat map, with a blue colour gradient indicating increasing overlap.

The analysis of human microglia scRNA-seq data17 (shown in Fig. 5f,g) is, on the whole, based on data obtained from the AD Knowledge Portal (https://adknowledgeportal.org)104. Single-nucleus RNA-seq counts and cell-level metadata were downloaded from Synapse syn31512863 (ref. 17). All downstream processing and statistical tests were performed using R statistical software v.4.3.1 (ref. 98). To generate pan-microglial pseudobulks, the authors' cell annotations were used to filter microglia. Because most of the samples from the same donor were sequenced in two replicate batches, we further subsetted the data to include only those donors and batches and generated pseudobulks by summing read counts for all cells for each donor. Samples with at least ten cells were retained for further analysis (n = 428). Similarly, to generate cluster-specific pseudobulks, the same subset of donors and batches was included. Counts were summed for all cells in a cluster for each donor, and we retained samples with at least ten cells per cluster (n = 1,963). For visualization, counts were CPM normalized with edgeR105 and batch corrected with the regressBatches function from the batchelor package106. Heat maps were generated with the pheatmap package107.

SPI1–AD risk variant differential expression and DAM abundance analysis were done after donor genotypes were downloaded from the AD Knowledge Portal104. Pseudobulks were annotated by matching on the ‘projid' included in the cell metadata and searching for rs1057233 genotype information108. On inspection of the data, we noted that rs1057233 and SPI1 expression showed a dominant inheritance pattern, in which donors with two copies of the risk-associated A allele showed slightly increased SPI1 expression compared with heterozygous carriers and non-carriers. We, therefore, labelled homozygotes as ‘risk' and others as ‘non-carriers'.

Differential expression and DAM abundance analyses were performed on samples with diagnoses (cogdx) of either not cognitively impaired or AD and for which SPI1 variant status was known (n = 302 for differential expression and n = 306 for DAM abundance). For differential expression on the basis of carrier status, limma-voom109 was run on donor-level pseudobulks with batch as a blocking factor and AD status as a grouping variable. For the DAM abundance analysis, the proportion of microglia in the Mic 13 cluster was calculated for each donor, and a two-way ANOVA was performed to analyse the effect of cognitive diagnosis for AD and SPI1 carrier status on the proportion of DAM microglia. This was followed by Tukey's post hoc test, with P < 0.05 considered significant.

For the bioinformatics analysis of Kimura et al.49, mouse microglia single-nucleus sequencing data were obtained on GEO with accession number GSE267764 and converted to Seurat objects. Quality control cutoffs (nFeature greater than 1,500; pct.mt less than 5) were used to generate final datasets. The following clustering pipeline steps were then applied: NormalizeData(), FindVariableFeatures(), ScaleData(), RunPCA(), FindNeighbors() and FindClusters(). Clusters that do not express Hexb (highly expressed pan-microglia gene marker) were excluded. Cluster quality was confirmed by VlnPlot() for nFeature, nCount and pct.mt (percentage of mitochondrial DNA). Data were then integrated using the following clustering pipeline steps: FindIntegrationAnchors() with dims = 1:20, IntegrateData() with dims = 1:2, ScaleData(), FindVariableFeatures() with selection.method = ‘vst', nFeature = 3,000, RunPCA() with npcs = 30, RunUMAP() with reduction = ‘pca', dims = 1:20, FindNeighbors() with reduction = ‘pca', dims = 1:20 and FindClusters() with resolution = 0.6. Nineteen clusters were generated; cluster-identifying markers were generated using the FindMarkers() with logfc.threshold = 0.25 and min.pct = 0.

Sex-matched control, 5xFAD and 5xFAD;PU.1-low mice (9–10 months old) were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and subsequently decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and chilled in cutting artificial CSF (ACSF) containing choline chloride (93 mM), HCl (93 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.2 mM), NaHCO3 (30 mM), HEPES (20 mM), glucose (25 mM), sodium ascorbate (5 mM), thiourea (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM) and CaCl2 (0.5 mM; pH 7.4). The brains were embedded in 2% agarose, and coronal slices (400 µm thick) were made using a Compresstome (Precisionary Instruments). Brain slices were then allowed to recover at 32 ± 1 °C in cutting solution for 5 min and after that at room temperature in holding ACSF containing NaCl (92 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.2 mM), NaHCO3 (30 mM), HEPES (20 mM), glucose (25 mM), sodium ascorbate (5 mM), thiourea (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), MgSO4 and CaCl2 (2 mM; pH 7.4). After at least 2 h of recovery, the slices were transferred to a submersion recording chamber and continuously perfused (2–4 ml min−1) with ACSF containing NaCl (124 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.2 mM), NaHCO3 (24 mM), HEPES (5 mM), glucose (12.5 mM), MgSO4 (2 mM) and CaCl2 (2 mM; pH 7.4). Slices were allowed to recover for another hour in the recording chamber before recording the baseline. All the solutions were continuously bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2, and recordings were obtained at 25 ± 1 °C.

A bipolar stimulating electrode was positioned in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were evoked by square-wave 50-µs pulses delivered every 30 s by MultiClamp 7b (Molecular Devices), and current was set to 50% of the maximum field excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude using ISO-Flex (ampi). A recording electrode, filled with ACSF (2–4 MΩ), was placed in the stratum radiatum a few millimetres away from the stimulating electrode. LTP was induced using a theta-burst protocol: four trains, separated by 10 s, each comprised five bursts of four stimuli delivered at 100 Hz, with 200 ms between the bursts. Data were acquired using a MultiClamp 7B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz and analysed using pCLAMP 11 software (Molecular Devices). LTP was quantified as a percentage change in excitatory postsynaptic potential slope from baseline (the last 10 min of a 30-min baseline period).

Behavioural analyses used sex-matched control, 5xFAD and 5xFAD;PU.1-low mice (9–10 months old). All behavioural analyses were performed within the 0700–1900 hours light cycle. All experiments were conducted in a blinded manner, and genotypes were decoded only after data processing and analysis. The mice were habituated to the testing room for at least 1 h before the experiment. All procedures followed the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software; v.9.0) was used for statistical data analysis.

Locomotion and exploratory behaviour were measured using the open-field assay, as previously described28. Open-field activity was quantified using Fusion software (Omnitech Electronics). The mice were recorded for 60 min, and chambers were thoroughly cleaned with ethanol between rounds. Anxiety was assessed by measuring the total time spent in the centre of the open-field box for the first 10 min of the 60-min recording.

Mice were habituated to a three-room novel object box for 20 min without objects. During the training trial, the mice were placed in the box containing two identical objects and allowed to explore for 10 min. They were then returned to their home cage for a 1-h inter-test interval. During the testing trial, the mice were placed in the box containing one familiar object from the training phase and one novel object. Between each round, the box was thoroughly cleaned with ethanol. Videos of each session were measured using EthoVision video-tracking software (Noldus Information Technology). Blinded manual scoring was performed for the time spent sniffing the familiar and novel objects. Recognition score was calculated as the percentage of time spent sniffing the novel object relative to the total time spent sniffing either object.

Control, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;PU1-low and 5xFAD;PU.1-high mice were monitored for survival and evaluated for health status at least once per week starting at tamoxifen induction (4–6 weeks of age) and continuing until death. Mice that were used for the experiments or died from environmental factors (such as cage flooding) were censored and excluded from death rate calculations. Both male and female mice were included in the study. No sex-specific differences in survival outcomes were observed; therefore, data from both sexes were pooled for analysis. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and statistical differences between groups were assessed using log-rank (Mantel–Cox) tests.

Statistics were analysed using GraphPad Prism v.5.01, with significance determined as P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were two-tailed. Normal distribution was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Grubbs's test was used to identify outliers. Variance was determined using the F-test. An unpaired t-test was used for normally distributed datasets with two independent samples. For normally distributed datasets with two dependent samples (for example, plaque-associated and distal microglia from the same mice), we used a paired t-test. For normally distributed datasets with more than two samples, we used one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. Normally distributed data with unequal variance were analysed using Welch's correction. Non-normally distributed data involving two samples were analysed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test. Non-normally distributed data involving more than two samples were analysed using a two-tailed Kruskal–Wallis test. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes were similar to those generally used in the field.

We did not include a justification of the sample size for this study. We used the minimum number of animals needed to reliably detect the expected effect size with an alpha rate of 0.05 in a standardly powered experiment and on the basis of extensive laboratory experience and literature in the field. There were further practical constraints related to the availability of samples and appropriate controls in the in vitro experiments, such as primary cell yield from animals and limitations in treatment or read-out methods, such as siRNA treatment or mass spectrometry. For human studies, the limiting factor was high-quality sample availability. These considerations collectively informed our sample size, which we deemed sufficient to observe biologically meaningful trends within the context of the aims of the study. Sample sizes are sufficient to detect significant changes on the basis of previous studies that used similar methodologies and experimental designs in the field. Data were formally excluded only if identified as a statistically significant outlier by Grubbs's outlier test. Any outliers identified by Grubbs's test were removed from the dataset, and the test was iterated until no outliers were detected. All replication attempts were successful. Each experiment was reproduced with similar results. Reproducibility is either indicated in the figure legends or shown as a quantification. For all experiments involving treatment with CSF1R or PLCi, animals or tissue culture wells were randomly assigned to groups. In other experiments, the mice were allocated into groups on the basis of either genotype or age. We did not compare human populations (control versus AD) but rather only within individuals with AD. The experimenters were blinded during the imaging and behavioural experiments. Gene expression and western blot analyses were not conducted under blinded conditions because they rely on quantitative read-outs, which lack subjectivity and are not influenced by knowledge of the experimental condition. Samples were processed either under blinded conditions or in batches.

On an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down as it expands the use cases for visual AI.

The image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers' first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant. 

However, investors wanted to know what Pinterest's opportunity in agentic commerce — AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users — was given the rapidly changing AI landscape, and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential.

That question has become more pressing. During the company's third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a weaker holiday shopping season than expected, citing President Donald Trump's tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. As a result, Pinterest's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.34 billion, on average. The news sent the stock tumbling by more than 21% on Wednesday.

Despite the near-term revenue concerns, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. In addition to its own proprietary models that are already accounted for in its cost structure, Ready said the company tests leading off-the-shelf models against open-source options on a regular basis, and found the open-source models promising.

“One of the really, really interesting things that we're seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,” Ready told investors. “Given current market rates and per token costs, in early testing, we're seeing orders of magnitude reduction in cost with comparable performance using fine-tuned open source models versus leading off-the-shelf proprietary models.” 

He said the company planned to move forward with many open-source models for its various use cases, which would come at “a fraction of the cost” of the larger model providers.

“We feel really good about the value that we're bringing to the user there, our ability to align that with monetization, and our ability to control those costs and deliver that effectively,” said Ready.

The exec also touched on other areas where Pinterest is considering how to best use AI, including agentic shopping. Ready said that Pinterest already offers “push-button type buying” via its Amazon partnership, and it will wait to see if users actually want the AI to “push the button for them.”

In the meantime, Ready suggested that Pinterest's biggest differentiator is that it guides the user through the shopping experience — something it hopes to improve with Pinterest Assistant, an AI companion users can talk to, asking for advice and recommendations. The assistant understands the user based on their boards, collages, saves, and how they compare to people with similar tastes, the company says.

Pinterest is also rolling out personalized boards curated with AI, which Ready said combine expert human curation and AI.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: The popular video game Overcooked is eying a move to television as a competition reality series. A24 has acquired the rights to the cooking simulation game and has teamed up with Netflix to develop an unscripted series adaptation, Deadline has learned. 


	Said to be in the vein of such established Netflix reality shows with family appeal as Nailed It! and Floor Is Lava, Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans.


	Executive producing the TV version, believed to be in early stages of development, are Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine, and Phil Duncan from Overcooked game developer Ghost Town Games and A24, in the independent film and TV studio's first foray into reality competition series.

	In the Overcooked game, 1-4 players work together as chefs to prepare, cook and serve meals against the clock in kitchens filled with various obstacles and hazards. Players must focus on teamwork, communication and coordination to successfully complete orders before customers get angry and storm out.


	Developed by Ghost Town Games, Overcooked was released in 2016 by publisher Team17 on PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, with a Nintendo Switch version following in 2017. 


	It won twice at the 2017 BAFTA Games Awards, for best British game and family game. A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018.

Apparently, size does matter.

Influencer Haley Kalil — known as Haley Baylee on social media — claimed her ex-husband Matt Kalil's penis size was “the biggest factor” in their 2022 divorce.

“We were trying to do the damn thing and [putting in work in their marriage],” she said during a recent appearance on Twitch with popular streamer Marlon.

“Deadass … for our whole marriage, deadass. But I was going to try it all. We tried it all: therapist, doctors. Not even lying … Looked up lipo-type s–t … That's why it's kinda funny. It's like my life is a comedy, and it kinda writes itself,” Hayley added.

“That was the biggest factor.”

The model, 33, then said that, though she has “love” for her “homie,” the former Minnesota Vikings player's penis size is “like .01 percent of the population.”

“We've tried, impossible unless you're going to be in tears,” she added.

Page Six has reached out to Matt for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

The former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model and Matt, 36, first began dating after he was drafted by the Vikings in 2012.

Three years later, they tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in Hawaii.

In May 2022, Haley filed for divorce from the ex-athlete, citing irreconcilable differences.

After news of their split surfaced, Hayley took to her Instagram Stories to share a positive affirmation.

“You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life,” she shared in white text over a black background.

The pair reportedly separated earlier that year and did not share any children.

In April 2024, Matt, who is now retired from the NFL, married model Keilani Asmus. The two welcomed a son later that year.
