                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The popular video game Overcooked is eying a move to television as a competition reality series. Said to be in the vein of such established Netflix reality shows with family appeal as Nailed It! and Floor Is Lava, Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans. Executive producing the TV version, believed to be in early stages of development, are Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine, and Phil Duncan from Overcooked game developer Ghost Town Games and A24, in the independent film and TV studio's first foray into reality competition series. Danai Gurira, Sean Harris, Moises Arias & Justin Kirk Join Netflix's 'Here Comes The Flood' Opposite Denzel Washington In the Overcooked game, 1-4 players work together as chefs to prepare, cook and serve meals against the clock in kitchens filled with various obstacles and hazards. Players must focus on teamwork, communication and coordination to successfully complete orders before customers get angry and storm out. Developed by Ghost Town Games, Overcooked was released in 2016 by publisher Team17 on PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, with a Nintendo Switch version following in 2017.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YouTube's dispute with Disney is part of a larger pattern, writes Azoff, one that mirrors how it treats musicians and media companies alike. David Israelite's guest column on October 23, 2025 explained how little music creators get paid across different streaming services. I just want to lay out the facts and be clear: YouTube pays the least for music, full stop. They'll throw up smoke screens and tempt you to look the other way, but let's not be fooled. YouTube recently touted that it paid artists $8 billion over the past year. During the same period, Spotify generated roughly $18 billion in revenue and paid about $12 billion to music rights holders — nearly 67% of its revenue. YouTube will say they're not just a music service. But I would argue that YouTube never would have become such a successful platform without music, and even if only one-third of their revenue comes from music (and it's likely higher), they certainly should be paying more than Spotify, not 50% less. How does YouTube pay less than their competitors? It's the dominant video platform, with more hours streamed than Netflix. It's the largest music service, with more users than Spotify. This company now owns audience and content delivery in a way the world has never seen before. Their tyranny isn't just limited to music. The playbook is always the same: if you refuse to accept YouTube's below-market terms, YouTube threatens to go dark until you capitulate. If you're a YouTube TV subscriber, you received an email saying “if Disney's content is unavailable for an extended period of time,” YouTube will give you a paltry $20 credit. So, YouTube gets to unilaterally decide for consumers how long is too long and how much ESPN is worth to them? YouTube is showing us what happens when unchecked power and greed collide. Thankfully, Disney is standing up to YouTube, and we all need to support Disney because enough is enough. As artists, consumers, and companies, let's voice our support for Disney in this battle with YouTube. And in parallel, Washington needs to take a good hard look at YouTube's abuse of market power and explore whether it's time to break up Google so that YouTube, YouTube Music, and YouTube TV are separate businesses that finally have to compete on a level playing field. YouTube: without the artists, athletes, and actors, there is no business. The Azoff Company is a privately held media and entertainment company dedicated to investing in positively disruptive businesses that put artists and fans first. Azoff was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020. Send us a tip using our anonymous form. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. This week, however, IMDb is undergoing a big overhaul to its credits section to give 12 different below the line positions some more attention, as well as adding one entirely new credit category to recognize the global scope of the industry. IMDb and IMDbPro, beginning just after 11:59 p.m. PST on Sunday, November 9, will update its credits pages to display full name and title pages for 12 different professional credits. Related Stories ‘Atropia' Trailer: Alia Shawkat and Callum Turner Have a Romance in a Fake Middle East See Luis Buñuel's Once-Banned, Sacrilegious ‘Viridiana' Anew in 4K — Watch the Trailer It's not that these titles were absent from IMDb in the past, but you had to scroll way down to the “Additional Crew” category on a film or show's “All Cast & Crew” page in order to find their name. Now they'll be organized in the same way you would see with folks in the sound department or visual effects and dozens of other categories. And with these additions, IMDb now features 45 professional credit categories. IMDb now accepts credits for dubbing foreign-language versions of movies and TV shows, which is just much better for those professionals to showcase their global work. Credits are now accepted for dubbing into English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. To submit dubbing credits, IMDb provided instructions and a tutorial video here. Name pages will automatically generate specific entertainment professions based on what that individual specializes in based on their credits, but IMDbPro premium members can select their professions from a newly expanded list of 500 options. IMDb worked with a number of industry guilds to make this happen and hopes to add more in the future: the Choreographers Guild, Colorist Society, I.A.T.S.E. Local 871, National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA), Property Masters Guild, and SAG-AFTRA. “Our vision is to ensure every profession involved in making movies and TV shows receives equal recognition,” said Nikki Santoro, CEO of IMDb. “We're grateful to our IMDbPro customers and industry collaborators who helped shape these updates, and we look forward to continuing this important work together.” “When our members work on a production, it's important that they be credited in the right way — not just because it feels good to see our names connected to our titles, but because it's a professional resource that the community looks to, to be informed,” said Sean Astin, SAG-AFTRA President. “It's important that IMDbPro has made this commitment to recognizing the many professionals whose creativity and dedication make film and television possible. This is an important step toward creating an accurate and more inclusive reflection of the industry we all create, and we thank them for working to ensure that every contributor to a production is visible and valued in their own right.” IMDb in 2022 did a massive redesign of its name pages, which IndieWire reported at the time impacted 11 million celebrities, filmmakers, and crew professionals. That revamp dramatically changed the way you viewed and could discover info on an individual's page, as well as making it easier to view credits pertaining to podcasts and music videos. That privacy update followed in the footsteps of a 2019 move to remove birth names from an individual's page after outcry from the transgender community. Representatives for several of the aforementioned guilds weighed in on what this added recognition means below: Our members are united by their passion and commitment to the craft and will be thrilled that this new credit category recognizes the unique role we play in modern filmmaking, from the earliest stages of production through final delivery.” “This new category provides a straightforward way to find talent and give credit to members of the color pipeline in individual roles. “As a Production and Travel Coordinator, it's important that our crafts get the same recognition as our brethren,” said Molly Merrell, Production/Travel Coordinator and President of I.A.T.S.E. Local 161 supports this launch because Coordinators and Accountants spend countless weeks making sure productions run smoothly; assist other departments with their needs; make the impossible happen with little notice; and more. To have the Production Department and Production Finance and Accounting credit categories added to IMDb and IMDbPro means we are an equal member of the film crew who contribute just as much as anyone else.” Local 871 Vice President, Production Coordinator (9-1-1 season 3), and Second Assistant Accountant. We're on each project from the first hire through final wrap, and our work is part of the essential logistics that turn ideas into motion pictures. These new credit categories provide proper recognition for the people who make movies and TV possible.” We have to know everyone and everything that is happening. “Voice acting is a unique craft that has defined some of the most memorable moments in entertainment,” said Cissy Jones, BAFTA Award-winning Voice Actor and NAVA member. It celebrates the creative leadership our members bring to productions of every size and helps ensure their work is seen, valued, and connected across the global entertainment industry.” “Our work touches every frame of a production yet it is often invisible to audiences and even peers. The Property Department credit category on IMDb and IMDbPro gives us the opportunity to be properly credited for our creative contributions and help future generations of Property Masters connect their artistry to the projects that inspire them.” “SAG-AFTRA applauds IMDbPro for taking this meaningful step toward recognizing the breadth and diversity of creative work that powers our industry,” said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator. While these updates directly impact some of our members today, we know this is just the beginning. We look forward to future enhancements that will recognize additional roles — those that have long been grouped under ‘Additional Crew' — and ensure that every contributor to a production is visible and valued in their own right. This progress represents an important step toward a more accurate and inclusive reflection of the industry we all help create, and we are proud to continue collaborating with IMDbPro to elevate and celebrate the full spectrum of talent that brings stories to life.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Influencer Haley Kalil — known as Haley Baylee on social media — claimed her ex-husband Matt Kalil's penis size was “the biggest factor” in their 2022 divorce. “We were trying to do the damn thing and [putting in work in their marriage],” she said during a recent appearance on Twitch with popular streamer Marlon.

Page Six has reached out to Matt for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model and Matt, 36, first began dating after he was drafted by the Vikings in 2012. In May 2022, Haley filed for divorce from the ex-athlete, citing irreconcilable differences. “You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life,” she shared in white text over a black background. The pair reportedly separated earlier that year and did not share any children. In April 2024, Matt, who is now retired from the NFL, married model Keilani Asmus. The two welcomed a son later that year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom, an Arte Cafe regular who claims he snuck into the private party being held there Tuesday night, is fighting for purchase around the packed bar. “It's the Disneyland of delusion to be a Sliwa victory party,” he adds. The crowd packed into the Upper West Side Italian restaurant on election night to celebrate Curtis Sliwa —  a conservative, tough-on-crime fixture in New York City for decades, and the Republican Party's nominee for mayor — is a comical mix of New Yorkers. Members of The Guardian Angels (Sliwa's controversial volunteer crime prevention group) mingle in their red berets and blazers. George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York, is there, too. At one point, attendees started dancing to reggaeton so loud it drowned out most conversations. Sliwa will not be delivering his victory speech tonight, and perhaps that's why there doesn't seem to be even an ounce of anxiety amid the revelry. Appetizers and small bites abound (“The meatballs are two for one!” one attendee jokes when a server approaches), and everyone is behaving like they've consumed more than their allotted drink tickets. The race for City Hall was bizarre and heated, with many believing Sliwa's presence would tank any chance Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, had of defeating Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo chose to remain in the race with the backing of ultra-wealthy donors, and his strategy relied heavily on demanding that Sliwa bow out. In September, the cat-loving, ball-busting Republican claimed he had received at least “seven offers so far to give me more money than my father and I ever made in a lifetime of work,” in order to drop out. “Cuomo already lost the nomination,” one young attendee at Sliwa's election party tells me, adding that while they ideally would have liked Sliwa to win, they could respect that — like the people of New York —  “Mamdani and Curtis [both] acknowledge that Cuomo isn't the right leader for New York City.” Two attendees described themselves as “Curtis supporters who voted for Cuomo.” He had “no chance,” one says. 'SNL' Cold Open: Trump Crashes NYC Mayoral Debate to Roast Each Candidate Zohran Mamdani Says the ‘Days of Endorsements Deciding Elections' Are Over Zohran Mamdani Shares Message to Vote at PinkPantheress' Tour Opener: ‘Our Time Has Come' In a more bizarre exchange, a young man insists to me that “Mamdani is a harbinger of something terrifying in American politics,” who “takes advantage of the contempt people have for white people and white civilization.” Another guest caught in the gaggle peeks over my shoulder and chuckles, slightly aghast, “You're writing this all down?” Others feel Sliwa's campaign had more in common with the Mamdani platform than Cuomo's — and a better memory about the former governor's time in office than his supporters. Perhaps the most sober attendee I encounter the entire night looks me dead in the eye and says that he would take practically anyone over Cuomo, who “killed more people during Covid than Hamas did on October 7.” Cuomo would have lost even if all of Sliwa's voters went his way. Mamdani told NY1 on Wednesday that he did not receive a congratulatory call from either Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams, but that Sliwa did ring him up on election night. During his concession speech on Tuesday — given before most major outlets had even called the race for Mamdani — a teary eyed Sliwa, accompanied by his wife Nancy Regula, spoke to the crowd as if he'd suffered only the narrowest, most contested of losses — not a blowout for third. “Let me warn our new leader: If you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police weak and impotent, if you forsake the people's public safety, we're not only organizing, but we are mobilizing,” he said. “We will become the mayor-elect and his supporters' worst enemy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, the pop star says she's "never felt this connected" to her art. In a New York Times profile published Wednesday (Nov. 5), Grande was candid about feeling unhappy with her music career before she was cast in Wicked a few years ago, noting that she once thought she'd never go on tour again after her exhaustive 2019 Sweetener trek. “There's a thing that comes along with your dreams coming true that feels dangerous at times … Nothing prepares you for what comes with it. Until quite recently, it was really hard for me to navigate and I think it stripped a lot of joy out of this for me.” Despite her prior reservations, the Grammy winner is now gearing up to hit the road again in 2026 for a small tour supporting 2024 Billboard 200-topper Eternal Sunshine, which she dropped after previously thinking that she'd never make an album again. The interview comes more than two years after Grande parted ways with SB Projects, where she had been managed by Braun on and off since 2013. The departure came at a time when several major clients were also announcing their splits from the music mogul, including Demi Lovato and J Balvin. In June 2024, Braun revealed that he was retiring from music management altogether. At the time, he said that he would “continue to root” for all of the big names that had once been on his roster, which also included Justin Bieber and Tori Kelly. This past June, Braun echoed those sentiments while guesting on The Diary of a CEO podcast. Shortly after leaving SB Projects, Grande signed with Brandon Creed's company, Good World Management. A source told Billboard at the time, “She wants the focus to be her art and [Creed] puts her artistry and vision before anything else.” “I've never felt this connected to my art or inspired, and that's just been such a tremendous gift,” she told NYT. “It's like, oh, I don't actually have to take on those things that were projected onto me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Irwin and professional partner Witney Carson brought power and precision to the ballroom during “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Night” on “Dancing With the Stars.” The duo performed a Paso Doble to “Icky Thump” by The White Stripes, blending strong choreography with the energy of a classic rock anthem. The choreography featured commanding movements, dramatic pauses, and synchronized spins that reflected the rhythm and tone of “Icky Thump.” Judges praised Irwin for his continued improvement and commitment to character, noting how he has evolved from earlier weeks. The Paso Doble allowed him to demonstrate strength and focus, two qualities that are central to the dance's storytelling. “Icky Thump,” released in 2007 by The White Stripes, is recognized not only for its distinct sound but also for its social message. According to Parade, the song carries political undertones that address themes of immigration and hypocrisy within cultural systems. Its heavy guitar riffs and bold lyrics made it a fitting selection for a dance that emphasizes defiance and power. The White Stripes used it as a metaphorical statement to critique societal contradictions. For Irwin and Carson, performing to a song with such depth gave their Paso Doble additional resonance beyond its choreography. Tonight's performance follow's last week's knockout dance for Halloween night. Ahead of the performance, Robert's sister, Bindi Irwin—who previously won Season 21 of “Dancing With the Stars”—shared her excitement on social media. She posted an affectionate throwback photo from her time on the show, expressing pride in her brother's journey. Viewers responded positively to Robert's routine, commending his dedication and chemistry with Carson. With his sister's encouragement and a standout performance on Rock and Roll Night, Robert Irwin continues to solidify his place as one of the season's most talked-about contestants.

Directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Hailey Benton Gates, known for her work in front of the camera as Josh O'Connor's love-lorn Tinder date Helen in “Challengers,” “Atropia” is her feature directorial debut. A satire of the military-industrial-entertainment complext, “Atropia” is based on real-life U.S. military bases that simulate foreign environments to prepare troops for overseas combat or help them to recover after traumatic experiences. Shawkat plays an actress who signs up to portray an Iraqi civilian on one of these bases in California that's been made over to look like the Middle East, where she falls in love with a soldier (Callum Turner) suffering from PTSD.

She also just wrapped a part in Kristoffer Borgli's upcoming “The Drama” for A24. So then I thought it was a subject ripe for satire. I think America's misunderstanding of the people they're invading is inherently comedic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The MPA's ratings program is a rigorous, human-driven process where every film is carefully assigned an individualized rating and content descriptors. The MPA's program rates roughly 500 films a year; millions and potentially billions of images and videos are posted to Instagram each day,” it said, asking for the social media giant to implement remedial measures. Presence With Proposal For Offices, Screening Space In Historic Building “For more than half a century, the MPA has maintained the well-known motion picture rating system to guide moviegoers and parents alike regarding the content of films they are about to watch. Last month, Instagram touted a revamp of its often-controversial teen accounts with a new default feature that it said limits content to what's appropriate for a PG-13 movie as set by Hollywood's ratings system. “Teens under 18 will be automatically placed into an updated 13+ setting, and they won't be able to opt out without a parent's permission,” the company announced in blog post. Meta's attempts to restrict teen content literally cannot be “guided by” or “aligned with” the MPA's PG-13 movie rating because Meta does not follow this curated process. Instead, Meta's content restrictions appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence or other automated technology measures.” In a statement to Deadline, a Meta spokesperson said, “Parents tell us they want to better understand what their teens see on Instagram. We know social media isn't the same as movies, but we made this change to support parents, and we hope to work with the MPA to continue bringing families this clarity.” Meta said its intention was never to suggest that it had officially partnered or been rated by the MPA and that it never made this claim. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, whose Department of Justice sued Meta for design choices it alleges put children at risk of sexual abuse, human trafficking and mental health harms, also weighed in. “Rather than actually make its platforms safe for young people as the law requires, Meta continues to roll out half-baked PR initiatives that … lull families into a false sense of security,” he said. “Meta's ratings game is difficult to square with Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that he has rolled back oversight of the content of its platforms and is inconsistent with a platform driven by recommendation algorithms.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Locals are grieving the loss of KitKat, a fixture at Randa's Market in the Mission District, after a Waymo driverless taxi ran over him during a stop to pick up passengers on the night of Oct. 27. “He was a special cat,” says Randa's Market owner Mike Zeidan, his voice breaking as he gestures to the memorial outside the shop. At Delirium, two doors down from Randa's, bartender Amy Rothbauer says she never worked a shift without KitKat stopping by. It's especially hard that there's no one to take responsibility for the feline's death. The news of KitKat's tragic death has sparked communal grief and outrage as locals weigh in on the safety of autonomous vehicles. “We reviewed this, and while our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,” they said in a statement. According to recent data, Waymo's market share now rivals that of Lyft. Last week, on the same day KitKat was killed, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said onstage at a tech conference that she believes society is ready to accept deaths caused by driverless cars, as long as the companies that operate them are held to high standards — but the outpouring of grief over the death of KitKat seemingly proves that society isn't ready to put up with any loss of life to a robotaxi, be it human or otherwise. Waymo is just one of the robotaxi companies operating in San Francisco; competitors include Zoox and Tesla. Former Zoox engineer Bob Somers, now an anti-driverless car activist, joined the Tesla Takedown movement after his experience designing and testing AV safety systems convinced him they're nowhere near as rigorous as they need to be. That incident shuttered Cruise for more than a year; the General Motors-owned company only recently restarted operations. Tesla May Have Sold a Million Fewer Cars Because of Elon Musk's Toxic Politics But He's Definitely a Sign of Our Bleak Reality Musk's Grokipedia Validates His Favorite Conspiracy Theories While Saying Nice Things About Him Somers says the AV industry should see KitKat's death as another stern warning. “Pets are hard to detect and track,” he says. It's a matter of where the statistics are coming from, Somers says. “You shouldn't trust numbers that come directly from a company's marketing department.” As of today, Tesla has had at least three robotaxi crashes and paid out two settlements after its Autopilot system was accused of being at fault in two fatalities. Zeidan tells Rolling Stone that witnesses said they saw KitKat sitting under the Waymo, and attempted to stop it from driving off. “This lady said there was nobody to yell at in the car, no driver.

Gavin Newsom to grant voters the right to regulate AVs in their cities, San Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder said on Instagram, “Waymo thinks they can just sweep this under the rug and we will all forget, but here in the Mission, we will never forget our sweet KitKat. We will always put community before tech oligarchs, and California should do the same.” On Nov. 4, at a press conference in front of Randa's Market, Fielder announced a plan to introduce a resolution that would allow counties the right to ban autonomous vehicles. She was joined by Tony Delorio, principal officer of Teamsters Local 665, who told the gathering, “​​Waymo only follows rules because humans programmed them, not because it cares about our kids. Remembering getting the call that KitKat had been hit, Zeidan passes a shaky hand over his face. “It could have been a child,” he says. “Hopefully, something good will come out of [his death].” Next door at Delirium, bar patrons raise a glass in their feline friend's memory. “Maybe he'll be a catalyst for change,” one says wryly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in recent years, trailers have lost something: their voice. For decades, people like Mark Elliott, Nick Tate, and Don LaFontaine introduced moviegoers to worlds, lands, times, and to one man who could save them all via trailer narration. 's video speeds through the history and evolution of trailers. shows how trailers have been in flux ever since. Unfortunately, like all trends, they grow stale over time. First, that they were overused so much in the '80s and '90s that they became cliché, with comedians like Pablo Francisco making a name for themselves through impersonations of those gravely baritones. Second, trailers still use narration, albeit in different ways. As the trailer evolved into distinct components, with trailers for trailers becoming more common in the last decade, editors began relying more on other sounds to grab viewers' attention. The decline of narration saw the rise in licensed music in trailers and staccato editing rhythms set to crucial exposition. “What happened to narrated movie trailers?” is a fascinating and insightful look at how the trailer evolved into what we see today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Editor's note: This piece contains spoilers for The Lowdown.] Ever since Bogie popped the collar of his trench coat and hit the mean streets of San Francisco, America has been riveted by film noir and its style, swagger, sexiness, and dark-underbelly mysteries. In the latest FX series from the Reservation Dogs co-creator, our gumshoe is Lee Raybon (Ethan Hawke), an eccentric citizen journalist hellbent on bringing down Tulsa's white-supremacist elite. Lee wraps up his investigations in this week's “The Sensitive Kind,” shining a light on femme fatale Betty Jo Washberg (Jeanne Tripplehorn), among others. He also helps mayoral candidate Donald Washberg (Kyle MacLachlan) face some hard truths. It's a visceral pleasure to see racists brought low and Indigenous Oklahomans get the restorative justice they've been denied for so long. But sadly, in our current reality, it can all feel like a beautiful dream. Yet Harjo, who lives in Tulsa himself, insists that it doesn't have to. Club to give us the lowdown on inspirations for the series, dig into this season's sendoff, and explain why he believes there's still hope for the future of this country. It's a diverse city where there is a collision of cultures, and there are unthinkable crimes that happened in the building of Tulsa. There's a lot of history here that is both dark and beautiful. Both of my parents are half white, descending from various European countries. And once I found Tulsa as a home, I just needed to sort things out for my own dreams and my own myth-making capabilities. It's also about myself being a father and trying to figure out if I'm going to be able to make a living for my daughter, who's a teenager, and all the challenges of trying to figure out how to have a stable home for her and myself while also making films and telling these stories. There's been people telling me, like, “You know, it's funny. It's like Ethan's playing you.” And I think it's a mix of all of these influences, including Ethan's own life. AVC: The Lowdown represents a wide variety of cultures and communities in Oklahoma, which is sadly rare in shows and movies about the American West. SH: I think it's more truthful than most writing out there. The worst thing is when people are trying to be diverse just for diversity's sake. It's not very hard to look out your window and see diversity, and it's very lazy when you don't try to understand that diversity around you. And it's like, Well, are you a writer or not? You're supposed to try and accurately represent the world around you, and that's what we tried to do in this show, whether it came from consultants and writers and myself or just a general interest in the people that make up this world. When Killer Mike [who plays Cyrus] first came onto the set and he was talking to me about how much he liked the script, he said, “I love that the story is diverse, but it's not just tacked on. It's not just for diversity's sake.” I'm very proud of that. The character is so interesting and specific, especially because he occupies a very particular space as a white man who's able to move between various communities in Tulsa. SH: Yeah, I started [writing the script] after Lee Roy passed. I didn't want to try to tell his story; he was a complex, fully realized human being that's no longer with us. But I love the spirit of Lee Roy and that he wasn't afraid to stick his nose in places that others thought he shouldn't. He could fluidly move throughout the city, and people trusted him. And I wanted to have that spirit in the character. AVC: Let's talk about the finale, which was so satisfying to watch. With all the horrible things being perpetrated by the people in power every day, it almost feels like a fantasy of an America we're so far from right now. SH: It feels like we entered a different timeline 10 years ago. And from both sides, people are scared to do that now. There's this fear to speak out against things that you're seeing and to feel like, Maybe I'll just say nothing. That way I can hedge my bets. It's why in this last episode, we opened with this racist preacher intercut with [a reenactment of] the Oklahoma Land Run with Donald Washberg, who isn't a racist but he's participating in things that were constructed by racism and therefore is still a part of it. These are all really tough things to parse and sort of express in nuance. There are cowboys that will turn to a Black man in Tulsa and say, “Hey, don't go to that racist place. You could get hurt.” That's actually more real than I think what mainstream media puts out there. AVC: At the beginning of the finale, Chutto [Mato Wayuhi] tells Lee that his family doesn't care about getting their land back from the Washbergs, and Lee struggles to understand why. SH: Land becomes so much about individual ownership, and that's not the point. Whenever Native people say, “We would like our land back,” it's not because they want to individually own it. It's because land is there for community. And it's caused so much pain in this country because people have this idea that they need to own it. My ancestors were moved here because of land. We were all moved to Oklahoma, and then the land wasn't good here. Tulsa was founded by Muscogee Creek Indians. And the reason is because we were moved here from Alabama, our homeland, and we had to walk all the way to Oklahoma. The word “Tulsa” comes from the word “Tallahassee,” which is a Muscogee word that means “old town.” Our whole story is about the taking of land and hurting people to own it. AVC: I love that the season ends with Betty Jo cry-singing a karaoke version of Waylon Jennings' “Luckenbach, Texas (Back To The Basics Of Love)” at a bar. What made you decide to finish on that scene? SH: I had written that moment for another part, and it ended up not working in that part. But we just loved the performance so much. Betty Jo gets away, but internally, she doesn't, and I needed to show that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[This story contains spoilers from episode eight of Dancing With the Stars season 34.] Tom Bergeron to Make First 'DWTS' Return 5 Years After Shocking Show Exit Sinclair Reached Out to Charlie Kirk's Widow Amid Jimmy Kimmel Suspension: "How Can We Make It Right?" Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Leavitt, social media star Earle, Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actress Elaine Hendrix, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter comprise the remaining cast of celebrities, while Fishel was eliminated from the competition Tuesday night. Hendrix suffered an injury last Tuesday that prohibited her from dancing on Halloween Night. Instead of performing live, she earned a 32/40 based on rehearsal footage reviewed by the judges. She was not eliminated from the show or prohibited to continue dancing, meaning she will perform an individual dance and partake in a group number on Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night. After performing a Viennese waltz to “What the World Needs Now Is Love,” Hendrix gave a brief update on how she's been doing since the injury, noting that she's been feeling “very solid and strong and grateful.” After Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night, there are only three episodes left, including Nov. 25's special three-hour finale. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night did see the first 40/40 handed out to Team Chicago, though no individual couples have earned a perfect score. During the individual dances, Earle and Leavitt nearly earned perfect scores, both scoring 39/40. Chiles and Irwin trailed close behind them, with respective scores of 38/40 each. Last week's Halloween Night saw the couples perform spooky numbers and compete in the dance marathon, while Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Jen Affleck and her partner Jan Ravnik were eliminated from the competition. Flavor Flav served as a guest judge alongside mainstay judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While some may find the intense desert heat grueling, Robert Pattinson actually found it “relaxing.” During a recent interview for IndieWire, alongside his Die My Love co-star Jennifer Lawrence, the actor shared his experience shooting Denis Villeneuve‘s upcoming Dune: Messiah. “When I was doing Dune it was so hot in the desert that I just couldn't question anything,” he recalled. “And it was so relaxing, like my brain actually wasn't operating, I did not have a single functioning brain cell. And I was just listening to Denis [Villeneuve]: ‘Whatever you want!' Alice Rohrwacher to Receive European Achievement in World Cinema Award Tokyo: 'Palestine 36' Takes Grand Prix, Zhang Lu's 'Mothertongue' Wins Two Prizes Zendaya, who plays Chani, previously told W Magazine that she got heatstroke while filming Dune: Part Two in Jordan because she wasn't drinking enough water. “It was very hot, and I remember thinking, ‘Oh, man, the bathrooms are so far away,' because we had to hike to the locations,” she recalled. Austin Butler, who portrayed villain Feyd-Rautha in the second installment, also previously shared his experience working in what he described as an “uncomfortable environment.” “It was 110 degrees and so hot,” he explained to Entertainment Weekly. “I had the bald cap on, and it was between two soundstages that were just these gray boxes of 200-foot walls and sand. Returning castmembers include Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson and Anya Taylor-Joy. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terri Irwin is like any proud mom — doting, sentimental, and always ready to share a rare throwback of her kids. Ahead of Robert's next performance on DWTS, Terri took to Instagram to share rare footage of 5-year-old Bindi Irwin meeting her baby brother for the first time. The now-viral clip from nearly 22 years ago shows her late husband, Steve Irwin, proudly introducing their daughter to their newborn son. In the video, little Bindi cradles baby Robert and asks with innocent curiosity, “I couldn't help hoping that maybe he was really a girl … how do you know it's a boy? The most unforgettable moment in the video comes when little Bindi proudly announces, “I'll call him Brian.” After a brief pause, Steve gently responds, “His name's Robert.” Without missing a beat, Bindi insists, “But I'll call him Brian for short,” leaving her parents laughing. Even decades later, the tender exchange continues to capture hearts, perfectly showcasing the Irwin family's warmth, humor, and unshakable bond. Many couldn't get over Bindi's adorable “Brian” moment, with one writing, “Steve's face when Bindi says she's gonna call him Brian 😂.” Another fan shared, “You think Steve was passionate about conservation, until you see him with his family.” Others admitted to rewatching the video several times, saying, “Have I seen this many times before? Did I just watch it 8 times in a row? Viewers also praised Bindi's spunky personality, calling the clip “literally my favorite of all time” and “proof she's had that spark since day one.” Many celebrated Terri for raising such a loving family, with one fan writing, “We all love ‘Brian' & Bindi! One fan wrote: “Terri, 🩷 you're the definition of unconditional love — thank you for inspiring all of us mums to lead with our hearts. Even Bindi herself joined in, commenting, “Love you so much BRIAN!! His sister Bindi, who famously won “Dancing With the Stars” in 2015 with Derek Hough, has been one of his biggest supporters. She and her husband, Chandler Powell, even moved to California with their daughter, Grace, to cheer Robert on throughout the season.
