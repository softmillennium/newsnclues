                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Parliament rapporteur for the digital euro has proposed giving private payment firms an equal chance to solve Europe's payment sovereignty problem, potentially sidelining a key part of European Central Bank's project. Fernando Navarrete, the MEP coordinating the legislative process, presented his draft report to the ECON committee today, marking a sharp departure from the legislative direction pursued before the 2024 European electionsAll parties unanimously agreed on the need for European sovereignty and are keen to move away from the dependence on Visa and Mastercard for retail payments. “Our commitment must be unwavering to the (sovereignty) goal itself, not to any single instrument to reach it,” Navarrete said. “When I ask myself what European citizens expect from us, I doubt that many feel an urgent need to create a digital euro.” The development of the central bank digital currency conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) has two versions: one that is online and the other that is offline. Navarrete proposes that the offline CBDC, as a tokenized version of cash without intermediaries, should proceed. There is a private payment solution in progress, the Wero wallet, which is currently available in Germany, France and Belgium. So far 20 banks and payment firms are involved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Total crypto liquidations continued, totaling $1.6  billion in the last 24 hours, CoinGlass data shows. While bitcoin recovered Wednesday, it's still down double digits from its October 6 all-time high. As for bitcoin ETFs, outflows so far this week have already reached $763 million, per SoSoValue. “Bitcoin is currently trading below its 200-day moving average, which may further suppress demand,” the analysts wrote in a note. Additional risk triggers include macroeconomic factors, a prolonged shutdown, and concerns around digital asset treasuries, all of which could further dampen risk appetite and drive bitcoin's price lower.Timothy Misir, head of research at Blockhead Research Network, also said that a loss of the $98,000 support level “signals structural shift toward bear phase; below $95,000 could trigger panic.” However, some analysts remain upbeat, and while November seems “choppy” for bitcoin, they say the bull run is not over. The long-term fundamentals haven't changed — liquidity and further rate cuts are still coming,” he said. Spot ethereum ETFs also a fifth straight day of outflows, with roughly $219 million leaving the investment funds on Tuesday. Shiba inu, cat in a dogs world, pepe, and popcat have fallen to levels not seen since 2024. Bitcoin ETFs also continued to bleed, with $186.5 million in outflows on Monday. BitMine, the largest ethereum treasury firm, also added over 82,350 tokens to its stash last week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitget, a Seychelles-based fintech firm dubbed a “universal exchange” due to its cryptocurrency and traditional financial services offerings, has announced its full integration with the Morph Chain layer-2 blockchain. Users on Morph can now trade assets from the Morph ecosystem directly from their Bitget wallets with USDT without the need for swaps or bridging. According to a Nov. 5 press release, Morph is the first network to offer full integration with Bitget Onchain. Half of the tokens were slated to be burned at the time while the remaining 220 million BGB were reportedly locked with a scheduled release at 2% per month to fund liquidity incentives, use case expansion, and education. With the integration now finalized, Morph is officially the native onchain home of the BGB token and serves as the core settlement layer with BGB established as both its gas and governance token. As Coinspeaker reported on Nov. 4, Bitget announced an institutional financing program offering zero-interest loans to qualified participants with borrowing limits up to two million USDT without interest. Approved users are required to meet at least 50% of the exchange's standard monthly trading volume benchmarks and the program runs from Nov. 1, 2025, through Jan. 31, 2026. The exchange also announced a major upgrade to its Bitget Onchain service in September allowing users to seamlessly trade, stake, and manage millions of on-chain tokens directly from their Bitget spot account. The expansion introduced support for Ethereum, Solana, BSC, and Base.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contrarian bulls might be taking some heart as at least one well-followed analyst is throwing in towel on his hefty year-end price target for bitcoin BTC$103,999.48. "While bitcoin's structural investment case remains strong, cyclical dynamics have evolved," Alex Thorn, head of research at Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital, wrote in a Wednesday morning note to clients. The $100,000 level has the potential to be a major support level, as it has been tested multiple occasions, he said, but "bad things can happen, so we shouldn't count on it." Morris added that BTC, now barely in the green for 2025, currently is "in no way overbought and is underhyped," hinting at cautious optimism for potential upside once stability returns. Bitcoin BTC$103,999.48 staged a modest bounce above $103,000 by early U.S. morning hours on Wednesday, recovering some of the losses from Tuesday's steep selloff that pushed prices below $99,000 for the first time since June. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,436.41 rebounded almost 10% from Tuesday's low, when forced liquidations dragged the price to just above $3,000. The second-largest crypto traded at $3,340, up 10% from its worst levels Tuesday, but still down 6% over a 24-hour timeframe. Crypto-related equities opened the session with tepid gains after yesterday's major losses. Among the gainers was Coinbase (COIN), up 1.9% and Strategy (MSTR), ahead 1.4%. A deep dive into Zcash's zero-knowledge architecture, shielded transaction growth, and its path to becoming encrypted Bitcoin at scale. In 2025, Zcash evolved from niche privacy tech into a functioning encrypted-money network: BONK gains 2.84% to $0.00001215 as volume surges 134% above average, maintaining upward momentum within defined technical boundaries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March 2022, Shell sold more than 20 LNG cargoes as "carbon-neutral," backed by nearly five million credits from rice farms in China's Anhui province. The credits flowed through Verra—the leading voluntary carbon registry—based on claims that irrigation upgrades had slashed methane emissions. It wasn't Verra's first credibility crisis. A 2023 investigation by The Guardian, Die Zeit, and SourceMaterial found that roughly 94% of Verra's rainforest credits didn't represent real reductions. A system built on trust was minting climate fiction. At the same time, cryptocurrency was in a speculative frenzy. One malicious line of code could drain your account overnight. Most people just wanted to buy Bitcoin like Apple stock—click, watch the number go up, maybe sell later. They didn't want to become their own Swiss bank. And that dependence was about to be exploited. FTX arrived with a seductive pitch: "We'll handle the complexity. It looked like Schwab, acted like Schwab, and for a while, felt safer than trusting yourself with a 64-character string that could never be recovered. Different industries, different starting points, but identical failure mode: complexity created dependence on intermediaries, and that dependence was eventually exploited until systems broke. What happened next wasn't just a reform. It was the beginning of a fundamental restructuring. After the voluntary carbon market's credibility crisis, a new generation of solutions has emerged built on proof systems, not trust. Satellite imagery confirms forest cover and irrigation systems, IoT sensors track emissions in real time, and blockchain creates an immutable audit trail. Rather than dismantling legacy registries like Verra, Gold Standard, or ACR, it's rebuilding trust by linking them through blockchain infrastructure. The Climate Action Data Trust connects these registries at the protocol layer, making every issuance, transfer, and retirement auditable in real time. The same infrastructure is already tracking the $500 million Metro Manila Flood Management Project, where every disbursement flows through blockchain, cutting administrative friction and creating instant visibility for auditors and project teams. Corporate buyers are increasingly favoring engineered carbon removal over traditional nature-based offsets, driven by the need for durable, verifiable solutions. Microsoft has poured hundreds of millions into direct air capture (DAC) technologies that pull CO₂ straight from the atmosphere, far more reliable than forests that risk burning down. A Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) facility with geological storage spanning thousands of years simply cannot be undone by drought or land-use shifts. While nature-based offsets remain valuable for immediate impact, engineered removals offer unmatched permanence, backed by continuous monitoring via sensors, satellites, and blockchain audit trails. In today's market, machine-readable, auditable truth isn't just a nice-to-have—it's the entry ticket to credible climate action. A new layer of solutions is pushing the precision stack directly to projects—combining satellite data, IoT sensors, and on-chain recording at the ground level. Rather than relying solely on centralized registries, these platforms automate verification in real time and channel funding toward confirmed outcomes in renewable energy and conservation. As an example, Preshent uses AI and blockchain to verify sustainability milestones through distributed pilots in partnership with Tribal Nations, expanding to regional and global partners. Its JR AI engine automates verification while PRSH Finance records transactions and channels funding toward verified outcomes across renewable energy and conservation projects. Financial institutions are now building the infrastructure to make this scalable. Carbonplace, a consortium of nine global banks including UBS, BNP Paribas, and Standard Chartered, is constructing a blockchain-based network for institutional carbon credit trading, creating the banking rails for tokenized environmental assets. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission now classifies tokenized carbon credits as regulated commodities. The G20 has endorsed distributed ledger standards for audit infrastructure. The EU has begun approving blockchain-based MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) pilots as part of its compliance infrastructure. Analysts project tokenized credits could reach $50 billion by 2030. No-code platforms, such as Coinrule and 3Commas, let users deploy algorithmic strategies such as grid trading, arbitrage, and momentum plays with a few clicks. Copy-trading platforms like eToro allow novices to mirror professional strategies tick-for-tick. Some exchanges charge around 0.01% per trade, making it economically viable to run strategies that once required engineering teams and institutional infrastructure. Retail traders can now access leverage levels previously reserved for professional desks. Coinbase now offers nano-sized Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, contracts representing 1/100th of a Bitcoin, letting users learn derivatives without committing large capital. Webull went further in October 2025, partnering with Coinbase Derivatives to list Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, and XRP futures, giving retail traders a single interface for equities, options, and crypto derivatives. Then there's Bybit, where more than 20 million accounts can access up to 100x leverage on major perpetual futures pairs. Retail traders face a structural disadvantage in futures markets: they lack the institutional-grade probability data and execution infrastructure that professional desks use to identify statistical edge and minimize emotional decision-making. Platforms like Edgeful are addressing this gap by providing probability analytics across 100+ historical market scenarios, analyzing patterns from gap fills to volatility reversals. Real-time screeners identify trades based on probability thresholds, auto-plotting levels on TradingView and NinjaTrader and connecting to brokers to execute trades using preset risk parameters. Whether retail tools can replicate anything close to an institutional edge remains doubtful. Professional desks process thousands of signals per second, co-locate servers near exchange engines, and deploy capital at scales an individual can't replicate. Models trained on historical data can perform flawlessly in backtests yet fail catastrophically when confronted with events outside their training range. When thousands of autonomous agents respond to the same market signal in real time, they don't correct instability—they amplify it. Volatility cascades faster than humans can intervene. The core questions have shifted: Who is liable when an AI agent triggers a flash crash? How do you audit a black-box model that cannot explain its own decisions? Smart contracts execute trades based on predefined logic recorded on-chain, creating transparent audit trails that regulators can monitor. MiCA's real-time audit obligations signal the same shift: machine-readable market structure over post-hoc enforcement. But skeptics argue the precision stack may automate flawed incentives rather than eliminate them. Some blockchain implementations also demand substantial energy consumption. The precision stack accelerates verification but can't replace adversarial auditing that catches intentional deception. Regulators are now auditing architecture, not just outcomes. Carbon markets and crypto trading began with different failures. One couldn't prove what was real, the other moved too fast to understand. Both reached the same conclusion: manual systems can't govern trillion-dollar flows. Institutional trading desks are using it to execute at machine speed. Microsoft and leading corporations are using it to govern carbon removal. AI interprets reality, blockchain enforces outcomes, smart contracts execute them. The same precision infrastructure is reorganizing both climate finance and digital markets. Supply chains, healthcare records, insurance claims—any system defined by fragmentation or opacity is being rebuilt around the same stack. The question facing institutions is no longer whether to adopt proof-based systems, but how quickly they can integrate them as markets restructure around machine-readable truth.

Tether will also share expertise drawn from its global experience to assist the city in creating a comprehensive framework aligned with international standards such as those implemented under the Plan ₿ initiative. This is an important step toward building a progressive policy framework that aligns with international practices, while ensuring safety and transparency in digital asset governance in Da Nang City. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, commented, “Da Nang is emerging as the future of digital governance in Southeast Asia with a clear vision for how technology can serve people and strengthen governance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the cryptocurrency market faces significant volatility in November 2025, Ethereum ETHUSDT and XRP are exhibiting unique price behavior compared to Bitcoin BTCUSDT. While Bitcoin continues to drain liquidity from the broader market, popular analyst CryptoInsightUK believes ETH and XRP may not necessarily follow BTC's lead this time. Adding to the analysis crypto analyst Ted highlighted that ETH nearly touched the $3,000 level before bouncing back, showing that this zone continues to act as strong support. However, Ethereum now faces a crucial resistance area between $3,500 and $3,600. Reclaiming this range would signal renewed bullish momentum, while failing to do so could send the price back toward $2,800, a level tested several times in recent months. As of early November 2025, Ethereum trades near $3,300, down about 8.6% following the latest market pullback. Simialry, XRP has now absorbed nearly all its low-timeframe liquidity, leaving only a small amount of support below current price levels. This pattern often signals a consolidation or accumulation phase, where selling pressure fades and buyers quietly begin to position for a potential reversal. Adding to the optimism, Ripple's decision to retain 25% of all XRP tokens reflects strong internal confidence in the asset's long-term growth. Currently trading between $2.20 and $2.30, XRP faces a crucial support zone. As Bitcoin's dominance wavers, ETH and XRP might quietly prepare for their own rebound, signaling that not all altcoins need BTC's permission to rise. Ethereum has cleared most short-term sellers, holding strong near $3,000 support and eyeing a key resistance between $3,500–$3,600. Analysts and AI forecasts project XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025, driven by ETF approvals, partnerships, and regulatory clarity. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metaplanet looks to buy more BTC despite sitting on major losses. When most are backing away from crypto as Bitcoin slips below $100,000, Japan's Metaplanet is doing the opposite. The firm, often called “Asia's MicroStrategy,” is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy, tapping a fresh $100 million loan to buy even more BTC. Over 50 Firms are Sitting on Major Losses The funds will be deployed toward additional Bitcoin purchases as part of Metaplanet's long-term accumulation plan. The firm is also expanding its Bitcoin Income Generation initiative, which includes selling cash-secured put options to capitalize on volatility and executing a $500 million share repurchase program. While Metaplanet ramps up, most other corporate Bitcoin treasuries are cooling off. The feverish pace of accumulation seen earlier this year has slowed sharply through the fourth quarter. Between January and June, public companies collectively added around 245,000 BTC to their balance sheets. That figure dropped to 205,000 BTC in the second half of the year — and just 28,000 BTC in Q4 so far. Ethereum holdings have followed a similar pattern.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Generative-AI Fortnite skins, Gucci-branded non-playable characters and knock-off NFT fashion drops are not one-off marketing ploys. Instead, they represent the frontier of a virtual goods marketplace, which is projected to exceed US$509 billion globally by 2033. Although these new immersive spaces provide opportunities for creative brand promotion, they also magnify the risk of trademark infringement. Nearly 700 million global users engage with immersive platforms, interest in NFTs continues to grow and AI tools enable near instantaneous content creation. However, this exceptional growth is generating more trademark disputes as brand owners contend with the dramatic increase in unauthorised and infringing use of their marks, trade dress, copyrights and other intellectual property. Virtual environments create endless opportunities for the proliferation of user-generated content. For example, one AI-generated logo or skin can easily move across platforms, games and NFT marketplaces. This multiplies the instances of potential infringement and raises complicated questions around what qualifies as “use in commerce” and whether and to what extent platforms that host or distribute allegedly infringing content can rely on safe harbour or immunity doctrines under current legal frameworks. Recent case law in the United States has begun to define how courts approach trademark disputes involving NFTs, AI and virtual goods. In Hermès Int'l v Rothschild (MetaBirkin), a district court in New York held that the Trademark Act allowed Hermès to assert its trademark rights against NFTs imitating a luxury handbag line (Hermès Int'l v Rothschild, 590 F Supp 3d 647, 650–51, 655, SDDY 2022). In another case, a California district court denied Midjourney's motion to dismiss artists' allegations of vicarious trade dress infringement based on the generative-AI platform's alleged inclusion of a “trade dress database that can recall and recreate the elements of each artist's trade dress” (Andersen v Stability AI Ltd, 744 F Supp 3d 956, 978–81, ND Cal, 2024). These issues are reaching the federal appellate courts as well. In July 2025, the Ninth Circuit ruled in Yuga Labs v Ripps that NFTs can qualify as goods under the Trademark Act (Yuga Labs, Inc v Ripps, 144 F4th 1137, 1157–59, Ninth Circuit, 2025). Yuga [wa]s not entitled to prevail on its trademark-infringement and cybersquatting claims at [the summary judgment] stage because it ha[d] not proven as a matter of law that Defendants' RR/BAYC project is likely to cause consumer confusion in the marketplace. Viewed holistically, these rulings signal that trademark law is steadily adapting to the digital economy, giving brand owners clearer guidelines for enforcing their rights in virtual marketplaces. Companies should expect increased litigation in the next year, which will continue to test how courts will address issues related to AI-generated content and cross-platform brand assets. This litigation will hopefully provide guidance on the issues of liability, safe harbour provisions and the scope of trademark rights in virtual marketplaces. As companies continue to experiment with creative and lucrative opportunities presented by AI and immersive worlds, it is imperative that they develop an IP enforcement playbook for handling the inevitable rise in infringement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin mining company MARA has just announced record-high revenues for the past quarter, at $252.4M. This represents a 92% increase compared to 2024's Q3, when the company bagged $131.6M. MARA owes this growth rate to its expanding Bitcoin mining system, which generated 98% more $BTC over a one-year span. The company mined 2,144 $BTC during this Q3 or almost 53,000 between 2024 and 2025. Fred Thiel, MARA's CEO, explained this mass expansion in the context of adopting open-source AI tech to replace the standard GPUs: We are already seeing the alternatives to GPUs enter the market, and open source AI is making it far easier and much less expensive for companies to deploy advanced AI systems directly in their own private cloud environments. This allowed MARA to almost double its performance in just 12 months. As Fred Thiel himself noticed, Bitcoin has ‘entered its institutional phase', with names like City Corp, BlackRock, and JP Morgan ‘integrating Bitcoin into traditional frameworks'. As Bitcoin Treasuries data shows, 353 entities hold over 4.05M $BTC and their accumulation rate went up 4.12% over the last 30 days. This ever-expanding ecosystem offers unlimited opportunities, and Thiel's MARA is all for it. Bitcoin mining monetizes underutilized energy and stabilizes grids, while AI inference transforms that same energy into intelligence and productivity. To that end, MARA has already secured a partnership with MPLX with the goal of expanding its operations into West Texas. MPLX will offer ‘long-term access to low-cost natural gas at scale', which will complement MARA's computing infrastructure for higher throughput. These developments position MARA as a leader in Bitcoin mining, which can only work in Bitcoin's favor. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), on the other hand, also propels $BTC forward, promising to build a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network than ever before. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises a faster, more performant, and more cost-effective Bitcoin network, leveraging tools such as the SVM and the Canonical Bridge. The Canonical Bridge addresses Bitcoin's most pressing issue: its performance limitations. As such, smaller transactions can sometimes experience confirmation times of hours, which explains the network's unsuitability for most DeFi applications.
