What is the point of one shot? In film and television, cinematographers will often show off their prowess by using as few cuts as possible. These shots are undeniably impressive, with actors having to treat their on-camera work as though it were onstage, to say nothing of weaving in and around one another as sets, rooms, and circumstances change in an instant. All of which is to say the one-take can get a little one-note. Perhaps that’s why it’s so refreshing to see Netflix’s new crime drama Adolescence push the form beyond the rigorous stress and into emotional territory not often explored in one-shot takes.

The high stress of executing the “oner” needs to mirror the tone of the scenes — or the complete films and episodes — themselves, so the one-take formula is typically used to exaggerate tense circumstances. That’s not to say all are like that, but increasingly, this is the one formal trick that makes any scene more stressful than it ought to be, with the audience distracted and left wondering if the show can really pull it off. In Adolescence, the four-episode limited series created by His Dark Materials’s Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham (who also stars), 13-year-old Jamie (Owen Cooper) is accused of murdering one of his classmates, and each episode was filmed in a single take — a process explored in this Twitter thread — from a scene as straightforward as two characters speaking in a row to some complicated aerial drone magic. Graham, who plays Jamie’s father, was quite familiar with this format, having starred in Boiling Point, a feature-length one-shot film about a chef, as well as its spinoff TV series (made in a few shots but not many). While Boiling Point might have pushed the possibilities for just how manic a single take could be, Adolescence opts to use the technique for a greater range of emotional realities. Rather than each episode being filled with heart-pounding action, the series establishes itself with a frantic, stressful raid on Jamie’s house and his subsequent arrest, then dissolves into a crime show that’s much more meticulous and robust beyond the thrills at the top.

The second episode is set at Jamie’s high school, where the local detectives arrive to talk to the students in hopes of getting a lead on the murder weapon. The mystery of “Did Jamie do it?” appears at end of the first episode, but the second becomes more concerned with the environment that might have fostered such violence long before the crime was ever committed. The shot zooms in and around the school, popping into classrooms and bearing witness to the fraying social order and sanity within it. Rather than use a lone shot to compound time, Thorne and Graham, working with cinematographer Matthew Lewis, broaden the show’s scope to examine the ways young people communicate — or, as Thorne puts it, it’s “not a whodunit, but a why-dunit.”

Adolescence sinks into the tragedy of a young boy radicalized and a young girl killed and lets the one-take trick explore the depths of understanding and grief, especially in episode three, arguably the best of the series. Rather than move the audience from pillar to post, Thorne and Graham clear the stage for long, unbroken conversations between Jamie and psychologist Briony (Erin Doherty) ahead of his trial.

What remains so potent about the third and fourth episodes — about Jamie’s dad, Eddie, trying to celebrate his birthday as his son’s trial nears — is that they don’t follow a clear emotional line because grief and processing it aren’t necessarily linear. These episodes are less action driven and more homebound with characters crying and laughing and trying and failing to understand what happened. When Jamie and Briony discuss his feelings about men and women, the boy’s behavior moves wildly between embarrassment and aggression. His mood swings are frightening and inexplicable, revealing a central truth about Jamie that is difficult for both Briony and the audience to sit with. This is a very different boy from the one we saw only two episodes ago (albeit seven months earlier in the show’s timeline). The sensation of the one-shot doesn’t build tension during these last two episodes so much as it shows how life is often composed of contradictions. An hour can contain a multitude of sensations: You can go from laughing to fearing for your life as Briony briefly does during her chat with Jamie. While a number of one-takes are about either setting a stage or building stress, these wallow in Adolescence’s central questions about how and why someone so young could do something so awful. Sitting with that discomfort is a more intense experience than the trapeze act of most television one-take feats — these characters can’t walk away from their situation, and neither can the viewer. The compressed sense of time bonds what is real and what isn’t.

Part of what feels remarkable about Adolescence’s one-take trick is that, by the end of the show, the mastery of the technique doesn’t come through as a thing to be impressed by as much as one that simply sustains the energy of a singular episode. The choreography of the shots during a “normal day” in Jamie’s life is undoubtedly impressive, but Graham’s performance, alongside those of Christina Temarco and Amélie Pease, who play Eddie’s wife and daughter, sits in the dismay and confusion that often settle in the aftermath of an inexplicable event. They don’t understand how this happened to their son — and we don’t necessarily see the full extent of it either — but knowing is not the point. In a landscape where so many shows foreground reveals and plots, Adolescence centers an emotional reality, one that can’t be cut around or spliced to create something coherent or streamlined. Sometimes, one hour can feel miserable, boring, intense, bizarre, overwhelming, frightening, or some combination of those. Adolescence can show all of that without blinking.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Playboi Carti Gets Lost in the Music,https://www.vulture.com/article/playboi-carti-music-review.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:04:41 GMT","Photo: Scott Dudelson/Getty Images

Playboi Carti wears his flows like he wears his clothes: Ensembles designed to wow and confound are tossed to the side with the same zest and vigor that brought them together. The 29-year-old Atlanta rapper’s shifting sound and persona were first cultivated as a member of the Awful Records crew and, later, Harlem’s A$AP Mob. Early works like 2017’s Playboi Carti and 2018’s Die Lit documented the birth of an increasingly bit-crushed mutation of southern hip-hop. Carti became the crown prince of rage rap, which swiped the forbiddingly DIY sonics, ominous iconography, and barely contained aggression from punk and metal. These ideas weren’t foreign to hip-hop — Geto Boys’ records touched most of the same points — but Carti’s eye was always further afield. His persona teetered on a razor’s edge: He must look magisterial but seem nonchalant. Rage, to the extent that the microgenre is distinguished from its fountainheads in trap and emo rap, is about ritual and release. The preening is the point. The screaming is the point. You’re paying for a portion of devil-may-care cool and a semblance of dominion over darkness. The aim is to carefully brandish chaos.

Music does nothing to reconcile any of its conundrums. But nobody showed up for earnestness.

The unpredictability fueling these triumphs is just as often a cause for concern. The tragic crowd-crush at Travis Scott’s Astroworld reinforced how badly a churning mosh pit needs the regulation and structure of the long-standing rock-show tradition. Allegations of violence surrounding high-profile artists — a 2022 domestic-abuse charge levied against Lil Uzi Vert met with a plea of no contest, and a 2023 felony-aggravated-assault charge against Carti was later reported as dismissed — imply that abrasive views on these records come from somewhere real and worrying. Iggy Azalea, mother of Carti’s son, saying “We haven’t heard from that man in … six months” lends disconcerting credibility to rhymes about not giving a shit about women. Scott and Kendrick Lamar, who both guest on Music, offer a thermostat reading for how much the industry even cares about these issues. But this isn’t what irks rage’s older detractors, who grew up loving Dr. Dre and knew the misogyny of 2001 was not the put-on some of the gun talk might’ve been. It’s a fear of debasement of rap’s perceived core values — painstaking originality, lyrical depth and dexterity, distinctive diction — bucking against a bumpy evolution. Purists see the rise of almost defiantly unlaborious music as proof that fast fashion floats, but this wave is kin to everything that came before it. Methodological quibbles aside, the story’s what it always was: Black 20-somethings knowingly strip-mining movements that ripped off and marginalized their grandparents. Music sees one of rage’s head scenesters crashing into orthodoxies and expectations of youth culture as time ticks on.

It’s been a fussy four years since the last Playboi Carti album, 2020’s goblin-infested Whole Lotta Red. Tentpole rage-rap releases like Uzi’s Luv Is Rage and Scott’s Rodeo will turn ten this year, and their authors are cruising into their 30s seeking to bottle and reproduce the old lightning. Uzi’s curt Eternal Atake 2 dragged, as did Scott’s “Hot 100” shooting star “4x4.” While Carti fans pestered him for a follow-up, the vocal theatrics and synth saturation he favors trickled into the topsoil, feeding mainstream rap. You can get pretty close to the signature listening to Ohio’s OsamaSon, Virginia’s Nettspend, New York’s Yung Fazo, Nottingham’s skaiwater, or any of the members of Carti’s own Opium imprint. (The label feels like a Galactus arrangement. Four Atlanta heralds — Destroy Lonely, Ken Carson, and the duo Homixide Gang — wield aspects of their benefactor’s power, priming the planet for conquest.) The shape of Music — 30 songs spanning 76 minutes — feels like an apology for years of false leads and starts to a hungry fandom.

The result is imperfect but instructive. It communicates why, in spite of anyone’s reservations, Carti is a rapper’s rapper. The big guns clearly study him, excitedly adopting the house style. He is a massive inspiration for pitched-up vocals and swarming ad-libs in mainstream hip-hop, though he gets the latter from Jeezy. Those qualities don’t necessarily dominate Music, which is more interested in reveling in the tonal breadth of the voice. Two exceedingly strange noises Playboi Carti makes on the new album are as follows: A long and guttural howl undergirding rousing choir vocals in the gospel-tinged “Crush,” like a demon exorcised in Pentecostal Sunday service. And later, in the deceptively saccharine “Fine Shit,” a crusty, percussive “The money gon’ talk!” interrupting soft crooning, like a lech yelling at the TV as the lead in a rom-com begins to trust a love interest. This is an artist obsessed with the marriage of high- and lowbrow.

Carti is, as oldheads assessed, somewhat enthralled by pissing on tradition. “Crush” takes after a Ye church banger, but the choir is whooping “Shorty gon’ let me crush,” like the Chappelle’s Show skit with the opera singer interpreting Dave’s raunchy thoughts. It’s almost entirely horny buildup, echoing grunts occupying spaces where a series of verses usually goes. (Actual Ye has been pitching a fit about not being featured anywhere, revealing how Carti, a lucrative collaborator on the Donda and Vultures albums, has stormed rap’s upper class to the extent that even the radioactive clout lord wants in on the action.) “Fine” weaponizes the sound and structure of a rap Song for the Ladies, mostly to flex on the riches and influence attracting women. The clean vocals are so slick, and the ad-libs so coarse, that rumors of Carti using an AI model of his own voice are circulating in the fandom. The query speaks to a dilemma: How do you reaffix a stamp on a sound that’s been aggressively copied?

Music regroups the way many works by artists a decade into their careers tend to nowadays: It reaffirms foundations. Sometimes this means cannibalizing aspects of older songs. The video-game-y topline of “Crush” brings to mind a similar sequence in Whole Lotta Red’s “Sky.” But the twist is that the artist’s point of nostalgia sits further back in time than fans looking for another hit of Die Lit. Not content to fully retreat into the self-parodic zoomer nostalgia routines Carti’s rage-elder peers have, Music engages in a jarringly convincing array of impressions. In addition to two songs in which Future appears, there are around a half-dozen Carti performances that sound like him. At first pass, the slurring trunk-rattler “Toxic” conjures the image of the DS2 star rhyming his way through anaphylaxis. “Walk” and “Dis 1 Got it” sell self-destructive chants like Future’s drug jams. But “Charge Dem Hoes a Fee” with actual Nayvadius makes the Carti deep voice all over Music feel small. At the same time, he salutes Lil Wayne on “Like Weezy” and approximates the squawk of mixtape-era Young Thug, while “K Pop” manifests the disinterested drawl of Lil Yachty. Music is saying that Carti can’t be pinned down.

But the familiarity grows oppressive. It hits more like a survey of what the rapper has been up to than a self-certain step forward. For Carti fans, appreciating his unusual gifts comes with an awareness of his foibles, of the erratic release schedules and legal woes that undermine his work. Audience and industry seem relatively nonplussed about this, more concerned with the questions of authenticity raised by tributary vocal delivery. The issue, then, is that Music is a lesser work in the catalogue. The instrument is astounding, but the guy can’t decide what to do with it. Restlessness sources both the most grating and the most intriguing performances. It is a distinguishing trait, impossible to pry off the music like the darkness threading in and out of rage and drill scenes. You couldn’t make Carti take himself as seriously as sticklers for bars desire and get anything half as loony as the crunchy, Ashanti-flipping “Cocaine Nose.” It is similarly unwise to bask in the airs of lawlessness in modern rap without stopping to ponder their real-world ramifications. Music does nothing to reconcile any of its conundrums. But nobody showed up for earnestness. Carti is here to facilitate people ramming into one another. In this objective, he gets his way.",vulture

The moment I knew I was going to get along very well with Michelle Trachtenberg, she was in an ice-cube battle with Jonathan Lipnicki.

It sounds impossibly ’90s, and it was — Harriet the Spy play-fighting with the kid from Jerry Maguire, backstage at the 1997 Kids’ Choice Awards, in front of the girl who played Matilda. But it stuck with me for a different reason: She was being nice to him.

Jonathan was five years younger than her, but she didn’t treat him like an annoyance. I knew so many older girls who were mean to younger kids, but she wasn’t, even when Jonathan was trying to slip an ice cube down the back of her shirt.

“Oh no, you don’t!” she said with a laugh, turning on him with her own ice cubes, and he giggled maniacally.

I had been nervous to meet her. She was the star of Harriet the Spy, the movie that everyone at school talked about, the character who spied on everyone and knew the whole neighborhood’s business. Michelle was only two years older than me, but in preteen years, that is an eon. At age 9, I was forever impressed by, and intimidated by, Cool Older Girls. Michelle Trachtenberg seemed to me the epitome of the Cool Older Girl: beautiful, stylish, funny, from New York — so much cooler than my hometown of Burbank, California. I couldn’t imagine she would want to talk to me, let alone be my friend.

But as soon as we were introduced, she gave me a huge, warm smile, then looked at my dress and said “Eurokids, right? I love that store!”

I nodded and felt a surge of joy. I shopped where the cool girl shopped!

To my surprise and delight, she wanted to keep talking to me. Not only was she nice, I realized, but she was remarkably intelligent. Yet she managed not to be condescending and didn’t try to impress with big words, the way other kids (including me) might have. She was smart, but she was also self-possessed, and didn’t need to show off.

Before we left the awards show, Michelle told me she’d be seeing me again: We were both going to be at the Audrey Hepburn Foundation’s Hollywood for Children charity film festival in New York in a few months. I told her I couldn’t wait.

That’s where I would find out it wasn’t just me: Everybody fell in love with Michelle Trachtenberg.

When I started acting at 5 years old, my parents made it known that no matter what happened, I would live the most normal childhood possible. As time went on, though, life hardly ever felt normal — except, ironically, when I was with other child actors.

Imagine a group of child and teen actors hanging out together, and you probably think the worst: everything from being shitty to wait staff to wrecking hotel rooms like mini rock stars. But nearly all the child actors I knew spent their time volunteering with charities, and so did I. It kept us grounded, made us feel like we were giving back, and was also a great way to make friends.

“We were all in that space as actors, but had it not been for these charities, we probably wouldn’t have been able to bond on the level we were able to,” says Vanessa Lee Chester, who had met Michelle on the set of a Panasonic commercial when they were both 5. She later went on to star in Harriet the Spy as Harriet’s best friend, aspiring scientist Janie. “I remember really looking forward to it. I was like, ‘I know I’m helping people out, doing something I would already want to do — but I’m doing it with all my friends!’”

At the same time the Pussy Posse was wreaking havoc around New York, my group of child-actor friends were making PSAs about wearing bicycle helmets, walking in fashion shows to support Multiple Sclerosis research, and giving Christmas gifts to children in hospitals. That group included Chester; Ashley Johnson; Andrew Keegan; Jonathan Taylor Thomas; Rider Strong; Lindsay Felton; Mae Whitman; Bryton McClure; Michael Fishman; Raven-Symoné; Miko Hughes; Taran Noah Smith; Zane, Paris, and Reeve Carney; Tia, Tamera, and Tahj Mowry; Adam Wylie; and many more.

After, we’d gather at a restaurant — usually Planet Hollywood — or someone’s home. Our parents were always present, and the teenagers would also keep an eye on the preteens. We’d sing Beatles songs and showtunes our parents taught us in the car, and pretend to be secret agents with walkie-talkies borrowed from generous security guards (“Come in, Thunderbird! This is Firebird! Over!”). We weren’t “child stars”; we were nerds.

“We fucking lived for those nights at Planet Hollywood,” Chester says. “We were all too young even to go to teen clubs, so these were our social moments.” Michelle had donated her spy belt from Harriet to Planet Hollywood, and Robin Williams gave one of his Mrs. Doubtfire dresses. For us, it felt less like a kitschy theme restaurant and more like being at a relative’s house, surrounded by family knicknacks.

Michelle was a later addition to the group, but she quickly became the heart of it. When she told us a set anecdote or a shaggy dog joke, in her slight New York accent — “Harriet” was “Haah-rriet, never “Herr-riet” — everyone would listen.

That wasn’t a surprise to Danny Tamberelli, who worked with her on the Nickelodeon sitcom The Adventures of Pete & Pete (she played his best friend, Nona). She was great at bringing people together, and was “immediately a sibling” to him, he recalls. Her second week on set, he decided to stay in his trailer and play his bass instead of going to lunch. “She hid the auxiliary cord from me,” he says, because she was annoyed that he wasn’t hanging out with her at lunch. “I got the message,” he says with a laugh. “I had two little sisters!” And now he had three.

Harriet was the perfect role for her, says Tamberelli, because she was always inquisitive. A studio teacher on Pete & Pete once taught him how to do a card trick; he was able to trick adults on the set, but he couldn’t fool Michelle. “She sniffed it out so quick,” he says. “She was like, ‘Let me shuffle the deck.’ I said, ‘No, no, no! You can’t shuffle it! You can’t shuffle it!’ She blew me up.”

Michelle can do anything, I remember thinking — until the night someone handed her a mic and said, “Hey, Michelle, freestyle rap for us!” She tried for about ten seconds, but couldn’t think of anything to say besides just the word “rap” over and over again, and dissolved into giggles.

That April of 1997, while we were at the film festival, marked one year since my mother had died. Being with the group in New York felt safe, the one place my mother’s absence didn’t haunt me. Still, on the anniversary of her death, I burst into tears. Michelle and everyone else rallied around me, giving me hugs and doing whatever they could to make me laugh. This so impressed my normally cold grandmother that she allowed me to have a hotel sleepover with my best friend of the group, Paris Carney, a sweet child actress and singer.

And what did we talk about at the sleepover? Michelle, of course. While she had been trying and failing to freestyle rap in the other room, some of us had been playing Truth or Dare, and another child actor friend had made a big revelation.

“He said he was in love with Michelle,” I said as we were brushing our teeth.

“Yeah, not even a crush, but in love!” Paris said. This was particularly scandalous to us because she already had a boyfriend. She was dating Paris’s sweet and funny older brother, Zane, a child actor and a regular on the CBS sitcom Dave’s World. It was a very middle-school relationship, no more than sitting next to each other and occasionally holding hands, but everyone knew they were together.

“He kept saying how jealous he was of my brother,” she added.

“He was like, ‘If I had Michelle Trachtenberg, I wouldn’t even give her to God,’” I said.

“I mean, she belongs to God,” Paris said, laughing.

“And to herself!” I said.

“I don’t know that she and I ever kissed,” Zane told me, as an adult. “It was very pure. But for me, it felt like love.” He’d developed a huge crush on Michelle after he saw Harriet the Spy; they met when she was cast as his preteen love interest on Dave’s World. After she went back to New York, the two of them started a long-distance phone-call relationship, which went on for years.

A few months after my sleepover with Paris, someone told me there were photos from the Audrey Hepburn Hollywood for Children film festival in a teen fan magazine. I flipped through it to see an image of Michelle, making an adorable face with an adorable stuffed animal. Under it was the caption “SCOOP: Michelle Trachtenberg and Zane Carney are an item!”

I felt a bit embarrassed on their behalf, and I still do. Imagine your middle-school dating life being discussed in a national magazine.

Michelle and I did events together all the next year. We went on a charity cruise together, where we sang along to the Grease Megamix, and she assured me that my ’40s-inspired outfit — a sort of half–Rosie the Riveter, half-pinup-model outfit an older girl had dressed me in — for “Retro Night” wasn’t too last-minute, or too mature, like I worried.

“You look adorable,” she told me. “You’re like one of those ‘limited edition’ collectible dolls.”

We had the kind of closeness that grows between girls who’ve spent a short but intense amount of time together, like summer-camp friends. After the press for Matilda and Harriet the Spy died down, though, we saw each other less and less, and I worried about when I’d see her again. There were only so many times I could fly out to New York.

Then something surprising happened: She moved to where I lived, in Burbank, and we ended up at the same middle school.

Surely, I thought, she’d be one of the beloved girls in school. But that didn’t happen. Every time I even heard someone say “Michelle Trachtenberg,” a kid would jump in to say that they’d heard she was mean, full of herself, a total bitch.

“She’s not,” I’d say, every time. “She’s really nice!”

I couldn’t reconcile it with the Michelle I’d known, the one who was never anything but warm and kind. I’d gotten the feeling she might have a feisty side, but that just made me like her more.

I remember wondering if the kids at school were jealous. A lot of students were aspiring actors: One week three people in my class were excused early to audition for the same Nickelodeon TV show. There was always a lot of resentment toward the kids who’d “made it.”

While my career was on the wane, Michelle’s career was thriving. We’d both been up for the role of Penny in Inspector Gadget (she got it), and she was just about to be cast as Dawn Summers, Sarah Michelle Gellar’s sister on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I’d see her around school, with a small group of friends, and while she always looked gorgeous, she usually didn’t look happy. Could it be that she had changed? She probably won’t want anything to do with me now, I thought, and kept my distance.

Then, right before she graduated in 1999, she pulled me aside, and asked if she could talk to me. It was the first time we’d had a one-on-one conversation that wasn’t just a quick “hi” in the hall since I’d started middle school.

“Are the kids here mean to you?” she asked.

“Sometimes,” I said.

“Because they are to me,” she said, tearing up. “They call me Harriet the Slut, Harriet the Bitch, Harriet the Bitchy Spy … and so much worse. They never stop.”

I had never seen Michelle cry before. I’d never seen her anything other than perfectly composed and confident. That’s what it was, I realized. That’s why they said she was “mean.” Because they were mean to her first, then when she went on the defense, they called her a bitch.

It wasn’t just that she was being bullied; it was that there wasn’t any way she could get them not to hate her. So much of being a child actor is about making everyone happy. It felt cruelly ironic to be so hated when our raison d’être was getting people to like us.

At the time, I was fortunate: I had supportive teachers and a solid friend group. When I started high school a few years later, though, both my friend group at school and my crew of child actors splintered, and I found myself in the same place Michelle had been. I was being bullied at school — both for having been a child actor and just for being an awkward teenager — and I felt completely isolated: The people-pleasing had made me resentful, and the resentment made me bitter and furious. Now everyone was calling me a bitch.

I transferred to a different high school, one for the visual and performing arts. There, once again, I found a group of friends and was able to feel like I could be myself again. I did miss screen acting, but I was tired of all that went with it: the months away from family and friends, the long hours and tedious reshoots, the constant scrutiny from the press and studios, the “fan letters” from grown men about your body.

Michelle must have also gone through it all. We never talked about it, but I know that if I did, she did too. I don’t know how she got through it. You had to be tough to weather the cruel misogyny of the 2000s and early 2010s. And Michelle was. (“She’s from Brooklyn!” Tamberelli said.) She always seemed to be working while mostly avoiding being tabloid fodder. That, to me, was success. Probably because, more than anything, she truly loved acting.

Even after I lost contact with her post–middle school, she never failed to surprise me. She could be in a goofy sex comedy like EuroTrip, then in a dark indie movie like Mysterious Skin, then in a family-friendly movie like Ice Princess. I was proud of her, and just like in middle school, I never stopped defending her.

“Michelle Trachtenberg is so mean on Gossip Girl,” a college acquaintance once told me, “that I feel like she just has to be a bitch in real life.”

“She’s not!” I said. “I knew her. She was a sweetheart.”

“But she’s so good at playing a bitch!” she insisted.

“Because she’s a good actress,” I said, rolling my eyes.

She was, I thought, wildly underrated. I’d see Michelle in a show or a magazine and smile, happy for her. Would she want to be friends with me now? I’d wonder. Would she even remember me?

Last month, when I found out Michelle died, I was packing for a work trip. I looked at my phone and felt my stomach drop. My hands were shaking and my knees went weak — I thought I might pass out. I sat in a chair, and started to sob.

This wasn’t supposed to happen. She was too young. She’d worked too hard. I always thought I would get the chance to see her again, to tell her how much I’d always looked up to her. To tell her the times we spent together as children were some of the best of my life.

I went through my Instagram and was instantly overwhelmed by all the tributes to her. Not only were all of my childhood friends posting about her but so were so many people I never knew had known her. Comedians, musicians, actors, people I’d met as adults. Fans and friends.

“My childhood friend is gone,” I posted. I didn’t know why I did it. It didn’t feel like enough.

But the next week, I was in New York, and I lost count of how many times people told me they’d seen my post and said, “I am so sorry about Michelle.” Not Michelle Trachtenberg. Just Michelle.

“You knew her, too?” I found myself asking, again and again. They did, or they knew people who did. All the while, I couldn’t stop thinking of my childhood friend group. So many of them I had just recently begun to reconnect with. I’d been so embarrassed about who I was as a preteen and teenager, it had taken me years to reach back out, to realize that it didn’t matter to them. They were forgiving.

I started texting and messaging all my friends who’d known Michelle. I needed them to know that I loved them and missed them.

In retrospect, it feels as though we were the last generations of child actors who were allowed to be kids.

Zane had stayed in touch with Michelle the longest. They had drifted apart and broken up in their early teens and lost touch while she was filming Gossip Girl and he was touring with different bands. His brother, Reeve, ran into her in Ireland while he was filming Penny Dreadful, and finally, the preteen sweethearts reconnected at a New Year’s Eve party in 2015.

“She did not miss a beat,” said Zane. She cackled when she saw him, and he felt as if he were seeing “the fully realized Michelle Trachtenberg.” They stayed up until four in the morning talking, and because their relationship had been so innocent, it moved easily into a deep, platonic friendship. From then on, she would always try to come see him play music, especially when he was performing with Evan Rachel Wood (who, Zane says, also loved Michelle).

“‘Joy’ is the word that comes up when I think of our connection,” he says of his grown-up friendship with Michelle. “Just boisterous laughing. There was so much of, like, ‘oh my God, what did we go through? We were like 9 years old!’ Laughter about how we made it through, and stayed positive.”

I told him about the other boys who had crushes on Michelle, and my and Paris’s proto-feminist critique. He laughed and admitted that once when he was 11, he had collapsed on his bed after a long phone call with Michelle and exclaimed, “I’m so glad she’s mine!” That earned him a gentle lecture from his mom about Michelle, and women in general, not being his property.

But I was glad they’d had each other. I was glad we had all had each other.

In retrospect, it feels as though we were the last generations of child actors who were allowed to be kids. I noticed a shift happening in the early 2000s, when former friends of mine, like Hilary Duff, suddenly had to be pop stars and actors and entrepreneurs. It only got more complicated when social media came around.

And being a kid is complicated enough on its own. I thought about this a lot when, last week, for the first time in years, I sat down to re-watch Harriet the Spy. It was a darker movie than I remembered: Harriet loses her beloved nanny, Golly; several of her friends; and, arguably, her own innocence. It’s not nostalgic about childhood. It shows the good and the bad.

I wouldn’t want to be a child again, I thought. Though if I could have lived one week of my life over again, I might have chosen the week I spent at the film festival in New York, with Michelle and all of our friends.

At one point in the film, Michelle, as Harriet, makes a snide observation about a girl in her class as the camera pans over to the girl at her locker, which was covered in photos of teen idols.

That’s when I burst out laughing, through my tears: They were all boys who had been in our group.

https://vulture.com,Reputation (Taylor’s Version) Teases: An Endless Timeline,https://www.vulture.com/article/reputation-taylors-version-release-timeline.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:01:26 GMT","Photo: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images

Taylor Swift might have sung, “I swear I don’t love the drama, it loves me,” on her 2017 album Reputation, but the fanfare leading up to its loooong-awaited rerelease seems to indicate otherwise. Ever since Swift’s sixth studio record became eligible for rerecording way back in November 2022 — the same long-ago month that saw Ron DeSantis topping polls and the end of The Walking Dead — fans have eagerly lapped up any clue that Reputation (Taylor’s Version) is ready for release. Yet 16 months later, all we have are a few brief clips and a new understanding of trademark law.

If you’re still down to clown, the latest rumors are that the album will arrive on July 16, which just so happens to be World Snake Day (during the Year of the Snake, no less). But if the date comes and passes without so much as a hiss? Well, take comfort in knowing it would be far from the first time we were all fooled by Swift’s Rep teases. And while some of the examples on the list below may seem like unintentional red herrings, remember Swift’s own warning to listeners on “Mastermind” off 2022’s Midnights: “What if I told you none of this was accidental?”

May 2023: The “Karma” Music Video Starts It All

Swift’s video for the Midnights single “Karma” contained references to all of her albums, but the Reputation nods got fans talking the most. From a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it snake cameo to the coffee-cup clock with a black nail by the No. 2 (a.k.a. a potential February release, duh), there were a good amount of clues that indicated Rep (TV) would soon be on its way.

August 2023: Two TV Teasers and … Ed Sheeran?

Toward the end of summer 2023, Swifties were surprised with not one but two clips of songs from Rep (TV) featured on TV shows: “Delicate” on The Summer I Turned Pretty and “Look What You Made Me Do” on Wilderness. What felt like celebratory gifts were probably more like consolation prizes as we still haven’t heard full versions of either track.

Also in August, Swift’s close pal and frequent collaborator Ed Sheeran revealed he had not yet recorded the new version of “End Game,” which was disappointing only if you miss the sound of Sheeran rapping.

October 2023: Shout-outs in Swift’s Eras Tour Movie Post

In her Instagram post celebrating the premiere of the movie The Eras Tour, Swift made several notable references to Reputation, including “getting in the car now” (a.k.a. “Getaway Car”) and “look what you genuinely made me do” (which, like her reputation, needs no further explanation). Perhaps the film would contain an announcement about Rep (TV)’s release date, we thought! Nope, just a better view of the Lover house and some amusing bloopers in the credits.

December 2023: Time’s “Person of the Year” Has “tRuSt iSSues”

Finally, some legit teases! In her Time Person of the Year cover story, Swift explicitly talked about Rep (TV) for the first time by calling the vault tracks “fire.” Let your very patient fans be the judge of that, Ms. Swift! The star fueled the flames in her Instagram caption about the article, writing that she had “tRuSt iSSueS” regarding interviews. An R for Rep and an S for snakes? Hmm …

January 2024: Green Dresses and Black-and-White Photos

By the start of 2024, hype was building that Swift would release Rep (TV) in February (remember that “Karma” clock?), supported by a few seeming teases in the year’s first month. In addition to Swift sporting some very Rep-like looks at the Golden Globes and on the street, she and some of her A-list friends changed their social-media profile pictures to black-and-white, which fans took to be a hint that the album was forthcoming. Well, an album was forthcoming, but it turned out to be The Tortured Poets Department, which also features a black-and-white photo of Swift on the cover. Half-credit?

February 2024: A Grammys Bait-and-Switch

With the two on the coffee clock having arrived, Swifties were convinced the star would drop Rep (TV) sometime in the month. The Grammys, during which Midnights scooped up Album of the Year, seemed like a perfect time. Yet Swift used her acceptance speech not to announce the release of the record everyone expected but a brand-new one (the aforementioned TTPD). Which we might have been way happier about if we already had Rep (TV) in our hands!

March 2024: Taylor Swift and … Tom Brady?

While Swift is a hardcore Chiefs fan these days, it was just a year ago that she allowed another NFL team to use a clip from a Rep (TV) song in its docuseries. Viewers of The Dynasty: The New England Patriots on Apple TV+ got to hear “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor’s Version)” during one episode. Perhaps Swift was lured in by the “TV” similarities?

June 2024: “This Is What You Came For” Hits Eras

On June 14, the lucky attendees of Swift’s second Liverpool stop on the Eras Tour got to hear her perform “This Is What You Came For,” the 2016 Calvin Harris–Rihanna hit later revealed to be written by Harris’s own ex. Many theorized the rarely heard track was bound to be a Rep (TV) vault track, especially since Swift’s breakup with Harris occurred while the original album was being recorded. Hey, it still could be!

August 2024: Swift Does “Something Bad” With Her Hand

All summer, it seemed as if the album might finally be released on August 17 since the date marked seven years since Swift’s social media went dark in advance of the original Rep’s announcement. During a London tour stop, Swift played Rep’s “I Did Something Bad” (one of her self-proclaimed favorite songs) for the first time, giving fans hope, but ultimately nothing came of it. A few days later, on August 20, Swift got fans hyped up again when she made a snakelike hand signal during her final London show, but it ended up signaling only a possible cramp.

October 2024: A New Bodysuit and Boy-Pop Delays

Oh boy, October was a ride when it came to Rep (TV) teases. Not only did Swift debut a very snaky new bodysuit on tour in Miami — about which she left a rare and suspicious comment on Instagram — but she wore Rep-tinged outfits on multiple nights out. Also, both Joe Jonas and Shawn Mendes delayed their planned October 18 album releases, moves many fans took to be made out of caution over Swift’s incoming album. It’s possible that was the case and Swift moved the release date, but alas, we’ll never know.

November 2024: The End of an Era But Still No Rep (TV)

Her last three posts also go in order 3..2…1… (people in the cover). A countdown to an announcement? pic.twitter.com/eB9pZ0XRR9 — GAV #1 FOTS STAN (@gavbreakfavtoys) November 5, 2024

Surely, Swift would announce Rep (TV) at the end of the Eras Tour, right? It was a solid theory strengthened by the singer’s continued love of green outfits and an astute fan noticing Swift’s recent Instagram posts seemed to indicate a countdown. Sadly, the only things the Vancouver final show delivered (besides great music) were tears and confetti.

January 2025: Spotify Glitch or Reason to Clown?

After so many false hopes, most Swifties had stopped looking so closely for Rep (TV) clues by the beginning of this year. Yet when some Spotify listeners discovered the original album wasn’t showing up on the streaming service, the clowning began that an announcement was imminent. In all likelihood, it was probably just a glitch — and not the cool Midnights version.

February 2025: Travis Kelce and Trademarks

From Swift presenting at the Grammys, to boyfriend Travis Kelce saying he “can neither confirm nor deny” the Rep (TV) release date, to news that the album’s trademarks would be valid only until August, February brought some solid teases but no actual news.

March 2025: An (Imaginary) Lady Gaga Collab

The release of Lady Gaga’s Mayhem wasn’t exciting just for Little Monsters but for Swifties, too. It was rumored the two pop idols had collaborated on a Rep-coded song. Alas, the rumors proved false and fans were left with their hopes once again dashed.",vulture

https://vulture.com,Thank You God for All This Goggins,https://www.vulture.com/article/walton-goggins-white-lotus-righteous-gemstones-characters-performance.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:30:25 GMT","The White Lotus’ Rick and The Righteous Gemstones’ Baby Billy are very different characters, sure, but they’re really just at opposite ends of the Goggins spectrum. Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Fabio Lovino, Jake Giles Netter

Something incredible is happening on television right now. Every Sunday night on HBO for the next few weeks, you can watch The White Lotus, which this season features Walton Goggins as a very stressed-out man who is on vacation in Thailand. After that, you can leave your television on the same channel and watch The Righteous Gemstones, which continues to feature Walton Goggins, here as a white-haired televangelist and game-show host. We have a double-Goggins situation on our hands. An entire Goggins block of programming. HBO has taken one of the last remaining appointment-ish windows for scripted television and said, “Let’s give the people two scoops of Goggins.”

The only thing that I find even a little upsetting about this Goggins confluence is the sudden realization that it has been a possibility all along, this idea of filling up our HBO Sunday night with shows that feature Walton Goggins in some way. Think of what he could have done with a season of recurring guest spots on The Sopranos and Entourage in the incredibly weird handful of years when those two shows aired back-to-back. Or Westworld and Veep. Or Succession and Barry. I could keep putting hypothetical Goggins characters into HBO Sunday night shows for hours. Game of Thrones is probably my favorite, but only on the condition he kept his Southern accent and it was never addressed; I thought about this for two seconds and immediately heard him say, “Well now, Daenerys, it appears you got yourself some dragons.” Now you’re hearing it, too. This is the power of Goggins.

What’s most telling about the two characters he’s playing right now is that they’re such different people and yet both squarely inside Goggins’ particular wheelhouse. On The White Lotus, he plays Rick, a walking bummer of a man who travels to a fancy resort in Thailand for reasons that have less to do with spa treatments and meditation than with a lifelong quest for revenge. On The Righteous Gemstones, he plays Baby Billy Freeman, the host of Baby Billy’s Bible Bonkers and the deeply jealous uncle of Jesse, Kelvin, and Judy Gemstone. The former character is quiet and reserved, the latter a showman to the core. On paper, the two men have very little common ground other than their affinity for much younger romantic partners who have unconventional smiles and a willingness to put up with world-class narcissists.

But look closer. Look deeper. Both of them are guided by a similar motivation, a feeling that something was denied to them — for Rick, the happiness he could have had; for Baby Billy, the success he felt entitled to — and a burning desire to get their hands on it, even if it means coloring outside the lines. This is a theme of Goggins’s roles. His character on The Shield, Shane, was a cop who went corrupt because he felt he deserved the life the criminals he chased got to live. His character on Justified, Boyd, was a Kentucky criminal who saw running schemes and drugs as his best shot at upward mobility. Rick and Baby Billy are different, sure, but they’re really just at opposite ends of the Goggins spectrum. And he’s giving them both to us in one night of television. We are getting the Full Goggins.

We are getting the Full Goggins in more than one way, too. Baby Billy showed up in the second episode of The Righteous Gemstones’s final season — we had to go on a little detour to the Civil War with Bradley Cooper first — and promptly pulled his pants down to reveal his own little Baby Billy in order to impress upon his nephews and niece “what a fuckin’ man looks like.” There is a long history of actors on this show, to use Danny McBride’s term, “hanging dong,” and even though Goggins has confirmed that said dong was, to use his term, a “dick double,” just watching him gleefully take part in that grand Gemstones tradition is a wonderful treat. He does this thing with his arms and hands during the scene that I’m not sure I can even describe, a kind of peacocking via gesticulation that has burned itself into my brain. As an onscreen comedic bit, it’s a textbook example of an actor committing so wholeheartedly to something so silly that he manages to sell it.

He’s committing on The White Lotus, too, albeit in a way that involves his pants staying on. On this week’s episode, his character took a trip to Bangkok to meet up with an old acquaintance played by Sam Rockwell and, as Rockwell’s character delivered a wild monologue for the ages, Goggins sat there giving a series of facial reactions that you will see in memes for years. A few weeks before that, his character smoked some laced weed, went to a Thai snake show, and proceeded to absolutely freak out and release all the snakes as he had the cathartic wild-eyed realization that he too was a snake trapped in the glass cage of life. We’ve all been there. Probably. Maybe. Rick definitely was there, though. And thank God he was because it gave some genius on HBO’s social media team the opportunity to mash up the scene with the audio of Walton Goggins performing his Gemstones earworm, “Misbehavin’.”

Do you see now, though? Do you see why all of this is so incredible? We’re coming out of another cold winter. The days are getting longer. The birds are starting to chirp in the morning. The leaves are about to start sprouting on the trees. And right now, for the next month or so, our Sunday nights will be filled with Walton Goggins playing miscreants on HBO, complete with dick doubles and snake shenanigans and whatever else he can get himself up to. We are getting the Full Goggins, every dangling inch of it. Please do not take it for granted.",vulture

The Sex Lives of College Girls’s semester at Essex College has come to an early end. The show, which was created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, was canceled by Max on March 18, about two months after the finale of its third season on January 23. The most recent season was notable for its cast shake-up — former main-cast member Reneé Rapp (Leighton) left the show, and both Gracie Lawrence’s Kacey and Mia Rodgers’s Taylor were added to the full-time cast. Deadline reports that Warner Bros. Television, which produces Sex Lives, is currently shopping the show to Netflix, where Kaling just scored a hit with Running Point.

No, it has nothing to do with the keyboards. How about some trumpet innuendo instead? “If all you see are dudes in the audience,” he explained, “that means your music is dead.” Hancock, in turn, was told this by his old friend Miles Davis back in the ’60s — although he was a bit feistier about it. “He used more expletives than I just did,” Hancock added, “but you get the idea.” The jazz cat is now gearing up for the release of his first album in 15 years, the delay of which, he admits, was caused by the internet becoming its own bandleader. “I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube. A lot of them,” Hancock said. “New music-writing software, things about health, tech things.” Maybe Wayne Shorter had the same vice.",vulture

Influence Defines Lady Gaga’s Latest Album, Mayhem, to Carefully Curated Sonic Exhibition Showcasing her inspirations and imitators. The Record is a fascinating retrospective that reveals just How Thoroughly Gaga Understands Her Place in The Pop-Music Continuum.

Through Musical References and Production Choices, Mayhem Invites Fans to Explore Different Wings of Gaga’s Artistic Sensibility, Revealing An Artist Who has Mastered Musical Curation. Ahead, Switched on Pop’s Reunna Cruz Walks Co-Hosts Charlie Harding and Nate Sloan Through the References in Gaga’s Latest Release; You can check out the full episode here.

""Perfect Celebrity""

REUNNA CRUZ: GAGA GOT HERT START IN Underground Clubs in New York, So This Song and the Way It Turns from ’80s Funk-Pop Into Techno Could Be an Ode to Her Upbringing. Right off the bat, we’re getting a ton of thematic similarities to sum of gaga’s Most Famous Songs. This Exploration of Being in the Spotlight, We See it On Songs Like ""Paparazzi"" and ""The Fame."" We Even See The Satiric Slant of Celebrity on The Song “Applause” from Artpop. But in therms of Sonic Inspiration on This Song, We’re Gonna Go To Charlie’s Favorite Reference: Nine Inch Nails.

Charlie Harding: You Can’t Make Gothic Dance Music Without Reference Industrial Music! Like, If you want to make dance music Dark, you’ve drop to use those drone synths. It’s the formula.

R.C.: And GAGA LOVES NINE INH NAILS, SO IT’S NO SURPRISE. In a Recent Interview, She Said, ""I Black Out Every Time I’m in Trent Reznor’s Represent."" This is a True Superfan of Nine Inch Nails We Got Here.

BUT Than It Also Goes Beyond Nine Inch Nails. I Think “Perfect Celebrity” has This Gothic Depeche Mode-Aian Quality As Well, Kind of Leaning on Industrial But With a Synth-Pop Flair. To me, A Song Like ""Mercy in You"" Evokes ""Perfect Celebrity,"" privately in the verses.

""Vanish into you""

R.C.: Songs Like “Perfect Celebrity” are not indicative of the whole record. The album is actually to Happy Record. Gaga’s in What Sems to Be a Fulfilling Relationship with Her Fiancé. So In That Happyiness, It’s Easy to see How Imitators Come The Picture On The More Optimistic Songs. Critic Ann Powers Note to Me Recently That ""Vanish into You"" Souded to Recent Chappell Roan Hits, and I Agree.

C. I Mean, The ’80s Synth-Pop Thing. I can’t scratch the itch, what is it?

R.C.: I Hear a Little Bit of My Favorite of Hers, ""Good Luck, Babe."" ""Vanish into you"" is like ifpell roan did a Max Martin and Weeknd Song. It has also, Like, Grand Synths That Fit Well in the Weeknd’s Lusher Productions. I Think It Could Be Put In The Same Conversation As A Song Like ""In Your Eyes.""

C.H.: That’s The Weeknd, Not Peter Gabriel, To Be Clear.

R.C.: Another inspiration of gaga’s!

""How Bad do U want me?""

R.C.: So i Don’t Think it’s a Secret Who This Song Sounds Like.

Nate Sloan: Taylor Swift.

C.H.: Taylor Swift.

R.C.: Using More Positive-Skewing Words, I Think “How Bad Do U want me” is a tribute to Taylor Swift. IT’s Like A Full Imitation of the Jack Antonoff Taylor Swift Sound, Crafted On Records Like 1989 and reputation. I Think The Most Overt Comparison is “Gorgeous” - Though This Song is also essentially The Same As Yazoo’s 1982 Track “Only You.”

N.S.: YEAH, There are MANY TAYLOR HALMARKS HERE. You’ve Got BeSe ’80s Program Drums. You’ve Got Tosee Long, Substaned Basses, which we Talked about in Our Midnights Episode a Couple Years Aphra. In therms of the Lyrics and The Melody, You’ve Got A Lot of these, Like, One-NoTe Staccato, Repeated Melodies. And The Lyrically It’s All About This Self-Reflective Journey, Which I Think Is Vry Different Than Gaga’s usual Thing.

R.C.: She’s Also Dealing in Lyrical Archetypes That Taylor Deals with On ""Style."" Gaga Says, ""You Like The Bad Girl I Got In Me."" Taylor Sings Similar Lines: ""And I Got That Good-Girl Faith in A Tight Little Skirt / You Got That James Dean Daydream Look in Your Eye."" These ideas of, Like, The Bad Boy and the Good Girl. GAGA FLIPS IT, AND SHE’S THE BAD GIRL, AND HER FIANCÉ, OSTENSIBLY SHE’S SINGING TO, IS THE GOOD BOY.",vulture

Tracy Morgan left last night’s New York Knicks game in a wheelchair after being sick at his courtside seat. The 30 Rock star began vomiting during the third quarter of the game at Madison Square Garden and had a nosebleed. Morgan shared on Instagram the next day that he had food poisoning and is “doing ok now.” The game was delayed for about ten minutes, per CBS Sports, while staff took care of Morgan and cleaned the court. “We hope Tracy feels better soon and look forward to seeing him back courtside,” an MSG spokesperson told Vulture. After the pause, the Knicks beat the Miami Heat 116-95.

“Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!” Morgan added in his post. “More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I’ll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅”

Morgan has diabetes and has dealt with alcoholism, topics that frequently come up in his stand-up and on 30 Rock. He had a kidney transplant in 2010 and has been open in the past few years about taking Ozempic for his diabetes.

Happier Gilmore? Happy Gilmost? We can keep workshopping the name, but the fact remains that a Happy Gilmore sequel is coming to Netflix. News of the film first broke (if you don’t count Shooter McGavin blabbin’ on the radio) at Netflix’s Upfront presentation in May 2024. Now, we have our first official trailer, featuring a Happy that’s happy to be back golfing, Julie Bowen, and no alligators in the sky (as of yet). Below, everything we know about the upcoming comedy, from trailer to cast.

Fore! A trailer!

Netflix dropped the Happy Gilmore 2 trailer on March 18, and the Boston Bruins should be ashamed that, the previous night, they lost to the Sabres. Sandler reps the New England team (amid their terrible, terrible season) by wearing a jersey throughout the trailer. Happy, who has not golfed in years, gets back on the green and swings at a ball so heard he burns a hole through a golf simulator. Plus, Ben Stiller takes a break from prestige TV to return as Hal. “Holy shhhhh …” Mr. Gilmore reacts for us all.

Who else will be in Happy Gilmore 2?

Hmmm… what are Lana Del Rey’s avails? On The Tonight Show, Sandler mentioned that many real golfers will be making cameos in the film. Christopher McDonald and Julie Bowen are both back. (Carl Weathers, who played Chubbs in the first film, died in February 2024.) New cast members include Margaret Qualley, Travis Kelce, and Bad Bunny. Does that mean Taylor Swift is going to attend the premiere?

Margaret Qualley lied on her résumé

Apparently The Tonight Show is getting all the Happy Gilmore 2 ’sclusies. Margaret Qualley went on the show September 24 to share how her husband lied to get her a spot in HG2. Apparently Adam Sandler has a texting relationship with Jack Antonoff. Sandman texted “Jacko. It’s Sandler. Does your wife golf at all?” To which Jacko replied “yeah she’s actually good!” Now, Qualley says she does, in fact, golf. And is not, in fact, good. But Antonoff’s little white lies secured a small part in the Happy Gilmore sequel for Qualley.

KillaTrav will meet the Sandman

First Grotesquerie and now this! Travis Kelce has successfully clawed his way into Happy Gilmore 2. After pleading his case on his New Heights podcast, Sandler decided to give the kid a shot. “Travis has… he mentioned it, so we have a nice something for Travis,” Sandler said on The Tonight Show. “He’s gonna come by. He’s a very nice guy. You guys would love him in real life. What a big, handsome guy. Funny and cool as hell. He’s a stud, and he’s so funny.” Sounds like Sandman has a crush. Between Qualley and Kelce, that’s 2 of 2 Happy Gilmore 2 casting announcements straight from Taylor Swift’s squad.

When is Happy Gilmore 2 coming to Netflix?

https://vulture.com,Dakota Johnson Meets Her Match(es) in Materialists,https://www.vulture.com/article/materialists-movie.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:09:03 GMT","Are Celine Song and her husband just gonna take turns dropping a love-triangle movie every other year? Because that works for us, honestly. Song, the mind behind 2023’s Past Lives who is married to Justin Kuritzkes, writer of the screenplay for 2024’s Challengers, has a new movie in theaters as the writer-director of A24’s Materialists. Dakota Johnson leads the cast as an ambitious New York City matchmaker who seems torn between (who could’ve guessed!) two potential matches for herself. Are you team Chris Evans or team Pedro Pascal? Maybe the new trailer will help you decide.

What happens in the trailer?

The trailer introduces an original Japanese Breakfast song … and Johnson as Lucy, a matchmaker who is willing to stop random guys on the street to see if they’re potential customers. Some of her clients have very specific criteria (“nothing over 20 BMI,” “more grown” but still young), while others are a little more open (“I’m trying to settle”). A friend and a celebratory cake inform us that Lucy is responsible for nine marriages — which is shy of Love Is Blind’s record but still pretty good. According to an official synopsis, she’s “torn between the perfect match and her imperfect ex.” It’s pretty easy to tell who’s who: Pascal’s character meets her at an event where Evans’s character is a waiter who already knows her drink order. One man sleeps with her in a $12 million apartment, while the other man lives with roommates but has a rich past with her. She’s entertaining both connections, but her overall stance on relationships seems to be getting more complicated. “I don’t think I’m very good at my job, anymore,” she says at one point, later musing that people get married “because they’re lonely, and because they’re hopeful.”

Who else is in the cast of Materialists?

Johnson, Evans, and Pascal have our main love triangle covered. Variety was the first to report that Zoë Winters, Dasha Nekrasova, Marin Ireland, and Louisa Jacobson would also join the trio in the cast.

Not long before they absconded to Poland to make a movie with Charli XCX at the height of Brat mania, Jeremy O. Harris and director Pete Ohs spent two weeks making a very different movie in the wilderness — upstate Massachusetts, that is. Alongside The Afterparty’s Zoë Chao, Callie Hernandez from The Flight Attendant and Alien: Covenant, and Harris’s Slave Play collaborator James Cusati-Moyer, the quintet co-wrote and shot an arch body-horror psychodrama using a loose premise and a look book heavy on Cries and Whispers imagery. “You’re not supposed to mix Bergman with Beyond Fest,” Ohs jokes.

The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick premiered earlier this month at South by Southwest, ushering in what could be a big year for Ohs and Harris. Ohs had edited the documentary Slave Play. Not a Movie. A Play., and Harris was attracted to his fluid Mike Leigh–ish filmmaking process, which he’d also employed on the similarly microbudget indies Jethica and Everything Beautiful Is Far Away (the latter starring Julia Garner). So they decided to make one themselves. What resulted is a chamber piece about a dispirited urbanite named Yvonne (Chao) who retreats to a country house where her friend (Hernandez) is residing with a couple (Harris and Cusati-Moyer) who rattle off crunchy platitudes about mugwort, organic produce, and the restorative power of a sunrise.

The film runs a lean 80 minutes, dipping into Get Out and Rosemary’s Baby territory as Yvonne begins to doubt — and then reluctantly embrace — the eeriness of her roommates’ rustic nonchalance. When Yvonne discovers a tick bite on her upper back one morning, the others assure her it’s nothing a little clove oil or black walnut can’t fix. The hallmark of The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick is the sense of dread that mounts while Yvonne grows more and more susceptible to a figment of utopia built on wellness pseudoscience. Any city dweller knows what it’s like to make a brief escape to greener pastures, but what happens when that exodus becomes an entire doxycycline-agnostic lifestyle?

Ohs and his cast originally intended to make a sexier movie, but they were operating under SAG’s Micro-Budget Project Agreement, which prohibits nudity and simulated sex on productions costing less than $20,000. Around that time, Harris had been hanging out with wealthy fashion types who would casually reference their tick-induced Lyme disease — the same condition that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alumna Yolanda Hadid once compared to HIV. Ohs created a loose outline satirizing the sometimes–galaxy-brained wellness industry that’s reportedly worth upwards of $6 billion. In the Berkshires, he and the cast used a shared Notes-app page to write dialogue as the shoot unfolded, working their way toward an 11th-hour twist. They went to Goodwill to pick out costumes and lived together in the rental house seen in Tick, cooking, cleaning, and checking one another for bites in ways that mirrored their characters’ behavior.

“It does match my own writing in some ways because I like to take a bold swing at the start and not know where I’m gonna end up,” Harris told Vulture at the W Austin hotel during SXSW. “I didn’t know what the third act was. What I did know was that I wanted to start off that first scene of Slave Play the way you see it. I wanted it to be like, Where the fuck are they? And then, at some point, you were going to realize they were in group therapy with this weird sex that we’re seeing.”

Harris and Ohs, having encountered Charli XCX around 3 a.m. at the Lower East Side bar Clandestino about a month before Brat came out, made Erupcja that way, too. It’s one of several forthcoming roles for Charli, a cinephile who, according to Harris, bumps Criterion titles left and right. (Her other future club classics include Gregg Araki’s first film in 11 years, a Faces of Death remake, and an A24 pop-star mockumentary that she originated.) But whereas Tick was made in isolation, Erupcja (which does not yet have a release date or distributor) roves through Warsaw, hence why news of the production leaked last August. People who enjoyed Charli’s hyperclubby Grammys performance in February (and pretty much everything she has done in the past year) might be surprised to learn that she wanted to play against type here. She’s portraying a shy tourist modeled off a famous indie-rock friend of hers.

“She met Pete, they talked about movies, and she was like, ‘I’ll do one,’” Harris says. “That’s literally how it happened. It wasn’t about calling managers and agents. She was like, ‘This feels like making an album.’ But, also, Pete gives you the platform to play something you’ve never played before. I came to Tick, and I was like, ‘I’m on Emily in Paris, and I’m always playing big and brash with the loudest costumes.’ The lowest-energy thing I can play is really funny for me. I think the experience for Charli was, I’ve been playing Charli XCX for so long now. What would it be like to play this new person?”",vulture
https://vulture.com,Is Netflix’s Adolescence Based on Real Adolescents?,https://www.vulture.com/article/is-netflix-adolescence-based-on-a-true-story.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 02:27:47 GMT","Photo: Courtesy of Netflix

Adolescence opens with a dramatic arrest: 13-year-old Jamie (Owen Cooper) is accused of stabbing his classmate, Katie, to death. The four-part British series — which dropped on Netflix on March 13 and topped the streaming platform’s most-watched show list that weekend, according to the BBC — already has famous fans. Paul Feig praised the first episode as “one of the best hours of television” he’s ever seen, while Jeremy Clarkson joined viewers in expressing amazement and confusion over the show’s use of a drone in the second episode. (Every episode of Adolescence is shot in one continuous take.) But it’s not just the technology that the internet is curious about. Many people online are also wondering whether this crime drama is a work of true-crime. Andrew Tate is name-dropped, and he’s real whether we like it or not — but is the main murder plot of this series also based in reality? Below, what co-creator and star Stephen Graham has said about the inspiration behind Adolescence.

Does Jamie have a real-life counterpart?

Not directly. Jamie’s story itself is not based on a specific person or event, but per Birmingham Live, Graham noted that real reports of knife crime did give him the idea for what the series would be about. “I’d read an article in the paper about a young boy stabbing a young girl, and it made me feel a bit cold,” he said. “Then about three of four months later, there was a piece on the news about a young boy who’d stabbed a young girl.”

He told Tudum that learning about that first stabbing “shocked” him and made him wonder what was going on in society. “And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again,” he recalled. “I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, ‘Why is this happening today? What’s going on? How have we come to this?’ ”

So, youth knife attacks are a concern in the U.K.?

Yes, and increasingly so. Graham told The Hollywood Reporter that there is an “epidemic of knife crime amongst young, young lads … up and down the country.” According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of knife attacks in England and Wales has almost doubled in the past 10 years. Meanwhile, Ministry of Justice data for the year ending in March 2023 shows that 17.3% of the roughly 18,500 cautions and convictions made for possession of a knife or offensive weapon were offenders ages 10 to 17.

Adolescence’s release follows the January sentencing of an 18-year-old to at least 52 years in prison for killing three young girls last summer at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in Southport when he was 17. The series was “conceived and written months before” that attack, according to Entertainment Weekly, but the subject material unfortunately continues to feel timely. The Official for National Statistics reported in February that 83% of teenage homicide victims in England and Wales were stabbed to death during the year ending in March 2024; according to the BBC, the data showed that teens were more likely to be killed with a sharp instrument over any other age group. As recently as last week, an 18-year-old was sentenced to at least 23 years in prison for fatally stabbing a 15-year-old girl in London when he was 17.

Do we know anything about the inspiration for Jamie’s parents?

Graham has not named any specific direct inspirations, but he has said that his own reaction to knife attacks shaped the way that Jamie’s parents, played by himself and Christine Tremarco, is portrayed in the series. He told The Hollywood Reporter that people “blame the mom and dad” when they hear this type of news involving kids from “council estates,” or British public housing. He admitted that he himself is sometimes “guilty” of falling into this line of thinking. However, he told Rolling Stone UK and Drama Quarterly that questioning that initial instinct made him decide to focus on what was happening with Jamie and not have the parents be violent or alcoholics. “I wanted the dad to be a hardworking man,” Graham noted, “the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, six in the morning and not get home till 8 o’clock at night, Monday to Friday.”

And was that an Andrew Tate reference?

Yup. Much to the displeasure of some of his fans, Adolescence name-drops self-proclaimed misogynist and far-right star Andrew Tate when a detective brings up the potential role of the involuntary celibacy subculture. In GQ, Graham credited co-writer and co-creator Jack Thorne for coming up with the “incel stuff” in the series and doing research about online radicalization.

Meanwhile, Graham first learned about Tate through his kids. “I was looking online at a workout thing that our [son] Alfie sent me, and it was a good workout,” he told Rolling Stone UK. “Three or four days later, the algorithm — which I don’t understand — showed me the same gentleman again, and he was telling me his misogynistic opinions and views.” In his GQ interview, Graham added that his daughter Grace was the one who then identified Tate and explained who he was. “And then I thought, Well, I’m a semi-put-together 51-year-old man who knows a little bit of who I am and what I’m about,” he said. “So what if I was a 13-year-old boy who didn’t have the greatest relationship with my father, didn’t really have that solid connection with a role model, and was finding my feet out there?”",vulture

No one wants to be a teen again. How could they? It’s an unnerving, seemingly never-ending time of immense social pressure, roller-coaster hormones, and incredible self-doubt. You feel simultaneously alone and under constant supervision, and the littlest slight or kindness can send you into a mental spiral.

And, God, to be in a school full of teens? No thanks. It seemed bad enough when I went in the late ’90s, when there were parties and cliques and whatever else. But today? With phones, social media, backbiting, and “Are you even my friend if you don’t comment on my Story” stuff? Unthinkable.

It’s not something that DIs Bascombe and Frank are thinking when they go to visit Jamie and Katie’s school, even though it also happens to be the school that Bascombe’s son, Adam, attends. As adults, they think they get how high school works, with bullying and teachers and whatever, but it becomes quickly apparent that they don’t get it at all. They might think they have Jamie dead to rights (and they do, in some sense), but as soon as they question Katie’s friend Jade and almost instantly provoke her into flying off the handle, you realize they’re in over their heads.

Thankfully, Adam’s there to help his dad, finding him to explain the intricate and hairy world of emoji codes. Bascombe and Frank asked Jamie if he and Katie were friends and got a sort of noncommittal affirmative in the previous episode, but people like Adam and Jade make it quickly known that, in fact, they were not. Katie thought Adam was an incel, a red-pilled member of the internet misogynist Andrew Tate’s manosphere. The cops take that to mean she was bullying him, and while that’s certainly possible — calling someone out on social media, via emoji or not, is pretty shitty — I get the feeling we haven’t truthfully discovered the whole story yet. What did Jamie do to make Katie think that about him?

And how were Jamie’s friends involved? At the very least, Ryan knew what was going on, given that he gave Jamie the knife. (Side note: Asking “Did you help him get the knife?” is a weird question considering it’s a kitchen knife. Who would have trouble getting one? I’ve got eight in my knife block right now.) Moreover, who else knew? Were the teachers complicit in their ignorance? Could they claim to be as overwhelmed as Mr. Malik? What role did bullies like Fredo and that shitty kid in the front row of 8G play, and did all that screaming and screen time just serve to exacerbate everything? Could the teachers have done more to protect Katie and all the girls? Or maybe they should have protected the boys and educated them about adult social relationships rather than leaving it to their parents, most of which have to be just as clueless as Bascombe and Frank.

It’s all truly just nightmare fuel. What goes on in our kids’ schools while we’re not watching? On their phones? Do we really know as much as we think we know, and are teenage secrets still okay? At the end of the episode, we see Bascombe trying to reestablish a relationship with his son, who he says barely talks to him. It seems to work … for today, at least, with the pair jetting off for some Chinese-restaurant chips. Adolescence wants us to think that these types of problems can be solved by really, openly talking to our kids. That may be true, but I’m pretty sure that, sadly, it will take more than just this show to get us parents up and moving in that direction.

Stray Observations

• Two things that I thought were well said in this episode. First, Bascombe tells Ryan, “It’s crazy what your brain tells you to do when you’re a kid.” Second was Frank’s assertion that kids just need one person — a teacher, a parent, a friend — to tell them that they’re normal and they’re supported. Ideally, they’ll have more, but it really is amazing and important to have that one person. (And that’s why I’m also incredibly worried about Jade now.)

• I love how Adam knows about red pills and blue pills but has no idea that they’re from The Matrix.

• While the British criminal-justice system seemed pretty all right in episode one, this school failed to make me jealous of the British educational system. However, the uniforms were cute. And they had a tennis court!",vulture
https://vulture.com,Adolescence Series-Premiere Recap: We Need to Talk About Jamie,https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-recap-episode-1-netflix.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:11:07 GMT","Adolescence Episode 1 Season 1 Episode 1 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * Previous Next » « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Courtesy of Netflix

When you become a parent, you enter a new world of worries. Is my baby being too quiet? Are they breathing? Is my kid talking when they should, walking when they should, reading when they should? Do they have enough friends? Are they a good friend? A good student? A good global citizen?

What you hope you never, ever, ever have to worry about is the subject of Netflix’s new series, Adolescence. The four-part British crime drama tells the (fictional) story of Jamie Miller, a 13-year-old suburban boy who’s ripped from bed in the morning, accused of murdering a classmate. Created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham — who also plays Jamie’s dad, Eddie — the show is an emotional gut punch, aided by the fact that each episode is shot in real time in one take.

When the premiere opens, it’s with idle cop chitchat. It’s about their kids and their lives, and it makes things extra jarring when, a minute or so later, we follow them as they burst into the Miller family home. It’s 6 a.m., and they’ve taken the family by surprise. Jamie’s so shocked he pees his pants while his teen sister cowers in the bathroom doorway. Mom and Dad are more confused than anything, wondering why their barely teenage son, a kid who still has a space-themed bedroom, is being charged with murder.

And for a while, as a viewer, you wonder that too. Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, is perfectly cast. With a smattering of freckles across a face that you know has never seen the sharp side of a razor, Cooper looks barely old enough to have armpit hair. He’s stuck somewhere between childhood and adulthood; if you let yourself, you can remember how weird that time felt. The heightened emotions and the sullen chatter. The slouching and the shame you might get if you cried as Jamie does in the police van on the way to the station.

How could this boy commit murder? And if he did, does he really deserve this very adult treatment? This questioning by these very adult, very business-y cops? This cell just across from some very belligerent grown-ass man? There must have been a reason, or maybe the cops got it wrong. Maybe this is a story about how some kid gets railroaded.

Except, as we learn when Jamie sits for an interview, fresh off a medical exam and meeting with his lawyer and “appropriate adult” father, he seems to have very much committed the crime he’s accused of, following and then stabbing a classmate named Katie with a kitchen knife. He’s insistent that he didn’t do it, but the cops have photos and CCTV video of the whole incident, which stemmed from a confrontation in a parking garage, a shove and then a sneak attack. It’s horrific, and, somehow, it’s Jamie. The sweet boy we knew, who’s wearing a sweatshirt that’s much too big and who just learned about the Industrial Revolution, has killed some other parent’s sweet, sweet kid.

We’re not sure why yet — even Jamie doesn’t seem like he knows, considering he’s still denying the whole thing or at least asserting that he “didn’t do anything wrong” — but it’s clear that’s to come. Jamie’s dad crumbles like we do, his world and his family destroyed by his own kid, who has just made a life-ruining mistake.

It’s tough to want to push forward from here, except in search of the “why.” But Adolescence is so well-made and compelling that it’s hard not to go on. There probably won’t be good answers, ultimately, but there will be good TV, and maybe that’s enough for now.

Stray Observations

• The cops in Adolescence keep their lives so insanely compartmentalized that it’s downright disturbing. They’re borderline aggressive and awful to Jamie, which seems harsh, but then you realize that they were also the ones who had to break the news to Katie’s parents. The cops know the destruction Jamie wrought, whether intentionally or not, and I have to think that if I were them, I’d be pretty damn pissed off too.

• Eddie says he thinks he’s a good dad but the lack of physical contact between him and Jamie gives me pause. I’m sure that it’s a sort of “you’re a man” type thing, but when your son is clearly shaken to the core, you’d think you could give him a hug. Appreciate him yelling for Jamie to “eat [his] cornies,” but I would have liked a little softness even more.

• Prior to Adolescence, the last show I reviewed for Vulture was Missing You, which also came out on Netflix, stars Ashley Walters, and is insanely depressing. I must be a glutton for punishment.

https://vulture.com,The Bachelor Recap: An Adventurous Wife,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-bachelor-recap-season-29-fantasy-suites-week.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:23:51 GMT","The Bachelor Fantasy Suites Week Season 29 Episode 8 Editor’s Rating 2 stars * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Anne Marie Fox/Disney

This is a pretty gloomy episode of The Bachelor, especially for Fantasy Suites Week! Is anyone having fun? (Litia is). Is anyone getting what they want out of this process? (Litia is). Is this going to turn out well for anyone involved? (No, not even for Litia. That is my prediction now.)

There’s a lot going wrong here: A lack of any real sexual chemistry between Grant and the ladytestants; Grant saying “I love you” completely unprompted; production giving Zoe the absolute worst date. But for me, what is such an absolute bummer is Grant continuing to objectify the women. Now, he’s not objectifying them by talking about their bodies or how sexy they are; and maybe a little bit of that would be helpful, even, to show us chemistry between Grant and the top three. No, I mean that he keeps referring to them as “a wife” or “a mother,” reducing them to the role they’ll play in his life. Where is “partner”? Or “girlfriend”? Or “Sugarlips”? The most egregious instance is when he says, “When I saw Zoe with her friends and family, I saw a wife.” Zoe was transported to another plane of existence, and she became A Wife. Grant has not said anything meaningful or specific about any of the women except where they rank on the A Wife scale.

The other quality all the women have to display by the episode’s end is “adventurousness.” The x-axis is Wife and the y-axis is Adventurous. So let’s see how each woman ranks on the Adventurous-Wife Scale.

We’re in the Dominican Republic! This episode looks like it was edited by the team behind Fast & Furious! We get a backstory drop on Grant in the first five minutes: He’s part Dominican, his grandma was from there, he played basketball there for three years. And oh, right, he’s trying to figure out who his wife is going to be. He doesn’t know! It’s like Grant is playing a game of The Traitors called The Wife in which one of the women is secretly his wife and he’s going to banish everyone else.

The first date of the week is Juliana’s. The show is keeping up this “Pairing the women with a former contestant with similar emotional themes” thing, and I would say Juliana’s emotional doppelgänger is Daisy, if Juliana were angling to be the Bachelorette and very ambivalent about the Bachelor. Juliana tells Daisy about the fact that she was cheated on repeatedly in her last relationship and is having trouble opening up or trusting or something. She says she puts up a bubbly front to hide how emotional she is inside. Juliana’s strategy seems to be emotionally white-knuckling her way through the rest of the season. Daisy tells her that she has no regrets. Easy to have no regrets when you ended up with Terrible Herbst the Fourth.

There are no run-and-jumps on any of these dates! Have we rejected tradition? Instead, Juliana and Grant are going four-wheeling, and Juliana needs a lot of validation that Grant likes her hair after it was in a helmet. I think Juliana is secretly in the lead because neither of them have doubts about each other. And he can see her as Wife, and she’s Adventurous. So if she needs to be told her bangs still look cute after being in a helmet, that’s fine. Grant also says that things in a relationship are going to be rough but that they’re going to be there to help each other through it. That’s what love is. That brings our “That’s what love is” counter to 1.

Time for the evening portion of the date. You might think there would be some drama about Juliana feeling insecure that the other women are also there. Nope, that doesn’t happen. You might think there would be some drama about Juliana feeling insecure that her and Grant haven’t said “I love you” yet. Nope. None of that. Is there any drama or forward momentum? No!!!!!!!!! Part of the reason is we’ve heard some of this information about Juliana’s past relationship before and Grant offers so little about himself or his past relationships that there’s nothing to latch on to. The only interesting thing Grant says is “That’s what love is for. It fixes you.” And RED FLAG! RED FLAG!!! I don’t know how much more ink can be spilled on the amount of inner-child work Grant needs to do, but holy fucking smokes.

Grant says that the moment today when her hair was all messed up and she didn’t even know she was beautiful was so important, and he’s ready to take the lead. He sees her heart and he’s falling in love with her. Information we already heard. They get the Fantasy Suite card, and as the door closes, Juliana says “Oooh, spicy!”

The next morning, Juliana has a level of calm and peace that I haven’t seen outside of the spa at the Four Seasons. He totally told her she was making it to the next week, right? When Grant leaves, she calls him “Mr. Ellis” and says, “Bye, boyfriend!” She’s really trying to get that shit over. She dips her cute little toes in the pool on her balcony and allows the dark thoughts to come flooding back in.

It’s Zoe’s turn! Guys. Who let this happen? This date shouldn’t have happened for so many reasons. Chief among them: They don’t know each other! These are two strangers. Also, the filming this season was two weeks shorter, so there is an alternate universe where Zoe got a one-on-one date, and who knows if she would have made it to Fantasy Suites! Right now, it seems like Grant stacked the deck for his Fantasy Suites week with two people he really, really, really likes … and the hottest person available. Which is a disservice to Zoe because she seems cool! And like someone who may just not be made for reality TV. I said during Hometowns that she and Grant looked really good together, and this episode … they look very awkward together.

Their daytime date is designed to get into Zoe’s head. It’s silent yoga. Are you fucking kidding me? I need Zoe to be a bad bitch and take over the date. This is not the time to actually be silent for the entire yoga session. You have two options: Either say “screw it” and joke and laugh, or go full-on sexy. Remember, ABS: Always Be Straddling. Instead, it seems like the two of them can’t even maintain eye contact for more than 15 seconds. Things are not looking good. (She also met with Rachel before the daytime portion of the date, and you can see it dawn on Rachel how not good this is going for Zoe.)

Zoe keeps saying she wants “the romance and the softness.” She clearly wants to feel like a viable option and wants Grant (and the show) to treat her like a potential romantic partner. And she keeps reiterating she wants a man to see her as deserving of love and then the love will come. During the nighttime portion of the date, we don’t even get to that because Zoe has more pressing questions, like, “What’s your whole fucking deal, dude?” They’re literally still at the “Tell me about yourself” stage and an engagement is supposed to happen next week. My favorite exchange is when Grant tells her that his favorite color is blue and she asks him, “What’s my favorite color?” and he goes “Is it blue?” This is a man who needs his partner to reflect his values and experiences so much that they definitely have the same favorite color, right? NO. WRONG. Her favorite color is teal, which is honestly an insane favorite color choice. Grant tells her about his family history and his dad’s struggle with addiction. Zoe says that those issues are present in her family as well, and they seem to be starting down a road of some compatibility.

Then Grant goes off on his flights of magical thinking and says he wanted to mend his family’s brokenness and be in a family that eats dinner together. He doesn’t really engage with Zoe saying she’s been through similar experiences, and they both pivot into generic TikTok relationship goals: “I’m looking for someone to build an empire with.” Ladies, no you don’t. You want a man who will fold the laundry unprompted.

They head to the Fantasy Suite and … where did their chemistry go? What is happening? At one point, Grant says he admires that she’s a survivor, and I can’t imagine a bigger lady-boner killer than being described as a survivor. Instead of seeing them in bed the next morning, they are heading to a picnic on the beach. The beach? In the morning? Oof. A beach at night? Sexy, romantic, wistful. A beach in the morning? Frigid, uncaring, heartless. You could hold a job interview or an intervention on the beach in the morning. Zoe says they’re ready to build on where they are now, and oh, sweetie.

The show is giving Litia a conflicted winner’s edit, and I’m very interested to see where this goes. She is racing through several different Fantasy Suite Week tropes and dismisses them until she lands on the one she’s going to work with for the rest of the episode. Kaity is there to talk to her about how to manage hearing about the other women, but that doesn’t appear to be an issue this season so that gets put aside. It seems like Litia might be gearing up for an ultimatum if Grant sleeps with anyone else during Fantasy Suites, but that never materializes. Litia ultimately lands on “no sex in the Fantasy Suite,” and I can’t tell if that’s a hard moral boundary or a result of her wanting to hurl on this zip-line date.

Ah yes, the zip-line date. Grant already knows that Litia is Wife. She might be the most Wife out of all the remaining women — but is she Adventurous? The answer is a solid “no,” but Grant mostly ignores that. Litia is about to vomit and/or sue the zip-line company, and Grant is like, “Wow, she’s a trooper!” They head to a cenote and start talking about their future. Grant mentions that his father is in a rehab program in New Jersey, and Litia chimes in, “SO WE CAN MOVE TO NEW YORK?” Listen, my family’s business for basically my entire life has been addiction medicine. My mom ran a treatment center for many years. I don’t think “We’re gonna move to the biggest city near my dad’s rehab” is a thing? I think Litia is treating Grant’s father as if he has a terminal illness and is gearing up for that kind of in-law experience, and while very admirable, it’s not exactly the same as being a full-time caregiver. Grant and Litia just keep saying, “I want you to be happy. No, I want you to be happy” to each other. There’s going to be a lot of self-sacrifice with these two!

It’s time for the evening portion of the date. Grant asks Litia what the next step is, and she says, “Meet your family and get engaged.” She’s watched this show. You can’t trick her. Grant is trying to get a read on how quickly she wants to have kids since everyone in her family told him she was an old crone who needs to be with child. She says her timeline is to have a kid by 33, so she’s got two years. Grant seems a little freaked out by this timeline. He mostly seems like a guy who has never really thought about the fact that it gets harder for women to get pregnant as they get older and was really asking if she wanted to go to Japan or Brazil after they get engaged. They get the Fantasy Suite card, and it sounds like Litia is going to say “no,” but she just wants to say “no physical intimacy.” Grant says he respects that and it shows maturity to not build their foundation on sex and then he says, “I do love you.”

Yeah. Okay. Sure. She says it back, and they head to the Fantasy Suites floating on air. I don’t have time to unpack whatever relationship gibberish Grant was spouting about sex as something that can get in the way of a foundation for a relationship. Because the next morning, Grant looks positively shook. It seems like the reality of telling Litia that he loves her is sinking in, and he says, “Should I stop now and pick Litia? What am I gonna doooo?” And he’s very confused about this. He’s panicking about how to manage the multiple feelings he’s feeling.

Time for the rose ceremony. We all know how this is going to go down. Zoe is eliminated, and Grant tells her how hard this has all been on him. Zoe does a better job complimenting him and telling him he’s going to find someone special. GRANT. PLEASE.

Then I thought my DVR had somehow traveled forward in time and started the finale episode. But no! It’s time to meet Grant’s family!

https://vulture.com,Below Deck Down Under Recap: Fizzling Out,https://www.vulture.com/article/below-deck-down-under-recap-season-3-episode-7.html,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:00:30 GMT","It’s starting to feel like Groundhog Day on the Katina. At least since episode five, the same “conflicts” have recurred without escalating in any significant way. Wihan doesn’t want to work. The deck crew brings up dinner for the guests half-naked. Tzarina delusionally chases Wihan’s attention. Adair seems so lost it’s like she wandered onto the boat by accident. I thought Alesia’s arrival might stir things up, but as it turns out, so far, she’s been nothing but a lovely team player and a stable presence to Tzarina’s chaotic methods. Also, she is the sole reason why this episode is getting four stars from me.

Gossip and confrontation are the pillars of good reality television writ large, but what makes a great season of Below Deck is more specific and somewhat counter-intuitive. It helps the show when the crew is tight — we saw this last season after the Devil (Luke) and his fork (Laura) left. One of the joys of watching the crew work together is to commiserate with them about the general loathsomeness of entitled rich guests. By the time they get a couple of days off, we almost feel as if we, too, have earned the break. Watching a good Below Deck cast is like having a really cold beer after a really long day; or like sending your best friend a three-minute voice memo about all the shit that happened at work that day. It’s soothing because it’s a way to exorcize the demons that have been lodged into your soul by a job. At its strongest, Below Deck speaks directly to that instinct. When that appeal starts fizzling out like Bri and Harry’s lukewarm relationship, our engagement also begins to drag.

Maybe Alesia will save this season from total boredom. In the morning after their first night out, Johnny says more to her than Harry has over the entire course of his semi-relationship with Bri. With a humble dignity that is rarely demonstrated by any male member of a deck team, he apologizes if his move made Alesia uncomfortable. In a confessional, we learn that Alesia is not officially trained as a chef but is hoping to learn on the job, which is enough to ensure she won’t try to dominate the kitchen like Anthony. For her part, Tzarina is already better at being a head of department: she doesn’t ask Alesia to list her weaknesses, and she clearly communicates her expectations that the sous will take on crew food and help clean up.

In the light of morning, the boatmance landscape looks unchanged: Lara facepalms when Wihan tells her that he kissed Tzarina even after telling her that he is interested in Adair. Bri tells Marina that she is reaching her last rope with Harry: if he doesn’t demonstrate more urgency and interest, things could quickly go south. She later tells Lara the same thing, which ends up being great for Harry — Lara warns him that he should step up if he wants things to progress between them, resulting in a nice text exchange that raises the heart rate from 50 to 60 bpm. Tzarina concludes that she and Wihan are nothing more than “flirty friends” who “shouldn’t drink around each other,” knowing full well they will continue to drink around each other for the next several weeks. The only real development occurs on the deck when Wihan tentatively tells Adair he likes her. The confession takes Adair by surprise, though it doesn’t exactly sweep her off her feet. She tells us Wihan is not really her type. She likes a man who drives a lifted truck when Wihan has a Mini Cooper.

It would be nothing but beneficial for Wihan’s ego to be swiftly shot down. Though it seems like she has better chemistry with Johnny, with whom she’s always laughing and goofing around, Adair doesn’t reject Wihan definitively: she tells him there’s time yet. Taking her tentativeness as encouragement, Wihan leaves his deck team working while he stalks to the nearby hotel to write Adair a love letter, which nearly made me choke on my chicken salad sandwich. He comes back to the boat just in time to help with provisions, which he does only kind of, leaving most of the lifting and running up and down the dock for Lara.

As they get ready for the incoming guests to arrive, Lara puts Marina on housekeeping for the third consecutive charter, even though Marina has more experience as a stew than Bri. This might emerge as a point of conflict between the two of them later, but as of now, Marina is a good sport and doesn’t say anything. The crew goes to change into their whites, and as Wihan tells Harry about the letter he wrote for Adair, Lara mentions to Tzarina that she never sees Wihan working — another heroic effort by the editing team to defame Wihan’s reputation.

The guests finally arrive: Caroline Buck, a trial attorney and philanthropist, is on girls vacation with the rest of Kappa Delta Gamma. They look like fun gals with enormous potential to be obnoxious. Perhaps unaware that requesting “local cuisine night” is just a more involved way of ordering Tzarina’s World Famous curry, they ask for the first night’s dinner theme to be “Seychelles Islands.” The stews all wear nice floral dresses, and Lara cooks up a scheme for the deck crew in which with every course they will shed another piece of clothing, so that by the end of dinner, they’ll be serving dessert in nothing but a pair of silver hot pants with a palm leaf hot-glued to it. When Lara pushes Wihan on why no one is available to help her set up the sundeck, or why it seems like the deck team relaxes more than they work, he tells her that he’s in a tough spot with Adair, because if she helps interiors too much, the rest of the crew will “start taking the piss out of that.” But isn’t Adair supposed to help both departments? Don’t the boys know that?

Amazingly, Wihan then pulls Johnny and Adair aside to tell them that if Lara starts encroaching too much, his advice is for them to “not stand around” and look like they’re doing nothing — in other words, to pretend to be busy. What he doesn’t seem to take into consideration is that other members of his team are harder workers than he is; Johnny tells him simply that he doesn’t mind helping in the interior or anywhere. Johnny tells us that Johnny doesn’t care who is right between Lara and Wihan. “Let’s keep the fun going, let’s keep the money flowing,” he proselytizes, in a line more beautiful than anything Wihan came up with.

To Tzarina’s credit, tonight’s first course is non-liquid, a salt-baked red snapper with mango salad that actually looks delectable. While the guests enjoy their dinner, Adair helps Marina with the cabins, having learned from last week’s blunder. They chat about Adair’s type. At first Marina is amused by the fact that Adair describes it as “redneck,” but then she’s just concerned. Whatever her type is, it’s definitely not Wihan in hot pants, through which Adair says she can see “inner thigh hair.” Her questionable taste in men notwithstanding, Adair is pretty funny, and it’s kind of bizarre that for someone so central to the season’s dominating plot, we barely know her at all. I wish there was a way to fact-check this, but for my money she has gotten the least amount of screen time out of everyone aboard, Jason’s fish included.

The guests are all happy with the food, but Wihan appears less happy with each layer of clothing the deck crew sheds. His unhappiness is a little confusing, since he was the one rallying Johnny and Harry to degrade themselves in order to increase their tip prospects. I’m of two minds on this because while it’s obvious, as Harry points out, that Wihan’s grumpiness has nothing to do with taking his clothes off — it’s clear to everyone that he loves attention and wearing a speedo in front of guests ranks among the tamest things he’s done to entertain them — I have to agree with him that having the deck crew serve dinner half-naked every charter is getting old and gross. Bottom line, though, Wihan’s annoyance has to do with the fact that he feels bossed around by Lara, who is supposed to be his equal, not his superior.

Talking about this with Harry, Wihan gets pretty worked up — or so I thought until I realized what he was really fretting over was how he was going to get his love letter to Adair. When he slid it under Adair’s cabin door, my whole body cringed so hard it basically folded onto itself in ways I had previously thought unimaginable. “Stop it,” Marina laughs as soon as she sees the note. Somehow Adair manages to read the whole thing with a straight face, and when Marina comes into the cabin demanding gossip later, Adair doesn’t give away much: she basically only says that the note was sweet. I have a feeling that Adair is probably just a nice person who doesn’t want to embarrass anyone on national television, but if that’s true, Bravo is just not the place for her. In the morning, when she sees Wihan, she thanks him with a tight hug and promises to talk more later, which makes him very happy.

Meanwhile, Lara and Tzarina realize that Wihan spent all his time trying to be Rimbaud and no time organizing the guests’ morning excursion. They are scheduled to go on a bike ride to a tortoise sanctuary, ending the trip with a paradisiacal beach picnic. Earlier in the bridge, Jason had shown Wihan the itinerary, putting him in charge of the day’s activities. But when Lara and Tzarina ask him difficult questions such as “what time are we leaving” and “what time do you expect they will be ready to have lunch,” Wihan wings the answers. He estimates the guests will be at the beach by noon, but at 11:45, they’ve only just made it to the tortoise sanctuary. It seems like a really nice time — the tortoises are old and cute, and we meet one fine, 114-year-old specimen named David — but the lack of communication between the bike riders and the beach crew creates a problem. As Adair had expected, the radios don’t work from that far away, so Lara is unable to communicate to Tzarina that they will be late for lunch, and Bri is unable to get ahold of Lara to ask where the hell they are. It’s a mystery why they don’t use their cellphones, but either way, it sends a chill down my spine to see all that food cooking in the sun, getting slimy and sweaty and swarmed with flies. In next week’s preview, we see that Lara and Tzarina have taken it upon themselves to talk with Wihan, which probably means the picnic was a disaster.

But the reason for my fourth star and this episode’s best moment happens on the boat while the guests are out. Having decided that the thing to do is present Adair with a cheese board, then a hug, then a whisper in her ear (creepy), Wihan descends to the kitchen to ask the sous chef to make said cheese board for him. Instead of immediately agreeing to a service that has nothing to do with the guests, or with her job at all, Alesia lays out a line of questioning. Has Wihan asked Adair out already? “Was she not slightly put off by the fact that you’ve gone through half the crew?” For me, this moment was like if your team scored a winning home run in the ninth inning of the World Series. Not satisfied, Alesia tells Wihan he can make a cheese board himself if he’d like — she’s busy, not that Wihan can fathom the concept. Sometimes all it takes to put a man in his place is a 25-year-old with an attitude. I hope she never changes.",vulture

Are you looking for a good buy? Do you need a crowdpleaser? An indie gem? An awards contender? Look no further than this year’s just-wrapped SXSW Film & TV Festival, which touts all these sorts of films (and more!), all open for the asking price of, well, we’ll leave the actual business-ing to you.

As for recommendations for those potential buys? We’ve got them in spades. While SXSW is best known for its bombastic crowdpleasers that, alas, already have a home (we’re looking at you, “Another Simple Favor,” “Drop,” and “The Accountant 2”), for every one of those big names, there are a wealth of other titles worthy of their own cinematic homes.

From Matthew McConaughey’s first starring role in years to searing documentaries, new offerings from some of our favorite filmmakers and calling cards from rising stars, this year’s batch of undistributed titles is big, and we’ve got a few favorites we’re dying to spotlight.

If you’re looking for more of our SXSW coverage, you can find it all right here, including a look at some of our early favorites and awards winners, both from the juries and the fest’s audience members. This list will be updated as (hopefully) these great titles find and announce their new homes.

https://indiewire.com,"Barry Levinson Has Steered Some Great Performances, but Directing Two Robert De Niros at Once Is Something Else",https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/barry-levinson-robert-de-niro-the-alto-knights-1235104520/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:30:00 GMT","Ever since he directed Robert Redford to one of his richest, most compelling performances in “The Natural,” Barry Levinson has had a knack for bringing out the best in iconic movie stars. Warren Beatty (“Bugsy”), Dustin Hoffman (“Rain Man,” “Sleepers,” “Wag the Dog”), Robin Williams (“Good Morning, Vietnam”), and Michael Douglas and Demi Moore (“Disclosure”), among many others, have done some of their finest work for Levinson in movies that capitalize on their strengths but provide opportunities to deepen and broaden their personas.

Even in this company, the relationship between Levinson and Robert De Niro is special. Since they first worked together on “Sleepers” in 1996, Levinson and De Niro have created a series of indelible characters, from the spin doctor of “Wag the Dog” and the beleaguered producer of “What Just Happened?” to real-life fraudster Bernie Madoff in “The Wizard of Lies.” These were all just a warm-up, however, for Levinson and De Niro’s latest collaboration “The Alto Knights” — a movie that contains two great De Niro performances for the price of one.

In “The Alto Knights,” De Niro plays both Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, crime bosses who grew up as friends but ended as rivals whose conflicts reshaped organized crime in the 1950s. Levinson credits producer Irwin Winkler with the idea of casting De Niro in both roles, but notes that it felt like an organic outgrowth of the true story screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi (returning to the milieu he immortalized in “GoodFellas”) was telling.

“I thought the idea of Bob playing both parts was intriguing, and certainly challenging,” Levinson told IndieWire. “Because as childhood friends they’re similar, and then they begin to grow apart and different sensibilities evolve. One is aggressive, a fast talker, and the other is more deliberate. Bob was very meticulous about shaping those rhythms and ultimately finding two distinctive looks.”

For each scene in which Costello and Genovese interact, Levinson had to plan his shots so that they would feel credible to an audience — in other words, to present the action the same way he would if it were two actors, neither employing showy tricks nor avoiding shots with both characters sharing the frame for logistical ease. Some of the most impressive blocking in “The Alto Knights,” as in a scene where Costello and Genovese meet in a candy store and are introduced together in an elaborately choreographed tracking shot, is barely noticeable on first viewing because it’s so organic.

“You have to plot those out, and then you basically have two days to shoot each scene,” Levinson said. “You shoot one side and then you shoot the other side, and Bob had an actor that he worked with anytime he had one of those scenes, because he didn’t just want a script supervisor feeding him lines. He wanted a really good actor that he could play off of to help his reactions.”

For Levinson, the key to his partnership with De Niro is their shared willingness to listen to each other rather than enter each scene with a predetermined notion of how to execute it. “It’s not, ‘You’ve got to do it this way,'” Levinson said. “It’s, ‘This is what we want to accomplish. What’s the best way to do it?’ Sometimes it comes out in a way I might not have thought of. Bob and I will go in with certain ideas but you explore and you go, wait a minute, there’s something interesting here — let’s explore that. You don’t want to be rigid. There has to be a certain kind of elasticity to explore the possibilities of any given scene.”

Throughout the process, Levinson was struck by how committed De Niro was to those possibilities, and by the actor’s refusal to rest on his laurels. “He’s got every imaginable accolade that you can have as one of the great actors, but he does not just let up and go through the motions,” Levinson said. “We spent days going over and refining every scene, just tweaking the language and the different rhythms between the two characters. He just works and works at it, with incredible commitment — and then he finds a way and it just comes out and looks like he made it all up.”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,NATO — The National Association of Theatre Owners — Has a New Name: Cinema United,https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/national-association-theatre-owners-new-name-cinema-united-1235104584/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:38:32 GMT","Outside of film business circles (and even sometimes in them), the acronym NATO refers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the transnational military alliance between 32 countries committed to maintaining the post-WWII world order. But for that niche group of people who make a big deal of going to CinemaCon in Vegas every April, NATO is the National Association of Theatre Owners. But now no one needs to be confused.

NATO, the cinema trade group which represents movie theaters across the country, is changing its name to Cinema United, NATO…er…Cinema United president Michael O’Leary told the Associated Press on Tuesday. O’Leary, who took over the post last year after former president John Fithian stepped down, said the trade group was in need of a rebrand and also conceded that getting phone calls about Ukraine was getting a little old.

The rebrand also comes with a new tagline: Moviegoing Is Our Mission.

Cinema United represents the 32,000 screens in the U.S. and another 30,000 screens across 88 countries, and that encapsulates not just the “Theatre Owners” of NATO but also the employees at those movie theaters, so the name change was fitting for yet another reason.

Beginning March 31, Cinema United is bringing together the folks who represent all those screens for CinemaCon, which is the annual convention in which the studios show off their upcoming theatrical slates to entice those theater owners to book their movies on their screens. O’Leary and company will surely take the occasion to echo the rallying cry of Sean Baker during the Oscars about putting movies into theaters (“Anora” is one of the lowest-grossing Best Picture winners ever), but it will also raise awareness about ways in which to help theaters recover.

After a few weak weekends in a row and a disappointing run for some major tentpoles like “Captain America: Brave New World,” the domestic box office for the year is now slightly off pace from where it was last year. To combat that, Cinema United will tout some of its recent promotions, including a commitment of $2.2 billion among cinemas to upgrade tech and install improvements and other amenities, as well as specialty weekends nationwide that will offer discounts on concessions to certain groups like families or couples celebrating date night.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Rachel Zegler Says ‘White Executives’ Asked Her to ‘Prove’ Her Latin Heritage for ‘West Side Story’ Role,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/rachel-zegler-prove-latin-heritage-west-side-story-1235104670/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:00:00 GMT","Rachel Zegler is recalling how landing her “West Side Story” lead role included “proving” her Latin heritage.

Zegler, who is now starring as the titular princess in “Snow White,” told Allure that her breakout turn as María in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” had some “confusion” in the casting process. Spielberg wanted the role of María to be played by a Latina actress.

“There’s confusion because I don’t have a single ounce of Latin in my name,” Zegler said. “Having a bunch of white executives have you prove your identity to them…It’s an interesting experience being part of that diaspora in the current climate we live in. But I love being Colombian.”

She added, “When I was in the running for María in ‘West Side Story,’ they kept calling to ask if I was legit. I remember thinking, ‘Do you want me to bring my abuelita in?’ I will. I’ll bring her into the studio if you want to meet her.”

Zegler’s casting in “Snow White” was later criticized due to her being of Latina descent. David Hand, the son of the director of the original 1937 animated film whose late father had the same name, told The Telegraph UK that Walt Disney would be “turning in his grave” over the new “woke” direction of the live feature.

Zegler now told Allure that she hopes the “Snow White” role will help the next generation with racially blind casting.

“The reality is, I was given a chance because I could sing,” Zegler said. “My only prayer for the future of diversity and inclusion is that we invest in and nurture talent no matter what they look like. That’s why it’s so important for the next generation to see movies like ‘Snow White,’ to realize there’s nothing wrong with choosing to do what’s right and that it doesn’t have to be with anger or a clenched fist. Anger can be a powerful emotion, but it doesn’t bring the brightest future. Snow White chooses kindness and still makes change. Power takes many forms. I hope we’ll see a new dawn of kindness and acceptance in the next couple of years. And people don’t see the need to use hate to cause further division.”",indiewire

Aronofsky is circling a new adaptation of Stephen King’s “Cujo,” the horror story about a friendly St. Bernard dog that turns killer and unleashes havoc on a small town. The project is in development at Netflix, and according to THR, which first reported the news, the project could be on the fast track after news of an adaptation was reported just last week.

Aronofsky would direct the film should a deal materialize, but no writer is attached. Roy Lee — who has most recently produced “Companion” but is also behind adaptations of other King projects such as “Salem’s Lot,” the “It” films, and Francis Lawrence’s upcoming “The Long Walk” — is attached to produce.

“Cujo” was a 1981 King novel and was shortly thereafter turned into a 1983 film as directed by Lewis Teague. The film grossed $21 million for Warner Bros.

Up next for Aronofsky is “Caught Stealing,” which is in post-production and is a crime thriller based on books by Charlie Huston about a burned out former baseball player who gets caught up in a world of underground crime in 1990s New York City. The film stars Austin Butler and is being released by Sony.

Back in 2023, Aronofsky was set to direct a biopic on Elon Musk for A24, which is based on a biography by Walter Isaacson, who also wrote the biography about Steve Jobs that Danny Boyle later turned into his 2015 film starring Michael Fassbender. He also directed a film for The Sphere in Las Vegas called “Postcard from Earth.” His last narrative feature film was “The Whale” in 2022, also for A24 and which won an Oscar for Brendan Fraser.",indiewire

Paltrow, who returns to acting with the Josh Safdie-helmed film after five years away from the screen, told Vanity Fair that she actually had no idea what an intimacy coordinator even was prior to working on the A24 film.

“There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator, which I did not know existed,” she said, adding that she told the coordinator at one point, “I was like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on.’”

As Paltrow teased, there were a slew of scenes that did warrant one, though. “I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie,” Paltrow said, citing her onscreen time with “Marty Supreme” co-star Timothée Chalamet. “There’s a lot — a lot.”

Chalamet plays the “other man” to Paltrow’s character, who is wed to a ping pong kingpin (Chalamet is the titular fictional character who is a ping pong champion.)

Paltrow added that at times, though, she and Chalamet also asked the coordinator to “step a little bit back” for certain sequences. “We said, ‘I think we’re good. You can step a little bit back,’ ” Paltrow recalled. “I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but…if someone is like, ‘OK, and then he’s going to put his hand here,’ I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”

As VF included, Paltrow shrugged at simulating sex with Chalamet, and quipped, “I was like, ‘OK, great. I’m 109 years old. You’re 14.’”

Paltrow also couldn’t help but praise the talent of Chalamet, as well as his charismatic charms: She dubbed Oscar-nominated Chalamet a modern day icon. “He’s such a thinking man’s sex symbol,” Paltrow said. “He’s just a very polite, properly raised, I was going to say kid…He’s a man who takes his work really seriously and is a fun partner.”

Paltrow previously said during the “Drew Barrymore Show” that Chalamet was an ideal co-star that also helped ease her nerves about returning to the screen. “He is such a wonderful young man,” she said. “He’s very polite, very talented. Just so nice to be with. I’m really having a good time with him. I’m glad that I put myself, you know, out of…just sort of back into fear a little bit again.”",indiewire

Claude Lelouch‘s 1966 Cannes Palme d’Or (and double) Oscar winner is led by French cinema icons Anouk Aimée (who died last year and strangely was not included in the Oscars’ 2025 In Memoriam segment) and Jean-Louis Trintignant (who died in 2022). The classic romance is now coming back to theaters, in a new restoration, courtesy of Rialto Pictures this April. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for the re-release below.

As IndieWire previously wrote in our ranking of all Cannes Palme d’Or winners: “From director Claude Lelouch comes this 1966 classic — a tender, visually stirring film of rejuvenating love between a widow and a widower: a race-car driver (Jean-Louis Trinignant) and a movie script girl (Anouk Aimee) share a candid romance while balancing the demands of career and parenthood. It’s a touching, realistic look at a burgeoning adult romance, with each participant encumbered by a past tragedy, causing them to proceed delicately. The film is also famous for Francis Lai’s gorgeous, swooning score. Winner of Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay, it’s quite possibly one of the sweetest love stories ever captured on screen.”

In the film, Trintignant plays a widower and racecar driver who is now single after his wife’s suicide. Meanwhile, Aimée’s character is herself a widow, whose husband was a stuntman who died in an accident during a production. They meet at their children’s boarding school in Deauville and form a nervous friendship that eventually turns into romance, all leading to an iconic finale in which Claude Lelouch’s camera (he did the cinematography himself) swirls around the lovers.

The film has been the subject of many homages in cinema and television for the past half century. Recently, Chanel’s black-and-white fall/winter 2024/205 ad featuring Penélope Cruz and Brad Pitt is a direct homage to “A Man and a Woman.”

The new restoration of “A Man and a Woman” opens April 4 at New York’s Film Forum and April 18 in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Royal. Lelouch will appear in person for Q&As in New York.",indiewire

Set along a lively city block, the advertisement sees Pascal whisked from the cold doldrums of his winter existence and dropped into a music-filled fantasia bursting with bright red and yellow flowers. Highlighting the power of these new Air Pods to help escape everyday life, Pascal is seen dancing through the streets and mouthing along to the lyrics, as if part of his own musical. Watch the new commercial below.

Though many are aware of Jonze’s films, including “Being John Malkovich,” “Adaptation,” and “Her,” for which he won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, even more people are likely to have seen his work on the small screen with advertisements that feature talent like Margaret Qualley (Kenzo World), Idris Elba (Squarepace), and FKA Twigs (Apple Homepod). Jonze also recently directed a short music video for Coldplay’s “All My Love” featuring Chris Martin singing alongside a dancing Dick Van Dyke.

Upon release of his 2018 commercial with Twigs, titled “Welcome Home,” Jonze also unveiled a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the short film in AdWeek. Jonze worked on the ad with famed cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, currently busy shooting Christopher Nolan’s latest project, “The Odyssey.” Dancer Ryan Heffington also took part, choreographing Twigs in “Welcome Home,” as well as Qualley in “Kenzo World.” Movement coach Theo Lowe was also involved in the former project too.

“Spike had a great insight to what he wanted in terms of when this movement would play into what was happening in the scene, so it was pretty much blocked out,” said Heffington during the “Welcome Home” behind-the-scenes video, “but we extended some sections, just so we can let the choreography settle a bit more and let the character within that choreography develop and settle and make sense within the story.”

Jonze is a member of the commercial production company MJZ, which also boasts work from directors Craig Gillespie, Harmony Korine, Mike Mills, and Halina Reijn. His new ad, “Someday,” promotes the release of Apple Air Pods 4, featuring active noise cancelling technology.

That’s because both films are formally bold, mind-bending tales about the search for identity.

“Anomalisa” explores Fregoli syndrome, where people appear as the same person in disguise, by marrying distinctive stop-motion designs with stylized action; “The Actor,” by contrast, tackles a variation of amnesia, where people appear as a troupe of actors playing multiple roles, with more dream-like theatricality.

Westlake’s surreal novel, “Memory,” Johnson’s newest film focuses on André Holland as a man who suffers from both long-term and short-term memory loss; he’s trying to get back to New York from a ’50s Midwestern town, but his only anchor in a shifting reality is the woman he befriends played by Gemma Chan. Holland’s continually refreshing blank slate is the story motivation for Passarelli and his team to wrap “The Actor” in a picturesque fog of soft but heightened imagery.

Of course, there is a clear reference point any cinephile might point to for ’50s, picturesque, heightened cinematography that blends all sense of reality and fantasy: Charles Laughton’s “The Night of the Hunter.”

“We really liked how the backgrounds were right up against the stage wall, and we stuck to that look,” Passarelli told IndieWire. “And it was really cool when we have the sky so close to the back wall on main street, and we were playing with forced perspective. Duke and I decided to use our knowledge and skill set from stop-motion and miniatures to fool the eye.”

‘The Actor’ Neon

Johnson and Passarelli looked at many other black-and-white films from the same period, too, in part because Johnson wanted to explore the things that make people feel like they’re in a period film. But all “The Actor’s” stylistic choices arose out of a desire to express the heightened importance and emotions that memories can take on.

“ It started with discussions of our memories in certain places and the further back they go, the more distant and heightened they become,” Passarelli said. “So just imagine if you forgot all those things, and then those memories must seem like the greatest memories ever. He’s almost living in a dream throughout the movie because he knows very little on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. We didn’t ever want the audience to forget that fact as well.”

“The Actor” was filmed in Budapest, where Passarelli shot on the ALEXA SXT cameras with period anamorphic lenses for bending the images around the sides of the artificial-looking sets. With the aid of soft lighting, this constantly put Holland in the spotlight — like an actor. “The thing that kept it balanced and focused was the journey home, and then, all of a sudden, he’s back in rewind,” Passarelli added.

‘The Actor’ Neon

While there are obvious differences between the tannery town that Holland is stuck in and his bohemian Greenwich Village home, the director wanted everything to appear whimsical and detached from reality. The filmmakers achieved this by combining elements of the theater with a TV soap opera that Holland appears in.

For the latter, they gave the appearance of being backstage during the filming of a soap opera in which Holland plays “The Condemned Man,” where the camera follows him closely as he gets more and more disoriented, wandering from one set to another (one of them even turns out to be his New York apartment).

The sense of artifice is present throughout the film. “The Actor” opens in monochrome like a vintage TV show, from the main titles to the violent inciting incident that causes Holland’s amnesia. For the skyline, they even borrowed from “Anamalisa.”

‘The Actor’ Neon

“After we shot everything at Budapest, we went back to [the animated Starburns studio] for just a few pickup shots for the titles with these ‘Anomalisa’ buildings,” said Passarelli. “So I lit it up and had one of our skies from the stop-motion film out there and put little flashes of thunder and rain on the windows. It was fun to take them out of storage for one last hurrah.”

For the scene where Holland and Chan first exchange glances in a movie theater as the only patrons watching the Casper animated short, “Boo Moon” (1954), the director and cinematographer were inspired by Martin Scorsese’s remake of “Cape Fear.”

“We had watched a bunch of different people watching movies in theaters,” Passarelli said. “And we wanted to see their faces very clearly and get that balance of the screen. And, surprisingly, Robert DeNiro’s got this great scene where he’s laughing in a theater [watching ‘Problem Child’], and it’s so well lit. It’s a good beam of light, changing colors, but not too distracting. And we designed something to change colors, and we played our Casper, and it looked great. In just a couple of shots we get their emotions, but then we end on André waking up after he’s passed out. He’s the only one left in the theater and he doesn’t know where he’s at.”

She is an advocate for change in the industry, with a focus on creating healthy on-set environments.

“Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna” is streaming now on Hulu. The death of Halyna Hutchins was a singular tragedy, but the conditions that led to it were anything but unique. Ignoring crew well-being, prioritizing budgets and schedules over safety, and pushing people past their limits happens every day.

As an industry, we have yet to fully acknowledge the pervasiveness of unsafe working conditions because we’ve normalized the idea that suffering is an essential part of filmmaking. Our “battle-tested” cameras have names like Rocket, Weapon, and Arsenal. We use terms like “run n’ gun,” “lock it up,” and “shoot.” Our toxic production culture frames suffering as “paying your dues.”

We don’t just accept self-sacrifice — we glorify it.

The data backs this up. In a 2024 survey by IPC, 79 percent of film workers reported being injured on the job, and 69 percent believed that creative vision was prioritized over safety. In a study by The UK Film and TV Charity, 77 percent of respondents said the film and TV industry is a mentally unhealthy place to work, and a shocking 30 percent having considered taking their own life in the past year.

These aren’t just statistics, they are people. Yet since most struggles don’t end in public tragedy, they rarely make headlines.

‘Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna Hutchins’ Hulu

But there is hope. A movement for change is growing. Documentaries like “Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna” and “Safe Sets: Dying to Work in the Film Industry” are sparking conversations and bringing long-overdue attention to the realities of working behind the scenes. More productions are actively prioritzing well-being, proving that a better way is possible.

The most effective way to create safe, sustainable sets is to build well-being into the production process rather than reacting when things go wrong. Here are some ways to start:

Mental Health Resources : Productions can establish dedicated well-being roles with trained professionals embedded on a project to support crew and proactively address mental health, burnout, and interpersonal challenges before they escalate.

: Reporting Mechanisms : Only 7 percent of industry workers feel safe reporting concerns without fear of retaliation. Anonymous reporting channels allow workers to speak up without risking their jobs.

: Industry-Wide Standards : Creating safer productions requires a unified approach. Producers, executives, and department heads need to align on best practices and define the roles that will make safety and well-being a priority across every set.

:

You may be asking, “How can we do more when budgets and timelines are already stretched to the limit?” Because the best work doesn’t come from exhaustion and fear. It comes from safe, creative environments where people feel free to bring their best ideas to the table.

When people experience a culture of trust at work, they report a 76 percent increase in engagement and a 50 percent boost in productivity. A study by Google found that high psychological safety in teams leads to 31 percent more innovation. Prioritizing safety doesn’t just protect people, it elevates the work itself.

Rachel Mason, director of “Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna,” has said, “Every single thing had to happen the way it did in order to have this outcome.” But what if the outcome had been different? What if the bullet had missed? Would anyone other than the crew have ever known about the poor working conditions on Rust? How many other productions have come close to tragedy without the public ever hearing about it?

This is about more than one feature film — it’s about the culture of production. A producer’s success can’t just be measured in accolades and bottom lines. It must also include the well-being of the people who bring these stories to life. If the cost of a project is that people get hurt, can it ever really be a success?

A true culture shift will require action from those in power who set the tone for how productions operate. By committing to sets that center humanity, where people feel energized, valued, and fulfilled, we do more than improve our individual productions. We raise the standard for how great work gets made.

Song writes and directs A24 film “Materialists,” starring Dakota Johnson as an ambitious New York City matchmaker who finds herself torn between the perfect match and her imperfect ex. Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal co-star as the two vying for Johnson’s heart. And all that love was also part of the film’s production.

“I really loved it so much,” Johnson said during the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast about filming the feature. “It’s one of those special moments, and I think in my work, every moment I felt so inspired and so connected to both of those dudes [Evans and Pascal] and everyone on that set. It was a wonderful experience.”

She also told IndieWire that Song is a “masterful filmmaker” and she was “very grateful” to be cast in “Materialists.” Zoe Winters, Marin Ireland, Dasha Nekrasova, and Louisa Jacobson co-star. The trailer also includes an original song by Japanese Breakfast.

Christine Vachon’s Killers Films produces the feature along with David Hinojosa, Pamela Koffler, and Song. Killers Films produced Song’s “Past Lives.”

Song was recently part of the Sundance 2025 jury alongside Daniel Kaluuya and Elijah Wood, and was honored at the Opening Night Gala with Kristen Stewart and Christopher Nolan. Oscar-nominated Song also joined the Academy in 2024 along with Lily Gladstone, Sandra Hüller, and Justine Triet.

In addition to “Materialists,” Johnson, Evans, and Pascal all have a full slate of projects. Johnson will lead the open marriage comedy “Splitsville” with “Hit Man” breakout Adria Arjona and Michael Covino, who also writes and directs. The Neon film will also be released in 2025. Evans is starring as a cult leader in Ethan Coen’s “Honey Don’t!” alongside Aubrey Plaza and Margaret Qualley. And, of course, Pascal will be making his MCU debut as Mr. Fantastic in “Fantastic Four: First Steps.” The actor appears in “Freaky Tales” and “The Uninvited,” as well as returns for “The Last of Us” Season 2.

“Materialists” premieres in theaters June 13. Check out the trailer below.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Rachel Zegler Says White Studio Execs ‘Kept Calling to Ask If I Was’ Actually Latina During ‘West Side Story’ Casting: ‘Want Me to Bring My Abuelita In?’,https://variety.com/2025/film/news/rachel-zegler-white-studio-execs-west-side-story-casting-1236340299/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:48:39 GMT","Rachel Zegler said in an interview with Allure magazine that white studio executives repeatedly questioned her during the casting process for Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story,” which served as her acting breakthrough in Hollywood. Spielberg cast Zegler as the musical’s female lead, María, and it was of utmost importance to him that the film’s Latina protagonist be played by a Latina actor.

“There’s confusion because I don’t have a single ounce of Latin in my name,” Zegler told the magazine. “When I was in the running for María in ‘West Side Story,’ they kept calling to ask if I was legit. I remember thinking, ‘Do you want me to bring my abuelita in?’ I will. I’ll bring her into the studio if you want to meet her.”

Zegler added, “Having a bunch of white executives have you prove your identity to them…It’s an interesting experience being part of that diaspora in the current climate we live in. But I love being Colombian.”

Popular on Variety

Spielberg’s “West Side Story” earned critical acclaim and scored Zegler a win at the Golden Globes for best actress in a musical or comedy film. Her career had effectively taken off, but “West Side Story” was far from release when the call came in for her to audition for the lead role in Disney’s live-action “Snow White” remake. Zegler had filmed “West Side Story” but it was months from opening and no footage of her as María was public yet. Spielberg personally advocated for her casting to “Snow White” director Marc Webb. Cut to years later and Zegler is now headlining the Disney remake, opening in theaters March 21.

“The reality is, I was given a chance because I could sing,” Zegler told Allure magazine about why she was cast as Snow White even if the Disney princess is not Latina in the original animated film. “My only prayer for the future of diversity and inclusion is that we invest in and nurture talent no matter what they look like.”

“That’s why it’s so important for the next generation to see movies like ‘Snow White,’” Zegler added about the film. “To realize there’s nothing wrong with choosing to do what’s right and that it doesn’t have to be with anger or a clenched fist. Anger can be a powerful emotion, but it doesn’t bring the brightest future. Snow White chooses kindness and still makes change. Power takes many forms. I hope we’ll see a new dawn of kindness and acceptance in the next couple of years. And people don’t see the need to use hate to cause further division.”

The series is set in the world of professional women’s basketball, which is having a moment with stars such as Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. It comes from two-time WNBA All-Star Chiney Ogwumike and GLOW creators Carly Mensch and Liz Flahive.

The half-hour project follows a hot-shot rookie WNBA player and her inexperienced agent navigating the wild ups and downs of the world of women’s professional basketball. It is loosely inspired by Ogwumike and her longtime business partner and agent, Allison Galer, who chose an unconventional path after Ogwumike, who was the first pick in the 2014, chose the 24-year-old as her rep. It will look at the “glamour and grind” of women’s sports.

Ogwumike was drafted by the Connecticut Sun before being traded to the Los Angeles Sparks in 2019. She also signed a deal with ESPN in 2018 and in 2020 became the first Black woman to host a national radio show for the Disney-owned sports network. She is also an in-studio analyst for NBA Today.

Watch on Deadline

Flahive and Mensch, who ran Netflix’s women’s-wrestling comedy drama GLOW for three seasons, will serve as showrunners for The W and will co-write the pilot with Tori Collins, who worked on Jamie Foxx’s Netflix comedy Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!

Universal Television is the studio and is producing The W with Condé Nast’s Glamour Studios and Victorious. It will be exec produced by Ogwumike, Galer, Flahive, Mensch, Helen Estabrook, Lajoie St. George and Jodi Hildebrand.

It also marks the first project for Ogwumike’s production company Victorious. Ogwumike and Galer previously created and exec produced ESPN Films documentary 144, which documented the 2020 WNBA season in the Covid bubble.

“Our mission with Victorious is to build a future where women in sports can win big,” said Ogwumike. “One of the most invaluable lessons that I have learned as a professional athlete, broadcaster, and ambassador is that we no longer have to wait for opportunities, we can create them. We are in an era where barriers are being broken, ceilings are being shattered and the world is finally taking notice. And with our groundbreaking first project, we will bring the main topic to the mainstream. In that spirit, Victorious is a purpose-driven platform that will forge new pathways for us to celebrate our own wins.”

Added Galer: “With Victorious and our first-of-its-kind scripted project, we are creating meaningful opportunities that show women in sports winning at the highest levels. As an advocate and teammate of female athletes for over a decade, I know firsthand the power of women’s sports and its exceptional ability to capture hearts and minds. With media coverage accelerating, superstar status shining, and investment expanding, Victorious will be the go-to vehicle for women’s sports stories to reach and captivate global audiences.”

Glamour’s Global Editorial Director Samantha Barry: “Glamour has a longstanding history of championing, spotlighting, and honoring female athletes. With more eyes focused on the world of women’s sports than ever before, we couldn’t be more thrilled to partner with WNBA icon Chiney Ogwumike, who has paved the way for herself and others in the industry.”",indiewire

It’s not Opening Day—at least not in the traditional sense—but MLB is starting the season in Japan with a pair of games between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs.

The Tokyo Series builds off of a lot of growth for MLB in Japan. Shohei Ohtani‘s rise, the success of the 2023 World Baseball Classic and an influx of other young Japanese stars—many of whom play in Los Angeles and Chicago—have opened the door for larger commercial opportunities for the league in Japan.

The hosts talk about the long delay—10 days—between the Tokyo Series and the beginning of the season for everyone else in the league. Is that too long? Does it threaten to lessen the excitement?

Before that, the hosts break down a number of business stories related to March Madness. North Carolina snuck into the men’s draw as the final team chosen, a notable decision given that a) UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham is chair of the selection committee, and b) Cunningham earned a $68,000 bonus for the Tar Heels’ selection. One of the teams left out in UNC’s place was West Virginia. The governor of West Virginia on Monday announced an investigation into the NCAA, which he derided as the “National Corrupt Athletic Association.”

The hosts also talk about some business oddities related to the coaches, top seeds and biggest-name players. This is yet another season where there may be more recognizable players in the women’s draw than the men’s tournament.

They close by talking about the Cincinnati Bengals, which just committed nearly $300 million to their two star wideouts. Are they the Toronto Maple Leafs of the NFL?

“I’m friendly with Brad Pitt,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2020. “I don’t have any really bad blood.”

The duo met on the set of the David Fincher film Se7en in 1994 and started dating soon after. They got engaged in 1996, only a few months before their split.

Paltrow talked to Howard Stern about falling for the Ocean’s Eleven star during a 2015 interview. “He was so gorgeous and sweet. I mean, he was Brad Pitt!” she said at the time, adding that her father, the late director Bruce Paltrow, was “devastated” when they broke up.

Pitt reflected on his relationship with Paltrow’s father during a June 2022 interview with Paltrow herself to promote his involvement with a Goop product, God’s True Cashmere. “I’ll never forget when we were engaged and he [Bruce] came to me one day, his eyes full of tears, and he said, ‘You know, I never really realized what they mean when they say you’re gaining a son. Like, I’m gaining a son,’” Pitt said.

Paltrow was married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin from 2003 to 2016 and share two children: Apple and Moses. She married television writer and director Brad Falchuck in September 2018.

Pitt, meanwhile, was married to Jennifer Aniston from 2000 to 2005 and then started seeing Angelina Jolie that year. He married Jolie, with whom he shares six children, in 2014. The actors split in 2016, and the divorce was finalized in January 2025.

Whatever the case there are zero regrets and while every relationship has difficulties we brought each other a lot of joy and am grateful to have had that in my life.”

Alongside the message, Moss shared a picture of him walking at sunset set to Noah Kahan’s “All My Love.”

The former Bachelorette contestant was most recently publicly linked to HGTV star Galey Alix. Us Weekly broke the news in 2022 that Moss and Alix were dating. She confirmed two years later that the pair went their separate ways. When a user asked in the comments section of Alix’s post, “Nice is she still with Dale?” she replied, “We’ve been separated for over a month now. He’s an amazing guy and will always be someone I adore as a person ❤️.”

In another Instagram Story on Monday, Moss replied to a fan question who asked whether he believes in “taking time to heal after a breakup” or if he’d rather be “dating soon after.”

“Yes, it’s healthy. I’ve never been a big dater, I’ve never gone on a date with a dating app and I’ve always taken a lot of time (sometimes years) between relationships,” Moss wrote. “Ultimately it’s our responsibility to heal ourselves even though a partner can help.”

Hull, 28, made the surprising revelation in a video posted via Instagram on Monday, March 17 — and it comes with high stakes.

“Today, I’ve made the decision I’m going to stop smoking,” Hull told her friend and pro golfer, Ryan Evans, in the video. “I’m going to give them to Ryan now. I’m going to do a 10-grand bet with you. I get no money in it. Ten-grand bet. If I pick up a cigarette in the next two months, I’ll give you 10grand and I’m shaking on that. Deal?”

Evans, 37, shook hands with Hull and joked, “I’m going to have to record you 24 hours a day.”

The shot drew all […]

Hull was so confident in the bet that she told Evans he was free to throw away her cigarettes in the trash.

Hours after making the wager, Hull clarified via her Instagram Story that she’s “not starting to vape either!”

The England-born golfer did say she will be using “snus,” which is British slang for a smokeless tobacco product.

Currently the No. 10 ranked women’s golfer in the world, Hull went viral in May 2024 after being pictured with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth at the U.S. Women’s Open in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

“It was crazy,” Hull told the Daily Mail in August 2024 about all of the attention. “Not really what I was expecting, but I guess it shows that any publicity is good publicity.”

She added, “I’d rather make the headlines for my golf, but hopefully it helped to attract a few new fans to golf!”

“I don’t train for golf,” Hull explained. “I have zero interest in training for golf. I don’t want to be just a golfer. I want to be an athlete. I train because it’s good for my mental health and it’s good for me.”

Bibb’s hairstylist, Chris McMillan, took to TikTok on Monday, March 17, to share exactly how he cut the actress’ “c—y little bob.”

“Some people have ‘The Rachel,’ I have the c—y little bob,” Bibb, 50, said as she showed off her finished hairdo, referencing Jennifer Aniston’s famous ’90s haircut in Friends, which McMillan also created.

He then demonstrated exactly how she trimmed Bibb’s mane, which was cut into a blunt bob slightly below her ears. “Today, I am giving Leslie Bibb her c—y little bob for the White Lotus,” he said, describing the look as “straight across, slightly angled [and] longer in the front.”

McMillan also explained that having a consistent haircut is important to maintain on TV, so a simplistic look — that won’t get messy with the humidity of Thailand, where season 3 of the Max show was filmed — was needed for Bibb’s character, Kate Bohr. “I think we nailed it, and then we also created a kind of iconic look,” he gushed.

“Ummmm can you say iconic?? Leslie Bibb and I are always trouble together now let’s see the ‘c—y little bob’ become the look of the year with color by Tracey Cunningham 🙃,” McMillan captioned the post. “Doing this look for Leslie was so much fun; don’t think I didn’t try to get some easter eggs from her but tight lips she didn’t reveal a THING…surprise surprise Sam Rockwell 🤪👏.”

https://usmagazine.com,Kristin Davis Recalls SATC Hiring Porn Stars for Season 1 Sex Scene,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kristin-davis-recalls-satc-hiring-porn-stars-for-season-1-sex-scene/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:13:09 GMT","Sex was a focal point on Sex and the City, but that doesn’t mean Kristin Davis and her costars weren’t taken aback by some of the situations they witnessed.

Davis, who played Charlotte York on the HBO series for six seasons, recalled season 1 being full of eye-opening moments. While rewatching season 1, episode 6, for her “Are You a Charlotte?” podcast, Davis, 60, looked back on Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) and Ted’s (David Aaron Baker) brief romance.

“She finds a porn magazine about spanking, and she’s kind of, like, a little miffed, which is also kind of funny because she’s Miranda,” Davis told her listeners on the Sunday, March 16, episode, noting, “Spanking kinda seems pretty benign to today’s world [but] she has to go and talk to Carrie [Bradshaw] about it.”

Davis explained that during the episode Miranda discovered a spanking video, but she made Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) watch. That moment is just the tip of the iceberg for the kinks the SATC ladies’ encounter.

“Carrie’s already had to watch the modelizer having sex [and] secretly filming the models … and then has to have a cigarette and act like it’s fine,” Davis explained. “Now, we’ve got Miranda with this spanking video.”

The actress revealed that the spanking video leads to an even more iconic moment on the show.

“Soon we’re gonna have all of us watching the people in the window,” Davis said, asking her guest star Christine Taylor, “Do you remember this when we, like, turn our heads sideways because we’re watching people have sex?”

Last year, the two services agreed to a licensing deal that allows some of HBO’s biggest […]

Charlotte, Miranda, Carrie and Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) tilting their heads in awe while watching the video was used in teasers and trailers for the show at the time. That scene, however, stood out for another reason in Davis’ head.

“We hired two porn actors for [that],” she recalled. “Which I remember, we were like semi-traumatized about it.”

Davis added that now she thinks, “more power to them” but at the time, the sexual nature of the show was very new.

“It is kind of a theme in the beginning,” she said of the wild sex acts they highlight on the show. “I guess it makes sense because Carrie is trying to, you know, investigate relationships and sex and [learn] what do people like? What do people do?”

While Davis confessed to being “semi-traumatized” watching porn stars in action, she previously revealed that her least favorite SATC story line didn’t even involve sex.

Who Is Your Favorite TV Couple of All Time?

During the March 13 episode of her podcast, Davis said that when Charlotte and her husband, Harry (Evan Handler), got food poisoning during season 6 she was not happy.

“I just hated that story line so much,” Davis shared on the podcast, revealing she tried to convince them to cut the scene, which showed the couple getting sick at home on the bathroom floor after a romantic night. “I went to Elisa Zuritsky and Julia Rottenberg [the writers of the episode] and said, ‘Please, do we have to do this? Why?’”

Her pleas went unanswered, because the writers thought it was a fun direction for the buttoned-up Charlotte. “They were like, ‘It’s so funny,’” Davis recalled. “I think it was based on a story where someone went to France and had a similar experience with their decadent cheeses, which we’re not used to here.”

I’m not gonna waste energy on it. I can’t change anybody,” Davis, 58, told The Telegraph on […]

Still, she did not “like” the story. “I didn’t want to lay on the floor of the bathroom with Evan in stained T-shirts. Ick.”

Even with a few awkward moments, Davis remained part of SATC throughout its original run from 1998 to 2004. She reprised her role in 2008’s Sex and the City movie and 2010’s Sex and the City 2.

Desert Rodeo is set to take place at the Desert International Horse Park in Thermal, CA the weekend of April 25 to April 27, which happens to be the same time as Stagecoach.

“It’s a very big weekend for the country music fans so that’s part of the reason why we wanted to do what we’re doing that weekend,” co-founder and Entertainment Tonight correspondent Cassie DiLaura exclusively told Us Weekly. “We wanted to offer the community and festival goers something to do during the day that is a supplementary experience to the festival, which a lot of people go to, later on in the evening.”

DiLaura, 32, shared with Us that her team wanted to do something “true to the Western Spirit” and landed on doing a “sanctioned professional rodeo.”

“This is not some backyard bulls—t. This is the real deal,” she explained. “Prize money, prizes, all of it. You have the MLB, you have the NFL, you have the NHL, you have the PRCA. The PRCA is the oldest and largest sanctioning body in western sports. It’s as big as you can get.”

The PRCA only holds about “700 rodeos throughout the year,” with Desert Rodeo being one of them, per DiLaura.

“The cowboys that are going to be competing, this goes towards their numbers to qualify them for NFR [National Finals Rodeo],” she gushed, adding that the “work ethic” of the cowboys is something she admires. “The community itself has just been the most welcoming.”

DiLaura noted that along with the rodeo consisting of three days of competition with eight events each day, there are also fun side activities for guests to participate in.

“Our friends over at “Fox Farmer Wants a Wife” are coming and we’re gonna have a big photo moment so fans can take their photo with the farmers,” she explained. “You can go over to the Tito’s activation and you can build charms for your boots. And you can do western games. We also have a retail ranch.”

Although festival-goers will probably be in their favorite country gear for Stagecoach, DiLaura did share some of her favorite fashion tips for the rodeo.

“One thing that is so special about Western fashion, you can be as creative as you want and you can do what you want. You can channel your personality however you want,” she told Us. “Boots highly encouraged. Cowboy hat, highly encouraged. Tank top, shorts also highly encouraged. …. There are no rules. You’ll see people in all sorts of get up during this weekend. … But at the very minimum, cowboy boots.”

https://usmagazine.com,Biggest Takeaways From Octomom's Return to the Spotlight,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/biggest-takeaways-from-octomoms-return-to-the-spotlight/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:26:29 GMT","Natalie “Nadya” Suleman retreated from the public eye in 2013, but now she’s back — and sharing her side of the story.

Suleman rose to fame in 2009 after getting pregnant with octuplets via IVF. That same year, she welcomed Noah, Maliyah, Isaiah, Nariyah, Jonah, Makai, Josiah and Jeremiah Suleman is also mom to six older children: Elijah (born in 2001), Amerah (born in 2002), Joshua (born in 2003), Aiden (born in 2005) and fraternal twins Calyssa and Caleb (born in 2006).

As she prepares for the release of her Lifetime film, I Was Octomom (Saturday, March 8), and docuseries, Confessions of Octomom (Monday, March 10), Suleman is reflecting on her life.

“I wasn’t happy as an only child, and clearly I projected my dream onto my kids and wanting a big, well, not this big of a family, but I did want seven kids,” she told People. “But it’s not enough to say I wanted a big family because I was lonely. There is an amalgamation of factors. I wanted kids to create maybe a safe and predictable little world that I lacked growing up. So then of course, I projected onto my future family.”

Scroll down to see the biggest takeaways from Suleman’s return to the spotlight:

Her 1 ‘Regret’

Suleman had multiple back-to-back rounds of IVF administered by Dr. Michael Kamrava. While the recommended standard practice is to implant two embryos, Kamrava implanted her with 12.

Suleman, who wanted “just one more” baby, was told by Kamrava that he had only implanted six embryos. He later admitted to planting 12 and his professional medical license was revoked.

“I don’t think I’d do too much differently,” Suleman told People. “I do regret not suing the infertility doctor. I definitely regret that because his insurance would’ve been the one paying, and it would’ve been some millions, and it would’ve been helpful for my family.”

She continued, “I regret that I kind of threw myself under the bus to cover for him, and I shouldn’t have but I was grateful. I wouldn’t have had any of my kids if it weren’t for his innovative technique. No one else in the world did this type of procedure so I didn’t have it in my heart to sue him,” she said.

However, Suleman “did sue the hospital because they breached HIPAA,” claiming that hospital employees reportedly shared her information. “They’re the reason why I ended up in the public eye.”

Her Financial Status — And ‘Biggest Misconception’

Suleman is setting the record straight on her financial situation after rising to fame. “At the time, I was not unemployed. I was on disability,” she told People.

Despite being accused of receiving and using government assistance to conceive her children, Suleman said, “That was a lie.”

“I did not use taxpayers’ money. I’d saved so much money working as a psychiatric technician at a state psych hospital,” she said. “I saved well over a hundred thousand dollars. I used all of that money. Instead of buying a house I bought in vitros. I also had an inheritance close to $60,000 that paid for it too, which I’m not proud of. It should have gone for my older kids. I also got student loans, but I paid for everything, period.”

Suleman’s financial situation became more dire after welcoming her octuplets, leading her to participate in paid interviews, photo opportunities and a solo adult film.

“I’ve never wanted fame,” she said. “That’s a No. 1 biggest misconception ever. I sued the hospital because they were the reason I ended up in the public eye.” She added, “I did whatever I needed to do to make ends meet. And that was shaming myself, sacrificing my integrity. The life I was leading was not only destructive, it was dark. It was the antithesis of who I am as a person.”

In 2013, the year she left the spotlight, Suleman said the family was struggling financially “more than ever.” Suleman went back into her “old profession as a therapist working 40 hours a week.”

She added, “I used my education. For years I was typecast as the welfare recipient, unemployed mother, all of which is wrong.”

Five years later, Suleman left her job when son Aidan’s “needs were becoming overwhelming.”

“I’ve always been his only provider, but I never got paid,” she said of her son, who is autistic. “So in 2018, that’s when I started to get actually paid. It’s decent money, but it’s still nothing compared to what we need to make to be comfortable in life.”

Now, Suleman and 11 of her 14 kids live in a three-bedroom townhouse apartment in Orange County, California. The family receives support from members of the community, including one couple who “offered us to live here half the rent just because they’re good Christian people. People at church have made a positive difference.”

Her Love Life — And Being Celibate

Before welcoming her octuplets, Suleman was married to Marcos Gutierrez. The pair separated in 2000 and officially divorced six years later. Looking back, Suleman told People that it “wasn’t a real marriage.”

“I was married, but on paper. He was just a donor and I only tried to pacify my very, very old-fashioned Middle Eastern family on my dad’s side, where some of the marriages are still pre-arranged,” she said.

Her first six children were conceived from a “platonic friend donor,” while the octuplets “have a frozen anonymous donor.” Suleman always knew she wanted a family, but without a partner.

“I’ve never really dated,” she said. “I had one relationship and I was very up front with him and said, ‘I’m really only interested in having a child. Wonderful guy, very nice, funny, great guy. And he had feelings, but I didn’t really reciprocate them. But I was open with him. I was never hiding the fact that I just wanted a child and he tried to help me, but it didn’t work out.”

Suleman later revealed that she has been celibate for 25 years.

In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, the mother of 14 identified herself as an aromantic, asexual person.

“I’m not a romantic person whatsoever,” she said. “I have zero interest in being in a romantic relationship, or any relationship, for that matter, with anyone.”

Her Death Threats

In the trailer for Suleman’s upcoming Lifetime series, one of her daughters claimed to the cameras that, “At the time my mom was getting a lot of death threats.”

One of Suleman’s sons also sat down with producers, sharing his experience of having people approach him to ask about his mom’s past. (Aside from her adult film, she previously worked as a stripper in men’s clubs.)

“When someone comes up to you at school and asks you, ‘Is your mom a stripper?’ You don’t know what to say,” the son said.

Hospital Frenzy

During a March 7 interview with Today, Suleman claimed that the hospital gave a press conference without her consent. She also alleged that the facility refused to discharge her until she “found a manager to help control the chaos” of the media frenzy.

“It was that professor, that manager, that was trying to protect me who confiscated my phone,” Suleman said, noting she opted for a professor to help her since she was in grad school at the time. “And said as soon as I finished this interview — I called it an interrogation — I could see my kids.”

Looking back on it now, Suleman confessed that she “would have refused” if she had known she could.

“I didn’t even know I had that right as a patient to refuse,” she continued. “I wish I had some legal assistance at that time.”

Single Parent Bias

Suleman told Today that if she had gone through her pregnancy with a partner by her side, she believes she would have received less scrutiny.

“If I were in a relationship and were married, it would have acted as a buffer to being a that target of that hate, of that downward social comparison,” she reflected.

One month more before West’s recent social media posts, multiple sources told Us Weekly that Kardashian, 44, is “considering” filing for “full custody” of her and West’s kids: North, 11, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 5.

“She is in a very tough position when she really has to coparent with him,” an insider shared. “Right now he is very distracted and she does not want to say anything bad about him, but the safety of her kids is what is [motivating this consideration].”

A second source noted to Us that Kardashian “is worried” that West’s online behavior could “create problems” for their kids.

Related: Everything Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Have Said About Coparenting Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have spoken candidly about coparenting since their February 2021 split — but it hasn’t always gone smoothly. The reality star and the rapper, who tied the knot in 2014, share four children: North (born in June 2013), Saint (born in December 2015), Chicago (born in January 2018) and Psalm (born […]

West, 47, previously sparked concern when he posted antisemitic rants and now has continued to raise eyebrows by sharing a song with disgraced music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, which featured vocals from his and Kardashian’s eldest child, North. In addition to dropping “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine” on Saturday, March 15, West shared an alleged text message exchange between him and his ex-wife, apparently revealing how Kardashian allegedly tried to stop the release of the song because of North’s trademarked name.

“I asked you at the time if I can trademark her name. You said yes. When she’s 18, it goes to her. So stop,” Kardashian reportedly wrote, according to screenshots shared via TMZ. “I sent paperwork over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song to protect her.”

West, meanwhile, allegedly replied: “And neither of us will recover from the public fallout. You’re going to have to kill me.”

Kardashian and West said “I do” in 2014 and were married for seven years before the reality star filed for divorce in February 2021. She previously opened up about the challenges of coparenting with her ex after their divorce was finalized in November 2022.

“I had the best dad. I don’t want to get emotional, but it’s just been a day for me. It is hard. Coparenting is really f—ing hard,” Kardashian shared on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast in December 2022. “I had the best dad and the best experiences, and that is all I want for my kids. As long as they can have that, that is what I want for them.”

Kardashian addressed the challenges of trying to prevent her children from seeing their father’s controversial and antisemitic social media posts, adding, “I definitely protected him, and I still will in the eyes of my kids. For my kids. So, in my home, my kids don’t know anything that goes on [in] the outside world. I am holding on by a thread. I know that I am so close to that not happening, but while it is still that way, I will protect that to the end of the Earth as long as I can. My kids don’t know anything.”

Related: What Kim Kardashian Has Said About Kanye West Since Their Divorce Kim Kardashian has had plenty to say about her ex-husband, Kanye West, since the couple divorced in 2022. Kardashian and West married in 2014 and share four kids — daughters North, 11, and Chicago, 7, as well as sons Saint, 9, and Psalm, 5. Coparenting means that Kardashian and West still see a lot of […]

She continued: “It is [a full-time job]. It is worth it because I think that of course I want to disassociate in specific thoughts and things being said because that is not me. But at the same time in my home I could be going through something, but if we are riding to school and they want to listen to their dad’s music — no matter what we are going through — I have to have that smile on my face and blast his music and sing along with my kids. [I can] act like nothing is wrong and as soon as I drop them off, I can have a good cry.”

West, who moved on with now-wife Bianca Censori, has also offered his perspective when it comes to raising his kids with Kardashian.

“Even to this day, I’ll still give Kim advice on things that could help because that’s going to go to the kids,” he said on the “Alo Mind Full” podcast in September 2022. “She’s still got them 80 percent of the time, [to] raise those children. So what people saw when I was going back and forth is that I still have to be able to throw my version of what people would throw into the curriculum.”

https://usmagazine.com,Tracy Morgan Provides Update After Violently Puking at Knicks Game,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tracy-morgan-provides-update-after-violently-puking-at-knicks-game/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:17:21 GMT","After Tracy Morgan triggered worry by puking all over the court at the New York Knicks game on Monday, March 17, he provided an update from his hospital bed.

“Thank you for all your concern!” Morgan posted via Instagram on Tuesday, March 18. “I’m doing ok now and doctors say it was food poisoning. Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!”

Morgan was sitting courtside at the game between the Knicks and Miami Heat on Monday when he began violently vomiting. He was taken off the court in a wheelchair while holding a towel to his face.

The actor and comedian managed to have a good sense of humor about the ordeal, which briefly delayed the third quarter of the game at New York City’s Madison Square Garden.

Related: Tracy Morgan Felt ‘Culturally Isolated‘ at ‘SNL’: ‘Whitest Show in America‘ Tracy Morgan didn’t hold back when discussing the downsides of his early days at Saturday Night Live. “I wanted to show them my world, how funny it was. But the first three years, I felt like I was being culturally isolated sometimes,” Morgan, 56, recalled on Peacock’s SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night docuseries. “I’m coming from […]

“More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I’ll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅 #goknicks,” Morgan wrote.

The Knicks defeated the Heat 116-95.

Supporters immediately flooded the comments section of Morgan’s post with well-wishes. “Wishing you speedy recovery 🙌,” one fan wrote.

Another even provided a potential clue as to what led to Morgan’s illness.

“If it was the garden food that [did] this I’m not surprised because the food we bought last night was stale and cold and the person at the food counter got upset because we took it back,” another person wrote. “MSG leadership needs to do better with food services.”

There is no proof that Morgan — who is a regular at Knicks games — got sick by eating the food at Madison Square Garden.

Regardless, when Morgan is ready to return to the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” the staff will be ready to welcome him with open arms.

I out-ate […]

“We hope Tracy feels better soon and look forward to seeing him back courtside,” a Madison Square Garden representative told People in a statement Monday.

After news of Morgan’s health scare broke, some of his famous friends expressed their concerns on social media.

“Sending good thoughts to Tracy Morgan 💙,” Knicks superfan Ben Stiller wrote via X.

Robert Griffin III, former NFL quarterback and ESPN analyst, posted via X, “Prayers up for Tracy Morgan 🙏🏾Threw up courtside watching the Knicks and Heat play and then was taken off in a wheel chair.”",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,Christine Quinn Breaks Silence on Christian Richard Divorce,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/christine-quinn-breaks-silence-on-christian-richard-divorce/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:47:06 GMT","Selling Sunset alum Christine Quinn is ready to discuss what led to her messy divorce from Christian Richard.

“I haven’t talked about this with anyone,” she told People in an interview published on Tuesday, March 18. “Some people knew stuff was going on, but no one knew the extent of it in terms of how bad everything really was.”

Quinn, 36, recalled having “no choice but to leave” Los Angeles and start again in Texas, adding, “I really didn’t have a choice. I was granted an emergency protective order so my ex couldn’t come to the house. He violated that and would keep coming back.”

While reflecting on the end of her marriage, Quinn noted there are a lot of details that the public “really don’t know” about the situation.

Related: Selling Sunset‘s Christine Quinn and Husband Christian Richard‘s Timeline Selling Sunset alum Christine Quinn met husband Christian Richard through a matchmaking mutual friend and work. “[My friend was] like, ‘Also, he’s looking for a house.’ And I was like: double bonus,” Quinn recalled to Bustle in May 2020. “Him and I had an amazing steak dinner and got to know each other, and we […]

“I was hacked out of my entire life. I was stripped of my entire life overnight — I literally had nothing. And it was dehumanizing,” she revealed. “I was completely resourceless.”

Richard, 46, did not provide a statement in response to Quinn’s comments to the outlet. The former couple’s marital issues originally made headlines when he was arrested and booked in March 2024 for assault with a deadly weapon. A temporary restraining order was put in place following the incident. Richard was taken into custody for a second time after violating the order when he returned to their home.

Quinn and Richard filed for restraining orders against one another following the alleged domestic violence incident. The former reality TV star’s request was granted but Richard’s was denied one month later.

Richard subsequently filed for divorce from Quinn after two years of marriage, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split. Richard also requested full legal and physical custody of their 3-year-old son, Christian, while allowing Quinn visitation.

Related: Hollywood‘s Messiest Custody Battles: Brangelina, Usher and Tameka and More When there are children involved, divorce can get messy and turn exes into enemies. “We don’t see eye-to-eye. The friend that I was to Tameka, I don’t know that I could ever be again, because I really felt like we were friends. She made us enemies in a way that I never understood,” Usher said […]

Court documents obtained by Us in April 2024 stated that Quinn was seeking sole legal and physical custody because Richard’s “actions and behavior have put our son’s health and wellbeing at risk.” She has since moved to Texas with her son, which has benefitted them both.

“Everyone sees the incident that occurred, but this is something that had been going on for a while,” she continued on Tuesday. “This is something that had been under the surface for a long time. It was extremely unhealthy, and I like to think that I’m extremely resilient — and I am.”

Quinn made the decision to cut ties with Richard after seeing how it affected their son, adding, “There are certain things that I could tolerate, and it got to a point where it was affecting my son, and that wasn’t okay. I was like, ‘OK, I can deal with this, I’m an adult.’ But bringing him into the chaos and everything that kind of ensued, I was like, ‘No, this is not OK.’”

During the rare interview, Quinn brought up an example of Richard’s alleged behavior.

Related: Inside Christine Quinn‘s Legal Battle With Her Ex-Husband: A Timeline Christine Quinn and estranged husband Christian Richard are experiencing continued legal drama following his initial March 2024 arrest. The Selling Sunset alum married Richard in 2019, and their untraditional wedding was showcased during the Netflix show’s third season. Quinn famously wore a black wedding dress while the pair exchanged vows. During Selling Sunset season 4, […]

“There were times where my husband, literally, where I had to go to work and he would lay himself under my car,” she claimed. “I would sit for an hour until I finally missed a meeting and gave up and would go back inside, or he would shut the gates down so I couldn’t leave. It was bad.”

Quinn continued: “It was really hard for me because I look at my parents. My parents are high school sweethearts. I made a vow, and I really didn’t want to break that. It took everything out of me, it really did, to realize that this is the right thing to do. And then it became a matter of safety. It was initially safety for me, and then it was safety for my son. And so I had to walk away.”

While Richard did not respond to Quinn’s recent claims, his lawyer Alexandra Kazarian previously released a statement.

“The depths of Ms. Quinn’s delusion are once again on display. Her wild and unsubstantiated allegations have not stopped and her lack of credibility is best understood when read in conjunction with the unprecedented public statement by LAPD that her claims of hotel room bugging and alleged surveillance by Christian were unfounded,” read a 2024 statement after Quinn filed for a restraining order. “The reality is that Ms. Quinn enjoyed complete financial and personal independence during the marriage while spending upwards of $30,000 a month of his money and is now facing a divorce without a prenup, and having to repay the community assets with the millions she made during the marriage.”",usmagazine

https://usmagazine.com,What Secret Lives of Mormon Wives Cast Went Through Before Season 2,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/what-secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-cast-went-through-before-season-2/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 02:59:06 GMT","Season 2 of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives started filming one month after the show premiered on Hulu — yet so much changed in the cast’s personal lives already.

The reality show premiered in September 2024 and became an overnight success as viewers tuned in to see Taylor Frankie Paul, Whitney Leavitt, Jen Affleck, Demi Engemann, Mikayla Matthews, Mayci Neeley, Jessi Ngatikaura and Layla Taylor navigate their personal highs and lows. The eight-part season followed Mormon mom influencers who were caught up in a swinging sex scandal and the ensuing aftermath, including the fallout with their significant others.

It didn’t take long for viewers to demand more — and executive producer Danielle Pistotnik promised to deliver.

“There’s so many stories that these women have to share,” Pistotnik told Us Weekly for a September 2024 cover story. “Their upbringing is unbelievably heartbreaking — a lot of them — and it is so inspiring to listen to.”

Related: ‘Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ Then vs. Now: How Cast Looked Pre-Hulu Show The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives fans have watched the cast change on and off screen before the series even debuted. Season 1 of hit reality series, which follows a group of Mormon mom influencers, debuted on Hulu in September 2024 following star Taylor Frankie Paul‘s “soft swinging” sex scandal. “We’re not all swingers,” Whitney […]

Pistotnik recalled there not being “enough time” to share everyone’s story in season 1, adding, “If we get to do another season, I really, really want these women to be able to talk about what brought them to where they are today. [Scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor] was really just a function of the amount of time that we had.”

But by the time cameras started rolling in October 2024, the cast went through friendship falling outs, splits and subsequently three pregnancy announcements. Keep scrolling for everything that happened to The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives before season 2:

Whitney Welcomes Her 3rd Baby

During season 1, Whitney found out she was pregnant in the aftermath of a cheating scandal with husband Connor Leavitt. Their son Billy was born one month after the show aired, joining their daughter, Sedona, and son Liam.

Jen and Zac Affleck’s Ups and Downs

All viewers wanted to discuss after The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives premiered was Jen and Zac’s controversial marriage. Some people questioned the way Zac spoke to his wife, considering he had his own issues that were largely kept off screen.

Jen defended Zac until filming picked back up, when rumors swirled about their relationship status. In February 2025, Jen confirmed she was expecting her and Zac’s third baby. She later completed an 11-day wellness program to help heal her past trauma.

“Not the pregnancy journey I expected, but definitely what baby and I needed,” Jen, who shares daughter Nora and son Luca with Zac, wrote via Instagram in March 2025 before quoting a proverb by an unknown speaker. “‘When we heal ourselves, we heal the next generation that follows. Pain is passed through the family line until someone is ready to feel it, heart it and let it go.’”

Taylor’s Split From Dakota After an Unclear Relationship Status

Are Taylor and Dakota Mortensen together or not? That was the question all of Us — including Taylor — were asking when season 1 dropped in September 2025. At the time, Taylor hinted to Us that Dakota wasn’t happy with how he was portrayed on the show and that led to an off-and-on romance.

Taylor appeared to reconcile with Dakota but by the end of the year, they appeared to be over for good. Taylor and Dakota have since documented their attempts at coparenting while figuring out next steps in their respective personal lives.

“When I realized I haven’t been in the dating scene since I was 20 and eventually will have to go back to that,” Taylor, who shares two kids with ex-husband Tate Paul and a son with Dakota, wrote via Instagram in February 2025 before answering questions about the next chapter in her life. “The more you resist the pain coming through, the longer the suffering, learned this the hard way.”

An Us Weekly Cover

Weeks after The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives became a pop culture phenomenon, Us spoke with everyone from MomTok — and the producers of the hit Hulu series — about what would come next.

“The vision for the show never changed in that it is one part very loud and frothy soap opera with a little bit of cheating. But then at the same time, you have this fascinating exploration of a religious faith,” executive producer Jeff Jenkins told Us about keeping the story lines “balanced” on screen. “Another producer might have just went with the salacious scandal of swinging and ignored the religion. Or another producer might have really focused on the religion and downplayed everyday life and all the other stuff.”

He continued: “The vision was always a balance. We tinkered with that balance but we certainly didn’t want to just condemn the Mormon faith. Not at all. Religion has challenges within it and things that some folks would like to be changed. So it’s finding the balance between the soap opera and this very real conundrum that they’re bumping up against their faith.”

Mikayla Expands Her Family

In February 2025, Mikayla announced she is expecting her fourth baby with her husband Jace Terry amid an unknown chronic illness. (The duo are also parents to daughters Tommie and Haven and son Beckham.)

“I’m a lot better than I was, but I still have my ups and downs, so it’s just frustrating to not get any answers and feel like I’m on my own and then have to navigate being in this really exciting time while not feeling my best,” Mikayla told Us in September 2024 about her health issues. “And so that’s kind of been the trickiest.”

Mayci’s Pregnancy

After filming on season 2 wrapped, Mayci revealed in February 2025 that she is expecting baby No. 3 with her husband, Jacob Neeley.

“It’s been really exciting. I think when you do IVF, it’s not a fun process. Usually you tell your friends and family that you’re doing it, so there are no secrets or surprises,” she told People at the time. “We decided this time not to share it with anyone, not even our family.”

The pair already share daughter Harlow and son Hudson.

Another Member of the Soft-Swinging Scandal Enters the Chat

While Taylor’s soft-swinging scandal was mentioned in season 1, it wasn’t until the show aired that Miranda McWhorter and Camille Munday were brought up as potential participants. Taylor didn’t rule out one — or both — of them making appearances in season 2 and Miranda was ultimately confirmed as a new cast member.

“It’s out of my control and they have a show to do. So I don’t see how it wouldn’t be happening,” Taylor shared with Us in September 2024. “A lot of those things will be triggering — and when it comes to it — I’ll have to face it. At this point it’s just out of my control.”

According to Taylor, Camille reached out to congratulate her on the show. Miranda, however, hasn’t been as friendly.

“There’s some animosity there from me exposing my story and knowing that she’s probably the one people allude to. So she probably feels all this animosity toward me,” she explained at the time. “I’ve called her out on certain things so I don’t know if she’s a huge fan of me.

Demi and Jessi’s Surprising Feud

There were several falling outs while the cast filmed season 1 — and after. But Demi and Jessi remained on great terms up until cameras started rolling on season 2. Gone were the days Demi and Jessi posted TikTok videos poking fun at how similar they looked. Instead, both of them have shared cryptic clips hinting at their friendship coming to an end.

Every Other Cast Feud

When season 1 originally aired in September 2024, viewers wanted to know whether Whitney would return to MomTok. Jen’s future with the friend group was also up in the air until they confirmed their appearances in season 2. From there, Taylor’s friendship status with each cast member was called into question after she claimed they weren’t supporting her.

“Not a single one of my girls from MomTok said anything on my CMA post, such a big night for me,” she wrote via Instagram in November 2024. “Awkward.”

Jessi, Demi, Mikayla and Mayci defended themselves while denying the drama was for a story line.

“One thing about me, I’m not playing into anything online or a storyline,” Jessie wrote via her Instagram Story. “What you see is what you get. If only you guys knew what’s really going on behind the scenes. We don’t need to make things up — our group just has things happen. Case in point — today.”

Taylor ultimately clarified her perspective, saying in a video later that month, “I guess I ruffled some feathers, a little too much. But first off, we are not allowed to talk about any storyline, so this is not made up by any means. That little concoction I made myself, I guess. I thought it was awkward that every single one of my friends was silent. That’s all I meant by that. I have a lot of supportive girls in this group, and I never said anyone specifically is not supportive because they are. Not a single one. I just felt off by it, so I made a petty post, and are we shocked?”

She continued: “Sure you don’t have to like my stuff. That’s fine. Again, nowadays, it’s your message without saying a message, and we can, I think, all agree. For all the girls telling me I should have handled this differently and offline as they’re literally eating me alive online right now, maybe they feel justified but don’t come at me if you’re going to do the exact same thing.”",usmagazine

The Woman King actor, 33, exclusively revealed to Us Weekly why he felt it was important to call out the racist backlash he endured following his appearance in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, explaining that he “didn’t like what I was seeing.”

“I just didn’t like it,” Boyega told Us at the premiere of Number One on the Call Sheet in Los Angeles earlier this month. “It just went against my point of view. I thought that, in my position, it’s great for people to know how we are related to this. As much as I’m in this position, I still have family friends who are in the real world; [not] in this Hollywood bubble. They get affected by these issues. So to not speak up about it, in my position, that made no real sense to me.”

Boyega starred as Finn, a stormtrooper-turned-resistance fighter, in 2015’s The Force Awakens, 2017’s The Last Jedi and 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker. The British actor told GQ in 2020 that he was the “only cast member whose experience of Star Wars was based on their race.”

Boyega, 31, posted photos of himself with Captain America actor Anthony Mackie via X (formerly Twitter) last month, prompting one fan to reply, “tell anthony mackie to connect you w […]

“You realize, ‘I got given this opportunity but I’m in an industry that wasn’t even ready for me,’” Boyega said at the time. “Nobody else in the cast had people saying they were going to boycott the movie because [they were in it]. Nobody else had the uproar and death threats sent to their Instagram DMs and social media, saying, ‘Black this’ and ‘Black that’ and ’You shouldn’t be a Stormtrooper.’”

While the experience was challenging, Boyega has been able to find joy in his career. He told Us that he has met and befriended several mentors who have helped him navigate the industry and all that comes with it.

“There’s been Robert Downey Jr., who’s mentored me,” Boyega said. “I would say Jamie Foxx, who mentored me. Femi [Oguns], my agent. My father, Samson Boyega. So many people over the years, but [many of them] happened to be good Black men and women who have gone to spaces that I haven’t necessarily gone to. Then, sharing their wisdom from there.”

Boyega is one of the many actors featured in Number One on the Call Sheet, a two-part documentary film on Black Hollywood that is co-produced by Foxx. Following his appearance in the doc, Boyega is scheduled to begin working on action films.

“Woman King, I got to rest and wear nice gowns. Now, they’re at a point where they go, ‘No, John; we need you to jump out of a plane,’” Boyega explains. “So, I’ll be doing an action [film] next.

“Every girl wanted to be her best friend and every guy wanted to go out with her. I remember she came up to the first rehearsal and said, ‘Hi, Marty. I’m so happy to be here.’ She had her finger on her forehead. I said, ‘OK, good.’ She pulled [away] and she had a big pimple here,” Short, 74, said on the Tuesday, March 18, episode of Amy Poehler’s “Good Hang” podcast. “She was just so original. The size of her purse, the fullness of her hair, and you know, I fell for her madly.”

Short was 22 when he dated Radner, who was four years older than him. He revealed that the couple “would break up” and “get back [together] every couple years.”

“In fact, I’ll tell you exactly what is very interesting,” Short said. “Gilda had, you know, emotional ups and downs. And I had just gone through a period where my parents had died, and my mother had died, and all she wanted to do was live. And she was the happiest person in the world.”

A rep for Short, 73, denied the actor and Streep, 74, are dating, telling The Messenger in a statement, “They are just very good friends, nothing more.” Dating rumors ramped up after Short […]

He continued, “So to me, one of the issues that Gilda and I had, what we’d have fights about, was I think, ‘What do you have to be not happy about? You’re talented, you have family money, everyone loves you, everyone wants to be your friend, everyone wants to date you, no one is funnier, you get the biggest laughs of anyone on stage.’ But I was only 22. I didn’t understand.”

When Poehler, 53, noted that she would’ve “really love[d]” Radner, Short replied, “You would’ve been madly in love with her.” (Radner died in 1989 of ovarian cancer at the age of 42.)

Short revealed in his 2014 memoir, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, that the pair met when he was cast by Stephen Schwartz for his 1972 production of Godspell. While he and Radner were on a break, Short met Nancy Dolman.

Short went on to tie the knot with Dolman, who died in 2010 of ovarian cancer after 30 years of marriage. (Short and Dolman welcomed three children via adoption: Katherine Elizabeth, 41, Oliver Patrick, 38, and Henry Hayter, 35.)

“I believe that when people die, they zoom into the people that love them,” Short told AARP The Magazine in 2019. “This idea that it just ends, and don’t speak of them — that’s wrong. That’s based on denial that we’re all going to die. So to me, she’s still here.”

Short has since sparked romance rumors with Only Murders in the Building costar Meryl Streep. Amid speculation, Short denied that he and Streep, 75, were more than friends.

“We’re not a couple,” Short said during an appearance on the “Club Random with Bill Maher” podcast in January 2024. “We are just very close friends.”

It doesn't take a genius to figure it out, the princesses are based on Disney classics ... ""Cinderella,"" Jasmine from ""Aladdin,"" Belle from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Ariel from ""Little Mermaid,"" and Aurora from ""Sleeping Beauty.""

Steamboat Willie -- the OG Mickey Mouse from 1928 -- is now in the public domain ... meaning the beloved Disney IP is up for grabs thanks to an expired copyright.

This gives filmmakers free rein to twist Mickey into whichever version they prefer ... and ""Screamboat"" is a horror comedy.

Multiple sources tell us ... Kyle was looking to possibly scoop up the 6-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom Beverly Hills house just feet away from LVP's famous Villa Rosa property. We're told Kyle toured the place a few times, even bringing along her daughters.

Our sources say Kyle's interest in the property had nothing to do with Lisa living in the neighborhood. Instead, we're told she really liked the house.

Unfortunately for Kyle, the house sold to a buyer at the end of February for $6.9 million.

Lisa and her husband, Ken Todd, have been fixtures in the celebrity enclave since 2011. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan previously owned the house, but sold it for $5.9 million in 2021 following their divorce.

When we reached Lisa for comment, she told us, ""What on earth. I thought that house was sold. This house is 10 feet away from me. A shame her offer wasn’t accepted because she’d finally be able to move into Beverly Hills."" Kyle was living in Bel Air and then moved to Encino in 2017.

A rep for Kyle denies LVP's claim she ever made an offer. The rep says she never put in an offer because she decided the area is too much of a fire hazard.",tmz

You know the one. A kitchen that, when Architectural Digest unveiled it in a home tour in 2022, virally eclipsed the entire Nancy Meyers canon as the bougie platonic ideal. The Mediterranean-blue plates lining a wall. The marble-topped island range, where Paltrow lovingly concocts Instagram-famous “boyfriend breakfasts” for her husband of six years, TV producer Brad Falchuk. The room is bathed in natural California light and almost eerily quiet because, as we also know, her children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, 20, and Moses, 18, are off at college.

“I’m Gwyneth,” she says by way of introduction, and of course she is.

Paltrow wears a greige cardigan, white wide-leg jeans, shearling-lined clogs, and no apparent makeup. (Stealth wealth, which we’ll get to in a bit.) At 52 she looks refreshingly like herself, with flaxen hair and vintage Noxzema-commercial skin. Unlike many of her contemporaries (not to mention much younger stars), she hasn’t plumped her subtle fine lines or her lips into the atmosphere.

Paltrow’s reputation—her iconography, over three decades—looms to a ridiculous degree. She’s the nostalgic ’90s waif and pixied Pitt (and Affleck) paramour the paparazzi, then the internet, never got over; the weeping Oscar winner turned woo-woo Goop guru. But here in her kitchen at 8 a.m. on this given Thursday, Paltrow is a mortal woman in the middle of a not-super-Goopy routine. She woke up before 6 and checked her email in the dark. Though she stocks almond, hemp, and macadamia milks for guests (we’ll get to the raw milk of it all too), the wellness maven takes her own coffee with a splash of heavy cream. (Dairy credit: Clover Sonoma organic, I think.) And her group chat is blowing up.

“Our friend Demi got nominated,” Paltrow beams as a screenshot pops up on her laptop showing her, a bespectacled Demi Moore, podcaster–slash–Nobody Wants This producer Sara Foster, and jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer with mouths agape on FaceTime this morning, which happens to be Oscar nomination day, celebrating Moore’s nod for The Substance. Seeing Moore get her due at 62, for a role about a woman’s worth in their ageist industry—“It’s so fucking rad what’s happening,” Paltrow purrs.

“There’s this weird, deep grief that comes with letting go, saying goodbye, and then calling into question your own purpose,” Paltrow says. “Who am I now?”

Paltrow quit Hollywood before it could even think of quitting her, but now she, too, is poised for the radness of a comeback. She’s emerging from soft retirement with her first substantial film role in 15 years in director Josh Safdie’s period Ping-Pong romp Marty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet as the titular 1950s hustler and Paltrow’s sidepiece, which has been teased in a passionate makeout scene rippling online. Rumors are brewing about a Venice Film Festival premiere late this summer (though studio A24 says the chatter is not accurate). Cinephiles are already frothing over Marty’s Christmas Day release, a marquee date for awards contenders.

“She’s a movie star. I say that in the cosmic sense. She’s got a gravitational pull that only a camera can depict,” says Safdie. “I think her absence from acting has lent a vulnerability to her abilities.” It doesn’t seem like posturing when Paltrow tells me she was nervous—really nervous—to return. She counts 2010’s Country Strong as the last movie in which she was “laying it all on the line and accessing a kind of vulnerability.” With all due respect to Pepper Potts and the Marvel universe, “it’s different when you’re reprising an Avengers thing.” Plagued by self-doubt, Paltrow turned to one of the few other Hollywood heavyweights who peaced in her prime. “Cameron Diaz is one of my best friends, sorry to name-drop,” she grins. Diaz, who’d already unretired for the Netflix thrill ride Back in Action, encouraged her to “think about the richness and the deepening of your life,” Paltrow recalls. “That’s all material.”

She considers it, sipping her creamed coffee: “I’ve gone through a lot since the last time I was onscreen in a real way.”

Paltrow is reentering Hollywood while she juggles being the embattled CEO of her intrepid lifestyle company, Goop, determined to refocus her corporate baby in the wake of layoffs last fall and headlines that seemed to revel in the reorganization. And after dedicating herself to motherhood since Apple’s birth in 2004, she’s contending with the disorienting sadness and newfound freedom of her children leaving their Brentwood nest, a former equestrian estate she listed last June and was in the process of selling before the wildfires ravaged her hometown—the movers are en route to Montecito as we speak. (Days later, news broke of the $22 million sale.) Plus, “I’m going through hard-core perimenopause,” Paltrow notes, “which doesn’t help.”",tmz

Fans finally got to see archrivals Alabama Barker and Bhad Bhabie duke it out ... well, sort of. A Tennessee strip club hired impersonators to fight each other in the ring Monday night -- and we have it all on video.

Check it out ... the pair playfully go at it, rolling around the ring in super skimpy outfits at Mouse’s Ear in Johnson City. AB's blonde look-alike rocks a barely-there bedazzled thong one-piece, while BB's impersonator sports a black halter bikini. ... even giving a twerking show before going in for the fight.

The mock match was well-received from the standing-room-only crowd, an eyewitness tells TMZ. The source adds it was like watching ""America's Sweethearts of 2025"" battle for the crown ... which we're told ""Bhad Bhabie"" took home.

AB also threatened violence in ""Cry Bhabie"" ... in addition to claiming BB is jealous of her and bragging that BB's baby daddy Le Vaughn tried to get with her.

This, of course, was after Bhabie insinuated Alabama slept with with Tyga and Soulja Boy in her January song ""Over Cooked."" She and Tyga both vehemently denied the allegation, as did SB.

Machine Gun Kelly has turned his sorrow over the death of close pal Luke ""The Dingo"" Trembath into a song ... with the release of a heartfelt tribute, titled ""your name forever.""

The music video is shot by MGK's longtime director Sam Cahill and uses splices of scenes from Dingo's funeral, in addition to a rooftop performance of the track.

On the song, MGK admits he went too far during their last argument, and notes Dingo left his coat at his house ... a reminder he'll never return to pick it up.

Dingo died last month and his cause of death is still unknown ... but his community of mourners have been rallying nonstop.

Popular muralist Royyal Dog painted a life-sized portrait of Dingo, and attendees at the funeral posed in front together in solidarity.

The late snowboarder's friends Synyster Gates and M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Oli Sykes of Bring Me The Horizon, Johnny Cappelletty, and Mod Sun all joined MGK in recording the track.",tmz

The reality TV star blasted her estranged hubby in a new interview with People, telling the outlet about the great lengths Christian would allegedly go to in order to mess with her.

Christine claimed, ""There were times where my husband, literally, where I had to go to work and he would lay himself under my car. I would sit for an hour until I finally missed a meeting and gave up and would go back inside, or he would shut the gates down so I couldn't leave. It was bad.""

What's more, Christine also claimed Christian locked her out of her bank accounts, credit cards and email by commandeering her phone number.

She claims he ""hacked"" her out of her entire life and ""stripped"" her life down to where she ""literally had nothing"" ... adding, ""And it was dehumanizing.""

TMZ broke the story ... Christian filed for divorce last April after weeks of volatility between them, which included his assault with a deadly weapon arrest and dueling requests for temporary restraining orders.
