According to Crypto Rover, a potential full ceasefire and permanent peace negotiation between Trump and Putin is seen as highly bullish for Bitcoin. This development could lead to increased investor confidence in cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset during times of geopolitical stability.

Boxford police Detective Nathaniel Peabody presents a check for the recovered cryptocurrency funds to resident Paul Miller at the station.

BOXFORD — Police say they have successfully recovered funds for a Boxford resident who fell victim to a sophisticated PayPal/Bitcoin scam last summer, marking the first time in Essex County authorities have been able to seize and reclaim cryptocurrency from an exchange.

The case began June 26, when the resident reported being scammed out of $13,000 after receiving a fraudulent email from PayPal, Boxford police said in a news release this week. The scam led the victim to a phone number displayed on his computer, where he was misled into believing a refund error had occurred and instructed to send funds back via Bitcoin.

Tech giant Microsoft shared a new report warning of malware that targets 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets used with the Google Chrome extension.



Microsoft's Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post.



According to the team, the malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet.



While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software.



“Due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape,” the team wrote.

It is not every day that you hear someone call Bitcoin BTCUSD not just a bad investment but outright harmful to the economy. But then again, Peter Schiff is not just anyone. 

The economist, known as the biggest skeptic of cryptocurrencies and an equally popular gold proponent, has once again taken aim at Bitcoin, this time framing it as a destructive force for the United States of America. 

While his views might not sit well with crypto enthusiasts, Schiff's arguments are hard to ignore, especially when you look at what is happening on the markets.

Bitcoin will cause a lot of people to lose a lot of money, and its been very harmful to the U.S. economy.

Bitcoin vs. gold

The precious metal has been on a tear recently, closing above $3,000 for the first time ever, a milestone that Schiff believes is just the beginning. Silver, too, is flexing its muscles, trading at $34.10, while U.S. stocks are lagging behind their foreign counterparts. 

The expert points out the irony in the new U.S. administration's reported moves: selling domestic stocks to buy foreign ones and, as he alleges, dumping Bitcoin to invest into gold. It is an occurrence that, in his view, shows where smart money is at.TradingView">

But let's talk about Bitcoin for a moment. Schiff is not buying the hype, and he is not alone. Since its peak in November 2021, the cryptocurrency has lost 26% of its value against gold, a trend that Schiff says underscores the growing outflow of investors from crypto to the precious metal.

“What do you think they're buying with the money?” he asks, pointing to the downtrend in Bitcoin's price as evidence that gold is leaving "crypto in the dust."

Then there's inflation

He argues that while the "tariff war" is often blamed for rising prices, the real issue is inflation - something the Federal Reserve has failed to take under control. 

As the cost of goods climbs higher, Schiff believes gold will continue to shine, while Bitcoin's so-called resilience will be put to the test as ETF investors start cashing out.

For now, Bitcoin is indeed struggling, losing the $82,000 price point today. But whether Schiff's predictions come true remains to be seen. 

One thing is for sure, though: his warnings about Bitcoin's impact on the economy are as bold as ever.

Bitcoin could shoot up in the near future.

The wider crypto market is certain to feel the change if the Federal Reserve ends its quantitative tightening program in May. There is some indication that this could happen, with crypto prediction platform Polymarket anticipating a high probability of that occurring.



This policy permits the central bank to sell bonds that reduce the supply of cash floating around in order to keep inflation low and keep the economy in a safe place. If this policy winds down, as many expect it to, that could drastically increase the value of cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin. Because these digital funds get a large part of their value from their limited supply, they could become more valuable if the U.S. government takes its hands off the fiat currency supply.

Bitcoin is down 0.95% today to $82,273 (BTC/USD), and it has gained slightly over the last week. Tariff concerns and sticky inflation are keeping Bitcoin low, as both of these factors limit how much money people have available to risk on cryptocurrency.

Discretionary spending has been tight this year, with January marked as a month of high consumer prices and tight inflation. February was a bit better, but the economy is still in a rough spot, and the stock market is also being hit hard by new tariff policies that have kept the stock indices negative for four weeks. All of this hurts cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and makes investors wary of putting their money into decentralized finance.

What may happen, though, if the Federal Reserve decides to decrease their quantitative tightening (QT), is that Bitcoin and other crypto tokens could shoot up. This may happen near the end of April in anticipation of the end of QT. That could bring Bitcoin back over the $100K mark in a big way. While it is still unlikely that the coin will hit $150K this year, it is the potential for QT ending that holds the most promise right now that Bitcoin will skyrocket.

Investors are also hoping that President Donald Trump will improve the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrency. If that happens this year, it could mean that there will be fewer crypto restrictions, and it will become easier to trade Bitcoin.

Key Takeaways

The biggest financial manager in the world, BlackRock, just bought Bitcoin valued at $42.3 million, therefore underlining its increasing dedication to digital assets. Especially via its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has drawn significant investor attention, the company has progressively raised its exposure to Bitcoin.

The purchase fits BlackRock's more general plan of increasing its range of cryptocurrencies. The new Bitcoin acquisition by BlackRock fits CEO Larry Fink's changing attitude on cryptocurrencies, from doubt to strong encouragement. Institutional players like BlackRock are positioned to gain from Bitcoin's long-term growth as acceptance of the cryptocurrency picks speed. The company's ongoing Bitcoin accumulation points to growing faith in its function as a store of value and counter against economic volatility.

BlackRock's interest in Bitcoin is notable given its weight in conventional finance. With more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM), the company's support of Bitcoin provides institutional investors contemplating exposure to digital assets with a great confirmation.  Since its introduction, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has been performing rather well and drawing billions of inflows.

Apart from BlackRock's investment, ARK Invest under Cathie Wood bought $88.5 million worth of Bitcoin, therefore proving institutional conviction in the commodity. Regularly raising its visibility via both direct investments and its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), ARK Invest has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin's promise.



This purchase fits ARK Invest's optimistic long-term view of Bitcoin; Cathie Wood has projected that by 2030 Bitcoin might be valued at $1 million each coin. In the changing financial scene, the company sees Bitcoin as a major asset especially as demand for distributed assets driven by global economic instability and inflation worries shapes the scene.

One of the most ardent institutional backers of Bitcoin, ARK Invest's most recent acquisition lends more validity to the asset's prospective.

With BlackRock's combined investments of more than $130 million in a single day plus ARK Invest's, the market receives a strong positive signal.

The growing curiosity of institutional players like BlackRock and ARK Invest has significant effects on the direction of the Bitcoin market.

Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto.

Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump's White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom.

“When there's financial distress, they always print money. It doesn't matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News.

The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump's on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession.

"When the floodgates open, it's go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they're going to reflate and print more money than anyone's ever printed before.”

The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing.

“We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said.

Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices.

“All eyes are on the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week,” BlackRock analysts wrote in a note.

The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed's latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump's campaign to see them brought down.

Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell's all-important, post-decision press conference.</p>

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the Governor of the Bank of France and a prominent member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has cautioned against the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., hinting at possible global financial instability. In a recent interview with La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy de Galhau criticized the policies of the Trump administration here, characterizing them as potential precursors to future crises.

The support for the cryptocurrency industry from the Trump administration has been significant, with initiatives such as the formation of a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets and the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated volatility, with Bitcoin's value plummeting below $80,000—a stark 25% decrease from its January high of $109,000. This slump reflects broader investor uncertainty, as evidenced by the S&P 500's more than 10% decline following Trump's tariff threats on European spirits.

While the ECB remains wary of cryptocurrencies, describing them as speculative assets, Europe is actively pursuing a more structured approach through its digital payments infrastructure initiative. This reflects the ECB's preference for a digital euro, a central bank digital currency that stands in contrast to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.

Villeroy de Galhau's comments also underscore Europe's apprehension regarding the U.S.'s relaxed regulatory stance on crypto. This concern is evidenced by the European Union's introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), aiming to establish a coherent regulatory framework across its member states. Although MiCA seeks to provide clarity and stability, its rigorous requirements may pose challenges for smaller crypto firms.

As the U.S. and Europe continue to develop divergent regulatory philosophies on cryptocurrency, the impact of these differences on the global crypto industry's future remains to be seen.

The Bitcoin price appears to be holding its breath ahead of tomorrow's Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has slid just below $83,000, having lost 0.8% in the past day, according to CoinGecko data.

Traders are moving a lot less Bitcoin than they were this time last week, when President Donald Trump's trade war again got put on pause. In the past 24 hours, $22 billion worth of Bitcoin has changed hands—a very sharp drop from the $49 billion worth of volume BTC saw a week ago.

Only 1% of traders are holding out hope that the Federal Reserve will announce a rate cut tomorrow, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. President Trump has been among the voices calling for the Fed to drop rates.

"I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world," Trump said in remarks made over video to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The Bank of England and European Central Bank have all cut rates recently. And the Bank of Japan is expected to pause its rate hikes at its next meeting.

But the Fed hasn't budged.

Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said markets could see some positive action if Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at least keeps hope alive that the FOMC will cut rates later in the year.

"Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin's growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact," he said in a market note shared with Decrypt.

Analysts at Singapore-based QCP Capital agreed that traders could shift sentiment if Powell leaves hope alive. "While we do not anticipate a surprise cut, any dovish signal from Powell could be the catalyst that sparks upside momentum," they wrote in a market note Tuesday morning.

Although Lee expects some volatility immediately during and after Powell's remarks, scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m. EST, Lee added that Bitcoin could drop as low as $80,000.

"Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence," he said, "while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level."

Users of MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, are evenly split on whether Bitcoin's price will top $83,000 by the end of the day on March 23.

As macroeconomic turmoil has battered markets, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has taken a big hit since the start of the year.

Open interest reached a 2025 peak of $69 billion on January 21, but has since dropped by 30% to $48 billion, according to Coinglass data. Derivatives traders use futures contracts to bet on future price movements. That cuts both ways. When uncertainty lingers, open interest starts to dry up.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and a key member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has warned that the U.S.'s increasing embrace of cryptocurrencies.

Trump's administration has been actively supporting the cryptocurrency industry, pushing for major reforms to make the U.S. the global leader in digital assets. Under his leadership, the U.S. has formed a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and introduced several crypto-friendly initiatives. However, the market's reaction has been volatile. Bitcoin, for example, recently dropped below $80,000, marking a 25% decline from its January peak of $109,000, highlighting investor uncertainty. The S&P 500 also fell over 10% after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European spirits.

The ECB has been critical of crypto's speculative nature, with ECB President Christine Lagarde previously calling Bitcoin a “speculative asset with no intrinsic value.” The bank has warned that unregulated digital currencies could undermine global financial stability. In contrast, the ECB has been working toward a more controlled approach with its digital payments infrastructure initiative, which aims to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), such as the digital euro. This initiative reflects the ECB's preference for safer, state-backed solutions as opposed to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.

Villeroy de Galhau's comments reflect Europe's growing concern about the U.S.'s laissez-faire attitude toward crypto. He believes Europe must strengthen its negotiating position to counterbalance the U.S. and avoid complacency in the face of the shifting global financial landscape. The ECB's regulatory approach stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has eased its regulatory crackdown on crypto platforms.

Furthermore, the European Union has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), designed to create a unified regulatory framework for the crypto sector across its 27 member states. While MiCA aims to provide more clarity and stability in the market, its strict licensing and compliance requirements could pose challenges for smaller crypto firms, especially those struggling to meet capital reserve and consumer protection standards.

As both the U.S. and Europe continue to shape their approaches to cryptocurrency, the potential clash in their regulatory philosophies could have lasting effects on the future of the global crypto industry.

Analysts speculate that a whale may have set up a $520 million Bitcoin short 40x leverage position on Hyperliquid as a trap to trigger a massive long.

On Mar. 16, a Bitcoin (BTC) whale placed a massive $520 million short position on Hyperliquid (HYPE) using 40x leverage, making it one of the largest known trades on the decentralized exchange. 

With a liquidation price of $85,561, the trade would be wiped out if Bitcoin rose just 1.75% from his entry at $83,898. This immediately drew the attention of traders who saw an opportunity to force a liquidation.

Pseudonymous trader Cbb0fe took to X  to rally a group to push Bitcoin's price higher and trigger the liquidation. The price surged by 2.5% within minutes on the same day, nearly hitting the whale's threshold before they added more funds to raise their liquidation price.

According to 10x Research's Mar. 17 report, analyst Markus Thielen noted that this event is part of a growing trend involving the democratization of stop-loss hunting. In this trend, independent traders, not just institutions, coordinate to move the market, powered by the transparency of leverage trading on DEXs.

Some analysts, however, think the whale's massive position might be a calculated strategy rather than a case of a careless short gone wrong. According to cryptocurrency analyst Josh Man, the whale might be intentionally exposing their position to liquidation in order to support a price rally, a rare tactic known as “self-liquidation.” 

So this there is a fairly rare and not widely used technique of self-liquidation and this FEELS a little like that.   In such events, the seller is actually creating a bomb designed to go off and create a rally from the liquidation of his own short.   One would expect that he has… https://t.co/JNcnCLO2E0

If the whale holds an even larger long position elsewhere, their own short liquidation could send Bitcoin higher, benefiting their long position significantly.

This isn't the first time Hyperliquid has seen such high-stakes plays. Just last week, a trader placed a $285 million leveraged Ethereum (ETH) bet that resulted in a $4 million loss for the platform. In response, Hyperliquid reduced leverage limits for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Now, the crypto community is watching the price movement of Bitcoin. Further upward momentum could be fueled if the whale's short position is liquidated. In any case, independent traders and the whale are currently engaged in a risky game of high-stakes competition in this trade.

Some cities in the metro area are making an effort to ban cryptocurrency machines due scam risks. FOX 9's Mike Manzoni has the story.

FOREST LAKE, Minn. (FOX 9) - The Forest Lake City Council met Monday night to discuss how to handle a surge in scams involving cryptocurrency kiosks.

The backstory:

Forest Lake police said victims have lost more than $300,000 in schemes involving cryptocurrency kiosks over the last two years. The Forest Lake City Council met Monday night to consider how to clamp down on the scams. The options include regulating or banning virtual currency machines.

What is cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is purchased electronically. Both Bitcoin and Ether are popular cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency is used for payments and as an investment.

How the scams work:

The scammers typically impersonate police officers or government officials, often convincing victims over the phone that they have committed a crime and need to pay money to avoid jail time. The scammers then stay on the phone and force the victims to lie to bank tellers, police officers and others. The scams conclude when the victims wire funds to the scammers via cryptocurrency kiosks, which are found at many convenience stores.

Scammers also commonly use investment fraud schemes, which involve convincing victims to send them funds under the guise of investments. In many cases, the victims never recover their lost money.

What are the city's options:

The city council has three options: do not take any action, pass an ordinance requiring owners to register kiosks or ban them outright.

During Monday night's meeting, the council expressed support for an ordinance.

The ordinance would impose a $2,000 to $3,000 fee and require signage and cameras at kiosk locations to deter fraud. In addition, a kiosk operator would not be allowed to register if there were three or more reported instances of fraud involving one of their kiosks in the preceding 12 months.

What they're saying:

"The employees will even see people come in all confused standing at the kiosk and they'll ask them questions like, ‘Do you know what you're doing? Do you need help?' And they're so wrapped up in the scam that they just brush everyone off," explained Forest Lake police Detective Nathan Olstad.

The City of Woodbury has reported $6.6 million in cryptocurrency losses from kiosks and online transactions since 2021. The City of White Bear Lake reported about $125,000 in losses in 2023.

The cities of Stillwater, Hastings and Cottage Grove are considering banning kiosks.

Big picture view:

In 2023, the FBI received more than 5,500 complaints involving cryptocurrency kiosks, with losses totaling more than $189 million. There were nearly 70,000 reports of fraud involving cryptocurrency, with total losses of $5.6 billion, a 45 percent increase from the previous year, according to the FBI. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the losses have increased tenfold since 2020.

In 2023, there were 976 complaints involving cryptocurrency fraud in Minnesota, with total losses of more than $75 million, according to the FBI. The state ranks in the top 20 for both virtual currency fraud reports and losses.

What's next:

The city council will discuss an ordinance requiring owners to register cryptocurrency kiosks at its March 24 meeting.
