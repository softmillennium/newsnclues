Institutional investors surveyed by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon were more likely to own XRP than Solana in January, according to a report published by the firms on Tuesday.

Bitcoin and Ethereum were widely held by 352 respondents based worldwide, yet 34% of them had allocated to the Ripple Labs-linked token compared to 30% for Solana. Around 25% of institutional investors also owned Dogecoin.

Tuesday’s report noted that a majority of institutional investors held just one or two cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, which U.S. investors can easily get exposure to through exchange-traded funds launched last year.

While a number of asset managers have filed applications for XRP and Solana ETFs, and analysts think they have a solid chance of receiving approval, most investors have few opportunities to gain exposure to the altcoins using a traditional brokerage account.

When it comes to registered vehicles that hold crypto as an underlying asset, most institutions said they prefer products resembling ETFs. Although around one and three institutional investors had allocated to XRP or Solana, 29% preferred holding assets in a digital wallet instead.

Despite this preference, Coinbase and EY-Parthenon’s survey found that an investor’s location had little impact on which altcoins they had allocated to. Though ETF applications have garnered excitement, the authors suggested that ETFs in the U.S. may not influence ownership trends much.

Still, 68% of respondents said they would likely invest in new crypto exchange-traded products that track a single asset. Coinbase and EY-Parthenon used XRP and Solana as examples.

The survey’s snapshot of institutional trends concluded on Jan. 24, four days after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. .

Since then, Solana has relinquished the entirety of its post-election gains, while XRP still changes hands at several times the value that it did on Election Day last year.

Analysts say that Trump’s crypto-friend stance means more for XRP than Solana because the asset’s associated business model faced existential threats from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, namely the agency’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs over XRP sales.

The Commission has adopted a collaborative approach to crypto firms under Trump’s watch, but 53% of respondents highlighted crypto’s “uncertain” regulatory backdrop as a concern.

When it comes to which digital assets are commodities versus securities, 49% of respondents said it was the most important area for clarity. Half cited crypto custody rules.

The SEC has created a Crypto Task Force to establish clearer rules, but lawmakers are also weighing a crypto markets structure bill on Capitol Hill. That bill would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight over the emergent industry.

The 2025 Ford Escape ST-Line is a cut above the standard SUV

Ford's Escape SUV slots in below the Explorer, offering a lower cost of entry, smaller overall dimensions, and a focus on fuel efficiency that the larger Ford SUVs don't prioritize as much. As a result, it's a pretty good SUV for new families or people that have space-intensive hobbies. The ST-Line is the first rung up the 2025 Escape trim ladder, asking just $845 more than the base Active trim, and you won't wonder where your money goes.

The 2025 Ford Escape ST-Line is heavy on features and light on frills

For the additional cash you spend on the ST-Line, you get a few key upgrades. Eight-way power seats take the place of the standard six-way manual ones. Larger 18-inch wheels replace the standard 17-inch units, and you get a pair of black-painted roof rails. The ST-Line also gets a slightly sportier grille design. Inside, a flat-bottom steering wheel with red stitching replaces the standard black one, and the same red stitching adorns the vinyl and cloth seats that are also unique to the ST-Line. You also unlock the available hybrid engine, which gets you a 12-horsepower advantage over the entry-level model. That powertrain commands a further $2,495 premium, but offers commensurately better fuel economy of 39 vs. 30 combined mpg for the standard SUV.

There are great alternatives, but the ST-Line stays competitive

2023 Ford Escape ST-Line EliteFord

The 2025 Ford Escape ST-Line, whether in hybrid guise or relying fully on gas power, faces a lineup of supremely confident competitors. The small SUV/crossover segment's standard bearer, the Honda CR-V, is included in the bunch. Its higher base price is offset by better out-of-the-box performance and a significantly higher cargo capacity of 75 cubic feet vs the Escape's 65 cubic feet. However, Edmunds ranks the Escape higher overall and consumer sentiment seems to mirror that appraisal. Furthermore, the base CR-V offers fewer speakers, smaller 17-inch wheels, and an optional 9-inch infotainment screen that is dwarfed by the ST-Line's offers a 13.2-inch screen.

Another solid competitor is the Mazda CX-5 2.5 S Select, which doesn't offer a hybrid powertrain but does offer some stuff that costs extra on the Escape ST-Line. Heated and leatherette-trimmed seats join standard all-wheel drive and a slightly more powerful 2.5-liter engine. The ST-Line and CX-5 2.5 S Select both offer six-speaker audio systems, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Despite the Mazda's higher MSRP of $31,520, it lacks cargo space comparatively, making do with just 58 cubic feet.

Final thoughts

Based on competitive analysis, we think the Ford Escape ST-Line is well-rounded but perhaps lacks focus. The Honda CR-V is better bare-bones transportation, and the CX-5 is arguably better to drive and much prettier. That said, the Escape ST-Line undercuts both on price and maintains advantages in some areas. Most importantly, it builds value with options its rivals can't match, like the $995 fancy touchscreen. The 2025 Ford Escape ST-Line is worth $29,995, but we recommend driving it back-to-back with competitors before deciding it's your next family hauler.</p>

Heroes of Mavia, a blockchain-based mobile strategy game that launched in early 2024, has seen the price of its token surge over the last week ahead of teased upgrades and expansion plans from creator Skrice Studios.

The MAVIA token on Ethereum has spiked by 430% over the last week, according to data from CoinGecko, reaching a current price of $0.61. It's the largest gainer by far in CoinGecko's Gaming (GameFi) category during that span.

Granted, the token's price had plunged substantially over the last year since it launched in February 2024. MAVIA peaked at a price of $10.59 just a couple weeks after it launched, then lost significant value over the following months, dipping to an all-time low under a penny just last week.

Even after the latest spike, MAVIA remains down 94% from its peak.

What's driving the surge isn't obvious, as Skrice hasn't made substantial moves around the Clash of Clans-like mobile game since the price started to take off on Sunday. However, the team did make several announcements closer to the start of the month.

In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), the official game account noted plans to create a "GameLink" hub to bring together crypto games across various platforms and blockchain ecosystems, along with various game enhancements and plans to launch "six flagship games"—including an "optimized and balanced" version of Heroes of Mavia.

These changes will streamline operations, improve collaboration, and ensure we deliver on our promises to you. Rest assured, our focus remains on the project’s success and the… — Heroes of Mavia (@MaviaGame) March 3, 2025

The changes included "reorganizing the core team," including moves to "streamline operations" and "improve collaboration."

MAVIA trading has surged since the price climb, rising from under $2 million on Saturday to a current rolling 24-hour mark of $100 million. The token has a current market cap of $32.1 million, making it the 863rd most valuable cryptocurrency by that metric.</p>

Strategy said that dividend payments will begin paying out on June 30, 2025

To date, Strategy holds under 500k Bitcoin, valued at over $40 billion

Strategy is planning to offer five million shares of the company’s Series A perpetual strife preferred stock, $STRF, as it works on acquiring more Bitcoin.

In an announcement, Michael Saylor’s Strategy said it intends to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes,” including the “acquisition of Bitcoin.” However, it noted that this was “subject to market, and other conditions.”

According to the company, the shares will accumulate cumulative dividends at a fixed rate of 10% per year. Dividends will be paid out beginning on June 30, 2025 “out of funds legally available for their payment,” Strategy said.

Raising funds for Bitcoin

The news comes as Strategy announced earlier this month that it’s planning to issue and sell shares of up to $21 billion in its at-the-market (ATM) program.

Through selling shares of its 8.00% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, $STRK, Strategy said the additional capital will be used for general corporate operations, including the purchase of more Bitcoin.

The latest news also follows a recent Bitcoin purchase Strategy made in an announcement yesterday. In a post on X, Saylor said it had acquired 130 Bitcoin for $10.7 million at an average price of $82,981 per Bitcoin.

Strategy has acquired 130 BTC for ~$10.7M at ~$82,981 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 6.9% YTD 2025. As of 3/16/2025, we hodl 499,226 $BTC acquired for ~$33.1 billion at ~$66,360 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK https://t.co/8xRmR8vlIt — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 17, 2025

To date, Strategy now holds 499,226 Bitcoin, valued at $40.92 billion, according to SaylorTracker.com.

Peter Schiff, a long-time opponent of Bitcoin, commented on Saylor’s tweet, saying: “Is that all you bought? Seems like you are running out of fire power.”

Crypto prices decline

News of Strategy’s recent Bitcoin purchase and its share offering comes as crypto prices across the market have seen a sharp decline.

At the time of publishing, Bitcoin is trading around $81,000, a substantial drop from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Market conditions and geopolitical issues continue to impact prices despite Trump signing an executive order in March to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>

Just don't look for the new circuit on a map. You probably won't find it.

The race will relocate to Madrid beginning in 2026—even though the existing event Barcelona still holds its 2026 contract, too—with a semi-permanent street track set to wind its way around the IFEMA exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital. F1 has raced at the current location in the Catalunya region since 1991, and the series has never visited Madrid.

Here's where the fun really begins. The track was last week given its official name and, drumroll please, it is called the Madring.

Why Madring? Well, it merges Madrid, and ring, and doesn’t really require much more explanation. But organizers gave us one anyway.

“Formula 1 circuits are typically referred to by the city or region where they are located—Monza, Imola, Interlagos, Spa, Silverstone, Miami, Las Vegas,” read the official release. “However, their full official names are rarely used.

"For this reason, Madring aims to establish a concise and memorable identity that directly references its host city, is instantly recognizable worldwide, and requires no translation. Ultimately, it is more than just a name—it is a genuine, distinctive, and iconic brand, designed to resonate with a modern and engaged F1 audience.”

C2 Corvette Grand Sport Plays With LS Power

Few names in Chevy heritage are as respected as the C2 Corvette Grand Sport. Perhaps that’s why some purists have a strong aversion to continuation models like this, especially when they come with a modern LS engine. But we like this sports car and think it would be a fun toy to own.

This Porsche barn find is unbelievable.

Originally, the Grand Sport was a strictly a racecar, not a street-legal production model. Chevy created it as a smaller, lighter version of the C2 Corvette specifically to take on the Shelby Cobra, which is why some call it the Mongoose (a snake killer).

Superformance has permission from GM to make these continuation cars, which can be driven on public roads. Some people think continuation cars are inferior garbage or something that shouldn’t exist. Others find them to be great ways of having fun. It can be a divisive topic.

Under the vented hood of this Grand Sport is a 408ci LS2 V8 built by V’s Performance. As you can see, it has velocity stacks via Borla. With upgraded internals, it’s tuned to make just under 500-whp.

With a curb weight under 3,000 lbs. this Grand Sport will move. A T56 Magnum XL 6-speed manual transmission backs that engine, adding to the fun a driver gets to have in this ride.

When it comes to the chassis, there are Bilstein coilovers up front, and a single leaf transverse setup made of a carbon composite. Instead of the original single-piston disc brakes, the Wilwoods come with six-piston calipers in front and four-piston in the rear.

We’re fans of well-done continuation cars like this one from Superformance. It pays tribute to the original Grand Sports yet pushes modern performance and reliability, which in our minds is the best of both worlds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Synthetic motor oils have been around for a while now, longer than most gearheads realize. The first synthetic hydrocarbon oils were created by French chemist Charles Friedel and his American associate James Mason Crafts in 1877. Thirty-six years later, in 1913, a German scientist named Friedrich Bergius figured out a process for creating synthetic oil from coal dust. A few years later, a pair of his countrymen named Franz Fisher and Hans Tropsch figured out how to make synthetics out of a combination of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

Standard Oil tried to commercialize synthetic oil in 1929, but it didn't stick due to lack of demand and, well, we had that Depression going on at the time. Scientists from all over the world kept working on it, though, and synthetic oil technology kept inching forward. Synthetics got a huge boost during WWII as the Nazi war machine started using it due to sanctions and dwindling domestic oil supplies. Not the best pedigree, you'll agree, but the Wehrmacht trying to figure out how to keep tanks and trucks running without oil gave synthetic technology a huge boost.

After the war, research continued but it wasn't until the 1970s American fuel crisis that synthetics really took off. Today, many cars are shipped from the factory with synthetic oil, and thousands of gallons of digital ink has been spilled on blogs and forums outlining the pros and cons of using it. One of the most contentious arguments about synthetic motor oil — aside from whether or not a true blue gearhead should use it at all — is how long it lasts and how often you should change it.

Well, Just How Long Does It Last?

Modern synthetic oils last an incredibly long time. Thanks to all the detergents, additives, and other concoctions in them, these oils might be good for anywhere from 7,500 miles to 15,000 miles. Extremely high-grade synthetics like Mobil 1 can last as long as 15,000 miles. That's under perfect laboratory conditions, however. Brands put those numbers on the bottle assuming that you'll be driving sedately in light traffic or on the highway.

Actual, real world driving in adverse conditions — heavy traffic, extreme high or low temperatures, dusty, dirty conditions, etc. — can reduce those numbers pretty easily. Driving your car without getting it all the way up to operating temperature also usually counts as adverse conditions, and a lot of short hops with long stretches of inactivity between them can break even the best oil down pretty quickly.

Your best bet, honestly, is to change your oil per your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations as laid out in the owner's manual. These days those reccos can run anywhere from 5,000 to 7,500 miles between oil changes, which seems like madness to those of use raised with the old "every 3,000 miles" rule. The fact is that modern motor oil, whether it's synthetic or good old fashioned dinosaur squeezins, is leaps and bounds better than it was in the '80s or '90s. Obviously, it's your vehicle and you should care for it as you see fit, but you can generally trust those manufacturer reccos and long-lived oils.

Popular AI bot and influencer AiXBT fell victim to a security breach that resulted in the loss of 55.5 ETH—around $105,000 worth at the current price of Ethereum.

The funds were allegedly taken by the creator of a since-deleted X (formerly Twitter) account called FungusMan, which was able to queue malicious X replies into AiXBT’s autonomous response system, generating a tip of 55.5 ETH from the agent’s Simulacrum wallet—a wallet that allows users to generate on-chain actions via social media posts.

In now-deleted posts outlining the heist, AIXBT replied to a post from FungusMan utilizing the Simulacrum tipping feature, sending 55.5 ETH on Ethereum layer-2 network Base to the malicious actor’s address.

simu wallet was cooked but core systems unaffected. if you're trading aixbt this doesn't change fundamentals. expect improved security after server migration. — aixbt (@aixbt_agent) March 18, 2025

“At 2am UTC, a hacker accessed a secure dashboard for AiXBT Agent’s autonomous system, queuing two malicious replies that led to 55 ETH taken from a Simulacrum wallet,” posted the bot’s pseudonymous developer, RXBT, who added that it “was not a result of agent manipulation as we have implemented strong safeguards over the last months.”

Since the incident, RXBT has implemented additional security measures, including migrating servers and swapping access keys while reporting the hacker’s address to centralized exchanges.

“Simu wallet was cooked, but core systems unaffected,” the bot posted in reply to its developer. “If you're trading AIXBT, this doesn't change fundamentals. Expect improved security after server migration.”

Despite the agent’s insistence that the security incident doesn’t change fundamentals, its AIXBT token on Base has not been spared, dropping approximately 20% in the last 24 hours to $0.097. The swift decline continues the token’s downward trend, placing it nearly 90% off its all-time high of $0.94 achieved on January 16.

The leading AI agent’s token decline has come amid a larger slump in AI-related tokens in crypto. The market cap for AI agent tokens, once valued at nearly $17 billion in early January, has dwindled to below $5 billion according to data from CoinGecko.

AiXBT’s developer did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A tried and true classic with some appealing alternatives

The Ford Explorer is one of the mainstays of the midsize SUV segment and one that it helped create. The 2025 Ford Explorer continues that legacy with three rows of seating, anywhere from 16 to 85 cubic feet of cargo space, up to 5,000 pounds of towing capacity, and up to 165 pounds of roof capacity. With all of that put together, it's no wonder that the Explorer remains a popular choice among buyers.

2025 Ford ExplorerFord

Power comes courtesy of a 300-horsepower turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder or a 400-horsepower twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission with either rear- or all-wheel drive. Inside, a 13.2-inch LCD infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard.

2025 Ford ExplorerFord

The Explorer’s performance will certainly meet all of your expectations. What it doesn’t do, and its competitors do, is surpass them in any particular way. While the Ford Explorer remains a solid entry in the class, you might want to look at these competitors instead.

Honda Pilot

The Honda Pilot possesses the traits found in so many Honda vehicles, namely a responsive driveline that inspires confidence behind the wheel.

2025 Honda PilotHonda

Power is adequate for the class, with a standard 285-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 and a 10-speed automatic transmission powering the front wheels, although all-wheel drive is optional. The off-road TrailSport trim provides an extra inch of ground clearance, along with the requisite gear for light-duty off-roading. Towing is rated at 3,500 to 5,000 pounds.

Cargo space is impressive at 19 cubic feet, growing to 89 cubic feet with the seats stowed. It can also carry an additional 165 pounds of cargo on its roof. A seven-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard but opt for an upper trim level, and it grows to nine inches and gains wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

Hyundai Palisade

The Hyundai Palisade proves to be a very competitive entrant in this segment, thanks in part to its 3.8-liter DOHC V6 that funnels 291 horsepower to the front wheels or all four. There are three spacious rows, anywhere from 18 to 86 cubic feet of cargo space, and a roof that can carry 220 pounds of items.

2025 Hyundai PalisadeHyundai

A 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard. Better yet, the Palisade can be filled with indulgent features, like a head-up display, dual sunroofs, heated steering wheel, Wi-Fi hotspot, rear heated seats, and quilted Nappa leather seating.

2025 Hyundai PalisadeHyundai

The Palisade’s relaxed demeanor and tranquil manner are complemented by its precise steering, modest body roll, and plenty of powertrain punch.

Jeep Grand Cherokee L

The Jeep Grand Cherokee L slots between the smaller Grand Cherokee and the larger Wagoneer. It is powered by a 293-horsepower 3.6-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic with rear—or four-wheel drive. It can tow up to 6,200 pounds, has 17-to-85 cubic feet of cargo space, and has a 220-pound roof load capacity.

2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Summit ReserveJeep

This is the SUV to have if you’re a serious off-roader, with 10.9 inches of ground clearance and 24 inches of water-fording ability. Its on-road demeanor reflects its off-road agility, returning a quiet ride and capable handling for such a big boy.

An 8.4—or 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard, while tonier models have a 19-speaker McIntosh audio system, a 10.3-inch passenger screen, and dual 10.1-inch rear screens.

Kia Telluride

More so than the Hyundai Palisade, its corporate cousin, the Kia Telluride, belies its price, particularly on pricier models. Quiet, comfortable, and sophisticated, it plays the part of a luxury SUV without the corresponding price tag. No wonder it’s the current cul-de-sac sweetheart.

2025 Kia TellurideKia

Like its cousin, the Telluride has a potent 291-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6, an 8-speed automatic transmission, and standard front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional. The cargo capacity ranges from 21 to 87 cubic feet, a roof rack is rated at 165 pounds, and its towing capacity is rated at 5,000 pounds. A 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen is standard.

2025 Kia TellurideKia

Mazda CX-90

With its subtle elegance and sophisticated finishes, the CX-90’s elegance is far above its price. However, its sleek urbanity is undermined by its infotainment system, which is controlled by a clunky, console-mounted controller. Power comes from a 3.3-liter inline six-cylinder mild hybrid system with 280 horsepower or 340 horsepower depending on the trim.

2025 Mazda CX-90Mazda

There’s also a 323-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder plug-in hybrid with 26 miles of pure electric range. An 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive come standard. Towing is rated at 5,000 pounds with the Towing Package and 3,500 pounds without it. The The CX-90's cargo capacity ranges from 15 to 74 cubic feet with a roof that can hold 210 pounds.

While it is athletic, there’s no hiding its size and weight. Thankfully, the nicely weighted steering and well-controlled body motions make it rewarding to drive. It’s a true class act – except for its infotainment.

Toyota Grand Highlander

This is the SUV in the gray flannel suit, a bit of family hauler orthodoxy that isn’t exciting but performs with a comprehensive competence that renders it the ultimate automotive butler: seen, but not heard. For many buyers, the Highlander’s strength comes from Toyota’s legendary reputation for reliability and good resale value.

2025 Toyota Grand Highlander PlatinumToyota

Being four inches longer, 2.3 inches wider, and 2 inches taller than the Highlander, there are three voluminous rows and 21 cubic feet of cargo space, expanding to a minivan-like 97.5 cubic feet if you need it. Its roof can also haul 165 pounds. A 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen and a wireless smartphone charging pad are among the standard tech features in the cabin.

2025 Toyota Grand Highlander PlatinumToyota

A 265-hp turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and front-wheel drive are standard, while all-wheel drive is optional. You can also opt for a 245-horsepower or 365-horsepower hybrid with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive as well.

Final thoughts

If you’re in the market for a three-row, family-hauling SUV, there are plenty of choices. While the Ford Explorer is certainly sufficient, there are others that outclass it, whether it’s the Mazda’s on-road athleticism, the Jeep’s off-road athleticism, the Kia’s upscale allure, the Hyundai’s generous feature content, or the Honda’s driving pleasure. There are plenty of unique choices beside that of the Ford Explorer that are well worth, um, exploring.</p>

A restored 1982 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Indy Pace Car with a 5.0L V8, manual transmission, and original memorabilia is up for grabs.

A meticulously restored 1982 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Indy Pace Car is turning heads, bringing back the spirit of the 66th Indianapolis 500 with its signature Silver Metallic finish and blue decals. This collector’s gem, complete with removable glass T-tops, is a tribute to Chevrolet’s storied involvement in the iconic race.

Under the hood, a High Output 5.0-liter V8 roars to life, paired with a rare four-speed manual transmission. The car is equipped with power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, and a Flowmaster exhaust, ensuring both drivability and classic muscle car appeal. Rolling on original Z28 wheels wrapped in Cooper Cobra white-letter radials, the car stays true to its period-correct look.

Though it has undergone a repaint in its factory-correct Silver Metallic, the restoration maintains the car’s original aesthetic, with the interior also refreshed to match its stock blue and silver bucket seat design. The extended-range AC Delco stereo remains functional, adding to the authenticity of the driving experience.

Beyond its pristine condition, this Camaro comes with a collection of original memorabilia, including a copy of the factory window sticker, an official 1982 Indianapolis 500 program, a May 1982 Chevrolet Friends magazine, and matching wall art. It also retains its original T-tops and storage sleeves.

While the odometer reads just 16,119 miles, its accuracy remains unverified due to the car’s age. Nonetheless, this Z28 Indy Pace Car stands as a well-preserved example of early third-generation Camaro history, ready to find a new home with a collector or enthusiast who appreciates its significance in Chevrolet and motorsports lore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ram Power Wagon is the beefiest off-road version of the brand's heavy-duty pickup truck, but its lone engine option is a gas-fed 6.4-liter V-8.

Ram offers a Cummins diesel 6.7-liter straight-six on its other HD trucks, and recently more customers have asked for a diesel Power Wagon.

A Ram powertrain engineer told Car and Driver that, while it's not happening for the 2025 model year, an oil-burning version of the HD off-roader is possible.

Ford and GM's heavy-duty off-road-ready pickup trucks all offer diesel engines, but that's not the case for the Ram Power Wagon. Its sole engine option is a gas-powered 6.4-liter V-8, which is naturally aspirated, so it avoids the intercooler that's employed on its turbo-diesel siblings. Since the intercooler interferes with a front-mounted winch, and Ram insists the Power Wagon has to have a winch, that's one of the main reasons it's gas only. However, it's possible the brand's beefiest HD off-roader could finally get a diesel option.

Ram Power Wagon with a Cummins?

Car and Driver recently spoke with one of Ram's powertrain engineers, and—unlike with Toyota's manual-less 4Runner—customers have been asking for a diesel Power Wagon. In fact, we learned that recently a lot more customers have been asking for it—and their voices are being heard. "We hear what's going on," the Ram engineer said. "If there's an opportunity there, then we can engineer it." Despite the possibility of a future diesel Power Wagon, Ram's engineer didn't provide a potential timeline, other than confirming it's not happening for the 2025 model year.

Stellantis

Ram's HD lineup just got a thorough refresh, and we've now driven the updated version of its Cummins turbo-diesel, a 6.7-liter straight-six that makes up to 430 horsepower and 1075 pound-feet of torque. The Cummins is available on the off-road-oriented Ram 2500 Rebel, but for now, the Power Wagon is stuck with the Hemi V-8, which is good for 405 ponies and 429 pound-feet. The Ram engineer said he believes that application is well suited for off-road duty, even if some customers still want the Power Wagon to get a Cummins option. "It's like, for some reason, people want 1000 pound-feet of torque to put in the sand," he said.

Obviously, there's a big difference between something that can be done and will be done. But at least the people who have dreamed of a diesel-powered Power Wagon know that it's being considered. And who knows? If customer demand keeps rising, perhaps Ram will finally give its HD off-roader the diesel treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Walsh is a far-right agitator, self-described fascist, and virulent transphobe, so it's only natural that the United States' most aggrieved and insecure icons of state-sanctioned violence are big fans of his. In fact, some cops love Walsh so much that they're apparently happy to watch his videos while driving, paying such rapt attention to his blithering inanity that they forget they're in control of a motor vehicle and mow down a roadside cyclist. At least, that's what one Vermont cop allegedly did, according to court documents.

Kyle Kapitanski, a sergeant in Shelburne, Vermont, had a Matt Walsh debate video playing in his cruiser when he hit and killed cyclist Sean Hayes, according to the Burlington Free Press. Kapitanski was driving 40 mph in a 35 zone at 2:40 AM, and didn't hit his brakes until 85 feet after he hit Hayes. The officer is being charged with "grossly negligent operation" of his cruiser, according to NBC 5, and has already plead not guilty. His attorney is making the case that, although Kapitanski had YouTube clips playing for 11 minutes in his cruiser, he wasn't actively interacting with the screen — just watching a YouTube video instead of the road is, apparently, not negligent at all.

A Shelburne police cruiser - Shelburne Communications Center

Kapitanski was driving a Ford Explorer cruiser, according to VTDigger, a vehicle with a front-end height known to increase pedestrian fatalities. You'd think a driver in such a vehicle — an officer theoretically dedicated to protect and serve, no less — would maybe want to keep an eye on where they're going, rather than watching a man who wants trans people "erased from the earth" for being "abusers" with "proclivities towards sin." Apparently not, though, given that Kapitanski clearly thought this 58-second portrait-oriented clip was more important than Hayes' life.

It's obvious that police think of civilians as some sort of lesser species, existing only to be exterminated at the slightest provocation, but rarely do we see it spelled out so clearly. Kapitanski was so enraptured by the speech of a man whose media presence is entirely built on bloodlust that he killed a man in an instant, and is now working with attorneys to argue that such a situation doesn't even qualify as gross negligence. This is how cops think. They are not here to help you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) consolidates below $2k, testing a 5-year trendline.

PepeX emerges as a fairer investment alternative with its upcoming presale and AI-powered meme coin launchpad.

Investors are shifting their focus to the upcoming PepeX presale amid Ethereum uncertainty.

As Ethereum (ETH) lingers in a precarious consolidation phase below the $2,000 mark, investors are increasingly turning their attention to alternative opportunities in the crypto space.

The broader market remains jittery, plagued by macroeconomic uncertainty, trade war fears, and erratic US policy decisions under President Trump. However, amid this turbulence, a new contender, PepeX, is emerging as a beacon for those seeking fresh prospects.

Billed as the world’s first AI-powered meme coin launchpad, PepeX promises a fairer alternative, drawing in degens and retail investors alike with its innovative approach and upcoming presale set to kick off on March 24, 2025.

Ethereum (ETH) faces a critical juncture

Ethereum’s current struggles are palpable as it trades in a tight range between $1,800 and $1,900, unable to reclaim the psychologically significant $2,000 level.

Analysts, including the prominent Mister Crypto, have pointed to a 5-year-long trendline that ETH is now testing— a historical support that has weathered major corrections in the past. This level is make-or-break for the second-largest cryptocurrency.

$ETH is retesting this 5-year long trendline. MASSIVE BOUNCE INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/bRSiu7DYKu — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 17, 2025

Should the level hold firm, a bullish reversal could propel Ethereum (ETH) back above $2,000, igniting hopes of a rally toward $2,300, where the 4-hour 200 moving average awaits as a key resistance.

However, the bears are unrelenting, and a failure to defend this trendline could see ETH slide toward lower demand zones around $1,600-$1,700.

The broader economic backdrop isn’t helping Ethereum’s case. Rising trade tensions, inflation concerns, and regulatory ambiguity in the US have left risk assets, including crypto, in a state of flux.

Bulls have lost their grip, and the prolonged consolidation has traders on edge, uncertain whether the next move will be a breakout or a breakdown.

For now, ETH remains at a crossroads, with its fate hinging on how it reacts to this multi-year support over the coming days and weeks.

This uncertainty has pushed some investors to diversify, seeking opportunities that offer more immediate promise and less exposure to Ethereum’s volatility.

PepeX offers a new frontier for crypto investors

As Ethereum struggles to gain its footing, PepeX is capturing the imagination of the crypto community with its bold mission to democratize meme coin creation with its PepeX.fun memecoin launchpad.

Unlike Pump.fun, which has been criticized for favouring insiders and leaving only 0.4% of traders with gains exceeding $10k, PepeX aims to level the playing field. Its AI-driven launchpad allows anyone to create a token in minutes—upload an image, pick a ticker, and let the AI handle the rest, from generating viral memes to deploying anti-snipe smart contracts.

With a $500 entry fee for creators, PepeX weeds out low-effort projects, ensuring a higher quality of meme coins while still keeping the process accessible to the masses.

What sets PepeX apart is its commitment to fairness and transparency. Founders are capped at a 5% token allocation, with their liquidity locked and redistributed to the community if a project flops—a stark contrast to the exit liquidity schemes that have plagued other platforms.

Additionally, the AI-powered marketing bots further amplify its appeal, autonomously shilling tokens on Telegram and X to supercharge growth.

With Pump.fun raking in nearly $400M in fees last year, PepeX positions itself as the next big wave, offering token holders a chance to ride a rising tide of value as more projects join the ecosystem.

As Ethereum stalls, investors are positioning themselves for the PepeX’s presale which opens in the next five days, drawn by its narrative of vengeance against the old guard and its promise of a fairer, more profitable meme coin meta.

For degens and retail crypto investors, PepeX offers a tantalizing blend of innovation, accountability, and opportunity, making it a compelling alternative as Ethereum (ETH) battles to find its footing.</p>

Police Lay A Trap For A Dodge Hellcat, Then All Hell Breaks Loose

After a suspect in a red Dodge Challenger Hellcat flees from police in the area of Albuquerque, New Mexico multiple times, including once going over 130 mph, cops set a trap. Despite meticulous planning and the use of advanced technologies, everything goes to hell in a handbasket as the suspect makes full use of the high-powered American muscle car.

Watch police in California chase a fleeing Dodge Demon.

What police didn’t know before they sprung the trap is the suspect had been in trouble with the law before. He had been charged with murder in 2014 but wasn’t convicted, but did plead guilty to other charges from the same violent incident. In other words, they were dealing with a hardened criminal willing to go to extreme lengths to escape capture.

Footage of the police chase starts with aerial reconnaissance spotting the Hellcat parked at a gas station. Officers set up spike strips nearby, determined to even the playing field since they can’t possibly keep up with the supercharged Hemi monster.

An officer on foot, with no patrol car in sight, is able to successfully spike the Dodge as the suspect appears to not even notice.

With the advantage starting to favor them, police move in with the plan of performing a quick PIT maneuver, ending the chase before it even begins. However, as officers in Ford F-150s approach and turn on their lights, the suspect floors it.

Even with the tires deflating, he’s able to rocket ahead, leading to exactly what police were trying to avoid. The suspect goes the wrong way on a major road, but thankfully there isn’t much traffic.

After running for a bit, the guy realizes police are following on the other side of the road, so he starts flipping around. However, his rapidly deflating tires don’t give him the traction to deal with a curb he runs over, hanging up the Hellcat as police in their trucks come in for the kill.

Three pickups pin the Mopar as the supercharged V8 growls, but the rear tires can’t get enough traction to do anything other than smoke.

Thanks to some non-lethal tools, authorities are able to finally get the driver and his female passenger to comply with orders to get out of the muscle car, although the guy tries his luck at sprinting away and gets about fifty feet.

This is how you catch a fleeing Dodge Hellcat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police in Kansas City, Missouri are investigating a possible arson attack at a local Tesla dealership after two Cybertrucks caught fire just before midnight on March 17. Officials say an officer saw one of the trucks on fire, and it spread to a second Cybertruck before firefighters could put it out. From video at the scene, it also looks like a couple of chargers were charred in the fire. I don't know about you, but two fewer Cybertrucks on the road doesn't sound like the worst thing in the world, does it? At the same time this was all happening, police and fire personnel in Las Vegas responded to a pretty big fire at a Tesla Collision Center.

The Kansas City Fire Department ordered both the Bomb and Arson units to assist at the scene, according to KMBC 9. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but it doesn't take too much of a genius to realize someone probably intentionally set this thing. The Fire Department tells FOX 4 Kansas City that the fire was soon brought under control with the use of a fire blanket to choke out the fire. The officer who originally saw the fire tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher, but it was a fruitless endeavor. A burning EV is no joke, folks.

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told CBS 8 that they had "received information that an individual had set several vehicles on fire in the parking lot."

Obviously, it's extremely early days for both investigations, so I'm sure more information — including the source of the fire — will come to light soon. We'll be sure to give you updates as we get them.

Tesla Vandalism On The Rise

Kansas City Tesla Cybertruck fire - Screenshot: KMBC 9

It's really not too shocking that something like this would happen, though. Since Tesla CEO Elon Musk made his hard turn to the right, vandalism attacks against the vehicles he makes have been on the rise. In fact, the vandalism is getting so bad that insurance rates may end up spiking for some owners, and President Donald Trump (Elon's best buddy) says that Tesla vandals will be tried with domestic terrorism. I suppose if you were looking for a sign to get rid of your Tesla, this is it.

These vandalism attacks started pretty much as soon as Cybertrucks got into the hands of the general public. In July of 2024, we told you about two separate vandalism stories. One involved a guy's Cybertruck ice cream truck having its windows smashed and another involved someone spray paint "F**k Elon" on 34 Cybertrucks at a lot in Florida. There have also been a number of protests at Tesla stores around the country, which Musk says are secretly funded by George Soros. I'm sure those protestors are still waiting for their checks.

Musk Is Mad

You probably won't be too shocked to find out Musk isn't thrilled people are setting his cars on fire. Perhaps he should have thought about that before becoming the right-wing loon he currently is, but that's beside the point.

Like he so often does, Musk took to X to express his feelings on the Vegas fire, specifically, referring to it as "terrorism."

"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong," he wrote in a second post. "Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks."

Listen, amigo: property damage at one of the most valuable companies in the world is never evil. While Tesla itself has never done anything outwardly evil (if you ignore the racism, sexism and homophobia issues among many others), Musk has intrinsically tied himself to the brand. That means that no matter what evil garbage Musk does, it reflects directly on Tesla.

Imagine managing a million-dollar investment fund stored in a cryptocurrency wallet. Everything runs smoothly until a single mistake—clicking a phishing link, visiting a malicious website, or falling victim to an undiscovered exploit—allows hackers to drain the wallet. Just like that, the assets are gone forever.

This nightmare scenario has played out in several high-profile crypto thefts, including the Japan-based exchange Coincheck in 2018, the Ronin Network in 2022, and most recently, the Bybit exchange in February 2025. While the causes of these breaches varied—ranging from private key compromises to smart contract exploits—they all underscore the importance of multiple security layers in Web3.

One of these protections is the so-called “multi-sig wallet,” which requires more than one person’s signature, via their private key, to authorize a crypto transaction.

A cryptocurrency wallet lets users store, send, and receive crypto by managing their private and public keys. When making a transaction, the user, via the wallet, signs it with a private key, proving ownership before broadcasting it to the blockchain for validation. Wallets can be custodial (managed by a third party such as Coinbase) or non-custodial (fully controlled by the user) and come in software or hardware forms.

What is a multi-sig wallet?

A multi-sig wallet works the same way as a regular crypto wallet, but requires multiple users' private keys to approve a transaction, adding an extra layer of security. For example, a “2-of-3” setup requires two out of three key holders to sign off. This makes multi-sig wallets ideal for businesses, online communities, and shared accounts, reducing unauthorized transactions.

Think of a high-security bank vault or a missile silo that requires multiple keyholders to turn their keys at the same time. Multi-sig wallets work similarly, preventing any single person from moving funds unilaterally.

“A multi-sig wallet requires multiple parties to approve any transaction that moves assets,” Dan Hughes, founder of blockchain UX developer Radix, told Decrypt. “A common setup is ‘3 of 5,’ meaning five parties are authorized to sign, but at least three must approve for the transaction to be accepted into the network.”

While single-key wallets are typically used by individuals, businesses, decentralized autonomous organizations, and exchanges favor multi-sig wallets to ensure shared control over funds.

Cryptocurrency wallets that support multi-sig include:

Multi-sig wallets are becoming increasingly popular. In 2024, Safe managed over $100 billion in assets with 1.6 million monthly active users. BitGo reported processing over 8% of all global Bitcoin transactions by value and with over 1,500 institutional clients in over 50 countries. Meanwhile, the Solana-based Cashmere wallet claimed $100 million in total value locked.

Use cases of multi-sig wallets

💼 Business Security: A company can distribute keys among executives to prevent any single person from moving funds.

If the buyer and seller agree, the transaction proceeds; if not, the third party intervenes.

A 2-of-3 multi-signature setup can include a buyer, seller, and a neutral third party (escrow). If the buyer and seller agree, the transaction proceeds; if not, the third party intervenes. 👥 Personal Backup: An individual can keep one key on their phone, another in a hardware wallet, and a third with a trusted friend. Losing one key does not result in total loss.

How multi-sig wallets work

Multi-signature wallets require multiple approvals before executing a transaction. Here’s how they work:

When a multi-sig wallet is created, multiple private keys are generated and distributed among different individuals or devices.

A user submits a request to initiate a transaction, but it is not immediately recorded on a blockchain.

The transaction remains pending until the required number of keyholders approve it. For example, in a 2-of-3 setup, at least two keyholders must sign off.

Once the necessary approvals are collected, the transaction is finalized and broadcast to the blockchain to be validated, confirmed, and permanently recorded.

Benefits of multi-sig wallets

by ensuring no single party can unilaterally drain the wallet. 🗝️ Redundancy protection — if one key is lost, access remains possible with the remaining authorized keys.

Multi-sigs provide not only security, but redundancy protection too, Hughes explained. “If one of the five should lose their key, the funds can still be accessed as there are still four keys remaining, of which three are required,” he said, adding that, “Without multi-sig, if you lost that key, your assets would also be essentially "lost" unless you had another form of access such as seed phrase recovery to reconstruct the key.”

Potential risks of multi-sig wallets

While multi-sig wallets significantly improve security, they also pose challenges, said Sean Li, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency wallet developer Magic Labs.

"More complex multi-sig wallets introduce a broader attack surface, mainly due to increased code complexity, coordination logic vulnerabilities, and the potential for bugs within smart contracts,” Li told Decrypt. “As more sophisticated mechanisms are added, like spending limits or time locks, the risk of vulnerabilities increases. To mitigate this, the industry should lean into rigorous smart contract audits and formal verification processes.”

Despite their security advantages, multi-sig wallets may not be the default choice for most cryptocurrency users.

“There’s a reason your average cryptocurrency wallet isn’t a multi-sig wallet,” Henry Fisher, Marketing Manager at Cake Wallet, told Decrypt. “More keys mean more steps and added complexity at every stage, from wallet creation to signing transactions and backing up keys.”

Fisher said developers can mitigate against these issues by educating users, creating more user-friendly interfaces, and promoting best practices.

“It’s not uncommon to see individuals lose their money by not backing up their keys or sharing their key unintentionally,” he said. “With multi-sig wallets, this care must be carried out across numerous keys.”

Who uses multi-sig wallets?

🏢 Businesses handling crypto payments or payroll can use multi-sig wallets to prevent unauthorized transfers and internal fraud.

can reduce theft and phishing risks by distributing signing authority. 🌐 DAOs benefit from multi-sig by enabling transparent, collective decision-making for treasury management and governance.

The future of cryptocurrency wallets

Multi-sig wallets provide a crucial layer of protection for cryptocurrency treasuries by reducing the risks of theft from a single key compromise. However, the complexity of setting up a multi-sig wallet means it is not always the go-to choice for everyday users.

Looking ahead, innovations in smart contract technology, threshold signatures—which allow multiple parties to collectively sign transactions without revealing individual private keys—and account abstraction, which simplifies user interactions by enabling flexible access controls, could make multi-sig wallets more accessible, leading to the development of so-called “smart wallets.”

“Smart wallets are the Swiss Army knives of crypto storage,” Gnosis co-founder and Safe Wallet developer Friederike Ernst told Decrypt, explaining that, “They support multiple signers, allowing credential rotation if lost or stolen,” She added that, “Recovery is customizable—you can use a bank for KYC verification or a committee of trusted friends.”

According to Ernst, smart wallets are the next evolution of cryptocurrency wallets. They enhance security, usability, and resilience through smart contracts and programmable logic. While multi-signatures improve security, smart wallets offer customizable recovery options, and role-based access.

As developers refine user experience and security features, multi-sig and other advanced wallet solutions will give fund managers the tools they need to ensure digital assets remain safe in an increasingly dangerous online world.</p>

I might be overthinking this, but are temperature and cost inversely proportional to each other? Per my observations, as the weather gets milder, Amazon's prices plummet. Perhaps there's a scientific explanation for this phenomenon — or, maybe more likely, we're being treated to a little preview of the Amazon Big Spring Sale. It was just announced that this seasonal savings event will kick off next Tuesday, March 25 and go through the end of the month (mark your calendar!). That said, I'm already seeing markdowns of up to 80%, so if this is just the sneak peek, I can only imagine what the official sale will have in store.

Top Amazon Big Spring Sale early deals

Some sought-after items, like a Stanley tumbler and Yeti cooler, are down to record-low prices as we speak. My advice? Scoop 'em up before they sell out, because they're not likely to dip lower than they are now. I also spotted the countertop pizza oven my parents can't stop talking about (it's within a few dollars of its all-time low), as well as an iRobot Roomba for nearly 50% off (just in time for spring cleaning) and a classic Hanes zip-up hoodie for a mere $16 (an A-plus transitional weather staple).

Now, before we jump into the rest of the best early Amazon Big Spring Sale deals, I also need to make you aware of an insane Disney+ and Hulu bundle bargain: From now until March 30, you can get a Disney+, Hulu Bundle Basic subscription for just $2.99 per month for four months (after which, you'll be charged the regular price of $10.99 per month). That's a 72% savings! Just note that this offer only applies to new and eligible returning customers.

At nearly 45% off, this is as low as this durable, attractive set has dipped in years. Plus, 10 bucks is what you'd expect to pay for a single cutting board, not a trio — that brings the cost of each one to just over $3. You also can't put a price on the peace of mind that comes with knowing your food will be free of plastic bits...

Singapore, Singapore, March 18th, 2025, Chainwire

HTX, a leading crypto exchange, has been ranked as the “Top 3 Exchanges for EUR-Stablecoin Trading Activity” in a recent CoinDesk report titled “MiCAR: The Institutional Playbook for Europe’s Digital Asset Market”. The report explores key trends shaping the European digital asset market with the implementation of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and highlights that HTX achieved a monthly average EUR-stablecoin trading volume of €48 million, with a notable volume of €33 million in November 2024, ranking third following Binance and Coinbase.

This surge in EUR-denominated trading coincides with the regulatory shifts. Regulatory clarity has become a key driver of institutional adoption and market confidence. The full rollout of MiCAR represents a major milestone for the industry, offering a unified framework that spans across 27 European Union (EU) member states. While MiCAR streamlines compliance and fosters innovation, it also brings along complex challenges that exchanges must navigate. HTX Ventures explores both the opportunities and hurdles that come with this landmark regulation.

Alec Goh, Head of HTX Ventures, said, “The implementation of MiCAR is a major step in the right direction for the crypto industry, providing much-needed regulatory clarity and fostering an environment conducive to institutional adoption. As jurisdictions worldwide become more crypto-friendly, a united framework like MiCAR will accelerate innovation while ensuring robust compliance. At HTX Ventures, we see this as an opportunity to drive the development of on-chain compliance tools, support the emergence of compliant DeFi solutions, and bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.”

Opportunities:

Unified Regulatory Framework Reduces Costs and Boosts Market Confidence

MiCAR covers all 27 EU member states through a “single license” approach, enabling exchanges to significantly reduce compliance costs across borders. This unified regulatory framework provides a clear and stable regulatory environment for the market, increasing confidence and participation among institutional investors while positioning Europe to become the world's largest compliant digital asset market.

Technological Innovations Drive On-Chain Compliance Tools

To meet MiCAR’s stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and reserve monitoring requirements, exchanges can actively explore compliance tool innovations, including:

Using Oracle networks to modularize AML rules and reserve monitoring, executing them on-chain for real-time data transparency.

Adopting zk-SNARKs to build an on-chain central platform for regulatory data, enabling transaction data desensitization to balance regulatory transparency with user privacy.

Leveraging account abstraction technology (ERC-4337) to integrate KYC processes into non-custodial wallets, lowering barriers for traditional financial institutions to access DeFi.

New Opportunities for the Convergence of Traditional and Crypto Assets

With platforms such as Coinbase launching securitized tokens, exchanges can introduce real-world asset (RWA) trading. This includes income-based stablecoins backed by US stocks or Treasuries, enabling users to leverage assets like USDT for multi-asset allocation and global liquidity matching.

Challenges:

High Costs and Technical Complexity of Compliance

MiCAR imposes strict requirements on stablecoin issuers and Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs), including adequate reserves, regular audits, and robust anti-money laundering measures. Exchanges must invest significantly in R&D to integrate compliance tools, data desensitization techniques, and on-chain regulatory platforms without compromising market fluidity.

Uncertainty in the Dynamic Policy Environment

With regulatory policies evolving rapidly, exchanges must establish multi-chain testing environments and collaborate with regulatory-friendly regions (e.g., Lithuania, Malta) for cross-border stress tests and regulatory scenario simulations. This requires continuous investment, with risks at the policy interpretation and implementation levels.

Security Risks and Stringent Custody Requirements

Following high-profile incidents like FTX, MiCAR has introduced rigorous digital asset custody requirements, mandating bank-level security measures to prevent hacking and asset loss. As DeFi integrates with traditional financial regulations, exchanges must address both technical vulnerabilities and evolving security risks.

HTX Ventures firmly believes that under a clearer regulatory framework such as MiCAR, exchanges can achieve a win-win situation through technological innovations and global asset allocation, balancing compliance with market innovation. Moving forward, the firm will continue to leverage its insights and expertise to actively explore on-chain compliance tools, expand RWA trading, and build a dynamic testing environment, navigating regulatory complexities and ensuring that crypto innovation remains aligned with long-term institutional adoption and market sustainability.

However, he was letterly listed as a vp or product at meta on LinkedIn - as a gag by an employee.

Meta's platforms have copied features from snap over the years, such as stories.

Evan Spiegel Doesn't work at Meta, but if you're looking at his LinkedIn, you might have thought hey.

The Snap Cophounder and CEO Said in an interview with Bloomberg published Monday that of his employees temporarily put on his profile that was he "vp product @ meta" as a gag. (His LinkedIn Profile No Longer Shows That.)

The Joke Appears to Be a Dig At Meta, which has tasks a few pages from snapchat's book over the years when it comes to features.

For Example, Snapchat was the first to introduction user stories that disappear after a while, rolling out a feature in 2013 that let users post photos and videos that'd vanh after 24 hours.

Meta in 2016 Unveiled Its Own Stories Feature on Instagram, and Facebook Got Them the Following Year. WhatsApp Debuted A Similar Feature Called Status also in 2017.

Facebook Offered to Buy Snapchat for $ 3 Billion in 2013, But Spiegel's Company Declined. The Wall Street Journal PreviOutly Reported That Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Reached Out to Spiegel in 2016 to Try Again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), two of the most prominent blockchain platforms in the market, are renowned for their innovative approaches and dedicated communities. However, Cardano continues to face challenges such as slower transaction speeds and fierce competition from other Layer-1 solutions.

Meanwhile, Solana’s focus on scalability has earned it a well-deserved reputation as one of the fastest networks available. Yet, concerns about network reliability and market saturation persist, prompting some investors to start looking for alternatives with higher growth potential.

For investors accustomed to the steady performance of platforms like Cardano and Solana, the search for the next 100x opportunity is a growing priority. BinoFi (BINO), a revolutionary DeFi platform that is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto community might just be the one such opportunity.

BinoFi’s Edge in the Competitive Crypto Landscape

BinoFi (BINO) presents itself as a forward-thinking project directly addressing key inefficiencies in decentralized finance (DeFi). By introducing a suite of innovative features, BinoFi is setting new benchmarks in performance, privacy, and transparency.

Key Features Driving BinoFi’s Momentum

Hybrid CEX/DEX Model

BinoFi’s hybrid Centralized Exchange (CEX) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) approach offers users the benefits of CEX-like liquidity and speed combined with the autonomy and security of DEX platforms. This model ensures optimal trading experiences with reduced compromises. AI-Driven Trading Tools

Trading success often hinges on actionable insights, which is where BinoFi’s AI-enhanced analytics and automation tools come into play. These advanced tools enable traders to make smarter decisions, maximize returns, and better manage their portfolios in real time. Proof-of-Reserves Transparency

BinoFi embodies trust by implementing proof-of-reserves protocols, offering users visibility into its platform’s liquidity. This commitment to transparency reassures investors of the protocol’s long-term stability and reliability. Gasless Transactions

Beyond trading mechanics, BinoFi introduces a gas-less transaction environment, allowing users to save on fees while navigating the DeFi ecosystem. This innovation is particularly appealing to traders and developers wary of high gas costs associated with networks like Ethereum.

$BINO Presale Attracts High Demand

At the heart of BinoFi’s ecosystem is its utility token, $BINO, which powers trading rewards, staking benefits, and ecosystem governance. Investors are showing strong interest in the ongoing presale phase, recognizing the potential for exponential gains.

The presale provides an opportunity for investors to secure their position in what experts suggest could be one of the most innovative DeFi platforms on the horizon.

A 100x Opportunity?

For Cardano and Solana investors, the appeal of BinoFi lies in its ability to balance cutting-edge technology with an investor-centric approach. While Cardano and Solana excel in their established ecosystems, the competitive crypto landscape calls for platforms offering fresh solutions and heightened growth potential.

BinoFi’s focus on scalable infrastructure, privacy protection, and transparent governance positions it as a top contender for investors seeking the next big thing in cryptocurrency.

Final Thoughts

Cardano and Solana remain pillars of the blockchain space, but as the market evolves, investors are seeking opportunities beyond established names. BinoFi (BINO) is emerging as a project with the innovation and momentum to capture that demand.

If you’re looking for a potential 100x opportunity with a foundation built on technology and transparency, BinoFi might just be the next game-changer in the DeFi ecosystem.

The company—founded by well-known crypto personalities Michael Anderson, pseudonymous trader Keyboard Monkey, and professional poker player Ben Lamb—aims to create a strong connection with crypto natives thanks to the expertise of its founders and their reputations from building in the space.

(Disclaimer: Anderson is an investor in DASTAN, Decrypt’s parent company. DASTAN President Farokh Sarmad is also an investor in Yeet.)

“Yeet's tagline is Crypto's Casino—meaning it’s built by crypto people, for crypto people,” Anderson, who is better known as Mando among crypto enthusiasts, told Decrypt. “We use crypto as payment rails, but it’s much more than that—our brand, team, and even the games themselves are deeply ingrained in crypto culture,” he said.

The gambling platform will offer a variety of traditional casino games like blackjack and roulette alongside new, crypto-focused games. For example, users will be able to engage with casino games that replicate the experience of minting NFTs, trading meme coins, and “getting rugged” in DeFi—the sorts of applications that allow crypto users to trade, borrow, and lend crypto assets without intermediaries.

To start, Yeet will focus on providing entertaining, high-stakes gambling experiences instead of on-chain games, though it may look to incorporate provably fair games via on-chain verifiable randomness (VRF) in the future.

“Crypto users love risk. They already trade 100x leverage, buy random meme coins, and gamble on everything from airdrops to NFTs in crypto,” Yeet co-founder Keyboard Monkey told Decrypt. “Crypto needs entertainment… and when trading slows down like right now, we all still want fun, fast-paced, gambling experiences—but ones that feel native to our world.”

Meeting crypto users where they are, the casino and its forthcoming sportsbook will offer access to its site via a Telegram bot as well, a trend that was popularized with meme coin trading applications that allowed users to buy and sell tokens directly from the popular messaging terminal.

As for competing with big name crypto casinos like Stake, Shuffle, and Rollbit, co-founder Ben Lamb expects the brand's deeply native crypto roots and culture to help the upstart pull market share.

“Yeet stands out by being deeply crypto-native,” Lamb told Decrypt. “Yeet isn’t trying to compete with these platforms,” he said. “We’re offering something they don’t. We are Crypto's Casino.”

Lamb also pointed to deals with “shitposters,” traders, and founders in the crypto space, and the casino’s plans to offer a multi-tier affiliate program and an extensive VIP rewards program—plus an initial points program that will lead to an airdrop. “Wen token?” he said.

Under Yeet’s Anjouan and Curacao licenses, U.S. residents will not be eligible to play on Yeet. The platform instead will focus on “Asia, Latin America, Canada, Africa, and select European markets where demand for crypto casinos is currently booming,” said Anderson.

Yeet users will be able to deposit funds across multiple Ethereum-compatible chains, Bitcoin, and Solana.</p>

A crypto whale that opened over 300 heavily leveraged short positions on Bitcoin, totaling more than $521 million, closed the shorts on Tuesday and pocketed a profit of $3.9 million. This green trade was made despite a platoon of crypto traders looking to wreck the whale’s position, seeking to boost the price of Bitcoin above the liquidation level.

A short trade is a bet that an asset’s price will drop; the lower it goes, the more money the trader makes. In this scenario, the whale had placed a short trade on Bitcoin that sat at $83,898—and with 40x leverage applied, the total trade surged to a value of more than $521 million. If Bitcoin had risen just 2% from the trade’s open to $85,591, then the whale’s position would have been liquidated.

Hearing this, some crypto degens went after the whale as pseudonymous trader Cbb0fe organized a group to pump over $10 million into Bitcoin, in an attempt to raise the price of the asset above the whale's liquidation mark.

That’s a tiny sliver of Bitcoin’s typical daily trading volume—which sits at about $25 billion over the past day. As is often the case, the leading cryptocurrency had a fairly volatile day Monday, peaking at $84,573 according to CoinGecko but eventually stooping to $82,295.

Following this daily low, the whale sold his 300+ heavily leveraged short positions in less than two minutes, according to the HypurrScan block explorer. In total, 208.1 BTC worth of shorts were closed, valued just shy of $16,959,000. According to on-chain analytics company Bubblemaps, the margin required for the whale to open the trade was approximately $13.027 million.

“Shorter closed,” Cbb0fe said on X, formerly Twitter. “We lost the war, but it's been a long time since we had this much fun on the internet. [Good game] to the shorter for the win.”

This means that the whale made a 30% profit on the trade and pocketed $3.932 million. However, the risk involved was much higher than this.

Hyperliquid allows users to place leveraged trades of up to 40x through its decentralized perpetuals exchange, which utilizes its own layer-1 blockchain to process transactions. In this case, the whale opened a cross position which would have used the wallet’s other positions to cover any losses made—meaning the whale’s portfolio could have mostly been wiped out through one trade.

Due to the hugely risky bet, however, many observers believed that the whale must have been an insider of some kind. But, Bubblemaps told Decrypt this is unlikely due to the lack of news that happened before or after the wallet exited its position.

That same trader caused a $4 million loss for the community-owned Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) last week, as it was forced to cover the losses of the whale's $285 million leveraged bet on Ethereum. As a result, Hyperliquid lowered the maximum amount of leverage a trader can apply on Bitcoin and Ethereum following the detrimental 50x leveraged trade.

While the whale has been making headlines and stealing social media attention with its risky bets, the wallet has profited over $9.37 million in less than 30 days since creating the account.

And the whale has already made a fresh bet: a long position on MELANIA, the official Solana meme coin of U.S. first lady Melania Trump, totaling $2.7 million with 5x leverage applied. If the Solana meme coin falls just 9.78% from $0.7238 to $0.653, then the whale’s position will be liquidated.

As of this writing, there's no sign of traders trying to hunt this position to force a liquidation.

Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx has acquired New Zealand’s largest digital asset platform, Easy Crypto, in a deal that consolidates its position as one of the biggest players in the Australia-New Zealand market.

The acquisition brings Swyftx’s total customer base to 1.1 million, adding Easy Crypto’s 350,000 clients to its existing footprint. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Founded in 2018, Easy Crypto has processed more than NZ$3.5 billion ($2.1 billion) in sales, offering a non-custodial trading platform alongside a New Zealand dollar stablecoin (NZDD) and self-custody wallet services.

Swyftx Chief Executive Jason Titman said the deal would support the firm’s regional expansion and allow it to scale into new products and markets.

“Our growth plans involve a mix of organic and inorganic opportunities, he told Decrypt. "While we believe it is important to localize operations to each geography or product offering, there’s no plan to operate a house of brands."

The plan is to bring both businesses closer together over the next 18 months, Titman said, as Swyftx looks to strengthen its relationship with Easy Crypto’s users and its team.

He added that improving regulatory clarity and shifting policy rhetoric around cryptocurrencies, including recent messaging from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, were tailwinds for the sector’s recovery and dealmaking activity.

The Brisbane-based company has expanded rapidly since its launch in 2018, handling billions of dollars in quarterly trading volumes.

The acquisition marks one of the largest mergers in the ANZ crypto market in recent years, following a slowdown in industry M&A amid regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.

Easy Crypto CEO and co-founder Janine Grainger said the acquisition aligned with the firm’s vision to broaden access to digital assets.

“I’ve been impressed with Swyftx’s growth and approach in the ANZ markets, and our shared focus on customer experience, security, and financial freedom made this partnership a natural fit,” she said.

Both companies will continue to operate as separate platforms in the near term before integrating services under the Swyftx brand. The combined business will have just under 200 employees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Key takeaways

Ordinals trading on Magic Eden spiked by 1,200%, with the trading volume hitting $50m.

The Bitcoin Pepe presale has now reached $5.5 million as stage seven ends shortly.

Magic Eden records spike in Ordinals trading volume

Magic Eden, one of the leading NFT marketplaces, experienced a short-lived, week-long period of sustained volume in Ordinals trades. The platform saw a 1,200% surge in Ordinals trading volume during that period, with over $50 million traded.

Ordinals are NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The surge in Ordinals trading volume could indicate a possible increase in interest in the Bitcoin NFTs.

What is Bitcoin Pepe?

The surge in interest in Ordinals could spark positive development for other Bitcoin-based projects. Bitcoin Pepe is a project launching on the Bitcoin blockchain and is set to introduce memecoin trading within the ecosystem.

The project intends to revolutionise the Bitcoin ecosystem by leveraging the liquidity and security of the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe will use Bitcoin’s position in the market to introduce memecoins to its ecosystem.

By launching a layer-2 network on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe will specialise in memecoin trading and other DeFi activities. It will enable Bitcoin Pepe to become home to memecoin activities within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Overall, Bitcoin Pepe will help unlock decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme trading on top of BTC.

In addition, Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme initial coin offering (ICO) on the Bitcoin blockchain, granting it the unique power to fuse BTC’s security with the unstoppable force of memecoins.

Bitcoin Pepe presale hits $5.5m

As a Bitcoin-based project, Bitcoin Pepe is already setting impressive records. The presale is quickly selling out, and the seventh stage will be over in the coming hours.

The Bitcoin Pepe presale raised $5.5 million in five weeks thanks to growing interest in its unique value proposition. The native $BPEP token is available to investors via the Bitcoin Pepe website. It can be purchased using various cryptocurrencies, including ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and SOL. In this sixth presale stage, $BPEP is worth $0.0281, and it will increase to $0.0295 in the eighth stage.

Will Bitcoin Pepe positively impact the Bitcoin ecosystem

With a market cap of over $1 trillion, Bitcoin is currently the most liquid blockchain in the world. While Bitcoin is home to NFTs like Ordinals, memecoins are yet to fully kickoff on the blockchain.

Bitcoin Pepe intends to change that by introducing memecoin and DeFi trading on the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin Pepe L2 network will enable developers to easily launch memecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain. Memecoins will empower the Bitcoin blockchain to become home to a crazy high-octane meme experience.

Furthermore, the L2 will provide the necessary infrastructure for all memes to migrate to BTC, ensuring security and liquidity for investors and users.

Should you buy the $BPEP token during the presale?

The $BPEP token will be available to users via centralised and decentralised exchanges. However, it is currently available to investors in the ongoing presale. This native token will power the Bitcoin Pepe ecosystem and could become a tremendous performer in the coming months and years.

The presale will enter the eighth stage in the coming hours or days, with the $BPEP token set to increase to $0.0295. $BPEP is not an ordinary memecoin as its utility could make it important to users.</p>

I attended the most recent status conference for the Samourai case today.



Here's an update from outside the courthouse: pic.twitter.com/9WN1N2t9Kr — Frank Corva (@frankcorva) March 18, 2025

This is the second time that the two developers, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, have appeared together in public since the previous status conference, which occurred on September 17, 2024.

Today’s hearing was the shortest and least substantive of the four pre-trial hearings that have occurred thus far.

Pre-Trial Motion Schedule

At the hearing, the prosecution and the defense established and agreed upon the pre-trial motion schedule schedule, which is as follows:

May 9, 2025 — Opening motion

— Opening motion June 6, 2025 — The prosecution’s response to the opening motion

— The prosecution’s response to the opening motion June 20, 2025 — Replies to the prosecution’s response

Expert Disclosure

The prosecution is scheduled to provide its expert disclosure on July 15, 2025, while the defense is expected to provide it by August 8, 2025.

Further expert disclosure may also be permitted on July 16, 2025 at 10:00 AM EST, which is the date for the next in-person pre-trial hearing.

Hill To Remain In Lisbon

Hill’s attorney asked Judge Richard Berman, who is presiding over the case, if the court would be amenable to the court not requiring Hill’s appearance at future pre-trial hearings given that Hill is currently living with his wife in Lisbon, Portugal and traveling back and forth to New York City is expensive.

His attorney also stated that pre-trial services were “supportive” of this request.

The judge stated that he didn’t see a problem with this.

Rodriguez Expresses Gratitude

After the hearing, Rodriguez told Bitcoin Magazine that he‘s grateful to all those who’ve donated to the Peer-to-Peer Rights Fund, which helps to fund the developers’ legal defense.

Those interested can still donate to the fund.

Trial Start Date

The trial is slated to begin on November 3, 2025.</p>

Vancouver, Canada, March 18th, 2025, Chainwire

The artificial intelligence landscape is evolving. Traditional AI models remain centralized, relying on static text data and corporate control. iAgent is introducing a decentralized AI framework where AI agents are trained, owned, and monetized on-chain using real-world visual data.

Backed by a recent $3 million investment, iAgent has forged several strategic partnerships with leading projects such as Base, LayerZero, Avalanche, Aethir, Arbitrum, and XAI Games. With over 700,000 users on its AGNTxp platform, iAgent is at the forefront of AI x Gaming x DePIN innovation.

Now, with TGE live, iAgent is laying the foundation for AI Agents to become a new digital asset that can be trained, validated, and exchanged transparently.

“AI should be decentralized, transparent, and monetizable. iAgent is ensuring AI models belong to those who train them, not corporations.” — Jamie Batzorig, Co-Founder of iAgent.

iAgent’s Product Hub: Powering the AI Economy

iAgent’s ecosystem consists of a suite of interconnected products aimed at supporting AI development, deployment, and monetization through a decentralized framework. Each component is designed to enhance the verifiability, scalability, and accessibility of AI models across various ecosystems.

Visual Learning Model (VLM): Adaptive AI Training

Unlike traditional AI that relies on text-based training (LLMs), iAgent’s Visual Learning Models (VLMs) enable AI agents to learn from real-world gameplay footage. This approach allows AI to analyze, strategize, and adapt dynamically, making them more intelligent and applicable in real-world scenarios.

iAgent’s VLM-powered AI utilizes real-player interactions to enhance its adaptability, enabling continuous optimization for performance in competitive gaming environments and other applications:

Current live for Counter Strike 2, Off the Grid & Citizen Conflict.

Players have already contributed 25 TB+ gameplay data.

gameplay data. Over 10,000+ hours of gameplay footage recorded

ERC-** Agent Standard: A New AI Digital Asset Class

iAgent’s ERC-** standard will bring AI Agents on-chain as verifiable, secure, and interoperable digital assets. This aims to enable true ownership, trading, and cross-chain utilization without centralized control. While enhancing trust and transparency through provable authenticity and ownership history.

AI Agent Marketplace: The Open AI Economy

The AI Agent Marketplace serves as the foundation of iAgent’s decentralized ecosystem, enabling seamless AI model deployment, trading, and monetization. Developers can list AI-powered agents for rental or sale, while businesses and game studios can purchase or integrate AI models tailored to their needs.

Zurich, Switzerland, March 18th, 2025, Chainwire

Brahma is launching ConsoleKit, a full-stack infrastructure designed to streamline on-chain automation with enhanced security and efficiency. Onchain automation has long been fragmented, requiring manual oversight and disconnected tooling. With over $1 billion in transactions across multiple chains, Brahma is demonstrating that true autonomous execution is now a reality.

Building on its innovations with Automated Vaults and Accounts, ConsoleKit enables automation directly from user-controlled accounts, with robust policy management ensuring all agent actions remain secure and self-custodial—eliminating the need for manual oversight.

Onchain Without Limits

Now live with Tempest, Creator.bid, and Swell, and integrated with Morpho, Agentic Protocols function as self-sustaining on-chain agents that execute transactions, manage assets, and optimize operations directly from user-controlled accounts. Unlike traditional smart contracts or centralized services, they operate continuously with custom logic and decentralized execution, while policy guardrails ensure all actions remain secure and self-custodial. Powered by AI-driven reasoning and Web2 integrations, these agents—enabled by Brahma ConsoleKit—support real-world use cases such as automated payroll, treasury management, operational fund allocation, and digital asset-based financial solutions.

These Agentic Protocols enable:

24/7 execution across multiple chains without manual intervention

Automated portfolio management through rebalancing and compounding mechanisms.

Integration with Web2 data sources for risk management and financial operations

Coordination across multiple protocols to maximize efficiency

Full user custody through secure, programmable execution with policy guardrails that confine agent actions.

Upcoming integrations with protocols on Berachain, BNB Chain, Base, and more will extend agentic execution into new frontiers, making on-chain interactions more seamless than ever. By bridging Web2 and Web3, Agentic Protocols unlock a future where on-chain runs trustlessly, efficiently, and without limits.

The Infrastructure Powering Onchain Autonomy

“The age of passive, manual onchain transactions is over. Intelligent, self-sustaining agents will define the next decade,” said Alessandro Tenconi, CEO of Brahma. “Agentic Protocols aren’t just about automation, they represent an entirely new paradigm where strategies run independently, adapting to market conditions with zero friction.”

Brahma’s execution stack, policy management, and automation framework provide the backbone for Agentic Protocols, enabling developers to:

Deploy AI-driven strategies with deterministic execution flows.

Automate onchain financial workflows, including payments, asset swapping, liquidity provisioning, and portfolio rebalancing and risk management.

Enable interoperable automation across multiple protocols and networks.

Connect onchain & Web2 services, to let agents perform traditional services too, while being able to spend onchain as well, expanding real-world utility.

Built with a modular and secure architecture, these agents ensure gas efficiency, reliable execution, and trustless enforcement of security policies, unlocking a new era where on-chain agents operate autonomously.

A Paradigm Shift in Agentic Protocols

“Onchain agents with powerful capabilities aren’t coming, they are here,” added Kakusan, Co-founder of Brahma. “We’re seeing protocols launch agents that execute strategies, manage assets, and bridge ecosystems in ways never seen before. With more agents on Berachain, and upcoming integration with teams like GlueX, and with other agents releasing soon, we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible.”

Brahma’s vision isn’t just about better automation, it’s about making onchain actors truly self-sustaining. With Brahma’s agentic infrastructure, developers, DAOs, and protocols can build self-sustaining Agentic Protocols today.

Users can already build, deploy, and optimize with Brahma ConsoleKit

Users can learn more about ConsoleKit here.

Zug, Switzerland, March 18th, 2025,

The Interchain Foundation (ICF), the steward of the Cosmos ecosystem and its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, has officially funded the open-sourcing of evmOS, a pioneering Ethereum-compatible Layer 1 solution that allows developers to build EVM-powered blockchains using the Cosmos SDK. This marks a significant milestone in advancing Cosmos’s functionality for Ethereum-native users, protocols, and infrastructure providers given evmOS’s standing as the most feature-rich and performant EVM solution for L1 protocols.

evmOS will be made open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, and the ICF will create a fork of this technology, renamed to Cosmos EVM to continue its development as part of the Interchain Stack, through the Interchain Labs (ICL) team. This specifically pertains to the ‘OS’ repository. Other Evmos-related libraries and the Evmos blockchain itself remain independent and are not included in this initiative.

Federico Kunze Küllmer, co-founder of Evmos and core-contributor to the evmOS codebase, will transition away from his role as Evmos contributor and will be advising and providing guidance in regards to Cosmos EVM on Ethereum interoperability, modular blockchain architecture, and its roadmap within the long-term vision of the Cosmos ecosystem.

"Building evmOS has been an incredible journey, and I am proud of the impact we’ve had on building the EVM ecosystem on Cosmos", said Federico Kunze Küllmer, representing Tharsis Labs. "We feel this is the right thing for the community for the longevity of the code we’ve developed, and are excited about the ICF’s support of this. I look forward to contributing to this next phase in a strategic advisory role."

“evmOS has done the work to merge the best of the Cosmos SDK as a blockchain-building framework, with EVM. It integrates them deeply, allowing for support of EVM as a VM, seamless user experiences with Ethereum wallets on Cosmos and EVM chains, and the extensibility of EVM itself through the in-protocol customization that only the Cosmos SDK can allow”, expressed Barry Plunkett, Co-CEO of Interchain Labs.

Strategic Vision for evmOS Under ICF

Under its new open-source provenance, the ICF will integrate Cosmos EVM, the fork of evmOS, further into Cosmos’ Interchain Stack, enhancing its role as the canonical EVM solution for Cosmos chains. Additionally, the ICF and its subsidiary, Interchain Labs, will become the main steward and contributor of the software, ensuring its ongoing development and integration within the broader Cosmos ecosystem. The acquisition aligns with ICF’s broader mission of fostering permissionless innovation, seamless cross-chain communication, and building the best platform and tools for world-scale application builders

Cosmos EVM will be fully open source, under the Apache 2.0 license. This will provide developers with greater freedom to contribute, modify, and deploy Cosmos EVM in a wide range of applications, fostering a more inclusive and decentralized development ecosystem.

“evmOS has been a critical piece in bridging the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, and we are excited to support its continued evolution under the Interchain Foundation umbrella”, said Josh Cincinnati, president of the ICF’s Foundation Council. "Federico’s leadership and technical expertise have been instrumental in shaping first Etheremint and then evmOS into the best solution for proof-of-stake networks, and we are pleased to continue to receive his strategic insights”, said Barry Plunkett.

What’s Next

The evmOS roadmap, now rebranded as Cosmos EVM, remains focused on its core objective of strengthening the EVM ecosystem while ensuring seamless Ethereum compatibility within the Cosmos network. The Interchain Foundation (ICF) and Interchain GmbH (ICL) will collaborate closely with evmOS projects to facilitate a smooth transition during upcoming network upgrades.

Federico Kunze Küllmer, Josh Cincinnati, Maghnus Mareneck, and Barry Plunkett are available for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump’s trade policy has yielded a risk-off mood in the crypto market with the fear & greed index remaining on the fear end of the spectrum. As such, most majors and meme coins alike have recorded double-digit losses in recent months. Investors are now keen on the Fed’s tone at the end of the two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Even so, there is a revolutionary project whose appeal remains undeterred by the current economic uncertainties. Bitcoin Pepe has maintained its upward momentum as savvy investors rush to be part of this project which assures hefty gains during and after its presale.

Trump’s tariffs push Dogecoin buyers to the sidelines

The risk aversion observed in the crypto market has impacted majors and meme coins alike. As President Trump threatens of even more aggressive tariffs, crypto buyers have stayed on the sidelines waiting for further guidance from the March Fed meeting.

In the near term, Dogecoin price will likely remain within the range of between the four-month low of $0.1439 and ythe resistance zone at $0.1804. Even with further rebounding, its gains may be curbed along the 25-day EMA at $0.1954.

Bitcoin Pepe maintains upward momentum despite risk aversion in the crypto market

Amid the ongoing crypto revolution, most of the recently launched meme projects are more than just a token that starts as a joke and goes viral. They focus on a particular need with the overall goal of revolutionizing the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin Pepe is one such project. Its mission is to build “Solana on Bitcoin”, which will have investors enjoy the stability and security of the Bitcoin network and the Solana-like transaction speed. Besides, with the new PEP-20 standard, it will enable one to directly launch a memecoin on the most reliable network.

Indeed, introducing the meme culture to the Bitcoin network is seen to be the missing puzzle. It is what has fueled Bitcoin Pepe’s virality as more savvy investors are rushing to be part of this revolutionary wagon. Subsequently, the project has raised over $5.5 million in the past five weeks of its presale.

Besides, its pricing model is meant to favor long-term holders and early adopters. With every stage sold, BPEP token price increases by about 5%. What started at $0.0210 has already surged by 27.6% and is set to yield cumulative gains of 311.4% by the end of the 30 stages. As such, this is the opportune time to be part of a project that will have its holders earn heftily during the presale and beyond. Hurry up and buy Bitcoin Pepe here.

Bitcoin price remains range-bound as the March Fed meeting commences

Bitcoin price has been range-bound for over a week now as Trump’s aggressive trade policy maintains a risk-off mood. Investors are now eyeing further guidance from the Fed’s March meeting which commenced on Tuesday.

In the FOMC statement scheduled for Wednesday, the interest rates are expected to remain unchanged at the current 4.25% – 4.50%. However, the focus will be on the central bank’s tone on the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the country’s economy.

In the near term, the range between the support level of $80,565 and the 25-day EMA at $86,500 will be worth watching. Depending on the Fed’s tone, further rebounding will give the bulls an opportunity to retest the crucial resistance zone of 90,000. On the flipside, further risk aversion may have Bitcoin price retest last week’s low at $78,039.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toncoin (TON) has been making headlines in the crypto world recently, with a surge of 23.11% following a significant event in the life of its creator, Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram. This surge came after Durov was allowed to leave France after a prolonged period of detention, bringing attention to Toncoin’s role in Telegram’s ecosystem. As Telegram’s native currency, Toncoin is used to facilitate transactions such as paying for advertising services on the platform, and it’s been gaining traction with investors who see the potential of the cryptocurrency in the decentralized space.

Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD), a Layer 1 blockchain project, is also making strides in the market. Coldware’s focus on IoT integration and decentralized applications (dApps) is strengthening its position in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly as more devices and systems adopt decentralized technologies. As Toncoin’s price surges, Coldware (COLD)’s rise reflects the growing demand for blockchain solutions that can cater to real-world use cases.

Coldware’s Position in the IoT and Blockchain Space

While Toncoin (TON) continues to benefit from its association with Telegram, Coldware (COLD) is carving out its own niche by focusing on IoT and decentralized finance (DeFi). Coldware’s scalable blockchain infrastructure is designed to handle high transaction volumes with minimal fees, making it an attractive option for industries like IoT, where real-time data and efficient transactions are paramount.

With its low-cost, high-efficiency blockchain, Coldware is poised to become a leader in the decentralized IoT space, providing secure and scalable solutions for businesses and developers.

Toncoin’s Surge and Its Impact on the Market

Toncoin’s 23.11% surge is primarily attributed to the news surrounding Pavel Durov’s release and the increased attention it has brought to Telegram’s crypto infrastructure. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram has been a defining feature of the token’s value proposition, as it is the exclusive currency used for payments within the Telegram ecosystem. With Telegram’s massive user base, Toncoin (TON) has a strong foundation to continue growing, especially as the platform expands its capabilities within the Web3 space.

The recent surge in Toncoin’s price also reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. As the demand for decentralized platforms and applications continues to grow, tokens that play an integral role in these ecosystems are gaining attention from both retail and institutional investors. This is evident in the price movement of Toncoin, which has seen a significant recovery from its lows earlier in 2024.

Coldware vs Toncoin: Different Paths, Similar Potential

While Toncoin focuses on leveraging its position within the Telegram ecosystem, Coldware (COLD) is focusing on a broader set of use cases, particularly in IoT and decentralized applications. Both projects, however, share the common goal of enhancing the decentralized landscape by providing efficient, scalable solutions that can address real-world challenges.

Toncoin’s association with Telegram gives it a unique advantage in terms of user adoption, while Coldware’s focus on scalability and IoT integration positions it to disrupt various industries. Both tokens represent exciting investment opportunities, and as the decentralized network continues to evolve, both Toncoin and Coldware (COLD) could play pivotal roles in shaping the future of blockchain technology.

Conclusion: The Future of Toncoin and Coldware

As Toncoin (TON) strengthens its position within the Telegram ecosystem and Coldware expands its reach within the IoT space, both tokens are poised to experience significant growth in the coming months. With Toncoin’s recent surge and Coldware’s (COLD) continued focus on real-world applications, these two projects are set to be key players in the decentralized revolution.

For investors looking to capitalize on the growth of the decentralized economy, both Toncoin and Coldware (COLD) offer promising opportunities. While Toncoin benefits from its connection to Telegram’s massive user base, Coldware’s emphasis on IoT and scalability positions it as a long-term player in the blockchain space. As both projects continue to grow, their impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem will be felt for years to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed significant growth and change in recent years, with new projects emerging regularly, aiming to capture the attention of investors looking for the next big thing. Coldware (COLD), a rising Layer 1 blockchain solution, is one of the latest cryptocurrencies to make waves in the market. After an impressive 70% surge in its presale, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a key player in the altcoin space, leading many experts to question if altcoin season is finally back. But how does Coldware (COLD) compare to Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme coin that has dominated the market for years?

Coldware (COLD) – The Next Big Altcoin?

Coldware (COLD), on the other hand, is rapidly gaining traction for its technological innovations and real-world use cases. The platform’s focus on scalability and low transaction fees has captured the attention of investors, especially those looking for more than just a speculative investment. The blockchain is designed to address the growing demand for decentralized solutions, particularly in the IoT and Web3 sectors. This sets Coldware (COLD) apart from Dogecoin (DOGE), which has limited functionality beyond being a meme coin.

In addition to its technical advantages, Coldware (COLD) is actively promoting mobile integration with devices like the Larna 2400 smartphone, designed to make decentralized applications (dApps) accessible to a wider audience. By targeting developing countries and economically disadvantaged regions, Coldware (COLD) has the potential to onboard the next 1.3 billion users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This forward-thinking approach could help Coldware (COLD) achieve widespread adoption, setting it on a path toward long-term success.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Challenges

Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been one of the most well-known meme coins, beloved by both retail and institutional investors alike. However, DOGE has been facing increasing difficulties in keeping up with the broader crypto market. One of the most significant recent developments is the formation of a death cross against Bitcoin (BTC). This rare technical pattern, which occurs when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, often signals a bearish trend in the market. Analysts have raised concerns that Dogecoin (DOGE) could face more downward pressure, especially if it continues to struggle against Bitcoin (BTC)’s momentum.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a favorite for many meme coin investors, its primary limitation lies in its lack of innovation and real-world applications. Unlike many newer projects, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still largely driven by social media hype rather than any concrete technological advancements. This leaves the coin vulnerable to market sentiment shifts, and as newer projects like Coldware (COLD) emerge, DOGE could fall behind.

Coldware (COLD) Surpasses Dogecoin (DOGE) in Value and Adoption

With Coldware (COLD) rapidly growing and its presale performing well, many believe it could outpace Dogecoin (DOGE) in terms of adoption and long-term value. The growing institutional interest and real-world applications of Coldware (COLD) make it an attractive investment opportunity, especially as it continues to build its ecosystem. If Coldware (COLD) can maintain its trajectory, it could eventually surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) in value, offering a much more robust platform for future growth.

Conclusion: Is Altcoin Season Back?

The rise of Coldware (COLD) signifies that altcoin season may indeed be back, with projects offering real utility and scalability gaining more attention from both retail and institutional investors. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a popular meme coin, its lack of innovation and real-world use cases may limit its growth potential in the long run. Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as the next major player in the altcoin space, with its focus on Web3 solutions and IoT integration. Investors looking for the next big altcoin opportunity may find that Coldware (COLD) is a much more promising alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bubblemaps (BMT) has spiked more than 110% in the past 24 hours, climbing from lows of $0.12 to intraday highs of $0.29.

This put BMT ahead of Mubarak (MUBARAK) and API3 (API3) in terms of 24-hour performance.

Binance and Bithumb news are likely catalysts for Bubblemap’s price rally.

Bubblemaps’ native token BMT has surged by more than 110% in the past 24 hours, climbing from lows of $0.12 to intraday highs of $0.29.

The altcoin’s gains put it at the top of the 500 largest coins by market cap, ahead of Mubarak (MUBARAK) and API3 (API3). Per CoinMarketCap, the two tokens have surged 77% and 54% respectively in the past 24 hours. Bounce (AUCTION) led gainers on Monday.

Why did Bubblemaps price skyrocket today?

Bubblemap’s BMT is surging amid an overall flip for some altcoins. The cryptocurrency is also surging as BMT’s traction post its token generation event continues.

Part of this upside momentum reflects invstor enthusiasm after major announcements by Binance and Bithumb. Recently, Binance announced the launch of BMT futures and price rallied hard.

On Tuesday, South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb announced trading support. With another major Binance announcement out today, Bubblemaps has skyrocketed.

“Binance is excited to announce the 12th project on the HODLer Airdrops page – Bubblemaps (BMT). Users who subscribed their BNB to Simple Earn (Flexible and/or Locked) and/or On-Chain Yields products from 2025-03-02 00:00 (UTC) to 2025-03-06 23:59 (UTC) will get the airdrops distribution,” the exchange noted.

Users will get the HODLer Airdrops in their spot accounts at least an hour before the exchange rolls out trading.

Expected pairs set to go live on March 18 at 15:00 UTC will be BMT against stablcoins Tether (USDT), USDC (USDC) and First Digital USD (FDUSD). Binance will also list trading pairs against BNB (BNB) and Turkish Lira (TRY).

Bulls push BMT price to all-time high

Positive vibes have propelled BMT’s market capitalization to over $72 million, with trading volume up 257% in 24 hours.

Bubblemaps is a blockchain data visualization platform designed to make complex on-chain data accessible and actionable. Launched on networks like Solana and BNB Chain, Bubblemaps transforms tokenomics and wallet interactions into intuitive bubble charts, helping users identify patterns, clusters, and potential scams.

Its native token, BMT, powers the ecosystem and serves as both a utility and governance token.

Since its token generation event on March 11, hosted on Binance Wallet, Bubblemaps has seen its price jump to the all-time high of $0.29. Notably, BMT is up 266% since its all-time low of $0.07 on March 12.

Momentum has swung upward amid top exchange’s listing of BMT. Apart from Binance and Bithumb, the token is available on Kraken, Bitget and Bybit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy, with top officials emphasizing their commitment to growing the U.S. government’s BTC holdings. Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit today in New York, Bo Hines, Executive Director on Digital Assets for President Trump, made it clear that the United States is determined to accumulate Bitcoin at an unprecedented scale.

“I think it’s high time that our President started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines stated. He went on to reveal that at President Trump’s first-ever digital assets summit at the White House, discussions centered around “ways of acquiring more Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways.”

Hines drew a direct comparison between Bitcoin and gold when asked how much BTC the government intends to hold. “You know, I’ve been asked all the time, it’s like how much do you want? Well, that’s like asking a country how much gold do you want – as much as we can get.”

JUST IN – 🇺🇸 President Trump's Executive Director on digital assets: "We talked about ways of acquiring more Bitcoin in budget neutral ways."



We want "as much as we can get." 🚀 pic.twitter.com/zK8PyQK1Rw — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 18, 2025

His comments align with the administration’s broader strategy following President Trump’s March 6 executive order, which formally established the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The initiative repurposes BTC obtained through forfeitures and seizures, ensuring that the bitcoin remains under government control as a long-term reserve. The very next day, President Trump’s crypto advisor David Sacks underscored the move’s significance, telling Bloomberg: “We’ve decided that Bitcoin is scarce, it’s valuable, and that is strategic for the United States to hold on to this as a long-term reserve asset.”

Beyond retention, the administration is exploring ways to expand its holdings without it costing tax payers anything. At the White House Digital Asset Summit, President Trump himself stated, “The Treasury and Commerce Departments will also explore new pathways to accumulate additional Bitcoin holdings for the reserve.”

The establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has already spurred more legislative action. U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds introduced a bill to solidify Trump’s initiative into law, ensuring it remains intact for future administrations. Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have proposed a separate measure calling for the United States to purchase 200,000 BTC per year over the next five years, totaling 1 million BTC, which would be held for a minimum of 20 years.

With a limited Bitcoin supply and increasing institutional adoption, the administration sees BTC as an essential asset for the nation’s financial future. As Hines put it, “We look at Bitcoin, it’s not a security, it’s a commodity. It has intrinsic stored value, it’s traditionally accepted… and that’s why you saw in the executive order that we compared this to digital gold.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The industry-first “trilateral exchange architecture” creates unprecedented access to over 5,000 cryptocurrencies through a unified platform

The cryptocurrency exchange landscape has historically been divided into distinct, often competing paradigms: centralized exchanges (CEXs) with their speed and user-friendliness versus decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with their autonomy and diversity of assets.

TOKERO Crypto Exchange introduces a radically different approach by creating a unified architecture that integrates these traditionally separate worlds while adding an unprecedented physical dimension.

The Trilateral Exchange Architecture:

The “trilateral exchange architecture” is a unified system that integrates three distinct exchange modalities: CEX, DEX & PEX; representing a cohesive system where these components function as complementary parts of a unified liquidity and access layer.

Hybrid Liquidity Engine

TOKERO’s hybrid liquidity engine creates a unified architecture that:

Routes orders across multiple liquidity sources simultaneously

Connects to major CEX order books (Kraken, Binance)

Integrates with DEX liquidity pools across multiple chains (Ethereum, Solana, etc.)

Provides direct fiat on/off ramps for all assets

The key innovation is enabling users to purchase DEX-only assets directly with fiat currency, eliminating the traditional multi-step process of buying base assets on CEXs and transferring to wallets for DEX trading.

Physical Exchange (PEX)

TOKERO’s PEX offers a groundbreaking solution to cash-to-crypto onboarding by transforming existing retail locations into crypto access points through software rather than hardware. This innovation enables customers to purchase any asset in TOKERO’s ecosystem—including thousands of DEX-only tokens—directly with cash, eliminating the need for multiple conversions or technical blockchain knowledge. Unlike traditional crypto ATMs that require $10,000-15,000 in hardware costs per location, PEX’s software-based approach enables unprecedented scalability at a fraction of the cost, allowing users to simply walk into a PEX location, pay cash for tokens only available on platforms like Uniswap or Jupiter, and receive them directly in their wallet.

Their goal of 50,000 PEX locations worldwide represents a physical distribution network beyond anything previously attempted in cryptocurrency.

Cross-Chain Aggregation Architecture

Another unique aspect of TOKERO’s technical implementation is their cross-chain aggregation architecture. TOKERO gives seamless access to thousands of tokens across multiple blockchain ecosystems without requiring users to manually interact with bridges or manage multiple chain-specific wallets.

OnRamp Iframe

TOKERO’s OnRamp iframe technology represents a significant innovation in crypto distribution. They’ve engineered an embeddable component that allows any website to offer direct purchases of any token in their system – including tokens that exist only on DEXs – without requiring users to leave the site or interact with external exchanges.

NeoBank Integration

TOKERO’s neobanking initiative creates a seamless integration between banking services and their hybrid exchange, allowing:

Direct fiat-to-crypto flows from bank accounts Integrated financial management Compliant fiat on/off-ramps with traditional banking features

Technical Innovation Beyond Incrementalism

What makes TOKERO’s approach genuinely innovative is that it transcends the incrementalism that characterizes most exchange development. Rather than simply optimizing existing exchange paradigms, they’ve engineered a fundamentally new architecture that unifies traditionally separate exchange models into a cohesive system. This is the future of crypto!

The result is a platform with capabilities that literally cannot exist in traditional exchange architectures – direct fiat purchases of DEX-only tokens, physical access points for thousands

As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to expand and fragment across chains and exchange types, unified access layers like TOKERO’s will become increasingly crucial for mainstream adoption.

Limassol, Cyprus, March 18th, 2025, Chainwire

PropellerAds, a global leader in performance-driven advertising solutions, has launched a groundbreaking advertising format: ads within Telegram Mini Apps. This new traffic type is designed to tap into Telegram’s rapidly growing ecosystem, offering advertisers unparalleled access to a crypto-oriented audience. With the integration of blockchain technology and the rise of Telegram Mini Apps built on the TON, this initiative opens a powerful new channel for advertisers in the crypto, Bitcoin, and blockchain sectors.

The announcement comes as PropellerAds officially rolls out this feature, which provides advertisers with immediate access to traffic with strong engagement from users, including those interested in crypto and blockchain. .

Telegram Mini Apps: A Gateway to Crypto-Oriented Users

Telegram Mini Apps are lightweight applications hosted within the Telegram messenger. Users can access a wide range of services — from crypto wallets to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms — without leaving the app. PropellerAds’ new advertising solution allows brands to reach this highly engaged audience through ad formats natively integrated into Mini Apps , including interstitial ads, task-list placements, and banners, seamlessly integrated into the Telegram Mini Apps experience.

A key feature of this offering is that the audience is actively engaged with in-app activities, and various ad delivery mechanisms are available — ranging from traditional online advertising formats like interstitial ads to more engagement-driven approaches, such as displaying ads when a user has depleted their in-game lives. This flexibility allows advertisers to choose the most suitable format for their campaign goals. This approach enhances engagement and aligns perfectly with the behavior of crypto users, who are accustomed to earning tokens and rewards through blockchain-based platforms, making engagement-driven formats a natural fit for certain segments of the audience.

Unlocking New Opportunities for Crypto Advertisers

PropellerAds’ integration with Telegram Mini Apps offers a new opportunity for advertisers in the crypto and blockchain space. This traffic type provides access to a global audience, including key regions such as Europe (including CIS countries), India, and parts of Africa—areas with strong crypto adoption.

Unlike traditional channels such as search engines and social media, PropellerAds offers a crypto-friendly moderation process, allowing blockchain-related brands to launch campaigns without the need for dedicated agencies or massive budgets. With a minimum deposit of just $100, advertisers of all sizes can access this high-potential traffic stream.

PropellerAds already provided services for various blockchain-oriented products, including crypto wallets, educational applications for crypto enthusiasts, and Telegram channels. This diverse range of partners demonstrates the flexibility and effectiveness of our platform for the crypto and blockchain industry.

The platform’s advanced targeting capabilities ensure that advertisers can connect with the most relevant users. PropellerAds’ CPA-based bidding model further enhances ROI, giving advertisers complete control over campaign performance and budget allocation. Additionally, today’s PropellerAds platform includes almost all the features advertisers are accustomed to in traditional ad networks, such as auto-optimization, CPA-based bidding, retargeting, and smart bidding models powered by machine learning technologies. These tools allow advertisers to fine-tune their campaigns, maximize efficiency, and scale with precision.

Gibraltar-based private bank Xapo said Tuesday it is now accepting members’ Bitcoin as collateral for loans.

The new service allows customers to access up to $1 million in Bitcoin-backed debt, except for those located in the UK and Australia, Gadi Chait, a Xapo investment manager, told Decrypt.

“We think it’s a great piece of collateral to lend against,” Chait added, referring to the asset that Xapo has safeguarded on behalf of customers since 2013.

As Wall Street firms like Cantor Fitzgerald develop their own Bitcoin financing businesses, Chait said Xapo is expanding its “one-stop shop” to give customers more options in most regions.

Xapo was among the first crypto banks to establish a physical headquarters in Europe, settling down in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar during crypto’s pandemic-era boom.

Last year, the firm said it gained regulatory approval in the UK, allowing it to provide interest-bearing Bitcoin accounts, among other banking services, to customers in the region.

Within the U.S., Bitcoin-backed lending has recently made a return. While companies like Coinbase ceased issuing Bitcoin-backed loans in 2023, the San Francisco-based exchange restarted them in January, tapping a decentralized lending protocol called Morpho.

Some asset managers are using decentralized finance, or DeFi, to earn yield from Bitcoin-backed loans as well. Among them is Bitwise, which recently made an allocation on Maple Finance, the lending protocol said earlier this month.

Xapo, of course, is a centralized entity. The bank’s customers need approval, and their corresponding Bitcoin is held “in a vault until the loan is repaid” over a period of time that can last as long as a year, according to a statement.

The crypto lending industry was among the buzziest corners of crypto heading into 2022.

But following a series of high-profile bankruptcies that culminated in the collapse of FTX, the practice fell out of favor with market participants while drawing regulatory heat in the U.S.

“Many long-term Bitcoin holders have steered away from crypto-asset-backed lending after seeing predatory lending practices and products they couldn't count on,” Xapo CEO Seamus Rocca said in a statement. “That’s why we’re doing things differently.”

Xapo was founded by Wences Casares, an entrepreneur born in Argentina. In 2015, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman described him as “Patient Zero for Bitcoin in Silicon Valley” and among the earliest Bitcoin devotees in the U.S., per Entrepreneur.

Ethereum metaverse game The Sandbox is kicking off its fifth season with a new in-game Jurassic World experience created in collaboration with Universal and Ambling Entertainment, allowing the player to become an employee of a dinosaur park.

The high-profile launch of Jurassic World: Dinosaur Preserve comes as part of a six-week long season that will pack in over 40 new experiences including content from other entertainment brands like Attack on Titan, The Smurfs, and The Terminator, all built on an improved game creator allowing for new features.

The Sandbox is an open-world video game on PC and Mac that invites players to explore and create in its blocky world. Users can purchase NFTs that represent a piece of land in the virtual world, which they can then build what they like on. Along the way, tons of brands have teamed up with the game's creators and deployed their own experiences for players to enjoy.

Jurassic World, the current evolution of the iconic Jurassic Park film franchise, is the latest major IP to enter The Sandbox—and the in-game event will take place ahead of the July 2 theatrical debut of the latest film, "Jurassic World Rebirth."

The in-game event will serve as the flagship product of the game’s Alpha Season 5, set to launch later this month, as players become a member of the Dinosaur Protection Group.

In this role, users are tasked with ensuring the park runs smoothly without the presence of Owen Grady—the main character of the films, played by Chris Pratt. Players will be given dinosaur eggs that they will need to care for, and then once hatched, they'll need to care for the baby dino for it to mature into an adult. The dinosaurs will grow using Jurassic Points, earned by performing tasks such as feeding or cleaning the dinosaurs.

“Alpha Season 5 marks a significant milestone for The Sandbox as we work towards our vision of building a social metaverse that combines gamified storytelling for brands with new formats for interactive user-generated content and culture,” The Sandbox co-founder and COO Sebastien Borget told Decrypt.

There will be 10 types of dinosaur eggs, half of which will be free-to-play herbivorous dinosaurs while the other half will be premium, purchasable carnivorous dinosaurs. Both the eggs and dinosaurs will be issued as NFTs with a limited supply.

This in-game event will kick-start the broader six-week season that's set to feature 40 new experiences—half of which will be user-generated, while the others leverage big brand partnerships.

During this period, more than $1 million worth of SAND tokens and over 50 NFTs will be up for grabs for players via the in-game battle pass. The Sandbox's NFTs are issued on Ethereum scaling network Polygon, though earlier assets were deployed on Ethereum's own mainnet.

All of these experiences have been built using The Sandbox’s new game maker, which offers improved character animations and gameplay features, plus a brand new ability system—which, for example, can grant players the ability to fly or double jump. Borget said that season launches offer a way to showcase new functionality and highlight fresh brand experiences.

“We plan on releasing multiple seasons this year," Borget added, "and alongside that, creating strong LiveOps and metagameplay that allows players to progress and be rewarded on a platform level, outside of individual, siloed experiences.”

API3’s unique Oracle solution which cuts middleware offers sustainability.

Moonwell switched from Chainlink to API3, showing growing adoption.

API3’s price surge has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. At press time, the API3 decentralized Oracle platform token had skyrocketed, climbing 56.5% in just 24 hours to trade at $0.9587.

With a market cap of $114.25 million and an astonishing $340.28 million in trading volume, API3 is defying a sluggish broader crypto market where giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain below $85,000 and $2,000, respectively.

This remarkable API3 price pump, following a 36% rise reported on March 17, begs the question: what’s driving API3’s meteoric ascent?

API3’s unique Oracle solution gains traction

At its core, API3 addresses a critical pain point in blockchain technology: connecting smart contracts to reliable real-world data.

Launched with a whitepaper in September 2020 and a token sale in December that raised tens of millions, API3 allows API providers to operate their own nodes, cutting out costly and centralized middleware like traditional oracles. This innovation dubbed the “Blockchain Oracle Problem” solution, is amplified by its OEV Network, which introduces maximal extractable value (MEV) protection.

By auctioning Oracle updates and redistributing 80% of proceeds as rewards to dApps, API3 creates a sustainable revenue model that’s turning heads. Posts on X highlight this feature, with users noting February OEV revenue of $44,000 and a runway exceeding 10 years, signalling a robust business model that’s close to profitability.

Adoption is another key driver. The recent switch by Moonwell from Chainlink to API3 for cost-effective, tamper-proof data feeds underscores its growing credibility.

Unlike Chainlink, API3’s decentralized API framework and MEV protection offer a compelling alternative, especially as blockchain applications in DeFi and supply chain management expand. With 23,630 holders and a circulating supply of 118.31 million out of 147.65 million tokens, the project’s fundamentals are aligning with market enthusiasm, fueling its upward trajectory.

AIP3 price prediction

AIP3 numbers tell a dramatic story. API3 hit an all-time low of $0.4981 on March 11, 2025, only to rebound 96.1% within a week.

Notably, its 24-hour range of $0.6007 to $1.03, coupled with a 78.8% seven-day gain, showcases intense speculative fervour.

Analysts see API3 as a 2025 contender, potentially rivalling Chainlink. Its 90.5% drop from an all-time high of $10.30 in April 2021 leaves room for growth, while a 4.9% hourly gain and 8.5% monthly rise signal sustained interest.

However, on the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is rising steadily currently sitting at 66.38 just around 3 points below the overbought region. This means the token could be headed for a pullback.

Though risks like overbought conditions loom, API3’s innovative tech, adoption momentum, and market buzz, echoed by market sentiment, explain why it’s pumping now. As blockchain reliance grows, API3’s practical solution could keep it in the spotlight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZachXBT has blasted the “Hyperliquid 50x leverage whale” as “a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds.”

The whale netted a $9 million profit despite efforts by crypto traders to liquidate the position.

ZachXBT has previously unmasked bad actors and identified hackers, including those behind the Bybit hack in February 2025

On-chain investigator ZachXBT says the “Hyperliquid 50x leverage whale” that has attracted massive attention across X is “just a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds.”

The on-chain sleuth’s comment came as the whale closed their high-leverage trading position, 50x, with a notable $9 million profit.

Despite efforts by crypto Twitter to marshal a liquidation for the Hyperliquid whale, the trader emerged unscathed – yet again.

Hyperliquid 50x whale a criminal – ZachXBT says

ZachXBT commented on this, revealing who the whale is and is not. He shared the investigative view via X:

“It’s funny watching CT speculate on the “Hyperliquid whale” when in reality it’s just a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds.”

Replying to a user comment, ZachXBT noted that the criminal whale has no links to the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group. In February this year, the blockchain sleuth linked the $1.5 billion Bybit hack to the hacker group.

Some X users asked that ZachXBT names and shames the Hyperliquid whale. However, his response was:

“We’ll see, it’s just not enjoyable posting investigations on X/Twitter anymore.”

Crypto ‘hunted’ for the mysterious whale

For weeks, the crypto market has speculated on who the mysterious Hyperliquid whale may be. A hunt for their identity and efforts to drag them down surfaced.

This hunt for the trader who opened a short position worth about $450 million on Bitcoin (BTC) intensified on Tuesday.

Amid the rush to liquidate him, analysts pointed to the whale’s 40x and 50x shorting of BTC and ETH as massive. The reaction had most traders looking to wreck the whale’s position with a flurry of buying deals. In fact, according to Lookonchain, the whale had to deposit $5 million USDC “to increase margin and avoid liquidation.”

But the effort to wreck the whale ultimately failed.

As well as th 50x short leveraged position on Ethereum (ETH), this whale also shorted Chainlink (LINK), opening a huge $31 million position with 10x leverage. The whale has also placed short bids on GMX.

While ZachXBT clarified this whale isn’t tied to North Korea, the incident highlights the challenge the crypto community faces amid bad actor incidents.

The issue of stolen funds making it back into circulation via decentralized finance protocols remains. It also points to the overall impact of massive leverage on the market, particularly when criminals tap into high-leverage trades to gamble stolen funds.

Although this particular whale’s identity may interest the broader ecosystem, the big question going forward is how does crypto reign in this potentially impactful scenario.</p>

Singapore, Singapore, March 18th, 2025

KIP Protocol, the Web3 base layer for AI, has successfully completed the first-ever fully autonomous on-chain AI trading tournament, marking a significant milestone in self-learning artificial intelligence. Powered by Superior Agents, the world’s first truly autonomous AI framework, the competition demonstrated how AI-driven market strategies can evolve, adapt, and execute trades without human intervention.

Over 48 hours of live trading, AI agents started with an equal balance of $500, dynamically refining their strategies in real-time. By the tournament’s conclusion, SEFER, running on o3-mini, secured first place with a 34.8% increase in capital, finishing at $674. PONDER, powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, followed with a 6.2% gain, reaching $531. DEIXIS, operating on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, closed at $530 with a 6.0% increase, while VERITY, using DeepSeek V3, ended with a slight 1.0% loss at $495. The competition also awarded a $150 USDT prize to @Zardl00n, who made the most accurate prediction of SEFER’s final balance.

Unlike traditional algorithmic trading models, Superior Agents do not follow predefined rules or static datasets. Instead, they self-learn, refine their decision-making, and develop novel strategies through trial and error. The tournament served as a stress test for financial autonomy, proving that AI can navigate and optimize within a live trading environment without human oversight. This marks a fundamental shift in AI capabilities, moving beyond programmed behaviors to dynamic, self-improving intelligence capable of surviving and thriving in real-world economic conditions.

Dr. Jennifer Dodgson, Co-Founder and Chief Researcher of Superior Agents, emphasized the tournament’s significance in the evolution of AI. “This event was more than just a competition—it was a proof of concept. We now have AI agents that are not only trading but actively learning from their successes and failures, evolving their strategies in real-time. This is a glimpse into the future of AI-driven economies, where autonomous agents sustain themselves financially and operate independently in complex environments.”

Following the success of the tournament, KIP Protocol plans to expand the Superior Agent framework into new domains, including cybersecurity, AI-driven gaming, and autonomous business intelligence. Future iterations will introduce more challenging environments, increasing complexity and pushing the limits of self-learning AI. With deeper integration into the KIP Protocol ecosystem, these advancements will unlock new opportunities for $KIP holders, further solidifying AI’s role in decentralized economies.

As Superior Agents continue to evolve, the next phase of testing will explore how they adapt to unpredictable, high-stakes environments. These upcoming challenges aim to further refine AI autonomy and influence the evolution of AI-driven finance and other industries. KIP remains focused on expanding the capabilities of AI, and exploring its potential in real-world applications.

Bitcoin is consolidating in the $82,000-$84,000 range after a 22% correction from its all-time high

Technical analysis shows Bitcoin forming a cup-and-handle pattern with a potential target of $130,000-$139,000

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) just purchased another 130 BTC, bringing their total to nearly 500,000 BTC

Analysts see the current downturn as a temporary “shakeout” rather than the end of Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle

On-chain data indicates strong accumulation by long-term holders despite price fluctuations

Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range between $82,000 and $84,000 in recent days, following a 22% correction from its all-time high of $108,786 reached in January 2025. The market sentiment has turned cautious as hopes for a quick return above $90,000 have begun to fade.

However, technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin may be forming a cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern has been developing over multiple years, with the rounded bottom phase stretching from 2021 to mid-2024.

The cup-and-handle pattern completed its handle phase in November 2024. This led to an impressive rally that resulted in Bitcoin reaching its new all-time high in January 2025.

The recent 24% correction has brought Bitcoin’s price back to the neckline resistance of the cup-and-handle formation. This neckline is expected to serve as support for the current price action.

Elliott wave analysis presents an even more bullish case. Bitcoin is currently in a larger fifth impulse wave formation, which is typically bullish despite being interrupted by corrective ABC sub-waves.

According to this technical framework, Bitcoin could target price levels above $130,000. Some projections put the specific target at around $139,000.

Despite these bullish technical indicators, Bitcoin’s fundamentals show some uncertainty in the short term. There is currently a lack of momentum needed to challenge the $90,000 mark.

Steady institutional outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs have increased selling pressure. This has limited Bitcoin’s ability to regain strength in the immediate term.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company recently purchased another 130 BTC for $10.7 million.

This latest acquisition brings Strategy’s total holdings to 499,226 BTC. This is worth approximately $33.1 billion at current prices.

Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. The company has consistently acquired Bitcoin even during market downturns.

Their average purchase price across all holdings stands at $66,360 per BTC. This demonstrates their long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition.

Market Analysis

Market analysts are viewing the current downturn differently than typical bear markets. Many describe it as a temporary “shakeout” rather than the end of Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle.

Bitfinex analysts note that “corrections within bull cycles are normal.” They suggest this may be a shakeout rather than the start of a prolonged bear market.

Despite fears of a disrupted bull market, Bitcoin’s four-year cycle and the recent halving event remain crucial for price action. The 2024 Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, reduced the network’s block reward to 3.125 BTC per block.

Bitcoin’s price is up over 31% since the last halving. This event was considered the “most bullish” setup for Bitcoin price, partly due to growing institutional interest.

On-chain data shows strong holder resilience and continued accumulation. More Bitcoin is being held for longer periods, with short-term holders converting to long-term holders.

CryptoQuant analysts highlight that “this trend highlights a hodling behavior.” Investors are refraining from selling despite the current market correction.

Historically, this type of resilience among Bitcoin holders has played a crucial role in forming market bottoms. It often ignites new uptrends.

While some analysts predict Bitcoin could reach as high as $600,000, CoinCodex’s algorithm offers a more moderate forecast. It suggests BTC will surpass $175,000 by the end of 2025.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $83,500. The next few weeks will be critical in determining whether the support holds and the predicted rally materializes.

For those tracking Bitcoin’s price action, keeping an eye on the $72,000-$73,000 support range will be essential. Broader market factors, including global treasury yields and equity trends, will likely influence Bitcoin’s next major move.</p>

XRP is currently trading between $2.30 and $2.47, down 1.6% from the previous month

Analyst “XRP Captain” believes $100 is a realistic target for XRP this bull run

Analyst Egrag Crypto predicts double digits this cycle and triple digits in the next cycle

Dark Defender suggests XRP could reach $333 if it repeats its 2017 bull run performance

Critics question the feasibility of such high prices due to market capitalization concerns

XRP is currently experiencing high volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The digital asset has been trading between $2.30 and $2.47 this month. This represents a 1.6% decrease from its value in the previous month.

The cryptocurrency reached a three-month low of $1.96 on March 11, 2025. Despite this recent dip, some analysts remain very optimistic about XRP’s future price movements.

Crypto analyst “XRP Captain” recently shared a bold prediction on Twitter/X. In a post dated March 15, 2025, the analyst claimed that “$100 is Ripple’s realistic target this cycle.” This post generated numerous replies from the crypto community.

However, XRP Captain’s prediction lacked specific details. The analyst did not provide a timeframe for when this price target might be reached. There was also no mention of what factors or events could trigger such a dramatic price increase.

Another prominent analyst, Egrag Crypto, offered a somewhat more conservative estimate for XRP. In a Twitter/X thread, Egrag Crypto stated that XRP will reach double digits during the current market cycle. The analyst further predicted that XRP would surge to triple digits in the next cycle.

Technical Anaylsis

Egrag Crypto used technical analysis to support these predictions. The analyst referred to a “Just Do It” chart showing measured wave patterns. According to this analysis, Egrag Crypto believes XRP has the potential to reach $13 in the near term.

These optimistic price targets for XRP have sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community. Some investors find these predictions reasonable based on technical analysis. Others view them as overly ambitious given current market conditions.

Crypto commentator Dark Defender has also weighed in on XRP’s price potential. Dark Defender suggested that XRP could surge to $333 if it repeats its performance from the 2017 bull run. This would represent an extraordinary increase from its current trading price of $2.34.

Critics have questioned these high price predictions. They point to market capitalization concerns as a limiting factor. At a price of $280, XRP’s market cap would reach approximately $1.6 trillion based on current circulating supply.

Dark Defender dismissed these market cap concerns. The commentator claimed that cryptocurrency market capitalization “doesn’t matter” and is “just an illusion.” This viewpoint has added fuel to the ongoing debate about XRP’s price potential.

XRP has been one of the top-performing digital assets in the fourth quarter of 2024. This performance has attracted attention from both supporters and critics in the cryptocurrency space. The asset continues to have a strong following despite recent price volatility.

The bearish sentiment has been affecting XRP in recent weeks. This downward pressure contributed to the three-month low observed on March 11. However, the cryptocurrency has shown some recovery since that point.

Trading activity for XRP remains active as investors evaluate these various price predictions. The cryptocurrency continues to be listed on major exchanges where it maintains good trading volume. Market participants appear divided on the asset’s short-term price direction.

Recent blockchain data shows movement of large XRP holdings. Reports indicate that 200 million XRP tokens were transferred recently. Some speculate this could be related to Ripple preparing for strategic market moves.

As of the latest data, XRP is trading at $2.34 according to TradingView charts. Investors continue to monitor XRP closely as market conditions evolve and analyst predictions play out in the coming months.</p>

Bitcoin experienced a major open interest wipeout of nearly $12 billion, dropping from $61.42 billion to $49.71 billion

This 19% reduction in open interest is viewed by analysts as a healthy market reset necessary for bullish continuation

Historical patterns suggest similar deleveraging events have created good short to medium-term opportunities

The OI drop coincided with price volatility triggered by uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and US interest rates

Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,500, having recovered from dipping below $80,000 in late February

Bitcoin has gone through a major market reset in recent weeks. Open interest in Bitcoin futures dropped by nearly $12 billion. This represents a 19% decline from February 20 to March 4.

Data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin’s open interest fell from $61.42 billion to $49.71 billion during this period. Open interest measures the total number of unsettled derivative contracts like options and futures.

This drop happened during a time of price volatility for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s price went below $90,000 on February 25. Just two days later, it dropped below $80,000 for the first time since November.

Market analysts see this deleveraging as a positive development. “This can be considered as a natural market reset, an essential phase for sustaining a bullish continuation,” said CryptoQuant contributor DarkFost in a March 17 report.

The reset was triggered by several factors. Political uncertainty related to President Trump’s tariff decisions played a role. Questions about the future of US interest rates also added to market worries.

These concerns led to what one analyst called “a massive liquidation of leveraged positions on Bitcoin.” When too many traders use leverage, it can create conditions for sharp price swings.

As of this report, Bitcoin is trading at around $83,500. This represents a recovery from the lows seen in late February but still shows a 14.58% drop over the past 30 days.

Market Reset Signals Potential Recovery

The cryptocurrency’s open interest has begun to recover slightly. It currently sits at $49.02 billion, showing a 6.5% increase over the past five days.

Looking at historical patterns gives reason for optimism. CryptoQuant’s analysis shows that past deleveraging events have created good opportunities in the short to medium term.

One chart shared by analysts tracks Bitcoin open interest and its 90-day percentage change over recent years. The current reading shows a 90-day change of -14%, marking a fresh low point.

This cooldown in futures market activity might set the stage for a price rebound. When open interest drops this way, it often removes market excess that can lead to extreme volatility.

The Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 19 could bring more clarity. Markets currently price in a 99% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Bitcoin chief analyst Ryan Lee notes that any unexpected hawkish signals from the Fed “could put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets.” The market is watching closely for any surprises.

The Fear and Greed Index for crypto markets currently sits at 32 out of 100. This reading puts sentiment firmly in the “fear” zone ahead of the Fed meeting.

For now, traders are taking a cautious approach. Daily trading volume for BTC/USDT pairs has almost doubled on major exchanges over the last 24 hours, showing increased activity despite the uncertain outlook.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Central Bank (ECB) is laying the groundwork for the probable launch of its wholesale and retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Digital Euro. Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, shared this update at their latest press conference. “President Lagarde stressed that the digital euro is ‘more relevant than ever,'” the ECB tweeted.

Lagarde emphasized that the Digital Euro, the EU’s CBDC solution, is set to launch in October 2025—provided it passes the legislative phase involving key stakeholders, including the European Commission, Parliament, and Council. Notably absent from this process is the European public, despite the significant impact this initiative will have on their daily lives.

Why Is the Digital Euro More Relevant Than Ever?

Could it be linked to Ursula von der Leyen’s recent “ReArm Europe” announcement, which proposes the creation of an EU army? This initiative requires an estimated €800 billion in funding—money the EU does not have. The options? Extracting it from EU member states and their citizens or printing fresh funds via the ECB. Either way, it’s time to warm up the ECB’s money printers!

We are living in dangerous times.



Europe‘s security is threatened in a very real way.



Today I present ReArm Europe.

Furthermore, The EU has introduced the “Savings and Investments Union”, aiming to redirect €10 trillion in “unused savings” from citizens to finance military growth and bolster Europe’s defense industry. “We’ll turn private savings into much-needed investment,” tweeted von der Leyen. If this hasn’t shocked you already, I’ll try to clarify: This is a clear violation of private property rights, and an implicit confiscation of Europeans’ wealth, while bluntly using their funds as the EU sees fit, including funding of a military industrial complex, without even asking them.

If the EU is accelerating toward totalitarian collectivism, as this statement suggests, then a CBDC would be a powerful tool—enabling tighter control over Europeans’ money with features like an “on/off” switch and programming abilities.

If most of your money is still in fiat the bank / stocks / mortgaged real estate etc. – they don’t need your permission.

They want you owning nothing, despaired & numb.

Christine Lagarde recently campaigned at the European Parliament, arguing that the Digital Euro is necessary to reduce the EU’s dependence on foreign payment solutions. European banks must innovate payment methods, but the EU’s primary concern isn’t just reliance on tech giants like Google Pay or Apple Pay—it’s the potential for widespread adoption of decentralized global protocols like Bitcoin.

The ECB continues campaigning for the digital Euro, a centralized European payment mechanism – to 'decrease dependency on external forces'. #CBDC pic.twitter.com/ovlkYX0bsQ — Efrat Fenigson (@efenigson) March 15, 2025

The ECB is observing geopolitical trends, noting that the U.S. is embracing crypto, Bitcoin, and stablecoins—technologies that pose a risk to centralized control. Unsurprisingly, they are choosing a different path. According to Reuters, “Eurozone banks need a digital euro to respond to U.S. President Donald Trump’s push to promote stablecoins” as part of a broader crypto strategy. ECB board member Piero Cipollone reinforced this stance, stating, “This solution further disintermediates banks as they lose fees, they lose clients… That’s why we need a digital euro.”

Bottom line, Lagarde’s and Von der Leyen’s recent agendas are aimed to drive more centralised control while strengthening the EU hierarchy, governance and incentive structure – that has always been their role.

New Digital Euro CBDC Survey

The ECB recently published findings from a survey on consumer attitudes toward retail CBDC, conducted among 19,000 Europeans across 11 Eurozone countries. Key takeaways include:

1) Lack of Interest – Most Europeans are not interested in the Digital Euro, as existing payment methods already serve their needs well.

Why would you not adopt the digital euro? source: European Central Bank

2) Europeans are Open to Propaganda – While public interest is low, the survey found that Europeans are receptive to video-based education and training. The ECB’s study suggests that CBDC-related videos could drive widespread adoption by reshaping consumer beliefs. The report states: “Consumers who are shown a short video providing concise and clear communication about the key features of the digital euro are substantially more likely to update their beliefs… which increases their immediate likelihood of adopting it.” No wonder the ECB has ramped up its digital euro video content since late 2024. For example:



Propaganda for European CBDC, the digital euro, has began. Be aware. pic.twitter.com/wStnfrZROZ — Efrat Fenigson (@efenigson) November 14, 2024

3) Preference for Existing Payment Methods – “Europeans have a strong preference for existing payment methods and see no real benefit in a new type of payment system”. While this finding sounds like a positive pushback, it can serve as a precursor to a tactic of technological integrations. “If you can’t beat them, join them” tactic – similarly to the Chinese e-CNY retail CBDC.

A recent Euromoney article highlighted e-CNY’s integration with China’s most popular apps (DiDi, Meituan, Ctrip, WeChat Pay, and Alipay), a move that facilitated its widespread adoption. Despite early struggles, e-CNY now boasts 180 million personal wallet users and a cumulative transaction value of $1 trillion. I recently explored this topic in depth with Roger Huang recently on my podcast.

Not Just Retail—Wholesale Too

On the wholesale CBDC front, the EU is experimenting with distributed ledger technology (DLT) to interconnect financial institutions across Europe and beyond. This follows exploratory work conducted by the Eurosystem between May and November 2024. Their trials involved 64 participants—including central banks, financial market players, and DLT platform operators—conducting over 50 experiments.

“Digital Cash“

Lagarde insists that the Digital Euro is a form of cash, gaslighting and misleading uninformed Europeans about the risks of CBDCs. Permission-based CBDCs such as the Digital Euro are prone to micro levels of control through expiry dates, geofencing and programmability. If Europeans don’t recognize these dangers, they won’t resist the Digital Euro. By framing it as “digital cash,” the ECB ensures smoother public acceptance with little to no public fuss.

[2025] Europeans!

Are you ready for “YOUR Digital Euro”?

Christine Lagarde is prepping you to the next phase of EU’s CBDC, which is everything *but* a form of cash (nice try though). pic.twitter.com/t6mG5liw26 — Efrat Fenigson (@efenigson) January 5, 2025

To be clear, cash itself is fiat currency—centrally controlled, easily debased, and prone to inflation. Every time the issuer expands the money supply, citizens suffer from declining purchasing power, essentially being robbed by the state.

“Rules for Thee, But Not for Me”

While ordinary citizens are bound by the rule of law, elites often evade consequences. A prime example is Christine Lagarde, who was found guilty of negligence for approving a massive taxpayer-funded payout to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie. However, she avoided a jail sentence. The Guardian reported in 2016: “A French court convicted the head of the International Monetary Fund and former government minister, who had faced a €15,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But it decided she should not be punished, and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. … The IMF gave her its full support.”

My Prediction for the EU’s CBDC

Despite public disinterest, the ECB (and other central banks) will push forward with their CBDCs. To maintain the illusion of public involvement, they will conduct surveys and create engagement tools. But ultimately, the Digital Euro will be integrated into existing payment methods and consumer apps—just as China did with e-CNY. This strategy will drive adoption even without direct public enthusiasm.

We are, after all, playing the game of “democracy,” right?

Geopolitical analyst Alex Krainer recently tweeted in response to Lagarde and von der Leyen’s acceleration of CBDC efforts: “This is excellent news; Christine Lagarde and Ursula von der Leyen never took on something they didn’t completely mess up. I hope they’ll continue with their excellent performance. Godspeed.”

Stay tuned as I continue to track central banks’ moves toward CBDC implementation.

Solana deleted a controversial ad after backlash for its messaging about gender identity issues

The ad depicted “America” wanting to “invent technologies, not genders” in an apparent criticism of progressive values

The ad received widespread criticism from crypto industry figures for being divisive and offensive

The controversial messaging appeared to contradict Solana’s previous commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion

The ad had over 1.2 million views before being removed, with some suggesting it was intentional “rage bait” marketing

Solana has deleted an advertisement from its social media accounts following strong criticism from the crypto community. The ad, which ran for about nine hours, sparked debate for its messaging related to gender identity issues.

The advertisement was posted on March 17 with the caption “America is back. Time to Accelerate.” It showed a man representing “America” in a therapy session. The therapist told him he should focus on “coming up with a new gender” and “focus on pronouns” instead of thinking about innovation and crypto.

In the ad, the man eventually says he wants to “build onchain and reclaim my place as the beacon of innovation” and that he wants “to invent technologies, not genders.” The ad featured patriotic music playing in the background.

Before being removed, the video had been viewed over 1.2 million times. It received more than 1,300 comments and 1,400 reposts on X (formerly Twitter). Most of the responses were negative.

Took them 9 hours to delete it. Also all the major players in the Solana ecosystem suddenly delete their tweets promoting/supporting the ad and RT’d and liked takes about it being bad. They approved this, supported it and celebrated it. They rolled it back because it hurt… pic.twitter.com/kPMERDpTcn — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2025

Many crypto industry leaders spoke out against the ad. Sean O’Connor, operating chief at Web3 infrastructure firm Blocknative, called it “tone deaf” on social media. He noted the timing was poor given recent policy changes affecting transgender people.

hey @solana – for real? at a time when trans people are getting denied passports and being erased by the government… this is the ad you put out? this is so fucking tone deaf https://t.co/p2hF5jIb9c — sean o’connor | gas network ⛽ (@aseoconnor) March 17, 2025

David McIntyre, operating chief at DoubleZero, described the ad as “horrendous.” He questioned why Solana didn’t “keep the message positive instead of dunking on people and making light of serious cultural issues.”

The controversy comes shortly after President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. On his first day back, Trump revoked executive orders aimed at preventing discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. He also signed an order recognizing only two sexes and removed the option for Americans to choose “X” as a gender on passports.

Nicolas Pennie, co-founder of Solana development platform Helius, commented that “virtue signaling will always be cringe regardless of political ideology.” This suggests that some viewed the ad as an attempt to appeal to certain political viewpoints.

Some initial supporters of the ad later changed their position. Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain deleted his post praising the ad “after some reflection.” He had previously called it “bold and risky.”

From DEI to Controversy

Critics pointed out that the ad seemed to contradict Solana’s previous stance on diversity and inclusion. Just weeks before President Trump’s election victory, the Solana Foundation held a conference in Singapore with a code of conduct that showed strong support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

That code of conduct prohibited “deliberate verbal or physical intimidation” based on “gender,” “gender identity and expression,” or other traits. It stated: “The Solana Foundation is committed to the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect.”

Tyler Bench, CRO of on-chain governance platform Tally.xyz, had harsh words for the advertisement. He wrote on X: “This might be the single most toxic piece of content I have ever consumed. It’s like the Coinbase ads if they were created by an incel who hasn’t left the basement in years.”

Anneri van der Merwe, product lead at Base, criticized the ad for going against crypto’s inclusive values. “Offensive, cringe, and pandering. Base is for everyone. Solana co-opted the ‘is for everyone’ phrase last week too. This ad shows there’s still a long way to go in truly embracing that ethos,” van der Merwe posted.

This new solana ad misses the mark so much. Offensive, cringe, and pandering. Base is for everyone. Solana co-opted the "is for everyone" phrase last week too. This ad shows there’s still a long way to go in truly embracing that ethos.https://t.co/cz5UVTsIMK — aneri.base.eth (@0xAneri) March 17, 2025

Even Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko seemed to distance himself from the campaign. He suggested in a social media post that the company’s previous “Maren ad was better,” referring to an earlier, less controversial marketing effort.

Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, suggested the deletion was business-motivated rather than a change of heart. “They rolled it back because it hurt their business, not because they thought it was wrong,” he wrote on X on March 18.

Some industry observers suggested the advertisement may have been intentional “rage bait.” This marketing approach aims to generate buzz through controversy. However, such tactics risk alienating large portions of the global crypto community.

The Solana Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that promotes the Solana blockchain, has not officially stated why it deleted the ad. Representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment from various news outlets.

The controversy comes as Solana faces other challenges. The network’s native token hit a yearly low on March 10, dropping to $118 as activity on its popular meme coin platform Pump.Fun showed signs of slowing down.

The situation highlights growing tensions within the crypto space about political messaging. Many industry figures argue that such divisive content contradicts crypto’s foundational values of neutrality and global inclusivity.</p>

Elon Musk claims to have found 14 “magic money computers” in federal departments that can “send money out of thin air”

These computers exist in Treasury, Defense, Health and Human Services, and State departments

Musk heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) focused on cutting government spending

Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp responded that “Bitcoin fixes this” issue

DOGE has already canceled 239 “wasteful” contracts worth up to $1.7 billion

Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has claimed to have discovered 14 “magic money computers” across various federal departments. These computers allegedly have the ability to “make money out of thin air” according to statements Musk made during an appearance on Senator Ted Cruz’s podcast “Verdict” on March 17.

The tech billionaire, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead government cost-cutting efforts, explained that these computers can issue payments without proper oversight. They exist in several federal departments including the Treasury, Defense, Health and Human Services, and State.

“You may think that the government computers all talk to each other, they’re synchronized, they add up what funds are going where, and it’s coherent,” Musk told Cruz during the podcast. However, he claimed this isn’t the case in reality.

Musk defined a “magic money computer” as “any computer which can just make money out of thin air.” He added that while these systems aren’t “totally wrong” in reporting government expenditures, they can be off by “5% or 10% in some cases.”

The DOGE team has been conducting a thorough audit of federal government spending. This audit aims to identify and eliminate wasteful expenditure across departments.

In response to Musk’s claims, Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp, chief security officer at Bitcoin custody company Casa, commented that “Bitcoin fixes this.” Cryptocurrency supporters have long argued that Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins serves as a hedge against currency devaluation.

DOGE’s Audit Uncovers More Than Expected

Musk’s investigation has also revealed other concerning findings. He noted that some government departments have more media subscriptions, software subscriptions, and credit cards than employees.

The DOGE head believes that about 80% of these cases stem from waste and incompetence rather than malicious intent. He cited examples where companies continued to receive government payments even after their contracts should have been terminated.

“We saw a lot of payments going out of Treasury that had no payment code and no explanation for the payment,” Musk said. He questioned whether these situations represent waste or fraud.

DOGE announced last week that it had already canceled 239 “wasteful” contracts within government agencies. These contracts were estimated to be worth up to $1.7 billion according to reports.

Among the canceled programs was $699,000 for studying “cannabis use” among “sexual minority gender diverse individuals” and $740,000 for examining “social networks” among specific demographic groups in New Jersey.

Senator Mike Lee of Utah responded to Musk’s revelations with humor on social media. “Can a person buy a magic money computer on eBay? Asking for a friend,” Lee wrote.

Musk described the computers as “maybe the biggest scam of all time” in a post shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. His statement has sparked discussions about government financial accountability.

The tech entrepreneur’s work with DOGE has not come without controversy. According to reports, some of Musk’s other business ventures have suffered due to his government role.

Tesla facilities around the United States have reportedly been vandalized as part of a broader “Take down Tesla” movement. These actions apparently protest DOGE’s cost-cutting measures.

Musk continues to lead the audit efforts despite these challenges. The DOGE initiative represents one of the most sweeping attempts to reduce federal spending in recent years.

The discovery of these “magic money computers” raises questions about financial controls within the federal government. It also highlights potential areas for reform in how government funds are tracked and disbursed.</p>

Burwick Law filed a class-action lawsuit against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora for allegedly orchestrating the deceptive LIBRA memecoin launch

LIBRA initially gained legitimacy through promotion by Argentine President Javier Milei but crashed 94% after insiders allegedly withdrew $107 million

The lawsuit claims developers used “predatory” one-sided liquidity pools to artificially inflate prices while withholding 85% of tokens

Blockchain research firm Nansen found investors suffered combined losses of $251 million while profitable wallets took home $180 million

Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, who reportedly netted $100 million, may face an Interpol red notice

A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the creators of the LIBRA memecoin in the Supreme Court of New York. The lawsuit names Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora as defendants in what has become one of the biggest cryptocurrency scandals of 2025.

Burwick Law filed the suit on March 17 on behalf of investors who lost money in the scheme. The law firm claims the defendants launched the LIBRA token in a “deceptive, manipulative and fundamentally unfair” manner.

The memecoin gained attention when Argentine President Javier Milei promoted it on social media platform X. The token was presented as an economic initiative to boost private-sector funding in Argentina.

According to the lawsuit, the developers used a “predatory” one-sided liquidity pool to artificially inflate LIBRA’s price. This setup allowed insiders to profit while regular investors suffered losses.

Within hours of the launch, insiders allegedly withdrew about $107 million from the liquidity pools. This caused a dramatic 94% crash in LIBRA’s market value.

The lawsuit states that approximately 85% of LIBRA’s tokens were held back at launch. The developers did not disclose this information to investors.

The Anatomy of a $251 Million Memecoin Collapse

Burwick Law claims the defendants took advantage of President Milei’s influence to promote the token. This created a false sense of legitimacy that misled investors about the coin’s economic potential.

The law firm is seeking multiple forms of relief for affected investors. These include compensatory and punitive damages. They also want the return of “unjustly obtained” profits.

Blockchain research firm Nansen examined the aftermath of the LIBRA crash. Their data shows that out of 15,430 large LIBRA wallets, more than 86% sold at a loss. These losses totaled $251 million.

Only 2,101 wallets were able to make a profit. These profitable wallets took home a combined $180 million.

Kelsier Ventures and its CEO, Hayden Davis, were among the biggest winners from the token launch. They reportedly made around $100 million from the scheme.

Davis now faces potential legal trouble beyond the class-action lawsuit. An Argentine lawyer has requested an Interpol red notice for his arrest. Despite the controversy, Davis claimed on February 17 that he didn’t directly own the tokens and wouldn’t sell them.

President Milei has tried to distance himself from the scandal. He argues that he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token but merely “spread the word” about it. This distinction hasn’t satisfied his critics.

The political fallout in Argentina has been severe. The opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment, though these efforts have not gained much traction so far.

The LIBRA token launched on the Solana blockchain on February 14. It quickly reached a market cap of $4.4 billion before crashing. The incident has been dubbed “Cryptogate” by some in the industry.</p>

Bitcoin miners have sold over $27 million in profits recently as BTC trades around $83,400

On-chain data shows miner exchange deposits have been elevated since late 2024

Bitcoin faces key resistance at $87,000, with the 50-day moving average at $87,400

Miner outflows are currently surpassing inflows, indicating reduced holdings rather than accumulation

These selling patterns could introduce short-term volatility and may impact Bitcoin’s ability to break resistance levels

Bitcoin miners have recently cashed in over $27 million in profits as BTC trades in the $83,000-$84,000 range. This large-scale selling comes as Bitcoin faces key resistance levels that could determine its next price move.

Data from CryptoQuant reveals that early Bitcoin miners have realized over $27.2 million in profits recently. This selling activity has increased following Bitcoin’s pullback from highs above $90,000.

On-chain metrics show that miners have been making large deposits to exchanges since the bull rally started in late 2024. The Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow metric has been registering positive values during this period.

The pattern suggests miners initially began selling for profit-taking purposes as prices rose. Even as bullish momentum has cooled and BTC’s price has declined, miner deposits to exchanges have continued.

Glassnode’s miner net position change chart confirms this trend. It shows that outflows are currently exceeding inflows, which means miners are reducing their holdings rather than accumulating more BTC.

Mining operations face constant running costs in the form of electricity bills. These expenses often force miners to sell portions of their Bitcoin holdings on a regular basis.

Typically, this routine selling isn’t large enough to heavily impact Bitcoin’s price. The market can usually absorb these sales without major disruption.

Miner Behavior: Market Impact

However, when miner selling reaches higher levels, as is currently happening, it can potentially introduce short-term volatility. One analyst noted, “If miner selling accelerates, it could introduce short-term volatility into the market.”

Despite the current selling phase, miners still hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin. The rate at which their holdings are declining might signal their outlook on near-term price movements.

Bitcoin was trading around $83,289 at press time. The cryptocurrency faces immediate support at $82,500, with a key resistance level at $87,000.

Technical indicators show the 50-day moving average positioned at $87,400. The 200-day moving average sits near $95,916, representing longer-term resistance.

These levels serve as critical barriers that Bitcoin needs to overcome to regain bullish momentum. A decisive move above $87,000 could trigger renewed upward movement.

Conversely, if Bitcoin breaks below the $82,500 support level, it might open the door to further declines. This could potentially push prices toward the $80,000 mark.

The next days will be crucial in determining if Bitcoin can absorb the miner selling pressure. If miners continue liquidating at the current pace, Bitcoin may struggle to break through key resistance levels.

A shift in miner behavior, such as reduced selling or a return to accumulation, could provide support for Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory. Until then, the market will closely watch how Bitcoin responds to this elevated selling pressure.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $83,400, up almost 6% over the past seven days despite the ongoing miner selling activity.</p>

Pi Network’s price has dropped over 17% amid a major token unlock and community concerns about transparency

The price decline coincided with the March 14 KYC verification deadline, where unverified miners forfeited tokens

Technical indicators show bearish momentum with DMI readings indicating sellers are in control

Pi Coin is currently trading around $1.46, below the crucial $1.50 support level, with risk of falling to $1.20

Despite price troubles, Pi Network continues seeing real-world adoption, particularly in China where businesses are accepting it as payment

Pi Network’s cryptocurrency has experienced a significant price drop, falling more than 17% to $1.16 in recent trading. The decline comes as investors express growing concerns about the project’s direction and transparency.

The price slump coincides with an upcoming major token unlock. This event will increase the supply of Pi Coins in circulation, putting downward pressure on the price. Many traders have responded by selling their holdings.

Technical indicators paint a concerning picture for Pi’s short-term prospects. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows sellers firmly in control of the market. The Average Directional Index (ADX) sits at 18.3, suggesting a weak but present downtrend.

The negative sentiment deepened after the March 14 KYC verification deadline passed. Pi miners who failed to complete the Know Your Customer process forfeited their tokens. This led to a mass burning of unverified tokens.

One social media post highlighted the impact of these forfeitures. It showed miners losing large amounts of Pi, with one user reportedly losing 10,000 tokens. This has shaken confidence in the project.

Pi has dropped to #13 in the CMC ranking as its price falls below $1.3. The price drop is directly correlated with public sentiment. The failure to get listed on Binance, despite 86% of the community voting in favor, raises serious concerns about public trust in the project. This… pic.twitter.com/3488BffUEc — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) March 18, 2025

Pi’s price is currently hovering around $1.46. This places it below the psychologically important $1.50 mark that analysts consider crucial for a potential rally. If Pi fails to recover this level, further decline to $1.20 or lower may follow.

Trust Eroding as Development Stalls

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has dropped to -0.14. This is its lowest level in a week. The negative reading signals strong selling pressure and weak accumulation of the token by investors.

Many community members point to the lack of exchange listings as a key reason for the price drop. Pi failed to secure a listing on Binance despite 86% of its community voting in favor. This rejection has damaged investor confidence.

The Pi Core Team has also faced criticism for not delivering major updates on Pi Day. This was viewed as a crucial event for the community. Many early miners who have supported the project for years have expressed frustration over the lack of visible progress.

A common complaint among investors is the absence of a clear roadmap for the Open Mainnet launch. Unlike other crypto projects that provide transparent timelines, Pi Network has remained vague about future developments. This uncertainty has fueled growing skepticism.

Pi enthusiast Dr Altcoin noted on social media that the cryptocurrency’s ranking has fallen to #13. He emphasized that the declining value reflects the community’s disappointment in the project’s progress. The lack of a roadmap has made investors hesitant, leading to increased selling.

Despite these challenges, the Pi Network is seeing some real-world adoption. Businesses in China, from restaurants to retail stores, are beginning to accept Pi as payment. This growing usage could potentially support long-term value.

The Pi Network community is calling for immediate action from the core team. Investors believe several steps are needed to restore confidence: releasing a clear Open Mainnet roadmap, launching the promised 100 decentralized applications, and disclosing key investors and partnerships.

Market observers note that a listing on a major exchange like Binance could trigger a significant price rally. Some analysts suggest such an announcement could push Pi above $2. However, without confirmation of any listings, market sentiment remains cautious.

If Pi’s price stabilizes above $1.50 and builds momentum, a rally toward $2 becomes possible. However, a breakdown below current support levels could trigger a sharper sell-off, potentially pushing the price under $1 for the first time since February.</p>

Metaplanet issued its 9th series of 0% ordinary bonds worth ¥2 billion ($13.35-13.4 million) to EVO FUND to purchase more Bitcoin

The bonds will be redeemed in full on September 17, 2025, with early redemption options available

Metaplanet recently bought 150-162 BTC, bringing total holdings to 3,050-3,200 BTC (worth $251-265 million)

The company has been gradually acquiring BTC since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Operations in April 2024

Metaplanet is now the 10th-largest BTC-holding public entity according to bitcointreasuries.net

Metaplanet, a Tokyo-based investment firm, has issued its ninth series of 0% ordinary bonds to EVO FUND. The bonds are worth ¥2 billion ($13.35-13.4 million) and will be used to purchase more Bitcoin.

The decision was made at a board of directors meeting and announced in a regulatory filing on March 18, 2025. This marks Metaplanet’s continued push to grow its Bitcoin holdings as one of Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders.

The bonds carry no interest and can be redeemed in full on September 17, 2025. Each bond will be redeemed at ¥100 per ¥100 of face value.

EVO FUND has the option to redeem the bonds early. They can do this by giving Metaplanet written notice at least one business day before the desired redemption date.

Early redemption can be made for all or part of the outstanding bonds. This gives EVO FUND flexibility in managing their investment.

Metaplanet plans to pay for the redemption using proceeds from their 14th to 17th Series of Stock Acquisition Rights. The company expects to exercise these rights before the redemption date.

The bond issuance has been fully allocated to EVO FUND. There is no guarantee or collateral attached to the bonds.

Following the announcement, Metaplanet’s shares dipped by nearly 0.5% to ¥4,030 according to Google Finance. This suggests a mild market reaction to the news.

This isn’t the first time Metaplanet has issued such bonds. On February 27, the company issued ordinary bonds to EVO FUND for the same amount of ¥2 billion (worth $13.6 million at that time).

Metaplanet’s Growing Bitcoin Position

Metaplanet has been steadily building its Bitcoin reserves since April 2024. This was when the company launched its Bitcoin Treasury Operations initiative.

Most recently, Metaplanet purchased 150-162 BTC for about $12.5-13.5 million. Reports vary on the exact amount, but the purchase price averaged around $83,123 per Bitcoin.

This latest purchase brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to between 3,050-3,200 BTC. At current market prices, this is worth approximately $251-265 million.

According to bitcointreasuries.net, Metaplanet is now the 10th-largest public entity holding Bitcoin. This positions the company as a major player in the corporate Bitcoin space.

The company appears to be taking advantage of Bitcoin’s recent price correction. Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,300, which is about 24% below its record high reached in January 2025.

Metaplanet stated in its notice to shareholders that the bond issuance is expected to have minimal impact on the company’s financial results for the fiscal year ending December 2025. This suggests the Bitcoin investment is part of a long-term strategy rather than a short-term financial play.

The investment firm continues to demonstrate confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Their regular bond issuances show a deliberate, structured approach to building their cryptocurrency holdings over time.</p>

PEPE has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern suggesting a potential 40% price upswing

Coin has already bounced 35% from yearly lows, currently trading at $0.000007181

Analysts like Ali Martinez and CryptoELITES predict significant gains with targets of up to 40X

Centralized exchange outflows have increased by 1.21%, indicating investors are moving to self-custody

Technical indicators show bullish patterns including double-bottom formation and falling wedge pattern

The frog-themed meme coin PEPE has been showing signs of a potential bullish breakout according to multiple technical patterns and analyst predictions. After experiencing a 30% monthly decline, PEPE has rebounded strongly with a 22% gain over the past week, currently trading at $0.000007181.

Several prominent crypto analysts have recently highlighted bullish formations on PEPE’s price charts. Ali Martinez identified an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the hourly chart that has been developing since early March. This pattern features a neckline resistance at $0.0000075.

PEPE briefly broke above this resistance level during recent trading, hitting an intraday high of $0.000007582. The inverse head and shoulders pattern is widely recognized as a signal that suggests a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend.

Analyst CryptoELITES claims that PEPE has already confirmed a bottom at $0.0000069834. The current price represents a notable recovery from this level, with the token up 6% in the last 24 hours alone.

Another analyst known as World of Charts has added to the market optimism. They also identified the inverse head and shoulders pattern and predicted a possible 50-60% rally following a successful breakout from resistance levels near $0.000007.

The daily chart shows PEPE has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.00005920. This pattern consists of two down peaks and a neckline at $0.00002827, which is considered one of the strongest bullish reversal formations in technical analysis.

Technical Analysis

Technical indicators are aligning with these bullish patterns. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) have formed a bullish divergence. This occurs when an asset’s price is falling while oscillators are rising.

PEPE has also formed a falling wedge pattern on the charts. This setup, defined by two descending and converging trendlines, typically suggests that the coin could experience a bullish breakout in the coming days.

Data from Nansen shows increasing exchange outflows, with tokens held on exchanges dropping to 240.15 trillion, down 1.21% from last week. These outflows are generally seen as a positive sign since they suggest investors are holding rather than selling.

Market interest in PEPE appears to be growing. Coinglass data shows the crypto’s futures open interest rose by over 8% to $237.90 million recently. Additionally, derivatives volume increased by nearly 16% to $627.05 million.

The initial price target for PEPE is the psychological level at $0.000010. Some analysts believe a break above that could push the coin toward $0.00001457, its lowest swing on December 20.

However, traders should note that a drop below the year-to-date low of $0.0000053 would invalidate the bullish outlook. This level serves as a key support that bulls need to defend to maintain the positive momentum.

The renewed interest in PEPE comes amid a general recovery sentiment in the crypto market. This optimism is brewing right ahead of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which often impacts market direction.

PEPE’s market capitalization currently stands at $2.9 billion, reflecting its 35% recovery from yearly lows. If the technical patterns play out as analysts predict, this figure could rise substantially in the coming weeks.

The current price action and technical setup suggest PEPE may be preparing for its next leg up in the ongoing crypto market cycle. Traders and investors will be closely watching key resistance levels to confirm the breakout thesis.</p>

Microsoft identified a new remote access trojan (StilachiRAT) that targets 20 cryptocurrency wallet extensions in Google Chrome

The malware can steal browser credentials, wallet information, and clipboard data while using evasion techniques to avoid detection

StilachiRAT creates a unique device ID, monitors RDP sessions, and establishes communication with command-and-control servers

The malware can execute 10 different commands including system shutdown, log clearing, and application launching

Despite not being widespread currently, Microsoft released the information to help users protect themselves from this emerging threat

Microsoft has discovered a new type of malware specifically designed to steal cryptocurrency. The tech company’s Incident Response Team first found the remote access trojan (RAT) in November 2024.

The malware, named StilachiRAT, targets cryptocurrency wallets through Google Chrome browser extensions. Microsoft shared their findings in a March 17 blog post.

StilachiRAT can steal sensitive information stored in browsers. This includes saved login credentials, digital wallet details, and data copied to the clipboard.

The malware works by looking for 20 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions. These include popular wallets like Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and OKX Wallet.

Once installed, StilachiRAT scans your device settings. It checks if any of the targeted wallet extensions are present on your system.

The trojan uses several methods to steal information. It can extract credentials saved in Chrome’s local state file.

It also monitors clipboard activity. This allows it to capture sensitive information like passwords and crypto keys as users copy them.

Microsoft explained that StilachiRAT has features to avoid detection. These include the ability to clear event logs.

The malware can also check if it’s running in a test environment. This helps it block attempts to analyze how it works.

Currently, Microsoft cannot identify who created the malware. They haven’t linked it to any specific threat actor or location.

The company stated that StilachiRAT doesn’t appear to be widespread right now. However, they decided to share their findings to help protect users.

“Due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings,” Microsoft wrote. This is part of their effort to monitor and report on evolving threats.

Inside StilachiRAT: Theft Tactics Revealed

StilachiRAT gathers extensive system information. This includes operating system details, hardware identifiers, and camera presence.

The malware creates a unique identification on infected devices. This ID is derived from the system’s serial number and attackers’ public RSA key.

StilachiRAT connects to remote command-and-control servers. It uses TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, selected randomly for communication.

The malware checks for the presence of monitoring tools. It won’t proceed if it detects certain security software running.

StilachiRAT delays its initial connection by two hours. This is likely an attempt to avoid detection during security scans.

The malware can be launched both as a Windows service or a standalone component. It has mechanisms to ensure it isn’t removed from the system.

A watchdog thread monitors both the EXE and dynamic link library files. If these files are deleted, they can be recreated from an internal copy.

StilachiRAT can execute various commands received from the control servers. These include system reboots, log clearing, credential theft, and executing applications.

The malware can also suspend the system, modify Windows registry values, and monitor open windows. This shows a versatile command set for both spying and system control.

Microsoft recommends several protection measures. Users should have antivirus software and cloud-based anti-phishing components on their devices.

The company advises downloading software only from official websites or trusted sources. This helps avoid RATs that masquerade as legitimate software.

Microsoft encourages users to use browsers that support SmartScreen. This feature can identify and block malicious websites, including phishing sites.

For organizations using Office 365, Microsoft recommends enabling Safe Links and Safe Attachments. These features provide additional protection against malicious content.

The rise of StilachiRAT comes amid increasing cryptocurrency-related crime. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, losses to crypto scams and hacks totaled nearly $1.53 billion in February alone.

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reported $51 billion in illicit transaction volume in their 2025 Crypto Crime Report. They noted that crypto crime has entered a more professional era.

The report highlighted AI-driven scams, stablecoin laundering, and efficient cyber criminal organizations. These tactics show how crypto theft methods continue to evolve.

Microsoft continues to monitor information about how StilachiRAT spreads. They note that malware like this can be installed through multiple vectors.

The company emphasizes that security hardening measures are critical. These help prevent initial compromise and reduce the potential impact of such threats.</p>

Ethereum (ETH) is showing price patterns similar to 2017 and 2020 bull runs, suggesting a potential trend reversal

ETH has fallen below $2,000 since March 11, with technical indicators like Stochastic RSI showing oversold conditions

Multiple analysts point to historical fractals and a 5-year trendline support suggesting an imminent rebound

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Bulls and Bears metrics indicate rising buying pressure

The upcoming Pectra upgrade and potential Wall Street expansion could serve as catalysts for ETH recovery

Ethereum (ETH) has struggled throughout 2025, with its market cap dropping more than 40% year-to-date as of March 18. The second-largest cryptocurrency has been trading below the $2,000 mark since March 11, a price level it hasn’t fallen below since December 2023.

Several crypto analysts have identified patterns suggesting ETH may be preparing for a turnaround. Analyst Mister Crypto highlighted similarities between Ethereum’s current price action and the pattern that followed the March 2020 COVID market crash.

That period saw ETH experience a sharp trend reversal to the upside after hitting bottom. The cryptocurrency went on to reach new all-time highs above $4,800 in the subsequent bull market.

Another analyst, Merlijn The Trader, noted that ETH appears to be repeating its historical cycle. This typically involves a capitulation phase before a massive run-up in price.

Merlijn pointed to the Luna crash of 2022 as another instance when bearish sentiment surrounding ETH peaked. Following that event, the digital asset quickly overcame market pessimism and experienced a 270% rally.

Technical Analysis

Technical indicators are also suggesting a potential rebound. Analyst TraderPA observed that Ethereum is currently oversold at its present price, with the weekly Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaling a possible trend reversal.

Ethereum is oversold. The weekly Stoch RSI is indicating that a bounce is likely to come soon. I'm accumulating. pic.twitter.com/wD92xaHSZO — TraderPA (@Trader1PA) March 17, 2025

The Stochastic RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the relative position of an asset’s current price within its recent price range. When the fast line crosses above the slow line in the oversold zone, it typically signals upward momentum.

On-chain metrics support this outlook. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of liquidity in and out of a cryptocurrency, shows rising buying pressure for ETH.

The daily chart indicates that the CMF reading has stayed above the zero signal line. This suggests that ETH’s price is unlikely to drop toward the $1,500 level, as some have predicted.

From an on-chain perspective, the Bulls and Bears indicator also supports a possible price increase. This metric tracks the activity of addresses buying and selling at least 1% of the total trading volume.

Currently, Ethereum bulls have outnumbered bears, indicating increasing buying pressure. If this trend continues, ETH might avoid another correction.

A five-year trendline further supports the bullish case. Ethereum’s price action over the past five years has consistently respected an ascending support line, which it is currently retesting.

This multi-year support level previously marked major cycle bottoms, including the March 2020 crash and the post-FTX collapse in 2022. Each time ETH has touched this long-term trendline, it has bounced back strongly.

Looking at shorter timeframes, ETH is currently confined within a descending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. The price has remained above the horizontal support line, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has turned positive.

For ETH to regain momentum, it must stay above $1,861 and retest the $2,227 level. If buying pressure increases, the price could potentially reach $2,520.

Several upcoming catalysts could fuel a recovery. The anticipated Pectra upgrade and Ethereum’s potential Wall Street expansion may drive renewed interest in the asset.

At press time, ETH trades at $1,911, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.</p>

Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has directed staff to consider withdrawing a proposed crypto custody rule from 2023

The rule would require investment advisers to custody client crypto with qualified custodians

Industry commenters expressed “significant concern” over the proposal’s broad scope

This marks the second recent instance of the SEC reconsidering Trump-era crypto regulations

The move signals a continuing shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto under the Trump administration

Acting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mark Uyeda has asked his staff to consider withdrawing a proposed rule that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisers. This move represents another step in the agency’s changing approach to cryptocurrency regulation under the Trump administration.

The rule in question was introduced in February 2023 during Gary Gensler’s tenure as SEC chair. It aimed to expand custody rules for investment advisers to include all client assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Under the proposal, investment advisers would be required to custody their clients’ crypto with a qualified custodian. These qualified custodians typically include federal or state-chartered banks and broker-dealers.

Gensler had stated that investment advisers “cannot rely on” crypto platforms as qualified custodians due to their operational methods. This stance caused friction within the industry and among some SEC commissioners.

In his speech at an investment industry conference in San Diego on March 17, Uyeda acknowledged the pushback. He noted that commenters had expressed “concern” over the “broad scope” of the proposal.

“Given such concern, there may be challenges to proceeding with the original proposal,” Uyeda said during his remarks. “I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal.”

Industry Reaction and Regulatory Shift

When the rule was first proposed, it faced criticism from both within and outside the SEC. Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom” for her pro-industry stance, was the only commissioner to vote against the rule.

Peirce argued that the proposed rule “would expand the reach of the custody requirements to crypto assets while likely shrinking the ranks of qualified crypto custodians.” This concern was echoed by industry advocacy groups.

Even Uyeda himself had reservations at the time. He questioned how advisers could comply with the rule while still investing client funds in crypto assets.

The banking industry also voiced concerns. A coalition of bank and financial industry associations, including the American Bankers Association, warned that the proposal “could have a material impact on their business.”

This marks the second time this month that Uyeda has directed SEC staff to reconsider rules proposed under the previous administration. Just days earlier, on March 10, he asked for options on “abandoning” parts of a proposal that would push some crypto firms to register as exchanges.

These actions reflect a broader shift in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation under the Trump administration. The agency has moved away from Gensler’s strict stance, which held that most cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin were securities.

In recent weeks, the SEC has rapidly changed course on several key crypto policies. It has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance known as SAB 121, which required firms holding crypto assets to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets.

The agency has also dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players, including Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase. These cases had created legal battles and uncertainty for the industry over the past few years.

Another key initiative under the Trump administration is the formation of a dedicated crypto task force led by Commissioner Peirce. The task force is designed to work closely with the crypto industry to develop more practical regulations.

The task force is scheduled to hold its first roundtable, titled “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” this Friday. This event may provide further insights into the SEC’s evolving approach to crypto regulation.

President Donald Trump has nominated former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to replace Uyeda as the permanent chair of the agency. A Senate hearing for Atkins is reportedly scheduled for March 27.

The potential withdrawal of the crypto custody rule would be welcome news for investment advisers and the broader crypto industry. Many had worried that the rule would limit the number of banks willing to do business with the sector.

Congressional Republicans had joined crypto firms and traditional finance companies in pushing back against the rule when it was first proposed. They argued that the requirements were too strict and would hamper innovation in the sector.

Uyeda’s speech on Monday focused primarily on the SEC’s rulemaking process. He discussed potentially withdrawing or re-proposing rules, as well as delaying compliance dates for certain regulations.

This approach contrasts sharply with the regulatory direction under Gensler, whose tenure was marked by strict crypto oversight. Gensler’s resignation before Trump took office marked a turning point in the SEC’s regulatory direction.

As the SEC continues to revise its approach to crypto regulation, industry participants are watching closely to see which other Gensler-era policies might be reconsidered or reversed.</p>

Canary Capital filed for a Sui ETF with the SEC on March 17, 2025, marking the firm’s sixth crypto ETF filing

Sui is a layer-1 blockchain with a $7.4 billion market cap, currently ranked among the top 25 cryptocurrencies

The filing comes amid optimism about crypto regulation under the Trump administration

Sui recently partnered with World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform backed by President Trump

The SEC is unlikely to approve new crypto ETFs until Paul Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chair

Canary Capital Group has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch what would be the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the Sui cryptocurrency. The March 17 filing adds to a growing list of crypto ETF applications in the post-election regulatory environment.

Sui is the native token of the Sui Network, a layer-1 blockchain service provider. It currently has a market value of approximately $7.4 billion. This places it within the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

This marks Canary Capital’s sixth cryptocurrency ETF filing with the SEC. The firm has previously filed for ETFs tracking Solana, Litecoin, XRP, Hedera, and Axelar. Each filing represents a bet on the changing regulatory landscape for digital assets.

The application comes during a period of increased optimism in the crypto sector. The election of President Donald Trump has sparked hope for a more favorable regulatory environment. Trump has promised to relax regulatory enforcement against cryptocurrency businesses.

Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg expressed his positive outlook on the changing situation. “There’s been a tremendous shift in the landscape and mood among cryptocurrency market participants since the election,” McClurg told Reuters. “I’m pretty optimistic that we’re on track to see many of these approved before the end of 2025.”

New Era for Crypto ETFs

McClurg also highlighted the growing importance of the Sui blockchain to The Block. “We have seen a massive move of developers into the SUI ecosystem,” he said. “Given the speed and efficiency of the SUI chain, we believe it will be a destination for many future projects.”

Sui itself has been making headlines in recent weeks. On March 6, the blockchain announced a partnership with World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project linked to President Trump. The partnership includes adding Sui to World Liberty’s “Macro Strategy” token reserve.

The Sui token has shown mixed price performance in recent months. While it is trading up 1.3% over the last day at approximately $2.31, it has fallen 56.5% from its January 5 all-time high of $5.35, according to data from CoinGecko.

Sui is a relatively new blockchain created by Mysten Labs, a company founded by former Meta employees. Despite being less than two years old, it has quickly gained traction in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Sui investment products already exist in other forms. Grayscale Investments launched the Grayscale Sui Trust in August 2024. This is a private investment vehicle offering Sui exposure to accredited investors only.

The proposed Canary Sui ETF would differ by trading on a public stock exchange. This would make it accessible to any investor, not just those meeting accreditation requirements. Canary had previously registered a trust in Delaware on March 6 for the fund.

To gain approval, Canary must also file a Form 19b-4 with the SEC before the agency can consider whether to list it for trading. The filing does not yet include information on which exchange the ETF would trade on or its proposed ticker symbol.

Industry observers note that the SEC is unlikely to approve new ETFs until Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee for SEC chair, is confirmed. A Senate confirmation hearing for Atkins is reportedly scheduled for March 27, having been delayed due to issues with financial disclosures.

The crypto industry has already seen some regulatory relief under the new administration. Regulators have dropped enforcement actions against several large cryptocurrency companies and are considering scrapping rules proposed by the previous administration.

Since the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, issuers have filed for regulatory approval to list ETFs on at least 10 additional cryptocurrencies. The most popular new coins among issuers are Solana and XRP, each with six ETF applications pending with the SEC.</p>

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicts 6-12 months of bearish or sideways Bitcoin price action

Declining market liquidity and stalled capital inflows signal an end to the bull cycle

Key valuation metrics like MVRV Ratio Z-score show bearish signals with potential return to $63K

Bitcoin is down 15% in the last month, erasing post-election gains

Analysts remain divided with some still predicting new all-time highs by mid-2025

The Bitcoin bull market has come to an end according to Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of crypto research firm CryptoQuant. On March 17, 2025, Ju posted on X that investors should expect “6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action” as the recent bull run loses momentum.

#Bitcoin bull cycle is over, expecting 6–12 months of bearish or sideways price action. pic.twitter.com/f80bnNhjy4 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 17, 2025

Ju pointed to declining liquidity as the main reason for his bearish outlook. “New liquidity is needed. The on-chain realized cap has stalled, signaling no fresh capital inflows,” he explained in a Telegram note to CoinDesk.

This marks a shift in Ju’s position from earlier this month. On March 4, he had stated that the Bitcoin bull cycle would remain slow but “is still intact,” citing neutral readings on key indicators.

#Bitcoin market will likely remain slow until sentiment in the U.S. improves. There’s no significant on-chain activity, and key indicators are neutral, suggesting the bull cycle is still intact.

A recent CryptoQuant report suggests Bitcoin could return to the $63,000 level. The report highlights bearish signals from key valuation metrics like the MVRV Ratio Z-score, which compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value.

When the MVRV Z-score drops below its 365-day moving average, it typically signals that Bitcoin’s price momentum has weakened. This pattern has lined up with deeper corrections or the start of bear markets in the past.

CryptoQuant analysts noted that the $75,000-$78,000 support level is critical. They pointed to weakening Bitcoin demand, shown by slowing whale accumulation and net selling by U.S.-based spot ETFs.

These factors are adding downward pressure on the price. They increase the risk of a deeper price correction in the coming months.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has seen three straight weeks of outflows. This trend supports the notion that institutional interest may be cooling off after the initial excitement.

Ju observed that “even with record volume near $100K, Bitcoin’s price barely moved.” He added that “without new liquidity to offset heavy selling, this is a bearish signal.”

Bitcoin is currently down 15% over the past month according to CoinDesk Indices data. This decline has erased any gains made following the U.S. presidential election.

Polymarket bettors are giving a 51% chance that Bitcoin ends the week between the $81,000-$87,000 range. They also see a 31% chance it drops to $75,000 by the end of the month.

Some market watchers express concern that economic uncertainty and global tensions could make the bearish pressure worse. LMAX Group’s Joel Kruger and Coinbase Institutional’s David Duong have warned about these factors to CoinDesk.

Not all analysts share this bearish outlook. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that “there is no reason to panic.”

Hundal explained that while investors are “spooked” by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, “all the numbers show a global economy that is pointing in the right direction.”

Some analysts remain optimistic based on macro factors. Crypto analyst Seth pointed out that global M2 money supply has reached new highs, which could trigger another Bitcoin rally.

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

In Aug 2024 I signalled the next leg up after Global Money Supply trending up making new ATH. I'm saying Global Money supply just made another new ATH. We are about to see #Bitcoin rally again. This time is not different. Not financial advice.

Always DYOR! https://t.co/uTM0KZaTju pic.twitter.com/a07babxVzZ — Seth (@seth_fin) March 17, 2025

CoinRoutes CEO Dave Weisberger believes Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs by late April if historical trends hold. “Expect Bitcoin to hit a new ATH within a month if its BETA correlation to money supply holds,” Weisberger said on X.

Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten recently stated there’s “more than a 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year.” Bitcoin’s current all-time high of $109,000 was reached on January 20, 2025.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at around $83,030, according to market data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DMND (“Demand Pool”), the world’s first Stratum V2 Bitcoin mining pool, has officially opened applications for miners to join as launch partners, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Successful applicants will receive 0% fees for the first two months and a special two-year founding miner agreement.

In addition to the launch announcement, DMND also confirmed the successful closing of its venture capital financing in Q4 2024, led by Trammell Venture Partners (TVP).

“The Bitcoin mining industry has a key problem which I’ve pinpointed over my 10-year career: mining pool centralization,” said Alejandro de la Torre, DMND co-founder and CEO. “This is why it is paramount that we make Stratum V2 a reality. SV2 will help decentralize Bitcoin mining by allowing miners to build their own blocks. With the release of DMND pool—the world’s first Stratum V2 pool—we help combat this problem – a historic moment in Bitcoin.”

Stratum V2 represents a major evolution in Bitcoin mining, offering enhanced decentralization, privacy, and security by enabling miners to construct their own block templates. Unlike traditional mining pools, where pool operators dictate transaction selection, Stratum V2 shifts control back to miners.

DMND’s pool implements end-to-end encryption to prevent hashrate hijacking, ensuring greater security for mining operations. Additionally, its SLICE payment system introduces auditable transactions and no hidden fees, guaranteeing maximum miner payouts in a fair and transparent manner.

The mining industry has long struggled with opaque fee structures and centralized block construction. DMND’s implementation of Stratum V2 and the SLICE payment system aims to address these issues, ensuring fairer payouts and greater control for miners while reinforcing Bitcoin’s decentralization.

“The mining pool industry is one where murky fee payouts and relative centralization have become the norm,” said Christopher Calicott, TVP’s managing director and founding partner. “By empowering mining operators to securely and privately design their own block templates while facilitating radical transparency and fairness of payments to mining pool participants, DMND will bring a new era to the mining industry. Mining operators of any size—from small home miners to publicly traded giants—will all work to enhance Bitcoin’s decentralization.”

Mining operators interested in contributing to the first-ever Stratum V2 block can apply via DMND’s official website. Applications for launch participants will close on March 28, 2025, at midnight PST.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last Tuesday, Congressman Nick Begich (R-AK) introduced The BITCOIN Act of 2025 to the U.S. House of Representatives. He made the announcement that he’d be doing so at the Bitcoin For America summit.

The bill, a revised version of a bill that Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced to the Senate last year, stipulates that the United States government acquire 1 million bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and protects the right of U.S. citizens to self custody their bitcoin.

As Rep. Begich spoke about the importance of the bill at the summit, I got the impression that he was acting as more than just an opportunist, a politician simply striking while Bitcoin is a hot topic in the U.S. government, but as someone who actually has a deep understanding of Bitcoin.

Turns out, I was right. The Congressman has held his own bitcoin in self custody for over 12 years now and very much understands the importance of U.S. citizens being legally permitted to do the same. Furthermore, he believes that in an age of “undisciplined bureaucracy” and reckless spending, it’s important for the U.S. government to hold bitcoin, as it will serve as a backstop to our financial system.

On a personal level, when did you first begin to see the value in Bitcoin?

In late 2012. I was reading an article on Slashdot.org regarding Bitcoin and the forthcoming halvening, and it piqued my interest. I started digging in a little further and decided that I wanted to learn more about how this digital asset worked. So, I wired the $100 over to Mt. Gox, and I bought seven bitcoin. Afterward, I transferred them over to a private wallet. I wanted to understand how Bitcoin worked, because I owned a software development company and spent 20 years in technology as a career before coming to Congress. This was just interesting to me.

So, you were just fulfilling your curiosity?

Yes, but also, a couple of days later, I called my business partners and told them that I thought bitcoin could become something really big. They had never heard of it. I said “I’m going to take $5,000, and I’m going to buy bitcoin.” I took that money from our software business and bought more bitcoin on Mt. Gox. We ended up with 440 bitcoin. So, when the exchange went under, of course it was a huge disaster, because all of that bitcoin was still on the exchange. A number of us who were creditors found each other and we put a group together to hire an attorney in Japan. We were one of the creditors that petitioned the courts successfully. Japan changed the bankruptcy type from a liquidation to a civil rehabilitation, which allowed creditors to receive a portion of their bitcoin back.

Did you get some of it back then?

Ultimately, I sold our company’s claim to Fortress. But I still hold my own original seven bitcoin.

What was your impetus in introducing The BITCOIN Act to the House last week?

For years, I’ve thought that the United States government should have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reason I believe it’s important is because when you look at the universe of available reserve assets, the lion’s share of them can be printed at will by a centralized authority. As a corollary to gold, bitcoin reminds us that there is value in scarcity, and scarce assets are the sorts of assets that belong in a reserve because they’re the defense against an undisciplined bureaucracy. What we’ve seen not just in the last several years but in the last several decades, is a federal government that will print dollars to solve problems. And, in doing so, it’s created bigger problems. That’s why holding the gold that we’ve held all these years is so important, and that’s why holding bitcoin going forward will also be important. Both provide us with a financial backstop of a scarce resource that can’t be created by an executive action or Congressional action, which imposes discipline on the financial system. Congress has not demonstrated a sustained ability to impose financial discipline and keep the government in its Constitutional lane. As a result, ultimately the math will not add up. The United States cannot sustain a 125% debt-to-GDP ratio. The United States will be unable to continue to deficit spend at the levels that we have over the last several decades. Our gold reserves and a future bitcoin reserve provide the United States and its people with a fallback mechanism should the debt-based fiat system collapse.

In your mind, what is the likelihood that The BITCOIN Act becomes law?

The likelihood is growing, and the reason I believe that is because a) there are more people in Congress today who understand what Bitcoin is than ever before, b) there are more people in Congress today who understand just how precarious our current debt and deficit is, and c) there’s a growing awareness among the public that holding a scarce asset in addition to gold is a wise diversification of our national strategic reserve. For those three reasons, the time is right. Seeing the number of cosponsors that have already come in from the Senate and the House is encouraging. And I will tell you that there’s significant interest among others in Congress who haven’t yet decided to cosponsor in learning more about the legislation and how it can be a backstop for the United States.

The bill states that the government should acquire 1 million bitcoin — 5% of the supply — over the next five years, which was also the math in the initial version of the bill. Why five years and why 1 million bitcoin?

If you look at the total amount of gold held in reserve by central banks relative to the total supply of gold, it’s estimated to be about 5% to 15%. So, as a reserve asset, that 5% to 15% zone for a global centralized bank aggregated total makes sense. The reason why five years makes sense is because what you don’t want to do is introduce a demand shock to the system that causes short- to mid-term volatility. It’s also important to remember the United States government is not a day trader. It recognizes that it needs to be methodical, thoughtful, and predictable in the way in which it acquires that asset. That’s why I think a five-year period versus say a one-year or 18-month period is more appropriate.

The bill also stipulates that the U.S. establish a proof of reserves system. Will this look something like El Salvador’s proof of reserves system, one in which the government’s Bitcoin address is made public?

100%. Yes. One of the challenges that we’ve had with Fort Knox is that there’s no way for the public to audit the reserves, and so you’ll often hear people say that they don’t believe we have the gold we say we do or perhaps we even have more than we say we do. There’s no way for a citizen of the United States to know with confidence that the United States has the gold that it says it has. Bitcoin provides us with mechanisms for continuous proof of reserves so that every citizen of the United States can know for a fact that we have the bitcoin we say we have.

What do you imagine to be the design of the United States’ cold storage setup?

The bill outlines that those regulations and technical practices will be developed in consultation with industry experts, which I think is appropriate. However, based on my own experience with Bitcoin, I believe it’s very important that a) we’re talking about cold storage, and b) that we’re talking about thousands of separate cold storage wallets. It’s also important that the keys for those wallets be held in different physical locations, and that we use the Shamir backup system, which is a mechanism where, as long as you have two of the three pieces of a key, you can reassemble the key. What you don’t want is to have a complete key in one physical location, because, if it’s compromised, someone would be able to access that wallet. You want a diversified key strategy so that you would need to reassemble the keys from multiple physical locations for each individual wallet. That is the most secure deep cold storage solution that I’m aware of.

The bill also protects U.S. citizens’ right to self custody their bitcoin. In your mind, why is self custody so important?

It’s important because if you look back at what the United States government did with gold in the early 20th century with Executive Order 6102, they nationalized the asset. You were not permitted to own gold outside of jewelry. They essentially confiscated the wealth of the people. We do not want to see a repeat of that ever in the United States, whether it’s with gold or anything else. I think continuing to assure the public in law that we have a fundamental right to self custody our own wealth is an important restatement of our Constitutional rights.

Are you familiar with the Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash cases, which are cases in which developers may be put on trial for creating and maintaining Bitcoin and crypto mixers?

I’m not familiar with them. I know what mixers are, but I don’t know about Samourai Wallet. Mixers have been around for a long time.

Yes, they have. What are your thoughts on them?

Well, I think the question is: “Where do you draw the line on the base layer and subsequent layers?” If you think about Bitcoin versus other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has unique characteristics as a store of value. Whereas other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have multiple layers in which logic for transaction restriction can be applied. In my view, you don’t wanna have transaction restrictions baked into the base layer of a store of value cryptocurrency like Bitcoin because it allows centralized control from an authority, which fundamentally defeats the fungibility aspect of it.

Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share?

I’m excited for this legislation. I think it’s important for the nation. And I look forward to the Bitcoin community being an advocate with their members of Congress and their senators. I’m one person. Senator Lummis is one person. We have cosponsors. That’s fantastic. But we need the Bitcoin community to continue to educate and inform the rest of Congress so that we can move this legislation to President Trump’s desk where he can sign it into law.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new lending product from Xapo Bank allows qualifying members to access USD loans using their bitcoin holdings as collateral. This enables bitcoin holders to tap into the fiat value of their assets without having to sell.

Xapo Bank, a licensed bank focused on bitcoin services, launched bitcoin-backed lending this week. Eligible members can now take out loans up to $1,000,000 secured against their bitcoin.

Once approved, the loan funds are instantly deposited into the member’s bank account. The corresponding bitcoin is held in secure storage by Xapo until repayment. This allows members to retain their bitcoin long-term while borrowing against their current value.

Members can select flexible repayment terms from 30 days up to 1 year. There are no early repayment fees or penalties, giving borrowers control over minimizing costs.

According to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, the product addresses the need for responsible bitcoin and crypto lending solutions. Many bitcoin holders have previously faced loss of assets from high-risk lending platforms.

Xapo states its bitcoin-backed loans have more conservative loan-to-value ratios from 20% to 40% to protect member assets. Automated controls around repayment and loan health monitoring further reduce risks compared to other crypto lending products.

The launch comes as bitcoin holders increasingly look to access the value of their holdings without asset sales. Selling bitcoin to cover short-term financing needs can result in lost future upside.

However, experts urge caution when leveraging bitcoin holdings, as price declines could trigger collateral liquidations if loans become undercollateralized. Thorough due diligence on lender practices and risks is advised.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hey, there! We hope your week is off to a great start. When it's time for a break today, there's a fresh round of Wordle waiting for you. In case you need a helping hand with it, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Tuesday's puzzle (#1,368).

It may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that too.

What is Wordle?

Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. The gist is that there is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.

Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.

The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.

How to play Wordle

To start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard.

You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.

Wordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.

How to play Wordle more than once a day

If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.

In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing $3,025 per ounce to mark an increase of over 15% in since the turn of the year. Meanwhile, bitcoin is lagging (BTC), down 10% year-to-date.

Several factors have contributed to gold’s rally, including significant inflows into gold ETFs and its traditional role as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical uncertainty.

Additionally, discussions of new tariffs in the U.S. under President Trump have further fueled demand for U.S. equities. Gold’s historic rally has driven its price up 40% year-over-year, far outpacing Bitcoin's 16% gain.

Historically, when gold enters a bull market, bitcoin often stagnates or declines. The two assets rarely move in tandem, though there are occasional periods when both rise or fall simultaneously.

During the significant rallies in both gold and bitcoin from early 2019 through 2020, gold led the charge initially. Bitcoin followed suit in Q4 2020, surging into its own bull run while gold took a backseat.

By 2022, as global interest rates began to rise, both assets faced pressure before rebounding in 2023 and 2024. Now, in 2025, the market is witnessing a renewed divergence between the two.

ByteTree founder Charlie Morris has described this gold rally as a "proper gold rush"—something the market hasn’t seen since 2011.

"Gold above $3,000, silver above $24, and gold stocks gaining momentum—it struck me that the crypto crowd has never witnessed a true gold rush. The last time this happened was in 2011, when Bitcoin was just emerging at $20. They will now."</p>

The company, which has over 40,000 users, aims to simplify blockchain adoption by enabling firms to integrate wallets, tokenization, and payments with minimal code, according to a statement on Tuesday. Crossmint users, including big brands Adidas and Red Bull, use the platform to transition their operations on-chain.

Crossmint is also building a framework for artificial intelligence-driven commerce, providing wallets and payment APIs for AI agents.

"AI agents are reshaping commerce. Soon, they will autonomously manage tasks like grocery shopping or personal styling," said Alfonso Gomez-Jordana, co-founder of Crossmint. "Traditional payment systems weren’t designed for AI agents—but blockchain is."

Ribbit Capital led the investment round with additional participation from Franklin Templeton, Nyca, First Round, and Lightspeed Faction, Crossmint announced on Tuesday.

Multicoin Capital's Kyle Samani — a major investor in SOL and countless subordinate protocols — has been publicly pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look favorably upon a SOL ETF. His bullish pronouncements therefore might come as little surprise.

But onstage Tuesday at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York City, Samani explained his view why Solana is better placed to appeal to traditional investors than Ethereum did. It's all about the money: the fees being generated on-chain, compared to the value of the asset's totality.

"A lot of the reason why the ETH ETF didn't have a super strong reception was a lot of investors looked at ETH and said 'show me the fees,' Samani said.

By his telling, they didn't find much proof to justify investing at its high prices.

Stock traders often look at a company's price to earnings ratio in deciding whether it's over or undervalued; in other words, when to invest. Crypto doesn't have such a clean metric, but blockchains still have revenue and tokens that can be mushed together for similar effect.

Samani believes Solana's theoretical P/E ratio is much healthier from an investing standpoint than Ethereum's. His onstage math placed Solana as trading at 30 to 50 times its P/E whereas Ethereum is trading closer to 1,000 times.

Solana's P/E ratio is "much more in line with high-growth tech stocks," Samani said.

If the logic plays out then traditional investors might be expected to believe Solana has more upside than Ethereum, and invest accordingly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, one of the earliest traditional financial investors in crypto, hopes to bring some of her company’s funds on-chain once the regulatory landscape allows companies in the U.S. to do so.

“We think tokenization is going to be huge,” Wood said at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Tuesday. “We’d love to be able to tokenize our Venture Fund (ARKVX) or our [Digital Asset] Revolution Fund.”

“I think the regulations are starting to open up in a way that will allow us to do that. So we'd like to seize the moment,” she added.

U.S. regulators have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, making it difficult for entities like Ark to launch products in the booming space that some believe could become a multi-trillion-dollar market by the end of 2030.

Executives of Coinbase, a big holding of Ark, had previously mentioned a similar outlook, although it was vague as companies are trying to make their mark in the tokenization industry.

At the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference earlier this month, Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said that the crypto exchange is in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a security token, a move that previously failed when Coinbase attempted to go public with such a product in 2020.

Jesse Pollack, the founder of Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 network built by Coinbase, later said in a post on X that there were no “concrete plans” to tokenize Coinbase’s stock.

“We are in an exploratory phase and working to understand what needs to be unlocked from a regulatory perspective to bring assets like $COIN to @base in a safe, compliant, future looking way,” he wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you blinked you may have missed it: Solana's SOL futures started trading on Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the go-to marketplace for U.S. institutions, and unlike previous, historic CME debuts for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), it received little fanfare.

The product booked $12.3 million in notional daily volume on day one and closed with $7.8 million in open interest, well falling short of similar debuts of BTC and ETH products, according to K33 Research data. For context, BTC futures launched in December 2017 with $102.7 million first-day volume and $20.9 million in open interest, while ETH futures debuted in February 2021 with $31 million in volume and $20 million in open interest, per K33.

Already under pressure by the implosion of speculative memecoin activity, bearish crypto action and even a botched commercial, SOL tumbled roughly 10% from its weekend high, underperforming bitcoin's (BTC) and ether's (ETH) 4.5% and 3.8% declines, respectively.

While SOL's debut may seem lackluster in absolute terms, it is more in balance with BTC's and ETH's first-day figures when adjusted to market value, K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman noted. Solana's market capitalization stood at around $65 billion on Monday, a fraction of ETH's $200 billion and BTC's $318 billion at CME launch.

Solana's CME launch also had unfavorable timing, as market conditions play a crucial role in futures activity, K33 added.

Bitcoin’s CME futures arrived at the peak of the 2017 bull market as speculative fervor was pushing to the extremes, and ETH's debut coincided with the early stages of the 2021 altcoin rally and Tesla’s BTC purchase announcement, fueling institutional participation. In contrast, SOL futures started trading as crypto markets turned bearish, without any hype or major catalyst driving immediate demand for the product, according to the K33."It would appear that institutional demand for altcoins may be shallow, although we note that SOL’s launch has come in a comparatively risk-off environment," K33 analysts said.

Derivatives trader Josh Lim, founder of Arbelos Markets that was recently acquired by prime broker FalconX, said that the CME product opens up new ways for institutions to manage their exposure to Solana, regardless of the first-day demand. FalconX executed the first SOL futures block trade on CME on Monday with financial services firm StoneX.

"There's enthusiasm for this new CME product launch," Lim said in a Telegram message. Liquid funds will be able to manage around their SOL holdings, including those that bought locked tokens in the FTX liquidation process, he said. Additionally, exchange-traded fund issuers with plans to introduce SOL products could start with CME futures-based ETFs.

"People are missing the big picture on the new CME products," Lim said. "It's going to change the access that hedge funds have into altcoins."</p>

Ju posted on X that he is expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action as the BTC bull run loses steam, citing declining liquidity in the market.

"New liquidity is needed. The on-chain realized cap has stalled, signaling no fresh capital inflows. For example, BlackRock’s IBIT saw three straight weeks of outflows," he said in a Telegram note to CoinDesk. "Even with record volume near $100K, Bitcoin’s price barely moved. Without new liquidity to offset heavy selling, this is a bearish signal."

(CryptoQuant)

A recent report from CryptoQuant made the case for the possibility of BTC's return to the $63K mark, citing bearish signals from key valuation metrics like the MVRV Ratio Z-score, which compares bitcoin’s market value (MV) to its realized value (RV) to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

The MVRV Z-score dropping below its 365-day moving average signals that BTC's price momentum has weakened, historically aligning with deeper corrections or the onset of bear markets.

The $75K-$78K support level is critical, CryptoQuant analysts noted, as weakening BTC demand, marked by slowing whale accumulation and net selling by U.S.-based spot ETFs, continues to add downward pressure, increasing the risk of a deeper price correction.

This echoes what LMAX Group's Joel Kruger and Coinbase Institutional's David Duong recently told CoinDesk, with both warning that sustained weakness in U.S. equities amid economic uncertainty and global tensions could exacerbate bearish pressure on crypto markets, with stagflation also a possibility.

Polymarket bettors are giving a 51% chance that BTC ends the week between the $81-$87K range, and a 31% chance it hits $75K by the end of the month.

In the last month, bitcoin is down 15%, according to CoinDesk Indices data, with its decline erasing any post-election gains.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The calm that has returned to the bitcoin (BTC) market may be short-lived, potentially setting the stage for a storm that could trigger significant price volatility, according to insights from the decentralized crypto on-chain options platform Derive.

Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve.

With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive.

"BTC’s weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today," Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk.

It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin.

“Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%)," Forster added.

Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction.

According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including "a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration."

Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date.

Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well.

The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher.

Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock.

"Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don’t point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut," BlackRock said in a weekly note.

The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto industry is expected to join the financial mainstream in the U.S. as the regulatory environment improves, and Coinbase (COIN) is well positioned to benefit from these tailwinds, broker Bernstein said in a report Monday.

Bernstein initiated coverage of the crypto exchange with an outperform rating and a $310 price target. About 41% of Wall Street analysts have a buy rating on the stock, 7% sell and the rest hold, according to FactSet data. The shares dropped 2% to $185.20 in early trading.

Regulatory clarity will result in more competition for Coinbase from fintech companies, brokers and banks, the report said.

Still, a "strong bull market and rising U.S. onshore dominance" is expected to more than offset market share and pricing pressures, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

An improving regulatory backdrop under Donald Trump's new administration is viewed as a huge tailwind for digital assets, and the President has promised to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world."

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formed a new crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce to draft new regulations for the industry.

Coinbase has done well to diversify beyond trading, the report said, and the exchange now has a strong presence in U.S. dollar stablecoins and crypto yield services, such as staking.

Bernstein said it expects Coinbase to grow non-trading revenues by around a 31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2024-2026.

This provides a "strong balance to cyclicality of trading revenues," the report added.

Coinbase recently secured FIU registration, paving the way for a return to the Indian market, the company said in a blog post earlier this month.

BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize and backed by U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, is set to receive $500 million allocation. Superstate's USTB will get a $300 million. Centrifuge's JTRSY, a T-bill fund in partnership with asset managers Anemoy and Janus Henderson, set to receive $200 million.

The selection process saw 39 applicants evaluated by advisory firm Steakhouse Financial, a key player in Spark’s ecosystem specializing in RWAs. Winners were chosen based on criteria including liquidity and capital efficiency. The final allocations will be market-driven and capped at $1 billion, Spark said in a press release.

Pending governance approval, the selected tokenized assets could be used as collateral for Sky’s native stablecoin USDS and its yield-bearing counterpart, sUSDS.

The protocol's move is part of a larger trend of blockchain-based protocols integrating tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, or real-world assets, like bonds, funds and credit. In 2024, Sky announced plans to invest $1 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasury bills, attracting interest from a wide range of issuers.

The allocation will also lend a significant boost for the already fast-growing tokenized U.S. Treasuries market, which currently stands at $4.6 billion, according to rwa.xyz data.

That, however, happened after weeks of the community leaning against the switch whilst a few CRO whales — or influential users who hold large amounts of a token — stepped up in the last few hours of the vote’s closure to nudge it into favor.

(Cronos Governance)

Cronos, tied to crypto exchange Crypto.com, earlier in the month proposed reissuing 70 billion CRO tokens it burned in 2021, aiming to restore its original 100 billion token supply for a "Strategic Reserve.”

The supposed $5 billion plan (at current $0.08 CRO prices) sought to boost U.S. crypto dominance, fund ecosystem growth and launch a CRO ETF. Community backlash was strong when the vote first went live, with 86% opposing it in the first few days.

But crypto governance is notorious for being community-governed in name only; with large token holders able to dominate any proposals and changes at their will — even though the vote would be, in theory, executed transparently by the “community.”

The proposal, live from March 2-16 and through its voting period, was nowhere near the 33.4% quorum needed to pass. Then, at 14:00 UTC on Monday, a 3.35 billion CRO vote dump flipped the script, hitting quorum and sealing the deal. Final count: 61.18% yes, 17.61% no, 20.11% abstain and 0.11% veto.

Two influencer network validators, Starship and Falcon Heavy, backed the plan as of March 10, dwarfed by 77.97% against it and 8.47% abstaining at the time. On Monday, Electron, Antares, and Minotaur IV piled in — using a cumulative 3.2 billion CRO in voting power to vote for the proposal.

Cronos network had an upgrade lined up in the hours after the vote drew to a close and was finished on March 18 at 03:00 UTC, setting course for a more than 200% increase in supply in the coming years.

Traders have responded in kind, with CRO down 8.5% in the past 24 hours amid a flat market.</p>

Bitcoin (BTC) traded around its 200-day average of $84,000 as the notorious Hyperliquid whale exited its multimillion dollar short BTC position. Smaller coins like CAKE, TKX, OKB and ATOM contributed to market optimism with positive performances.

The SUI token struggled to extend Monday's 6% surge, which was spurred by asset managers' ETF filings with the SEC, showcasing growing institutional interest in the wider crypto market.

While some analysts declared the end of the bitcoin bull run, casting doubt about the sustainability of the recent bounce, data indicated otherwise, pointing to exhaustion in the ETF-led selling pressure.

On Monday, U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $275 million in investor funds, building on Friday's $41 million influx. That's the first back-to-back inflows since Feb. 7, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.

"This data reinforces the narrative that ETF-driven selling pressure is exhausting," said Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN. "If this trend continues, we could see inflows gradually build momentum, further supporting bitcoin’s price."

The Fed's rate decision on Wednesday could introduce volatility into the crypto market with a dovish statement possibly spurring increased risk-taking.

"Post-FOMC, bitcoin is expected to trade within the range of $80,000 to $86,000 with 80% confidence, while ethereum is projected to fluctuate between $1,800 and $2,100 under the same confidence level," according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. "These ranges reflect potential movements tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions."

In traditional markets, European stocks edged higher before a German parliamentary vote on historic debt reforms. Gold remained firm above $3,000 per ounce, with BlackRock calling the yellow metal a better diversifier than Treasury notes in the ongoing macro environment.

Meanwhile, futures tied to the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow traded unchanged to negative amid reports that the Trump-Putin call regarding the Ukraine peace deal would take place between 13:00 and 15:00 GMT. Stay alert!

Token Talk

By Shaurya Malwa

Hackers attacked BNB Chain's Four.meme launch platform, exploiting new meme tokens to drain liquidity by bypassing listing restrictions and creating unauthorized trading pairs on PancakeSwap, siphoning off funds around 04:00 GMT.

The attack preempted Four.meme’s curated token launches, buying small token amounts pre-launch, adding liquidity to PancakeSwap pairs, and rug-pulling them, targeting popular tokens like MubaraKing (87.90 BNB stolen) and others such as EDDY and Cocoro.

Four.meme suspended new token launches and promised compensation for affected users, though no smart contract vulnerability was found. Leaked early transactions enabled the hacker’s front-running, according to analyst Chaofan Shou.

The attack exploited a flawed token function allowing transfers during the bonding curve stage, a recurring flow cell manipulation issue, potentially affecting all Four.meme tokens despite only a few being hit due to their popularity.

Derivatives Positioning

Open interest in ETH, LTC, XRP and SOL perpetual futures increased in the past 24 hours alongside a flat-to-negative cumulative volume delta (CVD), indicating net selling in the market.

SOL, ADA and DOGE have also seen negative funding rates.

Both open interest and basis in BTC and ETH CME futures remain depressed at recent lows, suggesting a lack of confidence among institutions to deploy capital.

Robert Valdes-Rodriguez, Keyrock's chief commercial officer, will lead the development of the New York business, the company said.

Valdes-Rodriguez has more than 25 years of experience in senior management roles at traditional finance institutions, including ABN AMRO, Scotiabank and Credit Agricole.

Improving regulatory clarity in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's new administration is expected to lead to a boom in digital assets.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formed a new crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce to draft new regulations for the industry.

"The U.S., as the largest capital market in the world, is a natural fit for our ambitions to eventually become one of the largest players in global financial markets," said Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, in the release.

Keyrock was founded in Brussels in 2017 and has existing entities in Belgium, the U.K., Switzerland and France.

The crypto market maker provides liquidity to over 85 centralized and decentralized trading venues globally. The firm has 170 employees and operates across 37 countries.</p>

Bit more than an hour before the close of the trading session, Nasdaq fell 1.7% and S&P 500, 1.1%.

The Federal Market Committee open today its two-day policy meeting, with the results and the post-reunion press conference of President Jerome Powell scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, US time.

Although One is expecting a change in interest rates, traders will be aware of signs that the Fed is perhaps becoming a little more moderate due to the recent market turbulence and the slowdown in inflation.

Market action on Tuesday, however, suggests nervousness that the Fed may not be ready to further relieve politics. After all, the fall in inflation seen in February T was so great and was just a report. And the fall in markets - though painful for many - was also very modest, given the impressive high in recent years.

According to Fedwatch, fee operators today do not see the chance that the Fed cut rates tomorrow and only 20% chance of the Central Bank loosening at the next meeting in May. For June, however, there is a 66% chance of the Fed cutting fees.</p>

Microsoft’s Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post.

According to the team, the malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet.

While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software.

“Due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape,” the team wrote.

"We have seen a lot more interest. We are working on several applications now," Alexandra Steinberg Barrage, a partner at law firm Troutman Pepper Locke, told Reuters. However, firms are being “cautiously optimistic” as regulatory agency leadership changes unfold.

Becoming a bank brings stricter regulatory oversight, but it can reduce borrowing costs and enhance legitimacy. Bank charters allow firms to lower their cost of capital by accepting deposits, yet accessing these is a major point of contention in the crypto community.

Various cryptocurrency firms have, over time, resisted becoming banks over the regulatory oversight associated with the move, choosing instead to follow the industry’s ethos to further decentralize and improve access to financial services to unbanked or underbanked individuals.

Cryptocurrency firms, including Paxos, Anchorage, and Protego have become federally regulated crypto ‘banks’ after securing a federal trust charter through the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Kraken and Avanti have secured Special Purpose Depository Institution charts in Wyoming, making them state-regulated crypto banks.

Historically, new bank charters have been rare. Between 2010 and 2023, regulators approved an average of only five annually, compared to 144 per year from 2000 to 2007, according to S&P Global.

Applications dwindled due to low interest rates, profitability concerns, and regulatory hurdles. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Federal Reserve officials have signaled support for streamlining the process. However, setting up a new bank remains expensive, with costs ranging from $20 million to $50 million, according to the report.

PERPERTUAL STRIFE (STRF) privileged shares offer a fixed 10% annual monetary dividend paid quarterly, according to SEC, if the dividends are not paid, they are compound additional 1% per year (quarterly) up to 18%. The first dividend payment is scheduled for June 30, 2025.

The initial privileged series Strategy (Strk) initially offered only an 8% interest rate. A series of proposals of convertible debt from Strategy came with insignificant or even zero interest rates (of course, a different product than desired).

Unlike ordinary shares, Strf owners have no voice, but have a priority when eliminating $ 100 per share. Strategy has the right to redeem Strf if less than 25% of the original shares remain or if there are tax measures and the owners may require redemption in the event of fundamental changes.

Strf is expected to bargain on NASDAQ within 30 days after release, offering investors access to Bitcoin with a high yield structure. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup and Moelis & Company are joint managers in securities, which are carried out in accordance with SEC registration.

After the Bitcoin has been bought at a rapid pace over the last few months, the raising of funds and purchasing tokens in Strategy has slowed over the last weeks. Last week, the company made additional Bitcoin purchases, but they were unlikely to be unnoticeable - only 130 BTC for $ 10.7 million to bring total stocks up to 499 226 tokens.

Mstr decreased by 5% at the beginning of the action on Tuesday along with the fall of the markets as a whole and the fall of bitcoin up to $ 81,300 from $ 84,000 a day ago.</p>

Токену Sui було важко продовжити стрибок на 6% у понеділок, який був спричинений менеджерами активів Заявки ETF з SEC, що демонструє зростаючий інституційний інтерес до ширшого ринку Крипто .

Хоча деякі аналітики оголосив про кінець зростання Bitcoin, викликаючи сумніви щодо стійкості нещодавнього відскоку, дані свідчать про інше, вказуючи на виснаження тиску продажів, очолюваного ETF.

У понеділок американські спотові Bitcoin ETF залучили 275 мільйонів доларів інвесторських коштів, збільшивши приплив 41 мільйона доларів у п’ятницю. Згідно з даними Farside Investors, це перший послідовний приплив з 7 лютого.

«Ці дані підкріплюють наратив про те, що тиск на продаж через ETF виснажливий», — сказав Валентин Фурньє, аналітик BRN. «Якщо ця тенденція збережеться, ми можемо спостерігати, як приплив поступово нарощує імпульс, що ще більше підтримує ціну біткойна».

Рішення Федерального резервного резерву щодо ставок у середу може внести нестабільність на ринок Крипто , оскільки така невтішна заява може сприяти підвищенню ризику.

«Після FOMC очікується, що Bitcoin буде торгуватися в діапазоні від 80 000 до 86 000 доларів США з 80% впевненістю, тоді як Ethereum , за прогнозами, коливатиметься від 1 800 до 2 100 доларів за того ж рівня впевненості», – сказав Райан Лі, головний аналітик Bitget Research. «Ці діапазони відображають потенційні зміни, пов’язані з макроекономічними сигналами, настроями інвесторів і ширшими фінансовими умовами».

Хакери атакували платформу BNB Chain для запуску Four.meme, використовуючи нові токени мемів для вичерпання ліквідності, обходячи обмеження лістингу та створюючи неавторизовані торгові пари на PancakeSwap, виводячи кошти близько 04:00 GMT.

Атака попередила запуск кураторських токенів Four.meme, скуповуючи невеликі суми токенів перед запуском, додаючи ліквідність парам PancakeSwap і перетягуючи їх, націлюючись на такі популярні токени, як MubaraKing (викрадено 87,90 BNB ) та інші, такі як EDDY і Cocoro.

Four.meme призупинив запуск нових токенів і пообіцяв компенсацію постраждалим користувачам, хоча вразливості смарт-контракту не виявлено. За словами аналітика Чаофана Шоу, витік ранніх транзакцій дозволив хакеру стати лідером.

Атака використовувала помилкову функцію маркера, яка дозволяла передачу на етапі кривої зв’язування, повторювану проблему маніпуляцій із коміркою FLOW , що потенційно вплинуло на всі маркери Four.meme, незважаючи на те, що лише деякі з них були вражені через їхню популярність.

The exchange submitted a 19b-4 filing to the SEC, asking for permission to list the ETF if it is approved by the regulator.

The proposed fund would track the spot price of DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network. The filing follows an amended S-1 form submitted by 21Shares earlier this year, marking another step in the firm’s push to bring more crypto investment products to the market.

21Shares is also seeking regulatory approval for funds linked to XRP and solana's SOL. The company recently announced it’s set to liquidate two actively managed crypto ETFs amid the market downturn.

Grayscale Investments, a crypto asset-management company, has also filed with the SEC to launch a Polkadot ETF, signaling broader interest in the asset.</p>

The company, which has over 40,000 users, aims to simplify blockchain adoption by enabling firms to integrate wallets, tokenization, and payments with minimal code, according to a statement on Tuesday. Crossmint users, including big brands Adidas and Red Bull, use the platform to transition their operations on-chain.

Crossmint is also building a framework for artificial intelligence-driven commerce, providing wallets and payment APIs for AI agents.

"AI agents are reshaping commerce. Soon, they will autonomously manage tasks like grocery shopping or personal styling," said Alfonso Gomez-Jordana, co-founder of Crossmint. "Traditional payment systems weren’t designed for AI agents—but blockchain is."

Ribbit Capital led the investment round with additional participation from Franklin Templeton, Nyca, First Round, and Lightspeed Faction, Crossmint announced on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (MSTR) Tuesday morning unveiled its latest twist at raising funds from capital markets to fund additional bitcoin (BTC) purchases, but there are indications the Wall Street spigot is slowing.

The company's Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) offers a fixed 10% annual cash dividend, paid quarterly, according to an SEC filing If dividends are unpaid, they compound at an additional 1% per year (quarterly), up to a maximum of 18%. The first dividend payment is scheduled for June 30, 2025.

Strategy's initial preferred series (STRK) initially offered only an 8% interest rate. And Strategy's series of convertible debt offerings came with negligible or even 0% interest rates (different product than preferred, of course).

Unlike common stock, STRF holders do not have voting rights but have priority in liquidation with a $100 per share liquidation preference. Strategy has the right to redeem STRF if fewer than 25% of the original shares remain or if tax events occur, while holders can demand a buyback in case of a fundamental change.

STRF is expected to trade on Nasdaq within 30 days of issuance, offering investors bitcoin exposure with a high-yield structure. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup, and Moelis & Company are joint book-running managers for the offering, conducted under an SEC shelf registration.

After buying bitcoin at a galloping pace over the past several months, Strategy's fundraising and token acquisitions have slowed to a crawl in recent weeks. The company last week did make additional bitcoin purchases, but they were hardly needle-moving — just 130 BTC for $10.7 million to bring total holdings to 499,226 tokens.

MSTR is lower by 5% in early action Tuesday alongside a slide in markets in general and bitcoin's dip to $81,300 from $84,000 a day ago.</p>

Bitcoin was trading at $81,300 at press time, lower by 3.5% over the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL), ether (ETH) and XRP were posting modestly higher losses.

A bit more than an hour before the close of trade, the Nasdaq was down 1.7% and S&P 500 1.1%.

The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day policy meeting today, with results and Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference set for Wednesday afternoon U.S. hours.

While no one is expecting a change in interest rates, traders will be looking for signs that the Fed is perhaps turning a hair more dovish given recent market turbulence and a slowdown in inflation.

The market action on Tuesday, however, suggests nervousness the Fed may not yet be ready to ease policy further. After all, the downturn in inflation seen in February wasn't that large and it was just one report. And the dip in markets — though painful for many — has also been pretty modest given the impressive run higher in recent years.

According to CME FedWatch, rate traders today see no chance the Fed cuts rates tomorrow and only a 20% chance the central bank eases at its next meeting in May. For June, though, there's a 66% chance that the Fed will cut rates.</p>
