<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310530/xrp-allocations-more-common-than-solana'>XRP Allocations More Common Than Solana Among Institutions: Coinbase, EY</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 20:30:36 <p>
Institutional investors surveyed by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon were more likely to own XRP than Solana in January, according to a report published by the firms on Tuesday. Tuesday’s report noted that a majority of institutional investors held just one or two cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, which U.S. investors can easily get exposure to through exchange-traded funds launched last year. While a number of asset managers have filed applications for XRP and Solana ETFs, and analysts think they have a solid chance of receiving approval, most investors have few opportunities to gain exposure to the altcoins using a traditional brokerage account. When it comes to registered vehicles that hold crypto as an underlying asset, most institutions said they prefer products resembling ETFs. Although around one and three institutional investors had allocated to XRP or Solana, 29% preferred holding assets in a digital wallet instead. Despite this preference, Coinbase and EY-Parthenon’s survey found that an investor’s location had little impact on which altcoins they had allocated to. Still, 68% of respondents said they would likely invest in new crypto exchange-traded products that track a single asset. Since then, Solana has relinquished the entirety of its post-election gains, while XRP still changes hands at several times the value that it did on Election Day last year. Analysts say that Trump’s crypto-friend stance means more for XRP than Solana because the asset’s associated business model faced existential threats from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, namely the agency’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs over XRP sales. The Commission has adopted a collaborative approach to crypto firms under Trump’s watch, but 53% of respondents highlighted crypto’s “uncertain” regulatory backdrop as a concern. The SEC has created a Crypto Task Force to establish clearer rules, but lawmakers are also weighing a crypto markets structure bill on Capitol Hill.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission. Ford's Escape SUV slots in below the Explorer, offering a lower cost of entry, smaller overall dimensions, and a focus on fuel efficiency that the larger Ford SUVs don't prioritize as much. Larger 18-inch wheels replace the standard 17-inch units, and you get a pair of black-painted roof rails. That powertrain commands a further $2,495 premium, but offers commensurately better fuel economy of 39 vs. 30 combined mpg for the standard SUV. The 2025 Ford Escape ST-Line, whether in hybrid guise or relying fully on gas power, faces a lineup of supremely confident competitors. Its higher base price is offset by better out-of-the-box performance and a significantly higher cargo capacity of 75 cubic feet vs the Escape's 65 cubic feet. However, Edmunds ranks the Escape higher overall and consumer sentiment seems to mirror that appraisal. Furthermore, the base CR-V offers fewer speakers, smaller 17-inch wheels, and an optional 9-inch infotainment screen that is dwarfed by the ST-Line's offers a 13.2-inch screen. Another solid competitor is the Mazda CX-5 2.5 S Select, which doesn't offer a hybrid powertrain but does offer some stuff that costs extra on the Escape ST-Line. Despite the Mazda's higher MSRP of $31,520, it lacks cargo space comparatively, making do with just 58 cubic feet. Based on competitive analysis, we think the Ford Escape ST-Line is well-rounded but perhaps lacks focus. That said, the Escape ST-Line undercuts both on price and maintains advantages in some areas. Most importantly, it builds value with options its rivals can't match, like the $995 fancy touchscreen.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Heroes of Mavia, a blockchain-based mobile strategy game that launched in early 2024, has seen the price of its token surge over the last week ahead of teased upgrades and expansion plans from creator Skrice Studios. The MAVIA token on Ethereum has spiked by 430% over the last week, according to data from CoinGecko, reaching a current price of $0.61. It's the largest gainer by far in CoinGecko's Gaming (GameFi) category during that span. MAVIA peaked at a price of $10.59 just a couple weeks after it launched, then lost significant value over the following months, dipping to an all-time low under a penny just last week. Even after the latest spike, MAVIA remains down 94% from its peak. What's driving the surge isn't obvious, as Skrice hasn't made substantial moves around the Clash of Clans-like mobile game since the price started to take off on Sunday. In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), the official game account noted plans to create a "GameLink" hub to bring together crypto games across various platforms and blockchain ecosystems, along with various game enhancements and plans to launch "six flagship games"—including an "optimized and balanced" version of Heroes of Mavia.

The track was last week given its official name and, drumroll please, it is called the Madring. Well, it merges Madrid, and ring, and doesn’t really require much more explanation. But organizers gave us one anyway. “Formula 1 circuits are typically referred to by the city or region where they are located—Monza, Imola, Interlagos, Spa, Silverstone, Miami, Las Vegas,” read the official release. “However, their full official names are rarely used. "For this reason, Madring aims to establish a concise and memorable identity that directly references its host city, is instantly recognizable worldwide, and requires no translation. Ultimately, it is more than just a name—it is a genuine, distinctive, and iconic brand, designed to resonate with a modern and engaged F1 audience.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Perhaps that’s why some purists have a strong aversion to continuation models like this, especially when they come with a modern LS engine. But we like this sports car and think it would be a fun toy to own. Superformance has permission from GM to make these continuation cars, which can be driven on public roads. Some people think continuation cars are inferior garbage or something that shouldn’t exist. Others find them to be great ways of having fun. Under the vented hood of this Grand Sport is a 408ci LS2 V8 built by V’s Performance. As you can see, it has velocity stacks via Borla. With upgraded internals, it’s tuned to make just under 500-whp. We’re fans of well-done continuation cars like this one from Superformance. It pays tribute to the original Grand Sports yet pushes modern performance and reliability, which in our minds is the best of both worlds.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/synthetic-oil-lifespan-long-does-192500291.html'>Synthetic Oil Lifespan: How Long Does It Really Last?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 19:25:00 <p>
Synthetic motor oils have been around for a while now, longer than most gearheads realize. The first synthetic hydrocarbon oils were created by French chemist Charles Friedel and his American associate James Mason Crafts in 1877. Thirty-six years later, in 1913, a German scientist named Friedrich Bergius figured out a process for creating synthetic oil from coal dust. Standard Oil tried to commercialize synthetic oil in 1929, but it didn't stick due to lack of demand and, well, we had that Depression going on at the time. Synthetics got a huge boost during WWII as the Nazi war machine started using it due to sanctions and dwindling domestic oil supplies. Not the best pedigree, you'll agree, but the Wehrmacht trying to figure out how to keep tanks and trucks running without oil gave synthetic technology a huge boost. Today, many cars are shipped from the factory with synthetic oil, and thousands of gallons of digital ink has been spilled on blogs and forums outlining the pros and cons of using it. One of the most contentious arguments about synthetic motor oil — aside from whether or not a true blue gearhead should use it at all — is how long it lasts and how often you should change it. Read more: These New Cars Just Aren't Worth The Money Thanks to all the detergents, additives, and other concoctions in them, these oils might be good for anywhere from 7,500 miles to 15,000 miles. Brands put those numbers on the bottle assuming that you'll be driving sedately in light traffic or on the highway. Driving your car without getting it all the way up to operating temperature also usually counts as adverse conditions, and a lot of short hops with long stretches of inactivity between them can break even the best oil down pretty quickly. These days those reccos can run anywhere from 5,000 to 7,500 miles between oil changes, which seems like madness to those of use raised with the old "every 3,000 miles" rule. The fact is that modern motor oil, whether it's synthetic or good old fashioned dinosaur squeezins, is leaps and bounds better than it was in the '80s or '90s.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A tried and true classic with some appealing alternatives Inside, a 13.2-inch LCD infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard. The Explorer’s performance will certainly meet all of your expectations. While the Ford Explorer remains a solid entry in the class, you might want to look at these competitors instead. Power is adequate for the class, with a standard 285-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 and a 10-speed automatic transmission powering the front wheels, although all-wheel drive is optional. It can also carry an additional 165 pounds of cargo on its roof. There are three spacious rows, anywhere from 18 to 86 cubic feet of cargo space, and a roof that can carry 220 pounds of items. A 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard. Better yet, the Palisade can be filled with indulgent features, like a head-up display, dual sunroofs, heated steering wheel, Wi-Fi hotspot, rear heated seats, and quilted Nappa leather seating. The Palisade’s relaxed demeanor and tranquil manner are complemented by its precise steering, modest body roll, and plenty of powertrain punch. It is powered by a 293-horsepower 3.6-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic with rear—or four-wheel drive. This is the SUV to have if you’re a serious off-roader, with 10.9 inches of ground clearance and 24 inches of water-fording ability. Its on-road demeanor reflects its off-road agility, returning a quiet ride and capable handling for such a big boy. An 8.4—or 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard, while tonier models have a 19-speaker McIntosh audio system, a 10.3-inch passenger screen, and dual 10.1-inch rear screens. More so than the Hyundai Palisade, its corporate cousin, the Kia Telluride, belies its price, particularly on pricier models. No wonder it’s the current cul-de-sac sweetheart. Like its cousin, the Telluride has a potent 291-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6, an 8-speed automatic transmission, and standard front-wheel drive. The cargo capacity ranges from 21 to 87 cubic feet, a roof rack is rated at 165 pounds, and its towing capacity is rated at 5,000 pounds. There’s also a 323-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder plug-in hybrid with 26 miles of pure electric range. An 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive come standard. While it is athletic, there’s no hiding its size and weight. Thankfully, the nicely weighted steering and well-controlled body motions make it rewarding to drive. It’s a true class act – except for its infotainment. This is the SUV in the gray flannel suit, a bit of family hauler orthodoxy that isn’t exciting but performs with a comprehensive competence that renders it the ultimate automotive butler: seen, but not heard. Being four inches longer, 2.3 inches wider, and 2 inches taller than the Highlander, there are three voluminous rows and 21 cubic feet of cargo space, expanding to a minivan-like 97.5 cubic feet if you need it. If you’re in the market for a three-row, family-hauling SUV, there are plenty of choices.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A meticulously restored 1982 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Indy Pace Car is turning heads, bringing back the spirit of the 66th Indianapolis 500 with its signature Silver Metallic finish and blue decals. This collector’s gem, complete with removable glass T-tops, is a tribute to Chevrolet’s storied involvement in the iconic race. The car is equipped with power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, and a Flowmaster exhaust, ensuring both drivability and classic muscle car appeal. Rolling on original Z28 wheels wrapped in Cooper Cobra white-letter radials, the car stays true to its period-correct look. Though it has undergone a repaint in its factory-correct Silver Metallic, the restoration maintains the car’s original aesthetic, with the interior also refreshed to match its stock blue and silver bucket seat design.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/could-rams-power-wagon-finally-184600372.html'>Could Ram's Power Wagon Finally Get a Diesel Option? It's Possible</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 18:46:00 <p>
Ram offers a Cummins diesel 6.7-liter straight-six on its other HD trucks, and recently more customers have asked for a diesel Power Wagon. A Ram powertrain engineer told Car and Driver that, while it's not happening for the 2025 model year, an oil-burning version of the HD off-roader is possible. Its sole engine option is a gas-powered 6.4-liter V-8, which is naturally aspirated, so it avoids the intercooler that's employed on its turbo-diesel siblings. However, it's possible the brand's beefiest HD off-roader could finally get a diesel option. In fact, we learned that recently a lot more customers have been asking for it—and their voices are being heard. Despite the possibility of a future diesel Power Wagon, Ram's engineer didn't provide a potential timeline, other than confirming it's not happening for the 2025 model year. Ram's HD lineup just got a thorough refresh, and we've now driven the updated version of its Cummins turbo-diesel, a 6.7-liter straight-six that makes up to 430 horsepower and 1075 pound-feet of torque. The Ram engineer said he believes that application is well suited for off-road duty, even if some customers still want the Power Wagon to get a Cummins option. "It's like, for some reason, people want 1000 pound-feet of torque to put in the sand," he said. But at least the people who have dreamed of a diesel-powered Power Wagon know that it's being considered. If customer demand keeps rising, perhaps Ram will finally give its HD off-roader the diesel treatment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Matt Walsh is a far-right agitator, self-described fascist, and virulent transphobe, so it's only natural that the United States' most aggrieved and insecure icons of state-sanctioned violence are big fans of his. In fact, some cops love Walsh so much that they're apparently happy to watch his videos while driving, paying such rapt attention to his blithering inanity that they forget they're in control of a motor vehicle and mow down a roadside cyclist. At least, that's what one Vermont cop allegedly did, according to court documents. Kyle Kapitanski, a sergeant in Shelburne, Vermont, had a Matt Walsh debate video playing in his cruiser when he hit and killed cyclist Sean Hayes, according to the Burlington Free Press. The officer is being charged with "grossly negligent operation" of his cruiser, according to NBC 5, and has already plead not guilty. Read more: Apparently It's Illegal To Put A 'For Sale' Sign In Your Truck Now You'd think a driver in such a vehicle — an officer theoretically dedicated to protect and serve, no less — would maybe want to keep an eye on where they're going, rather than watching a man who wants trans people "erased from the earth" for being "abusers" with "proclivities towards sin." Apparently not, though, given that Kapitanski clearly thought this 58-second portrait-oriented clip was more important than Hayes' life. It's obvious that police think of civilians as some sort of lesser species, existing only to be exterminated at the slightest provocation, but rarely do we see it spelled out so clearly. Kapitanski was so enraptured by the speech of a man whose media presence is entirely built on bloodlust that he killed a man in an instant, and is now working with attorneys to argue that such a situation doesn't even qualify as gross negligence.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

PepeX emerges as a fairer investment alternative with its upcoming presale and AI-powered meme coin launchpad. Investors are shifting their focus to the upcoming PepeX presale amid Ethereum uncertainty. The broader market remains jittery, plagued by macroeconomic uncertainty, trade war fears, and erratic US policy decisions under President Trump. Billed as the world’s first AI-powered meme coin launchpad, PepeX promises a fairer alternative, drawing in degens and retail investors alike with its innovative approach and upcoming presale set to kick off on March 24, 2025. Ethereum’s current struggles are palpable as it trades in a tight range between $1,800 and $1,900, unable to reclaim the psychologically significant $2,000 level. However, the bears are unrelenting, and a failure to defend this trendline could see ETH slide toward lower demand zones around $1,600-$1,700. For now, ETH remains at a crossroads, with its fate hinging on how it reacts to this multi-year support over the coming days and weeks. Unlike Pump.fun, which has been criticized for favouring insiders and leaving only 0.4% of traders with gains exceeding $10k, PepeX aims to level the playing field. Its AI-driven launchpad allows anyone to create a token in minutes—upload an image, pick a ticker, and let the AI handle the rest, from generating viral memes to deploying anti-snipe smart contracts. With a $500 entry fee for creators, PepeX weeds out low-effort projects, ensuring a higher quality of meme coins while still keeping the process accessible to the masses. Founders are capped at a 5% token allocation, with their liquidity locked and redistributed to the community if a project flops—a stark contrast to the exit liquidity schemes that have plagued other platforms. Additionally, the AI-powered marketing bots further amplify its appeal, autonomously shilling tokens on Telegram and X to supercharge growth. With Pump.fun raking in nearly $400M in fees last year, PepeX positions itself as the next big wave, offering token holders a chance to ride a rising tide of value as more projects join the ecosystem. For degens and retail crypto investors, PepeX offers a tantalizing blend of innovation, accountability, and opportunity, making it a compelling alternative as Ethereum (ETH) battles to find its footing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After a suspect in a red Dodge Challenger Hellcat flees from police in the area of Albuquerque, New Mexico multiple times, including once going over 130 mph, cops set a trap. Despite meticulous planning and the use of advanced technologies, everything goes to hell in a handbasket as the suspect makes full use of the high-powered American muscle car. Watch police in California chase a fleeing Dodge Demon. He had been charged with murder in 2014 but wasn’t convicted, but did plead guilty to other charges from the same violent incident. Officers set up spike strips nearby, determined to even the playing field since they can’t possibly keep up with the supercharged Hemi monster. An officer on foot, with no patrol car in sight, is able to successfully spike the Dodge as the suspect appears to not even notice. However, as officers in Ford F-150s approach and turn on their lights, the suspect floors it. However, his rapidly deflating tires don’t give him the traction to deal with a curb he runs over, hanging up the Hellcat as police in their trucks come in for the kill. Thanks to some non-lethal tools, authorities are able to finally get the driver and his female passenger to comply with orders to get out of the muscle car, although the guy tries his luck at sprinting away and gets about fifty feet.

The product of months-long design and development will be one display with two cars in the TA2 field—the Toyota Camrys driven by Toyota Development Driver Tyler Gonzalez in No. 10 Mobil 1 Camry for Nitro Motorsports, while Thomas Annunziata will drive the No. 90 Camry with the GR livery for Nitro Motorsports. “We are thrilled to be able to officially unveil the Toyota Camry body for the TA2 Series,” said Jack Irving, general manager, TRD USA in a press statement. “This body is the result of the diligent effort of so many people at TRD, Trans Am and Five Star. For us at TRD, we continue to see the value of the TA2 Series as our development drivers are able to get quality reps on iconic road courses across the country. First-year Trans Am President Andy Lally says the Trans Am Series is excited that new Toyota is going to be part of the Trans Am Series show. “The Trans Am Series prides itself as a proving ground for the future stars of stock car racing, and we’ve been fortunate to see many Toyota Development Drivers find success in Trans Am.

Police in Kansas City, Missouri are investigating a possible arson attack at a local Tesla dealership after two Cybertrucks caught fire just before midnight on March 17. Officials say an officer saw one of the trucks on fire, and it spread to a second Cybertruck before firefighters could put it out. At the same time this was all happening, police and fire personnel in Las Vegas responded to a pretty big fire at a Tesla Collision Center. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but it doesn't take too much of a genius to realize someone probably intentionally set this thing. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told CBS 8 that they had "received information that an individual had set several vehicles on fire in the parking lot."

In fact, the vandalism is getting so bad that insurance rates may end up spiking for some owners, and President Donald Trump (Elon's best buddy) says that Tesla vandals will be tried with domestic terrorism. I suppose if you were looking for a sign to get rid of your Tesla, this is it. In July of 2024, we told you about two separate vandalism stories. One involved a guy's Cybertruck ice cream truck having its windows smashed and another involved someone spray paint "F**k Elon" on 34 Cybertrucks at a lot in Florida. There have also been a number of protests at Tesla stores around the country, which Musk says are secretly funded by George Soros. I'm sure those protestors are still waiting for their checks. "This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong," he wrote in a second post. "Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks." While Tesla itself has never done anything outwardly evil (if you ignore the racism, sexism and homophobia issues among many others), Musk has intrinsically tied himself to the brand.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-a-multi-sig-wallet-a-beginners-guide'>What is a Multi-Sig Wallet? A Beginner’s Guide</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 17:55:17 <p>
Wallets can be custodial (managed by a third party such as Coinbase) or non-custodial (fully controlled by the user) and come in software or hardware forms. For example, a “2-of-3” setup requires two out of three key holders to sign off. This makes multi-sig wallets ideal for businesses, online communities, and shared accounts, reducing unauthorized transactions. Multi-sig wallets work similarly, preventing any single person from moving funds unilaterally. “A multi-sig wallet requires multiple parties to approve any transaction that moves assets,” Dan Hughes, founder of blockchain UX developer Radix, told Decrypt. “A common setup is ‘3 of 5,’ meaning five parties are authorized to sign, but at least three must approve for the transaction to be accepted into the network.” Meanwhile, the Solana-based Cashmere wallet claimed $100 million in total value locked. 💼 Business Security: A company can distribute keys among executives to prevent any single person from moving funds. A company can distribute keys among executives to prevent any single person from moving funds. When a multi-sig wallet is created, multiple private keys are generated and distributed among different individuals or devices. For example, in a 2-of-3 setup, at least two keyholders must sign off. 💰 Protection against theft — funds remain inaccessible without additional approvals if one key is compromised. — funds remain inaccessible without additional approvals if one key is compromised. 👾 Prevent scams and fraud by ensuring no single party can unilaterally drain the wallet. 🗝️ Redundancy protection — if one key is lost, access remains possible with the remaining authorized keys. Multi-sigs provide not only security, but redundancy protection too, Hughes explained. “If one of the five should lose their key, the funds can still be accessed as there are still four keys remaining, of which three are required,” he said, adding that, “Without multi-sig, if you lost that key, your assets would also be essentially "lost" unless you had another form of access such as seed phrase recovery to reconstruct the key.” While multi-sig wallets significantly improve security, they also pose challenges, said Sean Li, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency wallet developer Magic Labs. "More complex multi-sig wallets introduce a broader attack surface, mainly due to increased code complexity, coordination logic vulnerabilities, and the potential for bugs within smart contracts,” Li told Decrypt. “As more sophisticated mechanisms are added, like spending limits or time locks, the risk of vulnerabilities increases. To mitigate this, the industry should lean into rigorous smart contract audits and formal verification processes.” Despite their security advantages, multi-sig wallets may not be the default choice for most cryptocurrency users. Fisher said developers can mitigate against these issues by educating users, creating more user-friendly interfaces, and promoting best practices. “With multi-sig wallets, this care must be carried out across numerous keys.” 🏢 Businesses handling crypto payments or payroll can use multi-sig wallets to prevent unauthorized transfers and internal fraud. handling crypto payments or payroll can use multi-sig wallets to prevent unauthorized transfers and internal fraud. 🐋 Large cryptocurrency holders can reduce theft and phishing risks by distributing signing authority. 🌐 DAOs benefit from multi-sig by enabling transparent, collective decision-making for treasury management and governance. Looking ahead, innovations in smart contract technology, threshold signatures—which allow multiple parties to collectively sign transactions without revealing individual private keys—and account abstraction, which simplifies user interactions by enabling flexible access controls, could make multi-sig wallets more accessible, leading to the development of so-called “smart wallets.” “Smart wallets are the Swiss Army knives of crypto storage,” Gnosis co-founder and Safe Wallet developer Friederike Ernst told Decrypt, explaining that, “They support multiple signers, allowing credential rotation if lost or stolen,” She added that, “Recovery is customizable—you can use a bank for KYC verification or a committee of trusted friends.” While multi-signatures improve security, smart wallets offer customizable recovery options, and role-based access. As developers refine user experience and security features, multi-sig and other advanced wallet solutions will give fund managers the tools they need to ensure digital assets remain safe in an increasingly dangerous online world.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Per my observations, as the weather gets milder, Amazon's prices plummet. Perhaps there's a scientific explanation for this phenomenon — or, maybe more likely, we're being treated to a little preview of the Amazon Big Spring Sale. It was just announced that this seasonal savings event will kick off next Tuesday, March 25 and go through the end of the month (mark your calendar!). That said, I'm already seeing markdowns of up to 80%, so if this is just the sneak peek, I can only imagine what the official sale will have in store.

HTX, a leading crypto exchange, has been ranked as the “Top 3 Exchanges for EUR-Stablecoin Trading Activity” in a recent CoinDesk report titled “MiCAR: The Institutional Playbook for Europe’s Digital Asset Market”. The report explores key trends shaping the European digital asset market with the implementation of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and highlights that HTX achieved a monthly average EUR-stablecoin trading volume of €48 million, with a notable volume of €33 million in November 2024, ranking third following Binance and Coinbase. Regulatory clarity has become a key driver of institutional adoption and market confidence. While MiCAR streamlines compliance and fosters innovation, it also brings along complex challenges that exchanges must navigate. HTX Ventures explores both the opportunities and hurdles that come with this landmark regulation. As jurisdictions worldwide become more crypto-friendly, a united framework like MiCAR will accelerate innovation while ensuring robust compliance. MiCAR covers all 27 EU member states through a “single license” approach, enabling exchanges to significantly reduce compliance costs across borders. This unified regulatory framework provides a clear and stable regulatory environment for the market, increasing confidence and participation among institutional investors while positioning Europe to become the world's largest compliant digital asset market. To meet MiCAR’s stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and reserve monitoring requirements, exchanges can actively explore compliance tool innovations, including: Using Oracle networks to modularize AML rules and reserve monitoring, executing them on-chain for real-time data transparency. With platforms such as Coinbase launching securitized tokens, exchanges can introduce real-world asset (RWA) trading. This includes income-based stablecoins backed by US stocks or Treasuries, enabling users to leverage assets like USDT for multi-asset allocation and global liquidity matching. Exchanges must invest significantly in R&D to integrate compliance tools, data desensitization techniques, and on-chain regulatory platforms without compromising market fluidity. With regulatory policies evolving rapidly, exchanges must establish multi-chain testing environments and collaborate with regulatory-friendly regions (e.g., Lithuania, Malta) for cross-border stress tests and regulatory scenario simulations. This requires continuous investment, with risks at the policy interpretation and implementation levels. As DeFi integrates with traditional financial regulations, exchanges must address both technical vulnerabilities and evolving security risks. HTX Ventures firmly believes that under a clearer regulatory framework such as MiCAR, exchanges can achieve a win-win situation through technological innovations and global asset allocation, balancing compliance with market innovation. With more than a decade-long history as an industry pioneer, HTX Ventures excels at identifying cutting-edge technologies and emerging business models within the sector. Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, wallets, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Yeet.com, a new crypto casino and sportsbook, today announced it has raised $7.75 million in a funding round led by crypto venture fund Dragonfly, with participation from notable angel investors like Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz and LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino. (Disclaimer: Anderson is an investor in DASTAN, Decrypt’s parent company. For example, users will be able to engage with casino games that replicate the experience of minting NFTs, trading meme coins, and “getting rugged” in DeFi—the sorts of applications that allow crypto users to trade, borrow, and lend crypto assets without intermediaries. To start, Yeet will focus on providing entertaining, high-stakes gambling experiences instead of on-chain games, though it may look to incorporate provably fair games via on-chain verifiable randomness (VRF) in the future. They already trade 100x leverage, buy random meme coins, and gamble on everything from airdrops to NFTs in crypto,” Yeet co-founder Keyboard Monkey told Decrypt. “Crypto needs entertainment… and when trading slows down like right now, we all still want fun, fast-paced, gambling experiences—but ones that feel native to our world.” Meeting crypto users where they are, the casino and its forthcoming sportsbook will offer access to its site via a Telegram bot as well, a trend that was popularized with meme coin trading applications that allowed users to buy and sell tokens directly from the popular messaging terminal. As for competing with big name crypto casinos like Stake, Shuffle, and Rollbit, co-founder Ben Lamb expects the brand's deeply native crypto roots and culture to help the upstart pull market share. “Yeet isn’t trying to compete with these platforms,” he said. The platform instead will focus on “Asia, Latin America, Canada, Africa, and select European markets where demand for crypto casinos is currently booming,” said Anderson.

A crypto whale that opened over 300 heavily leveraged short positions on Bitcoin, totaling more than $521 million, closed the shorts on Tuesday and pocketed a profit of $3.9 million. In this scenario, the whale had placed a short trade on Bitcoin that sat at $83,898—and with 40x leverage applied, the total trade surged to a value of more than $521 million. If Bitcoin had risen just 2% from the trade’s open to $85,591, then the whale’s position would have been liquidated. As is often the case, the leading cryptocurrency had a fairly volatile day Monday, peaking at $84,573 according to CoinGecko but eventually stooping to $82,295. Following this daily low, the whale sold his 300+ heavily leveraged short positions in less than two minutes, according to the HypurrScan block explorer. “We lost the war, but it's been a long time since we had this much fun on the internet. However, the risk involved was much higher than this. In this case, the whale opened a cross position which would have used the wallet’s other positions to cover any losses made—meaning the whale’s portfolio could have mostly been wiped out through one trade. Due to the hugely risky bet, however, many observers believed that the whale must have been an insider of some kind. But, Bubblemaps told Decrypt this is unlikely due to the lack of news that happened before or after the wallet exited its position. That same trader caused a $4 million loss for the community-owned Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) last week, as it was forced to cover the losses of the whale's $285 million leveraged bet on Ethereum. As a result, Hyperliquid lowered the maximum amount of leverage a trader can apply on Bitcoin and Ethereum following the detrimental 50x leveraged trade. And the whale has already made a fresh bet: a long position on MELANIA, the official Solana meme coin of U.S. first lady Melania Trump, totaling $2.7 million with 5x leverage applied. As of this writing, there's no sign of traders trying to hunt this position to force a liquidation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Here's an update from outside the courthouse: pic.twitter.com/9WN1N2t9Kr — Frank Corva (@frankcorva) March 18, 2025 Today’s hearing was the shortest and least substantive of the four pre-trial hearings that have occurred thus far. The prosecution is scheduled to provide its expert disclosure on July 15, 2025, while the defense is expected to provide it by August 8, 2025. Further expert disclosure may also be permitted on July 16, 2025 at 10:00 AM EST, which is the date for the next in-person pre-trial hearing. Hill’s attorney asked Judge Richard Berman, who is presiding over the case, if the court would be amenable to the court not requiring Hill’s appearance at future pre-trial hearings given that Hill is currently living with his wife in Lisbon, Portugal and traveling back and forth to New York City is expensive. His attorney also stated that pre-trial services were “supportive” of this request. The judge stated that he didn’t see a problem with this. After the hearing, Rodriguez told Bitcoin Magazine that he‘s grateful to all those who’ve donated to the Peer-to-Peer Rights Fund, which helps to fund the developers’ legal defense. Those interested can still donate to the fund. The trial is slated to begin on November 3, 2025.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After an impressive 70% surge in its presale, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a key player in the altcoin space, leading many experts to question if altcoin season is finally back. But how does Coldware (COLD) compare to Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme coin that has dominated the market for years? Coldware (COLD), on the other hand, is rapidly gaining traction for its technological innovations and real-world use cases. The platform’s focus on scalability and low transaction fees has captured the attention of investors, especially those looking for more than just a speculative investment. This sets Coldware (COLD) apart from Dogecoin (DOGE), which has limited functionality beyond being a meme coin. This forward-thinking approach could help Coldware (COLD) achieve widespread adoption, setting it on a path toward long-term success. Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been one of the most well-known meme coins, beloved by both retail and institutional investors alike. However, DOGE has been facing increasing difficulties in keeping up with the broader crypto market. Analysts have raised concerns that Dogecoin (DOGE) could face more downward pressure, especially if it continues to struggle against Bitcoin (BTC)’s momentum. Unlike many newer projects, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still largely driven by social media hype rather than any concrete technological advancements. This leaves the coin vulnerable to market sentiment shifts, and as newer projects like Coldware (COLD) emerge, DOGE could fall behind. If Coldware (COLD) can maintain its trajectory, it could eventually surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) in value, offering a much more robust platform for future growth. The rise of Coldware (COLD) signifies that altcoin season may indeed be back, with projects offering real utility and scalability gaining more attention from both retail and institutional investors. Investors looking for the next big altcoin opportunity may find that Coldware (COLD) is a much more promising alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE).

Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit today in New York, Bo Hines, Executive Director on Digital Assets for President Trump, made it clear that the United States is determined to accumulate Bitcoin at an unprecedented scale. “I think it’s high time that our President started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines stated. He went on to reveal that at President Trump’s first-ever digital assets summit at the White House, discussions centered around “ways of acquiring more Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways.” Hines drew a direct comparison between Bitcoin and gold when asked how much BTC the government intends to hold. His comments align with the administration’s broader strategy following President Trump’s March 6 executive order, which formally established the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The very next day, President Trump’s crypto advisor David Sacks underscored the move’s significance, telling Bloomberg: “We’ve decided that Bitcoin is scarce, it’s valuable, and that is strategic for the United States to hold on to this as a long-term reserve asset.” Beyond retention, the administration is exploring ways to expand its holdings without it costing tax payers anything. U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds introduced a bill to solidify Trump’s initiative into law, ensuring it remains intact for future administrations. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have proposed a separate measure calling for the United States to purchase 200,000 BTC per year over the next five years, totaling 1 million BTC, which would be held for a minimum of 20 years. It has intrinsic stored value, it’s traditionally accepted… and that’s why you saw in the executive order that we compared this to digital gold.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The industry-first “trilateral exchange architecture” creates unprecedented access to over 5,000 cryptocurrencies through a unified platform The cryptocurrency exchange landscape has historically been divided into distinct, often competing paradigms: centralized exchanges (CEXs) with their speed and user-friendliness versus decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with their autonomy and diversity of assets. TOKERO’s PEX offers a groundbreaking solution to cash-to-crypto onboarding by transforming existing retail locations into crypto access points through software rather than hardware. This innovation enables customers to purchase any asset in TOKERO’s ecosystem—including thousands of DEX-only tokens—directly with cash, eliminating the need for multiple conversions or technical blockchain knowledge. Unlike traditional crypto ATMs that require $10,000-15,000 in hardware costs per location, PEX’s software-based approach enables unprecedented scalability at a fraction of the cost, allowing users to simply walk into a PEX location, pay cash for tokens only available on platforms like Uniswap or Jupiter, and receive them directly in their wallet. Their goal of 50,000 PEX locations worldwide represents a physical distribution network beyond anything previously attempted in cryptocurrency. They’ve engineered an embeddable component that allows any website to offer direct purchases of any token in their system – including tokens that exist only on DEXs – without requiring users to leave the site or interact with external exchanges. TOKERO’s neobanking initiative creates a seamless integration between banking services and their hybrid exchange, allowing: Direct fiat-to-crypto flows from bank accounts Integrated financial management Compliant fiat on/off-ramps with traditional banking features The result is a platform with capabilities that literally cannot exist in traditional exchange architectures – direct fiat purchases of DEX-only tokens, physical access points for thousands</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Gibraltar-based private bank Xapo said Tuesday it is now accepting members’ Bitcoin as collateral for loans. The new service allows customers to access up to $1 million in Bitcoin-backed debt, except for those located in the UK and Australia, Gadi Chait, a Xapo investment manager, told Decrypt. “We think it’s a great piece of collateral to lend against,” Chait added, referring to the asset that Xapo has safeguarded on behalf of customers since 2013. As Wall Street firms like Cantor Fitzgerald develop their own Bitcoin financing businesses, Chait said Xapo is expanding its “one-stop shop” to give customers more options in most regions. Xapo was among the first crypto banks to establish a physical headquarters in Europe, settling down in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar during crypto’s pandemic-era boom. While companies like Coinbase ceased issuing Bitcoin-backed loans in 2023, the San Francisco-based exchange restarted them in January, tapping a decentralized lending protocol called Morpho. Some asset managers are using decentralized finance, or DeFi, to earn yield from Bitcoin-backed loans as well. Among them is Bitwise, which recently made an allocation on Maple Finance, the lending protocol said earlier this month. “Many long-term Bitcoin holders have steered away from crypto-asset-backed lending after seeing predatory lending practices and products they couldn't count on,” Xapo CEO Seamus Rocca said in a statement.

Ethereum metaverse game The Sandbox is kicking off its fifth season with a new in-game Jurassic World experience created in collaboration with Universal and Ambling Entertainment, allowing the player to become an employee of a dinosaur park. The high-profile launch of Jurassic World: Dinosaur Preserve comes as part of a six-week long season that will pack in over 40 new experiences including content from other entertainment brands like Attack on Titan, The Smurfs, and The Terminator, all built on an improved game creator allowing for new features. The Sandbox is an open-world video game on PC and Mac that invites players to explore and create in its blocky world. Users can purchase NFTs that represent a piece of land in the virtual world, which they can then build what they like on. Along the way, tons of brands have teamed up with the game's creators and deployed their own experiences for players to enjoy. “Alpha Season 5 marks a significant milestone for The Sandbox as we work towards our vision of building a social metaverse that combines gamified storytelling for brands with new formats for interactive user-generated content and culture,” The Sandbox co-founder and COO Sebastien Borget told Decrypt. Both the eggs and dinosaurs will be issued as NFTs with a limited supply. This in-game event will kick-start the broader six-week season that's set to feature 40 new experiences—half of which will be user-generated, while the others leverage big brand partnerships. During this period, more than $1 million worth of SAND tokens and over 50 NFTs will be up for grabs for players via the in-game battle pass. All of these experiences have been built using The Sandbox’s new game maker, which offers improved character animations and gameplay features, plus a brand new ability system—which, for example, can grant players the ability to fly or double jump. Borget said that season launches offer a way to showcase new functionality and highlight fresh brand experiences.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://coinjournal.net/news/why-is-the-api3-crypto-pumping/'>Why is the API3 crypto pumping?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> coinjournal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 12:39:28 <p>
API3’s price surge has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. At its core, API3 addresses a critical pain point in blockchain technology: connecting smart contracts to reliable real-world data. Launched with a whitepaper in September 2020 and a token sale in December that raised tens of millions, API3 allows API providers to operate their own nodes, cutting out costly and centralized middleware like traditional oracles. This innovation dubbed the “Blockchain Oracle Problem” solution, is amplified by its OEV Network, which introduces maximal extractable value (MEV) protection. By auctioning Oracle updates and redistributing 80% of proceeds as rewards to dApps, API3 creates a sustainable revenue model that’s turning heads. Posts on X highlight this feature, with users noting February OEV revenue of $44,000 and a runway exceeding 10 years, signalling a robust business model that’s close to profitability. The recent switch by Moonwell from Chainlink to API3 for cost-effective, tamper-proof data feeds underscores its growing credibility. With 23,630 holders and a circulating supply of 118.31 million out of 147.65 million tokens, the project’s fundamentals are aligning with market enthusiasm, fueling its upward trajectory. API3 hit an all-time low of $0.4981 on March 11, 2025, only to rebound 96.1% within a week. Notably, its 24-hour range of $0.6007 to $1.03, coupled with a 78.8% seven-day gain, showcases intense speculative fervour. Its 90.5% drop from an all-time high of $10.30 in April 2021 leaves room for growth, while a 4.9% hourly gain and 8.5% monthly rise signal sustained interest. As blockchain reliance grows, API3’s practical solution could keep it in the spotlight.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As well as th 50x short leveraged position on Ethereum (ETH), this whale also shorted Chainlink (LINK), opening a huge $31 million position with 10x leverage. The issue of stolen funds making it back into circulation via decentralized finance protocols remains. It also points to the overall impact of massive leverage on the market, particularly when criminals tap into high-leverage trades to gamble stolen funds.

Bitcoin is consolidating in the $82,000-$84,000 range after a 22% correction from its all-time high On-chain data indicates strong accumulation by long-term holders despite price fluctuations The market sentiment has turned cautious as hopes for a quick return above $90,000 have begun to fade. However, technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin may be forming a cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern has been developing over multiple years, with the rounded bottom phase stretching from 2021 to mid-2024. This neckline is expected to serve as support for the current price action. According to this technical framework, Bitcoin could target price levels above $130,000. Despite these bullish technical indicators, Bitcoin’s fundamentals show some uncertainty in the short term. There is currently a lack of momentum needed to challenge the $90,000 mark. Steady institutional outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs have increased selling pressure. This has limited Bitcoin’s ability to regain strength in the immediate term. Their average purchase price across all holdings stands at $66,360 per BTC. Market analysts are viewing the current downturn differently than typical bear markets. Many describe it as a temporary “shakeout” rather than the end of Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle. Bitfinex analysts note that “corrections within bull cycles are normal.” They suggest this may be a shakeout rather than the start of a prolonged bear market. Despite fears of a disrupted bull market, Bitcoin’s four-year cycle and the recent halving event remain crucial for price action. This event was considered the “most bullish” setup for Bitcoin price, partly due to growing institutional interest. CryptoQuant analysts highlight that “this trend highlights a hodling behavior.” Investors are refraining from selling despite the current market correction. Historically, this type of resilience among Bitcoin holders has played a crucial role in forming market bottoms. For those tracking Bitcoin’s price action, keeping an eye on the $72,000-$73,000 support range will be essential. Broader market factors, including global treasury yields and equity trends, will likely influence Bitcoin’s next major move.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dark Defender suggests XRP could reach $333 if it repeats its 2017 bull run performance Critics question the feasibility of such high prices due to market capitalization concerns Despite this recent dip, some analysts remain very optimistic about XRP’s future price movements. The analyst did not provide a timeframe for when this price target might be reached. There was also no mention of what factors or events could trigger such a dramatic price increase. Another prominent analyst, Egrag Crypto, offered a somewhat more conservative estimate for XRP. In a Twitter/X thread, Egrag Crypto stated that XRP will reach double digits during the current market cycle. The analyst referred to a “Just Do It” chart showing measured wave patterns. We’ve built together the Full Elliot Wave Count to assess our next Targets: 🎯✨ Take an in-depth look at it! These optimistic price targets for XRP have sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community. Crypto commentator Dark Defender has also weighed in on XRP’s price potential. Dark Defender suggested that XRP could surge to $333 if it repeats its performance from the 2017 bull run. This would represent an extraordinary increase from its current trading price of $2.34. At a price of $280, XRP’s market cap would reach approximately $1.6 trillion based on current circulating supply. The commentator claimed that cryptocurrency market capitalization “doesn’t matter” and is “just an illusion.” This viewpoint has added fuel to the ongoing debate about XRP’s price potential. This performance has attracted attention from both supporters and critics in the cryptocurrency space. The asset continues to have a strong following despite recent price volatility. Trading activity for XRP remains active as investors evaluate these various price predictions. The cryptocurrency continues to be listed on major exchanges where it maintains good trading volume. Some speculate this could be related to Ripple preparing for strategic market moves. As of the latest data, XRP is trading at $2.34 according to TradingView charts.

This 19% reduction in open interest is viewed by analysts as a healthy market reset necessary for bullish continuation Historical patterns suggest similar deleveraging events have created good short to medium-term opportunities The OI drop coincided with price volatility triggered by uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and US interest rates Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,500, having recovered from dipping below $80,000 in late February Open interest measures the total number of unsettled derivative contracts like options and futures. This drop happened during a time of price volatility for the leading cryptocurrency. Just two days later, it dropped below $80,000 for the first time since November. Questions about the future of US interest rates also added to market worries. These concerns led to what one analyst called “a massive liquidation of leveraged positions on Bitcoin.” When too many traders use leverage, it can create conditions for sharp price swings. It currently sits at $49.02 billion, showing a 6.5% increase over the past five days. CryptoQuant’s analysis shows that past deleveraging events have created good opportunities in the short to medium term. One chart shared by analysts tracks Bitcoin open interest and its 90-day percentage change over recent years. This cooldown in futures market activity might set the stage for a price rebound. When open interest drops this way, it often removes market excess that can lead to extreme volatility. Markets currently price in a 99% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/ecb-prepping-the-ground-for-digital-euro-launch'>ECB Prepping the Ground for Digital Euro Launch</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 11:00:21 <p>
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, shared this update at their latest press conference. 🇮🇱 Israel is following EU’s footsteps – preparing for CBDC with a new 110 page design document. Could it be linked to Ursula von der Leyen’s recent “ReArm Europe” announcement, which proposes the creation of an EU army? This initiative requires an estimated €800 billion in funding—money the EU does not have. Extracting it from EU member states and their citizens or printing fresh funds via the ECB. Europe‘s security is threatened in a very real way. Furthermore, The EU has introduced the “Savings and Investments Union”, aiming to redirect €10 trillion in “unused savings” from citizens to finance military growth and bolster Europe’s defense industry. “We’ll turn private savings into much-needed investment,” tweeted von der Leyen. If this hasn’t shocked you already, I’ll try to clarify: This is a clear violation of private property rights, and an implicit confiscation of Europeans’ wealth, while bluntly using their funds as the EU sees fit, including funding of a military industrial complex, without even asking them. If the EU is accelerating toward totalitarian collectivism, as this statement suggests, then a CBDC would be a powerful tool—enabling tighter control over Europeans’ money with features like an “on/off” switch and programming abilities. If most of your money is still in fiat the bank / stocks / mortgaged real estate etc. You may want to consider a permissionless, unconfiscatable, easily mobile & liquid digital asset such as… pic.twitter.com/K2xjTpcyS7 — Efrat Fenigson (@efenigson) March 12, 2025 European banks must innovate payment methods, but the EU’s primary concern isn’t just reliance on tech giants like Google Pay or Apple Pay—it’s the potential for widespread adoption of decentralized global protocols like Bitcoin. ECB board member Piero Cipollone reinforced this stance, stating, “This solution further disintermediates banks as they lose fees, they lose clients… That’s why we need a digital euro.” Bottom line, Lagarde’s and Von der Leyen’s recent agendas are aimed to drive more centralised control while strengthening the EU hierarchy, governance and incentive structure – that has always been their role. The ECB recently published findings from a survey on consumer attitudes toward retail CBDC, conducted among 19,000 Europeans across 11 Eurozone countries. 1) Lack of Interest – Most Europeans are not interested in the Digital Euro, as existing payment methods already serve their needs well. 2) Europeans are Open to Propaganda – While public interest is low, the survey found that Europeans are receptive to video-based education and training. The ECB’s study suggests that CBDC-related videos could drive widespread adoption by reshaping consumer beliefs. The report states: “Consumers who are shown a short video providing concise and clear communication about the key features of the digital euro are substantially more likely to update their beliefs… which increases their immediate likelihood of adopting it.” No wonder the ECB has ramped up its digital euro video content since late 2024. Propaganda for European CBDC, the digital euro, has began. A recent Euromoney article highlighted e-CNY’s integration with China’s most popular apps (DiDi, Meituan, Ctrip, WeChat Pay, and Alipay), a move that facilitated its widespread adoption. Despite early struggles, e-CNY now boasts 180 million personal wallet users and a cumulative transaction value of $1 trillion. This follows exploratory work conducted by the Eurosystem between May and November 2024. Their trials involved 64 participants—including central banks, financial market players, and DLT platform operators—conducting over 50 experiments. Permission-based CBDCs such as the Digital Euro are prone to micro levels of control through expiry dates, geofencing and programmability. Christine Lagarde is prepping you to the next phase of EU’s CBDC, which is everything *but* a form of cash (nice try though). While ordinary citizens are bound by the rule of law, elites often evade consequences. A prime example is Christine Lagarde, who was found guilty of negligence for approving a massive taxpayer-funded payout to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie. Despite public disinterest, the ECB (and other central banks) will push forward with their CBDCs. To maintain the illusion of public involvement, they will conduct surveys and create engagement tools. But ultimately, the Digital Euro will be integrated into existing payment methods and consumer apps—just as China did with e-CNY. This strategy will drive adoption even without direct public enthusiasm. We are, after all, playing the game of “democracy,” right? Geopolitical analyst Alex Krainer recently tweeted in response to Lagarde and von der Leyen’s acceleration of CBDC efforts: “This is excellent news; Christine Lagarde and Ursula von der Leyen never took on something they didn’t completely mess up. This is excellent news; Christine Lagarde and Ursula von der Leyen never took on something they didn't completely mess up. Stay tuned as I continue to track central banks’ moves toward CBDC implementation.

He noted the timing was poor given recent policy changes affecting transgender people. this is so fucking tone deaf https://t.co/p2hF5jIb9c — sean o’connor | gas network ⛽ (@aseoconnor) March 17, 2025 David McIntyre, operating chief at DoubleZero, described the ad as “horrendous.” He questioned why Solana didn’t “keep the message positive instead of dunking on people and making light of serious cultural issues.” He also signed an order recognizing only two sexes and removed the option for Americans to choose “X” as a gender on passports. Nicolas Pennie, co-founder of Solana development platform Helius, commented that “virtue signaling will always be cringe regardless of political ideology.” This suggests that some viewed the ad as an attempt to appeal to certain political viewpoints. Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain deleted his post praising the ad “after some reflection.” He had previously called it “bold and risky.” Critics pointed out that the ad seemed to contradict Solana’s previous stance on diversity and inclusion. Just weeks before President Trump’s election victory, the Solana Foundation held a conference in Singapore with a code of conduct that showed strong support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Tyler Bench, CRO of on-chain governance platform Tally.xyz, had harsh words for the advertisement. He wrote on X: “This might be the single most toxic piece of content I have ever consumed. Anneri van der Merwe, product lead at Base, criticized the ad for going against crypto’s inclusive values. This ad shows there’s still a long way to go in truly embracing that ethos,” van der Merwe posted. This ad shows there’s still a long way to go in truly embracing that ethos.https://t.co/cz5UVTsIMK — aneri.base.eth (@0xAneri) March 17, 2025 He suggested in a social media post that the company’s previous “Maren ad was better,” referring to an earlier, less controversial marketing effort. Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, suggested the deletion was business-motivated rather than a change of heart. Some industry observers suggested the advertisement may have been intentional “rage bait.” This marketing approach aims to generate buzz through controversy. However, such tactics risk alienating large portions of the global crypto community. Representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment from various news outlets. Many industry figures argue that such divisive content contradicts crypto’s foundational values of neutrality and global inclusivity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

DOGE has already canceled 239 “wasteful” contracts worth up to $1.7 billion These computers allegedly have the ability to “make money out of thin air” according to statements Musk made during an appearance on Senator Ted Cruz’s podcast “Verdict” on March 17. The tech billionaire, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead government cost-cutting efforts, explained that these computers can issue payments without proper oversight. “You may think that the government computers all talk to each other, they’re synchronized, they add up what funds are going where, and it’s coherent,” Musk told Cruz during the podcast. However, he claimed this isn’t the case in reality. An absolute bombshell from @elonmusk on the latest episode of Verdict. Don’t miss the latest episode of Verdict wherever you get your podcasts. Musk defined a “magic money computer” as “any computer which can just make money out of thin air.” He added that while these systems aren’t “totally wrong” in reporting government expenditures, they can be off by “5% or 10% in some cases.” The DOGE team has been conducting a thorough audit of federal government spending. This audit aims to identify and eliminate wasteful expenditure across departments. The DOGE head believes that about 80% of these cases stem from waste and incompetence rather than malicious intent. He cited examples where companies continued to receive government payments even after their contracts should have been terminated. DOGE announced last week that it had already canceled 239 “wasteful” contracts within government agencies. Senator Mike Lee of Utah responded to Musk’s revelations with humor on social media. The tech entrepreneur’s work with DOGE has not come without controversy. Musk continues to lead the audit efforts despite these challenges. It also highlights potential areas for reform in how government funds are tracked and disbursed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Burwick Law filed a class-action lawsuit against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora for allegedly orchestrating the deceptive LIBRA memecoin launch LIBRA initially gained legitimacy through promotion by Argentine President Javier Milei but crashed 94% after insiders allegedly withdrew $107 million The lawsuit claims developers used “predatory” one-sided liquidity pools to artificially inflate prices while withholding 85% of tokens Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, who reportedly netted $100 million, may face an Interpol red notice The lawsuit names Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol, and Meteora as defendants in what has become one of the biggest cryptocurrency scandals of 2025. The memecoin gained attention when Argentine President Javier Milei promoted it on social media platform X. The token was presented as an economic initiative to boost private-sector funding in Argentina. This setup allowed insiders to profit while regular investors suffered losses. This caused a dramatic 94% crash in LIBRA’s market value. The lawsuit states that approximately 85% of LIBRA’s tokens were held back at launch. This created a false sense of legitimacy that misled investors about the coin’s economic potential. The law firm is seeking multiple forms of relief for affected investors. They also want the return of “unjustly obtained” profits. Their data shows that out of 15,430 large LIBRA wallets, more than 86% sold at a loss. Davis now faces potential legal trouble beyond the class-action lawsuit. President Milei has tried to distance himself from the scandal. The opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment, though these efforts have not gained much traction so far. It quickly reached a market cap of $4.4 billion before crashing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin miners have sold over $27 million in profits recently as BTC trades around $83,400 These selling patterns could introduce short-term volatility and may impact Bitcoin’s ability to break resistance levels This large-scale selling comes as Bitcoin faces key resistance levels that could determine its next price move. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that early Bitcoin miners have realized over $27.2 million in profits recently. This selling activity has increased following Bitcoin’s pullback from highs above $90,000. On-chain metrics show that miners have been making large deposits to exchanges since the bull rally started in late 2024. The Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow metric has been registering positive values during this period. The pattern suggests miners initially began selling for profit-taking purposes as prices rose. 🔸Miner inflows to exchanges have increased, typically a sign of miners taking profits. Mining operations face constant running costs in the form of electricity bills. These expenses often force miners to sell portions of their Bitcoin holdings on a regular basis. Typically, this routine selling isn’t large enough to heavily impact Bitcoin’s price. However, when miner selling reaches higher levels, as is currently happening, it can potentially introduce short-term volatility. One analyst noted, “If miner selling accelerates, it could introduce short-term volatility into the market.” If miners continue liquidating at the current pace, Bitcoin may struggle to break through key resistance levels. Until then, the market will closely watch how Bitcoin responds to this elevated selling pressure.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The price slump coincides with an upcoming major token unlock. Technical indicators paint a concerning picture for Pi’s short-term prospects. The Average Directional Index (ADX) sits at 18.3, suggesting a weak but present downtrend. Pi miners who failed to complete the Know Your Customer process forfeited their tokens. One social media post highlighted the impact of these forfeitures. Pi has dropped to #13 in the CMC ranking as its price falls below $1.3. This places it below the psychologically important $1.50 mark that analysts consider crucial for a potential rally. Pi failed to secure a listing on Binance despite 86% of its community voting in favor. This was viewed as a crucial event for the community. Unlike other crypto projects that provide transparent timelines, Pi Network has remained vague about future developments. Pi enthusiast Dr Altcoin noted on social media that the cryptocurrency’s ranking has fallen to #13. The lack of a roadmap has made investors hesitant, leading to increased selling. Despite these challenges, the Pi Network is seeing some real-world adoption. Investors believe several steps are needed to restore confidence: releasing a clear Open Mainnet roadmap, launching the promised 100 decentralized applications, and disclosing key investors and partnerships. Some analysts suggest such an announcement could push Pi above $2. However, without confirmation of any listings, market sentiment remains cautious. If Pi’s price stabilizes above $1.50 and builds momentum, a rally toward $2 becomes possible.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Microsoft identified a new remote access trojan (StilachiRAT) that targets 20 cryptocurrency wallet extensions in Google Chrome The malware can steal browser credentials, wallet information, and clipboard data while using evasion techniques to avoid detection StilachiRAT creates a unique device ID, monitors RDP sessions, and establishes communication with command-and-control servers The malware can execute 10 different commands including system shutdown, log clearing, and application launching Despite not being widespread currently, Microsoft released the information to help users protect themselves from this emerging threat Microsoft has discovered a new type of malware specifically designed to steal cryptocurrency. The malware, named StilachiRAT, targets cryptocurrency wallets through Google Chrome browser extensions. This includes saved login credentials, digital wallet details, and data copied to the clipboard. The malware works by looking for 20 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It checks if any of the targeted wallet extensions are present on your system. It can extract credentials saved in Chrome’s local state file. This allows it to capture sensitive information like passwords and crypto keys as users copy them. The malware can also check if it’s running in a test environment. They haven’t linked it to any specific threat actor or location. The company stated that StilachiRAT doesn’t appear to be widespread right now. This is part of their effort to monitor and report on evolving threats. This ID is derived from the system’s serial number and attackers’ public RSA key. This is likely an attempt to avoid detection during security scans. A watchdog thread monitors both the EXE and dynamic link library files. If these files are deleted, they can be recreated from an internal copy. StilachiRAT can execute various commands received from the control servers. These include system reboots, log clearing, credential theft, and executing applications. This shows a versatile command set for both spying and system control. Users should have antivirus software and cloud-based anti-phishing components on their devices. The company advises downloading software only from official websites or trusted sources. This feature can identify and block malicious websites, including phishing sites. They noted that crypto crime has entered a more professional era. The report highlighted AI-driven scams, stablecoin laundering, and efficient cyber criminal organizations. They note that malware like this can be installed through multiple vectors. These help prevent initial compromise and reduce the potential impact of such threats.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethereum (ETH) is showing price patterns similar to 2017 and 2020 bull runs, suggesting a potential trend reversal ETH has fallen below $2,000 since March 11, with technical indicators like Stochastic RSI showing oversold conditions Multiple analysts point to historical fractals and a 5-year trendline support suggesting an imminent rebound The upcoming Pectra upgrade and potential Wall Street expansion could serve as catalysts for ETH recovery Ethereum (ETH) has struggled throughout 2025, with its market cap dropping more than 40% year-to-date as of March 18. Several crypto analysts have identified patterns suggesting ETH may be preparing for a turnaround. That period saw ETH experience a sharp trend reversal to the upside after hitting bottom. Another analyst, Merlijn The Trader, noted that ETH appears to be repeating its historical cycle. Merlijn pointed to the Luna crash of 2022 as another instance when bearish sentiment surrounding ETH peaked. Following that event, the digital asset quickly overcame market pessimism and experienced a 270% rally. Analyst TraderPA observed that Ethereum is currently oversold at its present price, with the weekly Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaling a possible trend reversal. The Stochastic RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the relative position of an asset’s current price within its recent price range. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of liquidity in and out of a cryptocurrency, shows rising buying pressure for ETH. This suggests that ETH’s price is unlikely to drop toward the $1,500 level, as some have predicted. From an on-chain perspective, the Bulls and Bears indicator also supports a possible price increase. Currently, Ethereum bulls have outnumbered bears, indicating increasing buying pressure. If this trend continues, ETH might avoid another correction. Ethereum’s price action over the past five years has consistently respected an ascending support line, which it is currently retesting. Looking at shorter timeframes, ETH is currently confined within a descending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. For ETH to regain momentum, it must stay above $1,861 and retest the $2,227 level.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has directed staff to consider withdrawing a proposed crypto custody rule from 2023 The rule would require investment advisers to custody client crypto with qualified custodians Industry commenters expressed “significant concern” over the proposal’s broad scope Acting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mark Uyeda has asked his staff to consider withdrawing a proposed rule that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisers. Under the proposal, investment advisers would be required to custody their clients’ crypto with a qualified custodian. These qualified custodians typically include federal or state-chartered banks and broker-dealers. Gensler had stated that investment advisers “cannot rely on” crypto platforms as qualified custodians due to their operational methods. This stance caused friction within the industry and among some SEC commissioners. “Given such concern, there may be challenges to proceeding with the original proposal,” Uyeda said during his remarks. He questioned how advisers could comply with the rule while still investing client funds in crypto assets. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda delivered keynote remarks at ICI’s Investment Management Conference today. A coalition of bank and financial industry associations, including the American Bankers Association, warned that the proposal “could have a material impact on their business.” The agency has moved away from Gensler’s strict stance, which held that most cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin were securities. In recent weeks, the SEC has rapidly changed course on several key crypto policies. It has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance known as SAB 121, which required firms holding crypto assets to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The agency has also dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players, including Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase. The task force is scheduled to hold its first roundtable, titled “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” this Friday. This event may provide further insights into the SEC’s evolving approach to crypto regulation. Congressional Republicans had joined crypto firms and traditional finance companies in pushing back against the rule when it was first proposed. This approach contrasts sharply with the regulatory direction under Gensler, whose tenure was marked by strict crypto oversight.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There’s no significant on-chain activity, and key indicators are neutral, suggesting the bull cycle is still intact. A recent CryptoQuant report suggests Bitcoin could return to the $63,000 level. When the MVRV Z-score drops below its 365-day moving average, it typically signals that Bitcoin’s price momentum has weakened. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has seen three straight weeks of outflows. Bitcoin is currently down 15% over the past month according to CoinDesk Indices data. This decline has erased any gains made following the U.S. presidential election.

DMND’s pool implements end-to-end encryption to prevent hashrate hijacking, ensuring greater security for mining operations. The mining industry has long struggled with opaque fee structures and centralized block construction. Mining operators interested in contributing to the first-ever Stratum V2 block can apply via DMND’s official website. For more information on DMND and the Stratum V2 mining pool, visit their website.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/introducing-congressman-nicholas-begich-an-og-bitcoiner'>Introducing Congressman Nicholas Begich, An OG Bitcoiner</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 08:00:58 <p>
The bill, a revised version of a bill that Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced to the Senate last year, stipulates that the United States government acquire 1 million bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and protects the right of U.S. citizens to self custody their bitcoin. Furthermore, he believes that in an age of “undisciplined bureaucracy” and reckless spending, it’s important for the U.S. government to hold bitcoin, as it will serve as a backstop to our financial system. On a personal level, when did you first begin to see the value in Bitcoin? I started digging in a little further and decided that I wanted to learn more about how this digital asset worked. Afterward, I transferred them over to a private wallet. I wanted to understand how Bitcoin worked, because I owned a software development company and spent 20 years in technology as a career before coming to Congress. Yes, but also, a couple of days later, I called my business partners and told them that I thought bitcoin could become something really big. So, when the exchange went under, of course it was a huge disaster, because all of that bitcoin was still on the exchange. A number of us who were creditors found each other and we put a group together to hire an attorney in Japan. Did you get some of it back then? Ultimately, I sold our company’s claim to Fortress. But I still hold my own original seven bitcoin. For years, I’ve thought that the United States government should have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reason I believe it’s important is because when you look at the universe of available reserve assets, the lion’s share of them can be printed at will by a centralized authority. As a corollary to gold, bitcoin reminds us that there is value in scarcity, and scarce assets are the sorts of assets that belong in a reserve because they’re the defense against an undisciplined bureaucracy. What we’ve seen not just in the last several years but in the last several decades, is a federal government that will print dollars to solve problems. And, in doing so, it’s created bigger problems. Both provide us with a financial backstop of a scarce resource that can’t be created by an executive action or Congressional action, which imposes discipline on the financial system. Congress has not demonstrated a sustained ability to impose financial discipline and keep the government in its Constitutional lane. As a result, ultimately the math will not add up. The United States cannot sustain a 125% debt-to-GDP ratio. Our gold reserves and a future bitcoin reserve provide the United States and its people with a fallback mechanism should the debt-based fiat system collapse. The likelihood is growing, and the reason I believe that is because a) there are more people in Congress today who understand what Bitcoin is than ever before, b) there are more people in Congress today who understand just how precarious our current debt and deficit is, and c) there’s a growing awareness among the public that holding a scarce asset in addition to gold is a wise diversification of our national strategic reserve. For those three reasons, the time is right. And I will tell you that there’s significant interest among others in Congress who haven’t yet decided to cosponsor in learning more about the legislation and how it can be a backstop for the United States. The reason why five years makes sense is because what you don’t want to do is introduce a demand shock to the system that causes short- to mid-term volatility. It’s also important to remember the United States government is not a day trader. Will this look something like El Salvador’s proof of reserves system, one in which the government’s Bitcoin address is made public? Bitcoin provides us with mechanisms for continuous proof of reserves so that every citizen of the United States can know for a fact that we have the bitcoin we say we have. The bill outlines that those regulations and technical practices will be developed in consultation with industry experts, which I think is appropriate. However, based on my own experience with Bitcoin, I believe it’s very important that a) we’re talking about cold storage, and b) that we’re talking about thousands of separate cold storage wallets. It’s also important that the keys for those wallets be held in different physical locations, and that we use the Shamir backup system, which is a mechanism where, as long as you have two of the three pieces of a key, you can reassemble the key. What you don’t want is to have a complete key in one physical location, because, if it’s compromised, someone would be able to access that wallet. You want a diversified key strategy so that you would need to reassemble the keys from multiple physical locations for each individual wallet. The bill also protects U.S. citizens’ right to self custody their bitcoin. In your mind, why is self custody so important? You were not permitted to own gold outside of jewelry. We do not want to see a repeat of that ever in the United States, whether it’s with gold or anything else. I think continuing to assure the public in law that we have a fundamental right to self custody our own wealth is an important restatement of our Constitutional rights. Are you familiar with the Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash cases, which are cases in which developers may be put on trial for creating and maintaining Bitcoin and crypto mixers? Mixers have been around for a long time. Well, I think the question is: “Where do you draw the line on the base layer and subsequent layers?” If you think about Bitcoin versus other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has unique characteristics as a store of value. Whereas other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have multiple layers in which logic for transaction restriction can be applied. In my view, you don’t wanna have transaction restrictions baked into the base layer of a store of value cryptocurrency like Bitcoin because it allows centralized control from an authority, which fundamentally defeats the fungibility aspect of it. I think it’s important for the nation. And I look forward to the Bitcoin community being an advocate with their members of Congress and their senators. But we need the Bitcoin community to continue to educate and inform the rest of Congress so that we can move this legislation to President Trump’s desk where he can sign it into law.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A new lending product from Xapo Bank allows qualifying members to access USD loans using their bitcoin holdings as collateral. Eligible members can now take out loans up to $1,000,000 secured against their bitcoin. The corresponding bitcoin is held in secure storage by Xapo until repayment. Members can select flexible repayment terms from 30 days up to 1 year. There are no early repayment fees or penalties, giving borrowers control over minimizing costs. Many bitcoin holders have previously faced loss of assets from high-risk lending platforms. Automated controls around repayment and loan health monitoring further reduce risks compared to other crypto lending products. Selling bitcoin to cover short-term financing needs can result in lost future upside. However, experts urge caution when leveraging bitcoin holdings, as price declines could trigger collateral liquidations if loans become undercollateralized. Thorough due diligence on lender practices and risks is advised.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We hope your week is off to a great start. In case you need a helping hand with it, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Tuesday's puzzle (#1,368). Wordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. Wordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. You'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once. How to play Wordle more than once a day If you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. In addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. Before today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed: Every day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle. This should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Mechanism that either sounds an alarm after a certain period has elapsed or measures how long something takes. This is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. Don't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself. Not to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Gold has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing $3,025 per ounce to mark an increase of over 15% in since the turn of the year. Several factors have contributed to gold’s rally, including significant inflows into gold ETFs and its traditional role as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical uncertainty.

Gold’s historic rally has driven its price up 40% year-over-year, far outpacing Bitcoin's 16% gain. Historically, when gold enters a bull market, bitcoin often stagnates or declines. The two assets rarely move in tandem, though there are occasional periods when both rise or fall simultaneously. Bitcoin followed suit in Q4 2020, surging into its own bull run while gold took a backseat. By 2022, as global interest rates began to rise, both assets faced pressure before rebounding in 2023 and 2024. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris has described this gold rally as a "proper gold rush"—something the market hasn’t seen since 2011.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Solana doesn't yet have an exchange-traded fund, but one of the asset's biggest backers is betting the Wall Street-friendly vehicle could come in 2025 — and believes it's well-positioned to trounce Ethereum's various similar products. Multicoin Capital's Kyle Samani — a major investor in SOL and countless subordinate protocols — has been publicly pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look favorably upon a SOL ETF. His bullish pronouncements therefore might come as little surprise. But onstage Tuesday at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York City, Samani explained his view why Solana is better placed to appeal to traditional investors than Ethereum did. By his telling, they didn't find much proof to justify investing at its high prices. Stock traders often look at a company's price to earnings ratio in deciding whether it's over or undervalued; in other words, when to invest. Crypto doesn't have such a clean metric, but blockchains still have revenue and tokens that can be mushed together for similar effect. Samani believes Solana's theoretical P/E ratio is much healthier from an investing standpoint than Ethereum's. Solana's P/E ratio is "much more in line with high-growth tech stocks," Samani said. If the logic plays out then traditional investors might be expected to believe Solana has more upside than Ethereum, and invest accordingly.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Executives of Coinbase, a big holding of Ark, had previously mentioned a similar outlook, although it was vague as companies are trying to make their mark in the tokenization industry. At the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference earlier this month, Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said that the crypto exchange is in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a security token, a move that previously failed when Coinbase attempted to go public with such a product in 2020.

Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction.

A contentious proposal in the Cronos ecosystem drew to a close late Monday, with the community voting in favor of the token supply growing from 30 billion CRO to 100 billion CRO over a 10-year vesting period. That, however, happened after weeks of the community leaning against the switch whilst a few CRO whales — or influential users who hold large amounts of a token — stepped up in the last few hours of the vote’s closure to nudge it into favor. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Cronos, tied to crypto exchange Crypto.com, earlier in the month proposed reissuing 70 billion CRO tokens it burned in 2021, aiming to restore its original 100 billion token supply for a "Strategic Reserve.” The supposed $5 billion plan (at current $0.08 CRO prices) sought to boost U.S. crypto dominance, fund ecosystem growth and launch a CRO ETF. But crypto governance is notorious for being community-governed in name only; with large token holders able to dominate any proposals and changes at their will — even though the vote would be, in theory, executed transparently by the “community.” Two influencer network validators, Starship and Falcon Heavy, backed the plan as of March 10, dwarfed by 77.97% against it and 8.47% abstaining at the time. On Monday, Electron, Antares, and Minotaur IV piled in — using a cumulative 3.2 billion CRO in voting power to vote for the proposal. Cronos network had an upgrade lined up in the hours after the vote drew to a close and was finished on March 18 at 03:00 UTC, setting course for a more than 200% increase in supply in the coming years.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Microsoft’s Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post.

According to the team, the malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet.

While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software.

“Due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape,” the team wrote.

The company's Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) offers a fixed 10% annual cash dividend, paid quarterly, according to an SEC filing If dividends are unpaid, they compound at an additional 1% per year (quarterly), up to a maximum of 18%.

Strategy's initial preferred series (STRK) initially offered only an 8% interest rate. Unlike common stock, STRF holders do not have voting rights but have priority in liquidation with a $100 per share liquidation preference. Strategy has the right to redeem STRF if fewer than 25% of the original shares remain or if tax events occur, while holders can demand a buyback in case of a fundamental change. STRF is expected to trade on Nasdaq within 30 days of issuance, offering investors bitcoin exposure with a high-yield structure. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup, and Moelis & Company are joint book-running managers for the offering, conducted under an SEC shelf registration. After buying bitcoin at a galloping pace over the past several months, Strategy's fundraising and token acquisitions have slowed to a crawl in recent weeks. The company last week did make additional bitcoin purchases, but they were hardly needle-moving — just 130 BTC for $10.7 million to bring total holdings to 499,226 tokens.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day policy meeting today, with results and Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference set for Wednesday afternoon U.S. hours. While no one is expecting a change in interest rates, traders will be looking for signs that the Fed is perhaps turning a hair more dovish given recent market turbulence and a slowdown in inflation. The market action on Tuesday, however, suggests nervousness the Fed may not yet be ready to ease policy further. After all, the downturn in inflation seen in February wasn't that large and it was just one report. And the dip in markets — though painful for many — has also been pretty modest given the impressive run higher in recent years. According to CME FedWatch, rate traders today see no chance the Fed cuts rates tomorrow and only a 20% chance the central bank eases at its next meeting in May. For June, though, there's a 66% chance that the Fed will cut rates.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
