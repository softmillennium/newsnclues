The humble iguana may have have pulled off an epic migration millions of years ago, traveling from the coast of today's Mexico to Fiji on rafts made of vegetation.

Millions of years ago, seafaring iguanas may have pulled off one of the greatest long-distance migrations the world has ever seen.

That's according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), which suggests iguanas traveled from North America to Fiji on rafts of vegetation during the late Paleogene period (about 34 million years ago). The epic voyage measures more than 8,000 km (5,000 miles) or one-fifth of the world's circumference and is the longest in the “history of terrestrial vertebrates,” researchers of the peer-reviewed study said.

“We found that the Fiji iguanas are most closely related to the North American desert iguanas, something that hadn't been figured out before,” lead author Simon Scarpetta, an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco, said in a news release, adding that they split from their “sister” lineage around 30 million years ago.

“You could imagine some kind of cyclone knocking over trees where there were a bunch of iguanas and maybe their eggs, and then they caught the ocean currents and rafted over,” he said.

The findings could shed new light on how species are dispersed across oceans in a process that has long captivated scientists and is regarded as critical in the establishment of new species of plants and animals. Other animals such as primates, rodents, geckos, skinks and frogs have all been able to cross oceans, with lizards particularly adept “overwater dispersers,” researchers said. However, nailing down the specifics of how such events occurred and the plausibility of animals traveling between continents on rafts has been “vigorously debated,” researchers said, with other theories, such as land bridges, thought to be more likely.

The study was carried out by biologists at the University of San Francisco, the University of California at Berkeley and Villanova University in Pennsylvania, as well as experts from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Fijian nongovernmental organization NatureFiji-MareqetiViti. The team used a phylogenomics dataset, which helps construct an evolutionary history of a species, to compare lineages of 14 types of iguana, as well as fossil data and geologic records, to determine the time frame of the iguanas' arrival.

The notion of iguanas traveling on rafts has precedent. They are believed to have traveled about 600 miles from Central America to establish a home in the Galápagos Islands, and have traveled around the Caribbean. In 1995, at least 15 green iguanas on a vegetation mat thought to have come from Guadeloupe were seen making landfall on Anguilla, about 170 miles away — resulting in the successful hybridization of a local species of iguana, researchers said.

However, while there are more than 2,100 species in the Iguania group that also includes chameleons, anoles, bearded dragons and horned lizards, these are mostly concentrated in North, Central and South America. The Fiji iguanas are regarded as an “enigmatic” outlier, and their origin had not been tested, the research team said. It has been previously thought the two types of iguana found on Fiji — Brachylophus and Lapitiguana iguanas, the latter of which is now extinct — had come either in a “single rafting event” across the Pacific or via “stepping stone dispersal” across paleocontinent Gondwanaland, yet strong support for either theory was lacking.

“Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America,” the researchers said. While the team could not entirely rule out that the Brachylophus iguana arrived in Fiji via island-hopping, it said a route from coastal Mexico to the South Pacific “is plausible” based on floating debris and ocean currents at the time.

“That they reached Fiji directly from North America seems crazy,” said co-author Jimmy McGuire, a UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology. “But alternative models involving colonization from adjacent land areas don't really work for the time frame, since we know that they arrived in Fiji within the last 34 million years or so. This suggests that as soon as land appeared where Fiji now resides, these iguanas may have colonized it. Regardless of the actual timing of dispersal, the event itself was spectacular.”

Iguanas are the ideal candidate for such a voyage as they are herbivores and can go months without food, according to the authors. They may also have been able to snack on the “floating vegetation mats” along the way. The Fijian iguanas were closely related to those found in the North American desert, which are used to searing heat, researchers said.

“Iguanas and desert iguanas in particular are resistant to starvation and dehydration, so my thought process is, if there had to be any group of vertebrate or any group of lizard that really could make an 8,000-kilometer journey across the Pacific on a mass of vegetation, a desert iguana-like ancestor would be the one,” Scarpetta said in the news release.

Denisse Dalgo, a PhD candidate researching the evolutionary biology of marine iguanas at the University of Leipzig, was not involved in the research but said the findings are “truly remarkable” given the distance and prove just how tough iguanas can be. “Their strong swimming ability allows them to stay afloat despite strong currents, while their high stress tolerance helps them survive extreme conditions. They can withstand prolonged periods of starvation by lowering their metabolism, and some — such as the Galápagos marine iguanas — can even shrink their bodies temporarily to conserve energy,” she said.

Dalgo said further research into how iguanas change their diet and behavior to adapt to a new environment could help provide even deeper insight into island biogeography and evolution.

Israel launched new strikes against Hamas early on Tuesday and promised ‘increasing military force' after talks on on further hostage releases stalled.

Drones whined overhead and explosions rattled the night as Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Tuesday's airstrikes in Gaza are “only the beginning” and that all ceasefire negotiations will take place “under fire.”



In a recorded statement broadcast on national television, Netanyahu said Israel would press ahead until it realizes all of its war goals -- destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.

“The previous releases proved that military pressure is a necessary condition for freeing hostages,” he said.



THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.



DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing more than 400 Palestinians, local health officials said, and shattering a ceasefire in place since January with its deadliest bombardment in a 17-month war with Hamas.



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes, which killed mostly women and children, after Hamas refused Israeli demands to change the ceasefire agreement. Officials said the operation was open-ended and expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions.






The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians.



“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Netanyahu's office said.



The attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.



The renewal of the campaign against Hamas, which receives support from Iran, came as the U.S. and Israel stepped up attacks this week across the region. The U.S. launched deadly strikes against Iran-allied rebels in Yemen, while Israel has targeted Iran-backed militants in Lebanon and Syria.



A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu's decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.



Hamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday's strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas' civilian government, its justice minister and two security agency chiefs. There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.



But Yemen's Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel's southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country's territory, the military said.



The strikes came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial  was canceled after the strikes. 



The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.

The main group representing families of the hostages accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire. “We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.







Strikes across Gaza pounded homes, sparked fires in a tent camp outside the southern city of Khan Younis and hit at least one school-turned-shelter.



After two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.



“Nobody wants to fight,” Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months.”



A hit on a home in Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.



At Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group. 



She said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and “we don't know if her family survived,” Haj-Hassan said.



Gaza's Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry's records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.



The war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.



The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.

The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”



The ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.



An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.



The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.







Under the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.



But Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives. 



Instead, Israel demanded Hamas release half of the remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.

The deal had largely held, though Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas. Egypt, Qatar and  the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps.



Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas' governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible.



A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza. 



It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.



Released hostages have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining captives. Tens of thousands of Israelis have joined protests calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who were stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months, are set to return to Earth and splash down off the coast of the American state of Florida early on Wednesday.

According to NASA, Williams and Wilmore undocked from the ISS at 10:35 am IST Tuesday and set on a 17-hour trip back to Earth. The spacecraft, Elon Musk-led SpaceX's Dragon, will splash down at around 3:27 am IST Wednesday.

The two astronauts flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight. The spaceship, however, developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back and later returned empty.

In a post on X, NASA said: "#Crew9 will be difficult to spot in the daytime as it reenters Earth's atmosphere, but if you want to keep an eye out for @SpaceX's Dragon as it heads home today, we have the map for you."

Eight years before the Boeing Starliner suffered glitches, ensuring an extended stay on the International Space Station for nine months, NDTV had spoken to Sunita Williams and asked whether she thought flying on a privately built spacecraft could be risky. The Indian-origin astronaut, who had already begun collaborating with Boeing at the time, had said that while there were bumps and even a few heated discussions, she was confident that the spacecraft would be safe when people flew in it.

Speaking exclusively to NDTV during a visit to India in 2016, Ms Williams also spoke about being the first astronaut to have samosas on the International Space Station (ISS) and how she intended to carry an idol of Lord Ganesh, whom she called her "good-luck charm", on her next spaceflight.

Union Minister Jitendra Singh has called NASA astronaut Sunita Williams a "daughter of India", as the world awaits her return along with Butch Wilmore, both of whom have spent nearly nine months on the International Space Station.

Singh said the country is "proud" of her and praying for her safe return.

"...She (Sunita Williams), being a daughter of India, has made the entire world proud...She has successfully accomplished the task that she was assigned to. While all of us pray for a safe return, we also feel proud of her...A very pleasant coincidence is the fact that today itself, Prime Minister Modi made a statement on Maha Kumbh in the Parliament and incidentally, Sunita also expressed her best wishes for the Kumbh...," Singh told ANI.

The minister also referred to Sunita Williams' Indian roots in Gujarat and highlighted that Indian space scientists are making waves internationally.

"There is a very deep connection between her and India and of course Gujarat, the state that she belongs to. This is also an indication of the fact that most of the space agencies outside India, including NASA, are now having Indian boys and girls leading most of their important missions...," he said.



Kalpana Chawla, who would have turned 62 this year, was the first Indian woman to go to space.

Born in Karnal, Haryana, on March 17, 1962, Ms Chawla was fascinated by aeroplanes and space from a young age. Encouraged by her family, she pursued her passion by earning a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College. She then moved to the United States, obtaining a Master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas in 1984, followed by a PhD in the same subject from the University of Colorado in 1988.

Her academic excellence and determination took her to NASA in 1994. By 1997, she had achieved what no other Indian woman had before - she became an astronaut.

Kalpana Chawla went on two space missions that cemented her place in history.

Her first mission, STS-87 in 1997, was aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, where she served as a mission specialist and robotic arm operator. This journey made her the first woman of Indian origin in space. 

Captain Sunita Williams, the Indian-origin American astronaut is getting ready for her next space mission, but this time, on a commercial space flight.

Ms Williams, a NASA veteran and a world record holding woman astronaut with seven space walks, says India is never far away from her heart, on earth or in space. She has been touring India trying to convince ISRO to partner with NASA on its human journey to Mars.

She prides on probably being the world's only samosa eating astronaut and has also been holding classes for Indian students. In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Ms Willaims explains why she would like more Indian stuff in her space bunker.

"I love samosas and I had asked for some special things, this being one of them. My family was able to work with NASA to get clear packaging and they put samosas in there and it was a nice surprise," Ms Williams said.

Residents of Sunita Williams' ancestral village in Gujarat's Mehsana district are gearing up for Diwali-like festivities to celebrate her scheduled return to Earth.

Jhulasan village, known as the ancestral home of Williams' father, Deepak Pandya, is alive with excitement. Villagers have been praying for her safety, with many offering special prayers and lighting an Akhand Jyot (eternal flame) at the local temple of Goddess Dola Mata.

According to Williams' cousin, Navin Pandya, a grand procession will be held in her honour, accompanied by prayer chanting and fireworks to create a festive atmosphere similar to Diwali and Holi.

The villagers are keen to invite her to her paternal village in future.

"The atmosphere here is festive, with everyone eagerly anticipating her return. We will definitely invite her to visit Jhulasan in the future. It would be an honour to have her among us in her ancestral village," Pandya said.

Here are some of the experiments Crew 9 performed during their 9-month stay in space:

Micro-Algae For Generating Oxygen

Nick Hague worked on growing Arthrospira micro-algae on the ISS to help convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. These tiny algae perform photosynthesis, just like plants on Earth, helping keep the safe-to-breathe oxygen inside the spacecraft. It can also be treated as food when fresh food is not available during long-duration space missions. This experiment was led by the European Space Agency (ESA).

Improving Astronauts' Health

Butch Wilmore installed the compact workout machine called European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D) on ISS for testing. The modular device combines cycling, rowing, and resistance exercises to help astronauts stay fit during long space missions. Other than this, it is also designed to prevent bone and muscle loss and improve heart health on future missions.

Red Romaine Lettuce

As part of the Plant Habitat-07 experiment, astronauts on the ISS grew red romaine lettuce in the Advanced Plant Habitat. The study is about how different moisture levels affect the microbial communities in plants and water. The purpose of the study is to understand how less-than-ideal conditions affect plant growth. The findings will help scientists create more effective farming systems that would produce nutritious food for astronauts on upcoming space flights. Click here to read more.

As Sunita Williams is set to return home after nine months on the International Space Station, Dinesh Rawal, Sunita Williams cousin brother in Gujarat, expressed happiness and said she is the pride of the nation.

"Everyone in the family, including her mother, brother and sister, is happy that she is coming back home. Our entire family is delighted and eagerly awaits her return... We have started offering prayers and visited many temples for her safety... It is a huge day for us... She is the pride of the nation... We are doing a 'Yagna' for her return and will distribute sweets upon her return," Rawal told ANI.

According to retired NASA astronaut Cady Coleman, there is no special overtime salary for astronauts. Since they are federal employees, their time in space is treated just like any regular work trip on Earth. They continue to earn their regular pay, with NASA covering their food and living expenses on the ISS.

The only additional compensation they receive is a small daily stipend for incidentals - reportedly just $4 (Rs 347) per day, Ms Coleman told Washingtonian.

For reference, during her 159-day mission in 2010-11, Ms Coleman received a total of around $636 (over Rs 55,000) in extra pay. Using the same calculation, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore - after spending over 287 days in space - will likely receive just $1,148 (approximately Rs 1 lakh) each in additional compensation.NASA has maintained that the astronauts are not technically "stranded", as they have been actively working on the ISS.NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are classified under the GS-15 pay grade, the highest level for federal employees under the General Schedule (GS) system. GS-15 government employees receive an annual base salary ranging between $125,133 - $162,672 (approximately Rs 1.08 crore - Rs 1.41 crore).

For their extended 9-month stay on the ISS, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore will earn a prorated salary between $93,850 - $122,004 (approximately Rs 81 lakh - Rs 1.05 crore). 

Including the $1,148 (around Rs 1 lakh) in incidental pay, their total earnings for the mission is expected to be $94,998 - $123,152 (approximately Rs 82 lakh - Rs 1.06 crore).

Superior numbers and attacks on supply lines slowly choked off the Ukrainian forces holding the town of Sudzha and forced their retreat.

KYIV — A fresh supply of North Korean troops, command of the air and a crushing superiority in numbers helped Russia last week retake the town of Sudzha, Ukraine's last stronghold in western Russia, according to interviews with Ukrainian soldiers and officials familiar with the battles of the last few weeks.

Russia's heavy use of North Korean troops and equipment to retake nearly all of the Kursk region after seven months of Ukrainian control demonstrated the Kremlin's desire to reclaim the land at any cost and prevent Kyiv from forcing a territorial exchange as part of future negotiations. Russia occupies around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.

By Monday, Ukrainian troops had almost entirely withdrawn from Kursk, said a soldier familiar with drone operations in the region — who like the others interviewed for this story wasn't authorized to speak publicly — describing the parts of Kursk still under Ukrainian control as “a tiny patch, practically nothing. Just some border zones.”

On a map from Deep State, a Ukrainian volunteer project that tracks changes on the front line, Ukrainian troops are now shown occupying about 10 percent of the more than 500 square miles that they once held.

“Without North Korean troops, Russia cannot even hold onto its own territories with its own army,” said Ruslan Mykula, the co-founder of Deep State. “These were massive waves of reinforcements, much larger than our group. And the harsh reality is, we simply didn't have enough ammunition and drones to eliminate them all.”

Though a combination of factors ultimately hastened Ukraine's retreat‚ including the loss of supply routes and control of the airspace, the reappearance of North Korean troops — who had withdrawn from the battlefield in January to regroup amid heavy losses — had a “painful effect,” said a lawmaker connected to the Ukrainian military and Korean affairs.

“We are talking about well-trained and well-motivated soldiers in one particular place,” said the lawmaker, who isn't authorized to speak publicly about the matter. “I cannot say that the Kursk current situation happened because of North Koreans, but the effect of their participation is quite substantial.”

Moscow and Pyongyang have both denied the deployment of troops from North Korea to the battlefield, despite evidence indicating otherwise, including Ukraine's capture of two soldiers who are now in detention in Kyiv. Last week, a spokesman for the Ukrainian army, Dmytro Likhovy, said that North Korean troops were “one of the main attacking forces of Russian troops in Kursk” and were operating with greater effectiveness than they had over the winter, when they incurred heavy losses.

The return of foreign troops to the front lines in Russia comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to argue against the deployment of foreign peacekeepers to Ukraine, describing it as a threat to Russia.

While the arrival of North Korean troops last fall prompted the United States to allow Ukraine the use of guided missile systems known as ATACMS, their reappearance has not prompted any new action among Ukraine's allies.

Military analysts said that Ukraine losing its foothold in Kursk resulted in a retreat that at times bordered on chaotic — but which was better organized than previous withdrawals, such as from Avdiivka last year.

“Kursk was always going to be difficult to hold,” said Michael Kofman, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It was simply a matter of time before Russia could take back the salient.”

The beginning of the end came when Ukraine lost the sky.

As December tipped into January, Russian drones peppered the skies above Kursk — piercing the calm that Vitalii Ovcharenko had previously experienced that fall on the front line. Ovcharenko, who had arrived with his unit in August, said that on New Year's Eve drones swarmed six Ukrainian military vehicles as they entered Sudzha, quickly destroying them.

The Russians “moved not just troops but their best UAV operators to this part of the front line,” he said. “We did not have enough artillery shells or missiles to hit their rear.”

Entering and leaving the region became more challenging — even at night — as massive numbers of Russian troops began flanking the rear of Ukraine's operation, further narrowing their territory and attempting to sever Ukrainian supply routes into Sudzha, cutting off the delivery of ammunition and reinforcements and the evacuation of the dead and wounded.

“Russia controlled Ukrainian logistic lines going into Kursk,” said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan defense consultancy. “So for the past couple of months, Russians were able to … [make] it incredibly difficult for Ukrainians to sustain their presence in the region.”

The soldier — familiar with drone operations in the Kursk region — described how Russian troops had “superiority in manpower and weaponry,” relying on powerful glide bombs and unjammable fiber-optic drones to disrupt logistics. But they never managed to completely encircle Ukrainian troops, as President Donald Trump falsely claimed in a post on TruthSocial last week, echoing claims made by Putin, according to battlefield maps and military analysts.

“We held on for as long as we could,” the soldier said, describing escape routes that fell under heavy fire. “Once the left flank started collapsing, all efforts should have been focused on holding it. … It's just heartbreaking to see so much effort wasted, so many lives lost, and now we're losing ground again.”

Once logistics were cut off, “it became clear that an army without supplies would suffocate. And that's exactly what happened,” Mykula of Deep State said. “Ukraine didn't lose the battle on the battlefield. Our forces weren't driven out. They were simply put in a position where remaining in that salient, with that number of troops and those conditions, became impossible.”

Then, early last month, the North Koreans returned.

While they'd initially operated as simple rifle units, these new brigades included the 91st and 92nd Special Forces and now had their own command structures and attack plans sharpened by previous missions.

Operating in small groups on either flank, they joined elite Russian forces and outnumbered the Ukrainians by a ratio of about 2 to 1 — helping seize the key stronghold of Sverdlikovo near Ukraine's main logistics routes.

“We've found their maps: hand-drawn, extremely detailed,” said Artem, a soldier in Sumy who is familiar with the Kursk operation. “Every movement was written down by hand, perfectly marked. Nobody does that anymore. It felt like something from a bygone era — like a Soviet-style, ultra-structured military approach. Each line was meticulously drawn, as if by someone who had spent their entire life training for this.”

The North Korean soldiers were well equipped with gear that made it difficult to spot them with night-vision goggles, said Oleksandr, 40, an officer who has overseen intelligence operations in the Kursk region since August.

They “made a difference,” he said. “Russians have strong and good allies. They came just in time. … Our infantry is not as fast as it was at the beginning of the war. … Both of our armies are tired.”

Now on the retreat, Oleksandr says he feels only relief.

While some have questioned whether the Kursk operation was worth it, at a meeting with journalists last week President Volodymyr Zelensky said that it had “fulfilled its task” by diverting Russian troops from other fronts, including Pokrovsk and Kharkiv. Still, he admitted that conditions in the region were “very difficult.”

The nearly complete Russian operation in Kursk comes at a very symbolic moment — just ahead of the 80th anniversary of Russia's Victory Day, marking the Soviet Union's triumph over Nazi Germany, celebrated on May 9.

A Ukrainian official expected a “major concentration of Russia's efforts” to finish the operation before the big day, which will see world leaders such as China's Xi Jinping and India's Narendra Modi attending the celebrations in Moscow. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov went as far as to invite North Korean troops to participate in the May 9 parade.

As Russian troops approach the Ukrainian border of its Sumy region, what happens next “will depend on how Russian leadership sets its priorities,” said Mykula of Deep State.

“They will have to choose: Either they focus on establishing a buffer zone, securing some kind of political victory, or they reinforce their existing offensive axes to increase the territory they control and use that as leverage in negotiations,” he said.

Though he didn't know what would happen next, Oleksandr said, Sumy had been well fortified with trenches and infantry. Plus, he added: “All the experienced guys in Kursk will be waiting for them on Ukrainian soil.”

Berlin checking if US immigration policy has changed after Fabian Schmidt becomes third German to be detained

Berlin is investigating whether US immigration policy has changed, after a German national who is a permanent US resident was detained and “violently interrogated” by US border officials.

Fabian Schmidt, 34, is being held at a detention centre in Rhode Island after attempting to return to his home in New Hampshire after a trip to Luxembourg.

His mother, Astrid Senior, told the Boston-headquartered public broadcaster WGBH news that her son had been “violently interrogated” at Boston's Logan airport for hours, stripped naked and put in a cold shower by two officials.

A German government spokesperson told Euronews it was aware of the case and those of two other German citizens who were detained when attempting to enter the US and who have subsequently returned to Germany.

“We have recently become aware of three cases in which German citizens were unable to enter the USA and were detained for deportation when they entered the country,” the spokesperson, Sebastian Fischer, said.

Two of the three cases had been resolved, Fischer said, adding that the German government was “monitoring the situation” and liaising with other EU countries to assess if these were isolated cases or representative of “a change in American immigration policy”.

Senior told the US broadcaster that immigration agents had put pressure on her son to give up his green card. He had been placed on a mat in a bright room at the airport with little food or water, and denied access to his medication for anxiety and depression.

Schmidt, an electrical engineer, had been returning to the US on 7 March. His mother did not hear from him until 11 March, when he was transferred to hospital after collapsing.

She told NBC news she had no idea why her son had been detained, saying: “I feel helpless, absolutely helpless.”

Schmidt and his mother moved to the US from Germany in 2007 and got permanent resident cards the following year. He renewed his legal permanent residence status last year and has no active legal issues, his mother said, although she added that he had faced misdemeanour charges about 10 years ago.

The US Customs and Border Protection service told US media the claims about his case were “blatantly false”, without saying which points it disputed. The Guardian has contacted the service for comment.

The German foreign ministry said its consulate in Boston was providing support.

“It is clear that we expect from our partners, as well as from all other countries in the world, that prison conditions comply with international human rights standards and that detainees are treated accordingly,” Fischer said.

The case is the latest of a foreign-born national being detained and allegedly held in brutal conditions by US border agents, after Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.

The two other German nationals affected were Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Berlin, and Lucas Sielaff, 25, from Saxony-Anhalt. Both had valid tourist visas for the US and have now returned to Germany.

According to Sielaff's fiancee, Lennon Tyler, he was detained for two weeks after incorrectly answering a question about where he lived owing to his poor grasp of English. Sielaff had said Las Vegas, where he was staying with Tyler, when he should have said Germany, where he permanently resides, she said.

Brösche – who was travelling with tattoo equipment – was detained for more than six weeks, including nine days in solitary confinement, her friends said – a claim the company that owns the detention centre denies.

Meanwhile, a Canadian actor said she was detained for nearly two weeks in “inhuman conditions” over an incomplete visa, after attempting to cross the border at Mexico-Arizona. Jasmine Mooney was held in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that were never turned off, with no blankets and limited bathroom facilities, her mother said.

And a British woman was detained in “horrendous conditions” for three weeks, her family said, after a visa mix-up.

Rebecca Burke is now reportedly home in the UK. She was arrested by US border officials after attempting to cross into Canada and being sent back to the US.

She had been planning to stay with a host family in Canada, where she would carry out domestic chores in exchange for accommodation, but was told by the Canadians she should have applied for a working visa instead of a tourist visa.

Burke had previously stayed with a host family in Portland, Oregon under a similar arrangement after spending time sightseeing in New York City, where she arrived from the UK at the start of the year.

Human rights organizations say the message presented by videos posted by Bukele is clear: This is what awaits those deported from the United States to El Salvador.

The video, posted on social media by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Sunday, is tightly edited and set to dramatic music. It begins with drone footage of three planes on the tarmac, surrounded by rows of soldiers and police in riot gear.

One by one, the men emerge, their heads pushed down, their wrists and ankles shackled. Officers grip their arms and force them into buses which transport them to Bukele's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. An ominous electronic beat plays in the background. Two guards grip each detainee, rushing them into prison cells, dressed in white uniforms.

The message, human rights organizations say, is clear: This is what awaits those deported from the United States to El Salvador.

The video has been viewed more than 21 million times on Bukele's X account in less than 48 hours, drawing attention to the harsh treatment of prisoners in El Salvador.

Bukele describes the migrants as “the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua,” and “23 MS-13 members wanted by Salvadoran justice, including two ringleaders.” He said the members of Tren de Aragua would be sent to CECOT for a year, but that the contract with the United States is renewable.

President Donald Trump's administration paid Bukele's government approximately $6 million for detaining the alleged gang members, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.

Human rights experts say Bukele shared the video to reinforce his strongman image and promote his prison system as a model for combating crime globally. But the footage itself, they argue, shows clear signs of human rights violations.

“We don't know how many of these men have been charged or convicted with crimes, if they have access to a lawyer, or if they have been or will be presented in front of a judge,” said Ana Maria Mendez Dardon, the director for Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America.

It was troubling, she added, that the video prominently displayed the migrants' faces without confirmation of their criminal record.

The Trump administration faces accusations of defying a federal judge's order to stop deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows migrants to be expelled without a hearing.

For Noah Bullock, the executive director of the Central American human rights organization Cristosal, the video was “reminiscent of penal colonies from the long ago time of empires where people were sent away as a way to suspend their rights and permanently remove them from society.”

Little is known about the inmates held at CECOT, an isolated mega prison in the town of Tecoluca. At least 60,000 alleged gang members were arrested in El Salvador during CECOT's rapid construction, the AP reported. Since prisoners are typically held incommunicado, it's hard to confirm how many have a connection to gangs, human rights experts said.

El Salvador, though, also opened its prisons to social media influencers and travel content creators. One YouTube video has over 71 million views; another has 55 million views.

Influencers are how “the regime propagates its propaganda,” Bullock said, adding that “They activate and pay a swarm of social media mercenaries to reproduce the image of themselves that they want to sell.”

Apart from the now familiar images of half-naked prisoners forced to sit in tightly packed rows, Bukele also has a second brand of prison videos. These videos portray his prison system as self-sustaining as the prisoners are shown to be growing their own food, building furniture and fixing vehicles.

Other experts said that Bukele's sophistication and savviness with social media is not just limited to security issues, but they are most often used to show his no tolerance policy on crime.

Many of the images featured in the videos are recurring, said Sonja Wolf, a professor of political science at Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE) in Mexico.

“The shaving of the head, removal of clothes, the gathering of a large amount of security guards around one prisoner are all images we have seen before,” said Wolf. “These are denigrating practices and dehumanizing practices that he uses to show the power of the state.”

Bukele also uses social media to defend his use of mass incarcerations. “Put them all in jail so they can't kill anymore,” he said in an X post in February 2024 while explaining how he made El Salvador the “safest country in the Western Hemisphere.”

Bukele, who won a second five-year term in 2024 by a landslide, has one of the highest approval ratings of any world leader, due in large part to his crackdown on gangs and cartels.

Bukele declared a state of emergency in 2022, followed by mass arrests of suspected gang members and the rapid construction of CECOT. In his time as president, Bukele has lowered the country's homicide rates, once the highest in the world, and has encouraged other Latin American countries to follow his lead.

But human rights experts, such as Bullock, are quick to point out that Bukele's prison system, especially CECOT, is “one of the most opaque prison systems in the hemisphere,” adding that “they only show images they want to share.”

According to the World Prison Brief, a United Kingdom-based database on prisons around the world, there are 25 prison facilities in El Salvador, with an official capacity of 67,289 inmates.

El Salvador's prison population has surged in the past 25 years, and even the rapid construction of CECOT hasn't been able to keep up with the level of imprisonment in the country. Inmates have increased from 7,754 in 2000 to 37,190 in 2020, to roughly 109,519 in 2024, according to the Brief. The prison occupancy rate is almost at 163 percent.

“There are prisons in the country where overcrowding is such that people have to take turns standing and sitting,” said Bullock. “Human rights organizations have documented systemic torture and lack of access to families and lawyers in these places.”

Mark Carney-led ruling party projected to form majority months after political wipeout seemed inevitable

In January, Canadian pollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects of Justin Trudeau's Liberal party, musing whether it would be a wipeout of existential proportions, or merely a catastrophic blowout.

But fresh polling released by three companies this week shows a stunning reversal of fortunes for the party: newly minted prime minister Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to secure a majority government.

The outcome has little precedent in Canadian history, reflecting the outsized role played by an unpredictable US president, and it underscores the incentives for Carney to call a snap election in the coming days.

On Tuesday, the political analyst Philippe Fournier updated his closely watched website 338Canada, which tracks and aggregates national polls, converting those figures into projected election results.

For the first time, his projection showed the Liberals with a 55% chance of a majority government. In January, the odds stood at less than 1%.

For the last two years, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has used a controversial carbon levy and Trudeau, a deeply unpopular outgoing prime minister, to propel his Tories to what promised to be one of the most lopsided political wins in recent memory. Pollsters predicted his party would seize a commanding majority of seats. For more than a year and a half, the Conservatives' win probabilities stood at more than 99%.

As recently as January, for example, the most sympathetic polling firm had Trudeau's party trailing the Conservatives by 20 points. Others had the gap as high as 27 points.

But Justin Trudeau's resignation days later, and Donald Trump's threats to take over Canada, changed everything.

In a recent column for the Walrus magazine on the “stunning Conservative collapse”, Fournier warned the Tories, whose odds of winning stood at 15%, were “suddenly at risk of blowing one of the largest polling leads in modern Canadian history”.

Virtually all Canadian polling companies have shown a sharp trend towards the Liberals, at the expense of the Conservative party and the leftwing New Democratic party. If current polling predictions are reflected in the results of the upcoming federal election, the NDP would collapse and lose party status in the House of Commons.

“This shift would be among the biggest we've seen in such a short period of time in Canadian history,” said Éric Grenier, a political analyst at the Writ. Unlike other notable shifts in public sentiment, he says, the result is heavily skewed by threats from Donald Trump.

“It isn't just a question of a leadership honeymoon … But that adds a level of volatility to the public opinion environment that makes things unpredictable.”

For Poilievre, who had harnessed a populist current in the country and drawn comparisons with Trump, the avenues forward are less clear after losing the easy political targets of Trudeau and the carbon tax.

While the Conservative leader's combative politics have served him well as opposition leader, that same strategy appear to be faltering as nationalism supplants partisanship.

Poilievre this week held an event with an “Axe the Tax” sign – days after Carney had dismantled the consumer-facing carbon tax.

The political columnist Robyn Urback posted on social media that the Conservatives “are still waging the election campaign they never got to have”.

In more grim data points for the Tories, polling from the Angus Reid Institute released on Monday found Canadians preferred Carney over Poilievre on all questions relating to the ongoing trade war and the future of Canada's economy.

“More bluntly, 41% now view Carney as best suited to be prime minister compared to 29% for Poilievre,” the company said in its new release. “At least measurement, with Trudeau sitting in the PM chair, Poilievre led the Liberal leader by 19 points on this question.”

If the polling holds, “what was a tired, discardable brand just three months ago would be on its way to a fourth term, this time with a majority”.

The firm notes the profound effect Donald Trump has had on Canadian politics. After staring down a US-led trade war and giving impassioned speeches about the need to fight for Canada's independence, Trudeau left with the approval of 47% of Canadians – a 25-point jump compared with an all-time low of 22% just weeks before he announced his resignation.

What happens when Israel's political priorities clash with those of Jewish communities abroad? The backlash over the International Conference on Combating Antisemitism is a case study of this growing divide. While Israel is focused on securing international allies – sometimes from unexpected corners – many Jewish leaders, particularly in Europe, remain deeply uncomfortable with the inclusion of far Right politicians.The result? A controversy that has led to high-profile withdrawals and heated debates. Also, a stark reminder that the Jewish world is far from unified in its approach to combating antisemitism.  At the center of this divide is a growing divergence in priorities. Israel needs as much global support as possible, especially as antisemitism surges worldwide.This has led some Israeli officials to embrace leaders long considered off-limits by Jewish communities abroad, such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, an outspoken supporter of Israel who has yet to be deemed “kosher” in the eyes of many European Jews. Argentina's President Javier Milei is another far Right leader who has been warmly welcomed by Israel due to his strong pro-Israel stance.

(credit: HAIM ZACH/GPO)Jewish communities in Europe, however, see things differently. Many still associate far Right politicians with the specter of Holocaust denial, xenophobia, and antisemitism – even when some of these officials claim to have reformed.The former head of France's far Right National Rally Marine Le Pen, for instance, expelled her father from the party he founded and acknowledged its troubling past, yet remains deeply controversial among French Jews. However, following October 7, she and current National Rally leader Jordan Bardella personally participated in a Paris march against antisemitism, marking a significant shift in the far Right's stance on Jewish issues in France (BBC, November 12, 2023). Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron did not attend.The tension between Jews in Israel and Jews abroad has come to a head over the conference organized by Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. It has drawn criticism from Jewish leaders worldwide due to the inclusion of far Right European politicians such as Bardella and European Parliament members Marion Maréchal and Hermann Tertsch. The backlash has been swift, with UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein, British antisemitism adviser Lord John Mann, and French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy all withdrawing their participation.

During the period of the Talmud, there was constant friction between Eretz Yisrael sages and those in Babylon – the great Jewish center of learning in exile.The Jerusalem Talmud (Sanhedrin 3:5) records an exchange where Babylonian scholars send halachic questions to Israel's sages but then refuse to follow their rulings.“They (the Babylonians) send us questions, and we answer them, but they do not abide by our rulings.”This sounds familiar. Israel asks Diaspora Jews what they think about meeting with far Right political figures but doesn't listen to their answers. The Jewish state decides based on its own immediate needs, while Jewish communities abroad feel alienated or disregarded when they disagree.  The Talmud (Kiddushin 49b) goes even further, describing how Israelis mocked Babylonians as “foolish” for their different customs and way of thinking.“Those from Eretz Yisrael call the Babylonians ‘foolish Babylonians,' for they sit in darkness.”There was always a cultural and ideological gap between the Jews in the Land of Israel and those in the Diaspora. Back then, it was about Torah interpretation and halachic authority. Today, it's about who defines the Jewish political agenda – and with whom Israel should engage to ensure its survival.Why are far-right figures dominating the conference?Sources close to the Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Ministry told me on Monday that it had invited several leaders from left-wing political parties, as well as left-wing thought leaders, but few accepted the invitation. Now, with increasing pressure on Center and Center-Left figures to also withdraw, the conference lineup is overwhelmingly right-wing or Center-Right.At the same time, I have learned that members of far-right parties across Europe approached the ministry seeking to participate. According to Israeli officials, the ministry only allowed the participation of figures approved by the Israeli Foreign Ministry and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar. This means that these invitations were not random but aligned with Israel's broader foreign policy interests.The deeper problem is that antisemitism has become a political tool – used by both the Right and the Left to serve their own agendas. MK Gilad Kariv (Democrats), who has urged the government to rescind invitations to far-Right politicians, wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sa'ar that this move represents a “deviation from longstanding Israeli policy” and contradicts the positions of prominent Jewish organizations worldwide.“The invitation of these representatives is particularly jarring given that this concerns an international conference on combating antisemitism, which is supposed to be conducted under the auspices of the president of the state and the prime minister,” Kariv stated.However, while these objections are understandable, Israel faces a different political reality. Many of its traditional allies on the European Left have distanced themselves from the Jewish state, leaving Israel to seek support elsewhere. The question remains: If the Left refuses to stand with Israel, should Israel ignore the Right?Boycotts and cancellations do not advance dialogueThis situation reflects a broader trend in global politics – the rise of ideological purity tests that leave no room for dialogue. The idea that some voices must be completely excluded from conversation – rather than engaged critically – has led to polarization and political stagnation.Israel is in a difficult position. It cannot afford to ignore any potential allies, yet it must also respect the concerns of Jewish communities abroad. In Jewish tradition, debate and argument are core values – as seen in the beit midrash (study hall), where conflicting views are explored and challenged. It is unfortunate that, rather than fostering dialogue, many have resorted to boycotts and cancellations.If the country is to navigate this complex global landscape, it must find a way to engage with political leaders, including those from difficult pasts, without compromising its moral clarity.This is a delicate balancing act, and only time will tell whether Chikli's approach was the right one. But what is already clear is that the conference is off to a bad start – one that exposes the deep rifts between Israel and the Jewish world and does not contribute to healing them. 
            



The result? A controversy that has led to high-profile withdrawals and heated debates. Also, a stark reminder that the Jewish world is far from unified in its approach to combating antisemitism.  At the center of this divide is a growing divergence in priorities. Israel needs as much global support as possible, especially as antisemitism surges worldwide.This has led some Israeli officials to embrace leaders long considered off-limits by Jewish communities abroad, such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, an outspoken supporter of Israel who has yet to be deemed “kosher” in the eyes of many European Jews. Argentina's President Javier Milei is another far Right leader who has been warmly welcomed by Israel due to his strong pro-Israel stance.

The tension between Jews in Israel and Jews abroad has come to a head over the conference organized by Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. It has drawn criticism from Jewish leaders worldwide due to the inclusion of far Right European politicians such as Bardella and European Parliament members Marion Maréchal and Hermann Tertsch. The backlash has been swift, with UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein, British antisemitism adviser Lord John Mann, and French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy all withdrawing their participation.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken today for at least 90 minutes. Russia has agreed to a partial ceasefire on targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure as a result, for a period of 30 days. Follow the latest here.

Donald Trump has shared an update on his call with Vladimir Putin today. 

"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one," he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an end to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine," he added.

It appears the US president would need to get Ukraine to agree to the 30-day halt to energy infrastructure strikes. 

Trump also repeated claims that the war would have never started if he had been president when it began in 2022. 

"Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. 

"That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of humanity, get the job done!"

Away from the reaction to the Trump-Putin call, new photos today show the continuing destruction faced by Ukrainians.

These images show the aftermath of Russian drone strikes in two different parts of Ukraine. 

The first shows the damage to the AES Group private oil refinery after a shock drone attack yesterday in the Kharkiv region.

The AES Group confirmed the destruction of the facility in Merefa after about 20 drones were launched at it.

This picture, from the outskirts of Kyiv, shows the aftermath of another drone attack that saw debris land near a school.

We're getting some reaction through from Ukraine now.

Illia Ponomarenko, a prominent journalist, says the call outlines that the Kremlin is simply "dragging things out indefinitely".  

"The Kremlin is essentially sticking to its optimal strategy - dragging things out indefinitely, saying 'no' without actually saying 'no', drowning everything in meaningless demagogy," he says.

He claims Putin is "manipulating Trump" by "massaging his ego, tossing him silly trinkets like imaginary 'thousands of Ukrainian soldiers lives spared only thanks to Trump' and hockey games, all while continuing its full-scale war against Ukraine".

"And as long as Trump keeps indulging in his virtual 'victories' and tiptoeing around Putin, they have no reason to stop."

One detail that may have slipped through the cracks from the call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is that the US leader suggested that a hockey match between Russia and his country could take place. 

Donald Trump supported Vladimir Putin's idea to organise hockey matches in the US and Russia between Russian and American players playing in the NHL and KHL. 

Kremlin readout of the call

Russia has been banned from most international sports, including the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and more, since its illegal invasion of Ukraine. 

But Trump seems keen to restore relations with the Kremlin, and this is one step that is arguably more significant that it may seem on paper.

Our US correspondent James Matthews says: "The hockey match will speak to Trump.

"He likes to talk sport, he likes to sell sport - and Americans, many in this country, care more about ice hockey, frankly, than they do about a war they don't think affects them."

"It looks like an air and sea ceasefire," defence analyst Michael Clarke says, responding to the Kremlin and White House readouts of the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin call. 

Under the terms of what appears to be a kind of "limited ceasefire", airstrikes on energy infrastructure will halt, and military action in the Black Sea could cease later. 

Clarke notes it's not too dissimilar to a plan outlined by Volodymyr Zelenskyy not long ago - a staged deal that begins with a halt to air warfare. 

While that may signal that Trump could be listening to Kyiv, Clarke says the fact that Zelenskyy was not involved in today's talks speaks volumes.  

"There's an old saying in diplomatic circles: 'If you're not at the table, you're on the menu'," he says.

"And believe me Ukraine is on the menu."

By Mark Stone, US correspondent, in Washington DC

The outcome of this call will allow both sides to claim a win.

For President Trump, he can and will claim that he has secured a phased ceasefire - an air and sea ceasefire. 

He will claim, correctly, that he has moved the dial closer to peace (at least in the short term) in this long conflict. 

For President Putin, he has accepted a partial ceasefire - namely that energy and infrastructure facilities will not be targeted - but he can still continue his ground war along the frontline. 

He wants to do this because he believes he has the upper hand and can continue the battlefield conflict to push the frontline as far west as he can.

This is a war all about territory - and Russia wants to have control of as much land as possible before it signs any full ceasefire plan.

In our last post, we brought you the US readout of the call, so now we can bring you the Kremlin's.

Russia's summary of the call is wide-ranging - from prisoners, to suggestions of hockey games between the US and Russia.

The Kremlin response has come in the form of bullet points - here they are in full: 

We've just received a readout of the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin phone call. 

Here are the key lines: 

Ceasefire

"The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace," the readout says. 

On when/where negotiations will take place

"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.

"The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts."

On 'strategic' weapons - an apparent reference to nukes

"They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application."

On broader US-Russia ties

"The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. 

"This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved."

More from the Kremlin on that Putin-Trump call... 

Vladimir Putin has agreed to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Russian state media is reporting. 

They say that Putin has ordered the military to stop strikes on those targets for 30 days following talks with Donald Trump. 

As per our last post, we've been awaiting a statement from the Kremlin and the White House after Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's phone call.

We are now getting a few lines out of the Kremlin, cited by Russian state media. 

Moscow says that Putin and Trump expressed mutual interest in "normalising relations" between the US and Russia, while a prisoner swap between Moscow and Kyiv for 175 prisoners of war (on each side) was also agreed.

Moscow also agreed to hand over 23 gravely wounded Ukrainian soldiers.

US citizen girl deported with mixed-status family, who filed complaint over denied healthcare and poor conditions

A family that was recently removed from the United States to Mexico has filed a complaint seeking an investigation into what they describe as “serious abuses” they say they faced during their detention in the US prior to their removal.

The mixed-status family includes two undocumented parents and six children, five of whom are US citizens. On 4 February, five of the children, including four who are US citizens, and the two parents were removed from Texas and sent to Mexico after they were stopped at an immigration checkpoint.

One of the children, a 10-year-old girl, is recovering from brain cancer surgery, and the family says she has faced significant disruptions in her medical care since the family's removal.

The complaint, filed on Monday with the Department of Homeland Security's office for civil rights and civil liberties on behalf of the family by the Texas Civil Rights Project legal advocacy organization, alleges that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) committed “serious abuses” while the family was detained.

The complaint, first reported by NBC News, alleges that the 10-year-old girl was denied “urgent medical care”, the US citizen children were held in “deplorable conditions”, the family's due process rights were violated, and the family was subjected to “a course of abuse and humiliation” while in detention.

This comes as the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation efforts as part of its immigration crackdown. Tom Homan, Donald Trump's “border czar”, has previously stated that families with mixed immigration statuses “can be deported together”, leaving parents to decide whether they want to depart the country as a family, or leave their children in the US.

In this case, the parents opted to remain together with their children, rather than have their family be split up.

The Texas Civil Rights Project said that officials presented the parents with “an impossible choice” between either leaving their children in US government custody “and never see them again” or being deported together.

The complaint alleges that on the morning of 3 February 2025, the family was traveling from the Rio Grande valley to Houston to get emergency treatment at the Texas children's hospital for their daughter, as they had done several times before.

On the way there, the family passed through an immigration checkpoint, one that they had previously crossed several times without incident, the complaint states.

As they had done previous times, they presented officers with a letter from the hospital detailing their daughter's brain tumor treatment, the necessity of continuing her care at the Texas children's hospital, and a request that the parents be permitted to travel to oversee care for their daughter.

The parents also said that they showed officers the children's birth certificates, proving that they are US citizens, and a letter from their immigration attorney regarding their visa applications.

But this was insufficient. Instead of allowing them to proceed, the complaint states that the officers “detained the entire family” for over 24 hours and “eventually forced the entire family, including US citizens, to Mexico”, where the daughter “cannot receive appropriate treatment”.

The complaint adds that the family's 15-year-old son, who is also a US citizen, as well as their one child who is not a US citizen, both have a heart disorder known as long QT syndrome, which they claim was known to CBP's medical team.

“It was clear to CBP's medical team that they had custody of three children with complex medical needs, one of whom was complaining of urgent and serious symptoms, two of whom were US citizens,” the complaint reads.

And still, the family alleges that CBP didn't transfer any of the children, in particular the 10-year-old girl, to a hospital or medical care facility “to obtain pediatric medical review”.

“Instead of granting her that care, CBP forced a child who was still recovering from brain surgery to sleep in a hot, dirty, brightly lit cell,” the complaint alleges.

It also alleges that the children were inappropriately searched, including pat-downs of sensitive parts of their bodies, and that parents were denied adequate access to their attorney.

In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for CBP said that “the facts as reported are inaccurate.”

“When someone is given expedited removal orders and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences as outlined by the expedited removal process for individuals with removal orders,” the statement added. “For privacy reasons, we cannot comment on the specifics of this case.”

The Texas Civil Rights Project is urging homeland security's office for civil rights and civil liberties to “open an immediate investigation” and is also calling on the department to immediately grant humanitarian parole to the parents and the child who is not a US citizen so “that the family can be together” while the daughter receives the medical treatment she needs.

The complaint states that the family is currently in Mexico, fearing for their safety, and they cannot access the medical care they require.

The couple's oldest child, who is also a US citizen and was not traveling with the family on that day, currently remains in the US.

The complaint notes that the parents are “valued members of their community” in Texas, “dedicated members of their local church”, and people who “work hard” and have no criminal records.

The mother told NBC News that since the family was deported, the 10-year-old girl hasn't received the follow-up care she needs.

The girl still has swelling on her brain, the mother said, which is affecting her speech and mobility on one side.

Alphabet's acquisition of Israeli startup for $32bn follows rejection of takeover bid last summer

Google's owner, Alphabet, has agreed to buy the cybersecurity group Wiz for $32bn (£24.7bn), the biggest acquisition it has ever made.

The search company's purchase of the Israeli startup comes as Google attempts to catch its competitors Microsoft and Amazon in the competitive cloud services market.

Wiz, which offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks, turned down a $23bn takeover bid from Alphabet last summer.

The talks failed in part because Wiz and some of its investors were concerned about gaining clearance from regulators.

Alphabet has agreed to pay a $3.2bn fee if the deal fails to complete, as the takeover marks a test of the Trump administration's appetite to follow the former president Joe Biden's lead in taking on Big Tech.

US justice department officials are trying to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser to dismantle its monopoly over the search market.

Wiz, which has offices in New York and Israel and opened its European headquarters in London last year, was founded in 2020 by alumni of the Israeli intelligence corps' unit 8200. It has the backing of investors including the venture capital firms Sequoia, Thrive and Advent International.

Following the acquisition, Wiz will retain its brand and operate independently of Google, mirroring the way Microsoft operates LinkedIn, according to sources familiar with the deal.

Wiz will also continue to work with, and be available across, all major cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said: “Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds. Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers.”

When Wiz rejected Alphabet's $23bn offer, Assaf Rappaport, the startup's chief executive, said he was “flattered” by the offer but wanted to focus on growth with an eye to floating on the stock market instead.

“This is an exciting moment for our company, but an even more important one for customers and partners,” Rappaport said on Tuesday.

Dan Ives, an analyst at the US broker and investment manager Wedbush, said: “Wiz has become a household name for chief information officers as the Israeli cybersecurity player has a strong cloud cybersecurity platform and customer base that is going after a $1trn market opportunity.

“For Google this [will] be a shot across the bow at other big tech stalwarts, especially Microsoft and Amazon, making a major bet on the cybersecurity space to complement its cloud offering.”

Wiz has said its revenues are $750m annually. Wedbush estimated that Google could drive it to a $1bn-plus business over the coming years “given the company's massive installed base and go-to-market strategy globally”.

Alphabet's previous biggest deal was its $12.5bn acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012, which it sold two years later for $2.9bn.

Three years ago Alphabet paid $5.4bn to acquire the cybersecurity company Mandiant, to bolster its Google Cloud product. Other deals include paying $1.65bn for YouTube in 2006, and buying the UK AI startup DeepMind for about £400m in 2014.

Alphabet is keen to diversify its business away from its dependence on search-related advertising. The company hopes that Wiz will help it to increase its global market share of the cloud market from 12%, a distant third behind Microsoft Azure at 21% and Amazon Web Services, which has almost a third.

Ives said: “While this deal is expected to see further regulatory scrutiny across the board, we view this as a strategic move by Google to further bolster its cloud security offering and value proposition to enterprises as the company doubles down on its cloud and AI initiatives moving forward.”

Prominent Russian philosopher and political theorist Alexander Dugin has told CNN that he believes President Trump is closer ideologically to President Putin than to Washington's Western allies. The Russian scholar has often been referred to as "Putin's brain" or "Putin's philosopher" and is considered by many to be the ideological architect of the Kremlin chief's invasion of Ukraine. CNN's Fred Pleitgen spoke to him in Moscow.

Historic levels of spending on military and infrastructure secured in Bundestag with last-minute backing of Greens

Germany's parliament has voted in favour of unleashing historic levels of spending to boost the military of Europe's biggest economy and inject its infrastructure with investments worth hundreds of billions of euros.

Incoming conservative chancellor Friedrich Merz along with the Social Democrats (SPD), his likely coalition partners after last month's election, led the drive for the creation of a €500bn fund and relaxation of its constitutionally protected debt rules. The parties secured the last-minute backing of the Greens, which was needed to push the plans through the outgoing parliament.

The package received the backing on Tuesday of 513 MPs, with 207 voting against, and no abstentions. The minimum required was 489 votes. It has been hailed by some as a necessary measure to give Germany the fiscal heft it needs to ensure national and European security, but by others as a “highly risky bet” that will be a burden for generations to come.

Merz told MPs the package was mainly motivated by “Putin's war of aggression against Europe”, listing a range of suspected Russian sabotage “taking place every day” against Germany. He said these included attacks on critical infrastructure, arson attacks, spying and disinformation campaigns, as well as broader “attempts to divide and marginalise the European Union”.

Acknowledging that his funding plans were viewed with concern by many who feared the burden of debt, Merz said it was time to acknowledge the new era in which Germany found itself, not least having to be independent from the US.

“We understand the worries, we understand the criticism,” he said, but added: “We have, for at least a decade, felt a false sense of security.” Germany had now to face a “paradigm shift”, which Merz said required “us to rebuild our defence capabilities, in part from scratch”.

Markets rose on Tuesday even before the vote had taken place, in anticipation that the plans would boost growth across Germany and the wider eurozone. The euro reached its highest level in more than five months.

Investors have said the fiscal injection could help Europe's largest economy emerge from two consecutive years of negative growth. However, they have also warned the package needs to be accompanied by widespread reforms, including boosting productive capacity, reducing bureaucracy, encouraging Germans to work longer and tackling high energy bills, which are prompting companies to leave Germany. 

Having passed the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, the legislation will on Friday go to the Bundesrat, the upper house, which represents the governments of Germany's 16 federal states.

The conservatives and SPD believed they needed to act quickly to pass the legislation in the current parliament because it required changes to the constitution and therefore a majority of at least two-thirds of MPs to back it. In the new Bundestag, due to convene on 25 March, it would have been likely to face opposition from the far-right AfD and far-left Die Linke, who together have a “blocking minority”.

But the very fact that it was shoehorned through the outgoing parliament within a matter of days, sparked the ire of opposition parties.

Alice Weidel, co-leader of the anti-immigrant, Kremlin-friendly, Alternative für Deutschland, which had lodged a legal complaint with the country's highest court in the hope of stopping the legislation's passage through the existing parliament, struck a note of fury, calling the package “election fraud worse than anything I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany”.

Weidel, a former investment banker, predicted that Germany's resulting debt burden would cause a downgrading of its triple-A fiscal stability rating, which would send a ripple effect across the eurozone, adding that it would “blow up in the face” of young people and taxpayers who would face the consequences for years to come.

Britta Haßelmann, parliamentary co-leader of the Greens, who reluctantly backed the legislation after securing guarantees that €100bn (£84bn) of the funds destined for infrastructure would be allocated for climate and economic transformation investments, poured scorn on Merz for having “rejected every idea regarding reforming the ‘debt brake'” in the past, “with such arrogance and populism it made one sick”.

But, she said, her party recognised the necessity to free up funds at such a crucial time, and was therefore “glad we're making this decision”.

Robin Winkler, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, called the decision to reform the debt brake “a historic fiscal regime shift” comparing it to the transfers made over German reunification almost 35 years ago. But for it to be a success the next government, he urged, “will need to deliver structural reforms to turn this … into sustainable growth”. 

At the centre of the reforms is Germany's so-called debt brake, imposed under the government of Angela Merkel after the 2008 global financial crisis to ensure debt was controlled for future generations. The rules have long since been criticised by experts who say they are outdated and too rigid particularly in an era of fast-evolving geopolitical circumstances.

Merz faced fierce criticism before and during the four-hour debate. Opponents said he had voiced his strong commitment to the debt brake during the election campaign, only to have changed his mind within days of winning on 23 February. Merz has justified this by citing the “rapidly changing situation”, in particular, the clash between the US president, Donald Trump, and his Ukraine counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Central Ohio surgery centers are earning high marks in a U.S. News & World Report list that showcases the best ambulatory surgery centers in the nation.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers, or ASCs, for short, provide same-day surgical care for procedures including colonoscopies, hip or knee replacements.

U.S. News researchers evaluated the centers based how successfully surgery center teams avoided complications, ER visits and unplanned hospitalizations. This is the organization's second year in creating the list.

The facilities in central Ohio include:

“Our overarching goal is to help empower patients to make informed decisions about the care that they need, their own health care goals,” said Chelsea Wen, a senior health data analyst at U.S. News and World Report. “Part of that is giving them the information very granularly about how all of these surgery centers are doing, specifically on the procedure that they're interested in.”

Wen said there may be facilities on the website that are rated as average. However, that does not mean they have a negative review; it means that those ASCs met expectations and had no red flags in terms of safety or quality.

Jake Lang, charged with attacking police during riot and pardoned by Trump, seeks to fill seat Marco Rubio's old seat

A man accused of battling police with a baseball bat and shield during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol announced a run for the US Senate in Florida.

“WE ARE TAKING OVER THE CAPITOL AGAIN,” Jake Lang, a prominent January 6 defendant, wrote on X, announcing he is seeking the seat vacated by now secretary of state Marco Rubio in 2026.

Lang never stood trial for charges related to his role in the insurrection, seeking continual delays in his case until he was pardoned alongside about 1,600 others who participated in the Capitol attack when Donald Trump took office.

During his time in the DC jail, what he calls the “DC gulag”, Lang tried to organize a militia, which was initially called the North American Patriot and Liberty Militia, or Napalm. He created online fundraisers, collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars for January 6 defendants. He appeared in the media while in jail and since he was pardoned, talking about the Capitol charges and emerging as one of the most vocal members of the so-called J6 community.

Lang has not expressed regret for his actions on 6 January 2021 and has frequently referred to himself as a political prisoner. Photo and video footage of him on that day show him repeatedly fighting police and yelling things such as: “This is our house. We paid for this fucking building.” At one point in the riot, he wore a gas mask and beat police with a shield and bat, the justice department alleged, in an entrance to the Capitol that saw some of the most violence. He posted on social media afterward and wrote: “arrest me.”

Now he wants to go back to the Capitol as a US senator and he believes he can defeat the Republican who was appointed to the seat, former Florida attorney general Ashley Moody. He filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission in February.

“January 6 was a cry for change, and I am that change,” he said in his announcement video. “The tree of liberty is thirsty, America. We may have won the 2024 election, but the revolution has just begun. We're going back to the Capitol, and this time as your next elected officials and lawmakers.”

Lang did not respond to requests for comment. He previously told the Guardian he was “not ashamed” of his actions on January 6 and that he believes the day “ended up being the imagery that the American people and the world needed to see of a united America – Black, white, Asian, Spanish, gay, straight, Christian, Muslim – all standing united together against a tyrannical oppression, against a Marxist coup d'etat”.

On his campaign website, he notes that he will have a “100% TRUMP AMERICA AGENDA” and includes priorities such as mass deportation, sealing the border, “large tax cuts” and preventing a third world war.

Lang is from New York and previously told a local publication in his home town that he was considering a run for the US House in a district there. He also told the River Reporter that he hadn't voted for Trump until 2024, from inside the DC jail.

He told the Miami New Times he chose to run in Florida instead because, in his time there since being released from jail, he has found more acceptance. “They love the Jan Sixers,” he said. “As I've been going around these last 50 days here in Florida, making campaign videos and seeing business owners and friends of mine here and talking to strangers in the public, I've had dozens of people cry on my shoulder, come out and congratulate and hug and consider us to be patriot heroes and founding father-style leaders.”

Some Florida Republicans have said they don't see Lang as a serious contender. Jake Hoffman, the executive director of the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, told the Florida Phoenix: “Every cycle, both parties have insane candidates with a less than 0% chance of winning enter a race, but they do it anyway. This is one of those cases.”

Other J6ers have run for political office, but none successfully. Jacob Chansley, the rioter known as the “QAnon shaman” who dressed in horns and shirtless as he entered the Capitol, filed paperwork in 2023 for a congressional run as a libertarian. Ryan Zink talked about his January 6 charges during his unsuccessful run for Congress in Texas and called himself a “political prisoner”.

Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader who was convicted of seditious conspiracy related to the Capitol attack, also is reportedly considering a run for office in Florida. He told the Miami New Times in February that it was a “maybe thing” and that he's considering vying for the US House seat vacated by Matt Gaetz. “If I do run, I want to be in that building that they accused me of trying to storm,” he told the publication.

As NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are set to return to Earth on SpaceX's ‘Dragon' capsule, the belated journey brings back memories from three years ago, when a crew leaving the International Space Station had to use diapers due to a broken toilet on their capsule belonging to Elon Musk's company.

Four NASA astronauts had to spend 20 hours in the SpaceX capsule on their return journey, right from the time of undocking to that of their splashdown.

Megan McArthur, one of the four astronauts belonging to the American space agency, had back in 2021 described the situation as "suboptimal" but manageable, a report from The Associated Press had said.

She said that a spaceflight is full of little challenges, saying that the broken toilet was one such issue which the crew will take care of. "So we are not too worried about it," she had said.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will return home after having been stuck in space for more than nine months. They had travelled to the space station in June last year on Boeing Starliner's maiden crewed flight. Owing to helium leak and propulsion issues, the spacecraft was deemed unfit for the duo's return, turning their days-long stay into a months-long one.

NASA earlier on Tuesday shared an update on their return and said that the SpaceX Crew-9 mission had successfully undocked from the International Space Station, undertaking its return journey to Earth.

Back in November 2021, present along with NASA's Megan McArthur was French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who told reporters that the past six months had been intense. All the four astronauts had conducted a series of spacewalks to upgrade the space station's power grid and experienced thruster firings by docked Russian vehicles that even sent the ISS on brief spins.

They also hosted a private Russian film crew, which was a first for the space station.

Standing out in the list of issues was the toilet leak, with astronauts having to pull up panels in their capsule only to find pools of urine.

The issue was noticed first during SpaceX's private flight in September 2021, when a tube separated and spilled urine under the floorboards. Reportedly, the space company had fixed the toilet on the capsule which was awaiting lift off. But, they said that the toilet in orbit was unusable.

However, engineers had said that the toilet leak had not structurally compromised the capsule, deeming it safe for the astronauts' return journey. NASA had said that the crew was going to have to depend on absorbent "undergarments".

The SpaceX capsule, carrying NASA astronauts Megan McArthur, Shane Kimbrough, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, had been launched to the space station on April 23, 2021. Their capsule was certified for a maximum of 210 days in space.

Additionally, the crew had grown the first chilli peppers in space, which McArthur had described as a "nice moral boost" amid the slew of challenges. She had said that the peppers had a "nice spiciness to them, little bit of lingering burn".

(JTA) — The University of Amsterdam has suspended a student exchange with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, saying the institution has failed to distance itself from human rights violations in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.The Dutch university announced last week that it was cutting the program following advice from an internal committee on projects with its partners in Israel, China and Hungary. The school's executive board requested the inquiry after pro-Palestinian demonstrations roiled the campus last year.  The university also decided not to enter collaborations with more than 20 Hungarian institutions that have been sanctioned by the European Union because they are seen as too tightly controlled by the Hungarian regime. And it determined that Chinese doctoral students who go to the Netherlands through the China Scholarship Council will be allowed to continue, but the university said it would enact new measures to protect their academic freedom from China's government.The guidelines all aim to prevent the University of Amsterdam from “contributing to violations of human rights, misuse of knowledge for undesirable military purposes or serious damage to the environment through educational or research collaborations,” said the administration.

She reportedly resigned last year.

Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have begun a highly anticipated call as the US administration looks to persuade the Russian leader to sign-off on a 30-day ceasefire proposal as a possible pathway to end the war.

The call began at 1400 GMT and is going well, according to White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino. "The call is going well, and still in progress," Scavino wrote on X.

The conversation comes amid growing pressure for an end to the three-year conflict, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions, and left parts of Ukraine in ruins.

Trump is seeking to convince Putin to formally accept the 30-day truce, which Ukrainian officials agreed to last week during US-led talks in Saudi Arabia, spearheaded by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains skeptical of Putin's intentions, arguing that the Kremlin is stalling for time while continuing its bombardment.

Ahead of the call, Trump signaled that territorial control and key infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, would be part of the discussion. The fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe's largest — is believed to be central to the negotiations. The plant has been under Russian control since 2022, raising fears of a nuclear disaster.

"We're going to see if we can work out a ceasefire and, ultimately, peace," Trump told reporters on Monday. "I think we'll be able to do it."

While Putin expressed support last week for the US ceasefire proposal "in principle," he indicated that several conditions must be met before Russia agrees to halt its offensive. The Kremlin insists on maintaining control over the territories it has seized, including Crimea and large parts of eastern Ukraine.

In contrast, Zelensky has repeatedly asserted that Ukraine's sovereignty is non-negotiable. He warned on Monday that any deal allowing Russia to retain occupied land would be a "betrayal" of Ukraine's people.

"Now, almost a week later, it's clear to everyone in the world — even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years — that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war," Zelensky said in his nightly address.

Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and controls most of four eastern Ukrainian regions following its invasion in February 2022. It controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.

Putin said he sent troops into Ukraine because NATO's creeping expansion threatened Russia's security. He has demanded Ukraine drop its ambition of joining the Western military alliance.

Putin has also said Russia must keep control of Ukrainian territory it has seized, that Western sanctions should be eased and Kyiv must stage a presidential election. Zelenskiy, elected in 2019, rules under martial law he imposed because of the war.

Trump has moved the United States closer to Moscow since coming into office while alienating allies with tariffs and suggestions of annexing Canada and taking over Greenland.

        Attending a banned event will carry fines up to about €500, and authorities will be able to use facial recognition tools to identify attendees.
    

Hungary's parliament passed a law on Tuesday banning Pride events and allowing police to use facial recognition software to identify attendees, continuing a crackdown by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's right-wing populist party on the country's LBGTQ+ community.

The legislation, supported by Orbán's Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, passed in a 136-27 vote. It was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted only a day earlier.

It amends Hungary's law on assembly to make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate the country's contentious "child protection" legislation, which prohibits the "depiction or promotion" of homosexuality to anyone aged under 18.

Attending a banned event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (€503), which the state must forward to "child protection," according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify people attending a prohibited event, it says.

As the vote was being held, opposition lawmakers from the Momentum party ignited smoke bombs in the chamber, filling it with thick plumes of colourful smoke.

In a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organisers said the aim of the law was to "scapegoat" the LGBTQ+ community in order to silence voices critical of Orbán's government.

"This is not child protection, it is fascism," said Máté Hegedűs, press officer for the event. "Pride is a movement that cannot be banned."

The new legislation is the latest measure against LGBTQ+ individuals taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.

Hungary's government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilisation from what it calls "gender madness," and argues that its policies are designed to protect children from "sexual propaganda".

In a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban the Budapest Pride event, which attracts thousands and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement. 

Hadja Lahbib, the European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, said the decision to ban Budapest Pride was a "ban on fundamental rights".

"(The ban is) a trampling of freedom, dignity and human rights that should not be up for debate," she told Euronews. 

"Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fundamental European values that must be preserved and guaranteed for everyone, everywhere," Lahbib added. "We stand with the LGBTQ+ community in Hungary and beyond. Equality is not up for debate."

Amnesty International said the law was "a full-frontal attack" on the LGBTQ+ community.

"On the eve of the 30th anniversary of Budapest Pride in June, this harmful ban turns the clock back three decades, further undermining the hard-won rights of LGBTI people in Hungary," Dávid Vig, director of Amnesty International Hungary, said in a statement.

As ABC's “Nightline” hits its 45th anniversary this month, the show is bringing back an updated version of its old logo. Having gone with an all-lowercase “nightline” since 2017, a new take on the show's all-caps “NIGHTLINE” that had been in use between 1997 and 2017 will now be introduced. (That look itself was inspired by “Nightline's” original logo, which featured a city skyline embedded in its letters.) According to ABC News, the new logo “honors its iconic legacy, blending elements from its original look with an updated, modern design.”

The change happens as ABC News celebrates the “Nightline” 45th anniversary on March 24 (12:35 a.m. ET) with a special episode, featuring all-new interviews with original anchor Ted Koppel, as well as previous anchors Terry Moran, Dan Harris, Cynthia McFadden, Bill Weir and Dan Abrams. Current “Nightline” rotating anchors Juju Chang and Byron Pitts will anchor together on that episode in honor of the show's birthday. The episode will feature archival footage and recount “Nightline's” place in journalism.

The “Nightline” special is part of a day-long celebration at ABC News, where all of its programs and platforms plan to feature items about the show. That includes Chang and Pitts in-studio that morning on “Good Morning America,” followed by Chang on “The View” and Pitts on ABC News Live's “Prime with Linsey Davis.” The duo will also appear on “GMA3” and ABC News Audio's “Start Here” podcast, while “World News Tonight” and ABC News Digital will feature stories about the show's history.

“'Nightline' is an incredibly important part of ABC News' 70-year legacy, with a rich history of straightforward journalism that has become a hallmark of the show,” said ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic. “I was privileged to spend over a decade at ‘Nightline,' and am so proud of the team today, who continue to build on its exceptional reputation.”

“Nightline” actually had its start in November 1979 as “The Iran Crisis: America Held Hostage,” which looked at the hostage crisis in Iran. March 24 actually marks the 45th anniversary of when the show was relaunched as “Nightline” and broadened out to focus on other topics as well.

“'Nightline' is delivering some of the most compelling and in-depth journalism on television, tackling complex stories with nuance and integrity,” said ‘Nightline' exec producer Eman Varoqua. “As we move forward, we're focused on expanding our storytelling and reaching new audiences while staying true to the hard-hitting, thoughtful reporting that has defined the show for 45 years.”

        A spokesperson said the militant group had pulled out from Tuesday's peace talks in Angola in response to sanctions on several of its leaders.
    

The Rwanda-backed M23 rebels announced on Monday that they are withdrawing from peace talks with the Congolese government, citing international sanctions against their members as an obstacle to dialogue.

The talks, set to take place in Luanda, Angola, on Tuesday, “have become impracticable” following the EU's decision to impose sanctions on several M23 leaders, the group's spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement.

Additionally, ongoing military operations by the Congolese army in the conflict-hit region further undermine the possibility of peace discussions, Kanyuka claimed.

“Consequently, our organisation can no longer continue to participate in the discussions,” he added.

Despite previously rejecting direct negotiations, the Congolese government confirmed its participation in the peace talks. Delegations from both groups had arrived in Luanda for the talks, where Angola would serve as mediator. 

The conflict has resulted in one of the worst humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced. 

The EU imposed sanctions on five Rwandan nationals on Monday, including the commander of Rwandan special forces deployed in eastern DR Congo.

Additionally, the EU sanctioned four Congolese nationals, including M23's political leader Bertrand Bisimwa and three senior rebel commanders. 

Rwanda's Gasabo Gold Refinery was also blacklisted, with the EU accusing it of facilitating the “illegal extraction and trafficking of natural resources” from eastern DR Congo.

Gold and other strategic minerals from the region are key components in smartphones and computer production. Last year, the UN reported that M23 was generating an estimated $300,000 (€275,000) per month from its control of a mining area in eastern DR Congo.

Furthermore, amid rising international pressure, Rwanda severed diplomatic ties with Belgium on Monday, ordering all Belgian diplomats to leave the country.

The move comes a month after Brussels suspended development aid to Rwanda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused Belgium of attempting to destroy his country.

        Israel said it carried out the strikes after Hamas refused to release hostages held in Gaza and rejected a truce deal proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
    

More than 400 Palestinians were killed, including children and women, on Tuesday after Israel launched extensive airstrikes, Palestinian medics say. 

Early Tuesday morning, Israel's Prime Minister's office said it instructed the army to target Hamas across the Gaza Strip. 

The strikes were reported to have hit targets in northern Gaza, Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah. 

An Israeli statement said it carried out the strikes after Hamas refused to release hostages held in the Gaza Strip, and rejected a truce deal proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. Israel promised to use "increasing military force."

The scale of the horror is "unimaginable", according to one volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians based at Nasser Hospital. Dr. Tanya Haj Hassan said she had personally treated at least five patients who died in the emergency room.

“The ER was just chaos, patients everywhere, on the floor,” she said. “There were probably three men, and the rest were all children, women, and the elderly—everybody caught in their sleep, still wrapped in blankets. Terrifying.” 

The surprise attack broke a period of relative quiet during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and increased fears that the 17-month conflict, which has claimed tens of thousands of Palestinian lives and left Gaza in ruins, would resume in full.

When the Israeli planes struck, Palestinians at a school in Gaza City that was providing shelter to displaced families reported being forcibly shaken out of their sleep. 

More than two dozen people died, according to hospital officials.

“People are sleeping peacefully; they set the alarm to wake up for suhoor, and they wake up to death,” said Fedaa Heriz, a displaced woman, referring to the early morning meal during the fasting month of Ramadan.

“I heard screaming, my mother and sister screaming, calling for help. I came and entered the room and found the children under the rubble, under the stones,” said Majd Naser, a displaced Palestinian.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the school strike, which was part of a renewed offensive in Gaza.

The strikes come as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel remains in limbo. The first stage of the three-phase deal brokered by the US, Qatar, and Egypt started mid-January and ended on the first of March. 

Negotiations on the second phase have not yet been hammered out. 

Hamas condemned the latest raids and said it holds Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for the "unprovoked escalation" against Palestinians. 

"We hold the criminal Netanyahu fully responsible for the consequences of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, the defenceless civilians and our Palestinian people," the militant group said on Telegram.  

Hamas warned the strikes breached the ceasefire and put the fate of the hostages in jeopardy. 

"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to violate the ceasefire agreement and expose the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate," the statement said. 

Meanwhile, the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza said at least four of its senior officials, including two top police officers, were killed in the Israeli strikes.

They named the officials as Issam al-Daalis, head of the government administrative committee; Maj. Gen. Mohamed Abu Watfa, undersecretary of the Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Bahgat Abu Sultan, director of the domestic security agency and Ahmed al-Hetta, undersecretary of the Justice Ministry.

Earlier on Monday, Israel launched attacks towards Gaza, southern Lebanon, and southern Syria, killing at least ten people, according to local authorities. 

The airstrikes were the latest in what have been frequent and often deadly attacks by Israeli forces during the fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.

For the first time, the UK's foreign secretary, David Lammy, accused Israel of "breaching international law" during a House of Commons debate on Monday afternoon.His comments came before Israel began renewed strikes on targets in Gaza later on Monday night.  Lammy condemned Israel's halting of aid into the Strip - as a means of pressuring Hamas to return the remaining hostages - calling it "appalling and unacceptable" and adding that aid should never be used as a political tool.Responding to a question from MP Rupa Huq about the aid blockage during Ramadan, Lammy said, "This is a breach of international law." Advertisement"While Israel quite rightly must defend its own regional security," he said, "it has been 15 days since aid got into Gaza [which is] unacceptable, hugely alarming, and very worrying. We would urge Israel to get back to the amount of trucks from before so that Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support that they need at this time."Lammy addressed the room with details of the recent G7 meeting, in which members discussed conflict in Ukraine, Israel, the DRC, and others. He said the "G7 united in support for the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and unhindered humanitarian aid into Gaza."He also reiterated prior statements that Hamas can have no role in Gaza's future.

I still think that the UK's diplomatic voice counts in the world."Asked whether the UK holds the position that Israel has breached international law, McFadden responded, "We never want to see the denial of essential supplies like food or electricity or water to a civilian population."

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two NASA astronauts, are about to return to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS), where they have been living for nine months in a drawn-out mission fraught with technical challenges, schedule changes and politics.

Sunita Williams, 59, and Butch Wilmore, 62, had been stuck on the ISS after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a roughly week-long test mission.

The four-person crew, formally part of NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, is scheduled for a splashdown off Florida's coast later on Tuesday at 5:57 pm ET (Wednesday at 3:27am India time).

After Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore's landing on Earth, several key events would follow as part of her post-mission recovery and debriefing:

The absence of gravity has its effects on long-duration space travellers, who experience dizziness, nausea and an unstable gait when they return to Earth.

For Williams and Wilmore, test pilots for Boeing's new Starliner capsule, the eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months as a series of helium leaks and thruster failures deemed their spacecraft unsafe and had to return empty in September.

Astronauts who have travelled on space missions earlier have reported facing difficulty in walking, having bad eyesight, dizziness, and a condition called baby feet where space travellers lose the thick part of the skin on the soles that become soft like a baby's.

"Once the astronaut returns to Earth, they are immediately forced to readjust again, back to Earth's gravity, and can experience issues standing, stabilising their gaze, walking, and turning. For their safety, returning astronauts are often placed in a chair immediately upon return to Earth," news agency PTI reported, citing the Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine in a note on body changes in space.

It takes astronauts several weeks to re-calibrate themselves to life on Earth.

The vestibular organ deep inside the ear helps humans keep their bodies balanced while walking on Earth by sending information about gravity to the brain.

On Earth, gravity pulls blood and other body fluids into the lower part of the body, but for astronauts experiencing weightlessness in space, these fluids accumulate in the upper parts of the body, making them look bloated.

"Astronauts returning to earth often experience dizziness when standing up, known as orthostatic hypotension. This occurs because gravity on the earth is stronger than in space, and it is more difficult to deliver blood from the heart to the head," the JAXA said.

The lack of gravity causes significant and often irreparable bone density loss. According to NASA, for every month in space, astronauts' weight-bearing bones become roughly one per cent less dense if they don't take precautions to counter this loss.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announces changes to the welfare system aimed at saving £5bn by the end of 2030 - BBC Verify has taken a look at this number

Personal Independence Payments (Pip): Eligibility for the main disability benefit will be narrowed

Changes to Pip are likely to be the most politically controversial element of today's announcements, our political correspondent Henry Zeffman writes

Universal credit: The measure used to determine if someone is able to work will be scrapped in 2028 and will instead be assessed through Pip

Merging benefits: The government will consult on merging jobseeker's allowance and employment support allowance

"Right to try": People will have the right to try returning to work "without the fear this will put their benefits at risk", Kendall says

The Tories say the announcements are "too little, too late" while the Lib Dems say real cultural change is needed at the Department for Work and Pensions

We've spent today covering the announcement of plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed at cutting the growing amount the UK spends on welfare.

Here's a quick look at six key proposals we heard of today:

The Scottish government says Liz Kendall's announcements are “devastating for disabled people”.

Scotland's Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville tells BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime: “I know the announcement has been made, but I would strongly, strongly urge the UK government to reconsider.”

She says the reaction from disabled people shows the “strength of anger, real concern and desperate worry” put on some of the most vulnerable in our society.

“That surely can't be what a Labour government are supposed to be doing to some of our most vulnerable.

“They have got this wrong, they need to reflect on that, reflect on it quickly and this is one of those times when the UK government needs to develop a conscience and actually respond to what disabled people are saying to them.”

Chris Mason now puts it to Liz Kendall that the benefits bill is still going up and would continue to do so with these planned reforms in place.

Kendall accepts spending will rise, but she says the way to put welfare on a more "sustainable footing" is by getting people into work. 

"That is what we have failed to do for years and years," she says.

Watch more below as our political editor asks Kendall if the changes announced this afternoon are sustainable - both for the national finances and for recipients.

Liz Kendall: There is a Labour case for welfare reform

Asked by Chris Mason if she didn't go further with her reforms because of "jitters within her own party", the work and pensions secretary says Labour wants to "fix a failing system." 

"My starting point is not how far or how tough the government is, my starting point is how do we get a system that works for people who depend on it and works for taxpayers in the country as a whole."

Our political editor, Chris Mason, now puts it to Kendall that she should talk to people with disabilities or health conditions who cannot do daily tasks and say they deserve less money.

"That is not what we're saying," the work and pensions secretary replies, adding that changes are "not coming in overnight".

Benefits for people with severe disabilities "who will never work" will be protected, Kendall adds.

She says new claimants will have their cases assessed based on specific individual needs from 2026.

Over now to the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, who's been speaking to Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall after she unveiled the government's reforms to welfare.

He starts by asking her how many current benefits claimants would get less money under the changes.

Kendall does not answer the question directly, saying the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will come forward with an estimate by the Spring Statement.  

Asked why the government won't publish its assessment of the figure now, Kendall says it's because they wanted to publish their Green Paper before the Spring Statement.

Tom EspinerBusiness reporter

The government's reforms are the biggest welfare cut since 2015, and tilt the welfare system away from disabled people to the unemployed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says.

For decades the UK incapacity benefit - now paid through Universal Credit - has been separated from payments for higher living costs from a disability, which are paid through Personal Independence Payment (Pip).

From 2028-2029, they will be amalgamated - meaning there will be no support specifically for disabilities that
prevent work. This will leave 600,000 people worse off by £2,400, it says.

Furthermore, 2.4 million families that get incapacity benefit will get £280 less a year in 2029-2030 - but 4.5 million other families on universal credit will get £150 more a year.

Those who continue to get Pip will also be able to claim incapacity benefit - which is an extra £2,400.

The IFS says "there's
a clear risk here". It will weaken the incentives for people who can work to do so, while targeting stronger
incentives and employment support at those who may not be able to work.

It's unclear how much tightening the Pip eligibility criteria will save the government because claimants are incentivised to approach the assessment differently.

"Previous
governments attempting similar reforms have found that they have saved much
less than hoped," the IFS says.

Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent

This is a complex set of proposals, but the response from charities representing benefit claimants is quite simple to summarise.

In short, they say there is some good in here  - specifically the “right to try” plan of allowing people to have a go at returning to work without putting their benefit entitlement at risk.

But this is trumped by their concern about the £5bn-a-year cuts, which they say will create greater hardship for a group of people already struggling to make ends meet.

Thomas Lawson, chief executive of the anti-poverty charity Turn2us, says: “The cuts will harm more people than they help.”

Eleanor LawrieSocial affairs reporter

In her speech, Liz Kendall suggested
the number of people reporting a mental health condition had risen 190%. 

More
than half of the rise in working age people claiming disability benefits since
the pandemic stems from claims relating to mental health or behavioural
conditions, according
to think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), external. 

About 1.3 million people - or 44% - of all claimants are
claiming disability benefit primarily for one of these conditions, the IFS
says, while 86% report having a mental health condition.

Why has there been such a big increase? 

According to the
Labour Force Survey, the number of people who report having a long term mental
health condition has increased from about 8% a decade ago to over 14% last
year. 

Deaths of despair - those from suicide, drug and alcohol
poisoning and alcohol-related conditions - have also been steadily rising. 

Douglas FraserBusiness and economy editor, BBC Scotland

In trying to balance reform with savings, one casualty
of Liz Kendall's plans has been the opportunity to simplify.

Navigating through the system was already complex.

Now, with Personal Independence Payments (Pip) being replaced in
Scotland by an Adult Disability Payment, the thresholds to qualify look set to
diverge, and likewise the case review process.

Holyrood has been using its limited devolved powers over
welfare benefits to design a system with "dignity, respect and
fairness" at its heart. 

Yet it looks like a Scottish government
official will be applying the toughened rules for the non-devolved Universal
Credit.

Employability support is partly devolved. With more
requirements from Whitehall for engagement, a Scot with "risk of long-term
unemployment" may be handled differently in a Holyrood-backed programme
compared with a work search interview required of GB claimants to qualify for
Universal Credit.

Liz Kendall's plan merely acknowledges, and repeats, that
there will have to be discussions with the Scottish government. 

But as
her plan implies big cuts to the Treasury block grant to Holyrood, such
discussions are unlikely to start with much warmth or goodwill.

Gareth LewisPolitical editor, BBC Wales

Changes to welfare could have a disproportionate impact in
Wales, where places like Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil have some of the
highest health-related claim rates in England and Wales.

During today's First Minister's Questions, the leader of
Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, invited the FM, Eluned Morgan, to condemn the
changes.

She stopped short, saying that reform was needed, but
admitted not only that she had concerns, but also that she had called Downing
Street last week and had written to Liz Kendall about them.   

She told the Senedd that “some” of the points were taken on
board, which suggests that not all of them were.

The political stakes are high – the next Senedd election is
just over a year away, and both Labour and Plaid are trying to convince voters
that they offer the best option for Wales.

Michael BuchananSocial affairs correspondent

My inbox is full of responses to the government's
announcement, virtually all of them opposed to the plans. 

The changes
will “shame” the government, said one charity. A lack of moral choices, said
another. A third expects the cuts to push more people towards food
banks. 

Many of those charities, it must be said, were already unhappy
after the government cut the winter fuel allowance last year, a change
ministers applied knowing it would push tens of thousands of pensioners into
poverty.

Few organisations argue with providing more opportunities
for people to move into work, with appropriate support, and the government's
recent rhetoric about making job centres places where people find work rather
than a place to comply with benefit rules has been welcomed. 

But the Treasury's insistence on immediate cuts means that
most anti-poverty campaigners see these reforms as simply a dash to save
cash.  

A number of Labour MPs expressed disquiet in the Commons after the work and pensions secretary outlined her plans. 

Here's whip-around of what some of the more sceptical Labour MPs had to say: 

We've had a lot of technical detail on the government's plans to reform welfare. 

If you're looking for a quick overview, our chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman's got you covered:

Faisal IslamEconomics editor

There's something a little odd about the fact we are getting no breakdown of which of these welfare policies is generating the £5bn per year cash saving by 2029/30. 

Liz Kendall suggested that the final costing was still to be done ahead of the Spring Statement next week, by the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

But the government will already have a clear idea of how many people are affected, and by how much, and many are concerned right now.

The bottom line is that you cannot generate £5bn in savings without hundreds of thousands of people losing thousands of pounds.

While in the universal credit savings, much of the impact is generated by changes for future claimants, raising the eligibility age to 22 and halving the health payment, this does not appear to be the case for Personal Independence Payments (Pip).

Pip payments are determined by a questionnaire about daily life. Claimants will no longer be eligible unless they score four points, indicating a more severe disability in one area. (Our head of statistics, Robert Cuffe, explained how this would work in our previous post).

The bottom line here is that a pattern of recent mental health claims has been based on a range of less severe issues. 

The changes announced today aim to take Pip payments away from such people from November 2026. The government knows how many, and who they are. 

For now, until the Spring Statement next week, we can deduce that there are hundreds of thousands who will lose their entire £70 a week or £3,500 a year payment.

Robert CuffeHead of statistics

Pip assessments involve questions about parts of your daily life - like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed or communicating and reading. 

Each are scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.

Your payment depends on the total score across all areas. 

The proposed change is that people will need to score at least four on one item, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of activities. 

For example, needing an aid or appliance to speak or hear counts as two points, while needing support to express or understand complex verbal information counts as four points. 

And needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has announced a number of changes to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) - a key disability benefit paid to people in England and Wales.

So what were they?

By Anthony Reuben

The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, said that the package of measures announced today would save £5bn a year in 2029-30.

 That figure is not mentioned in the document the government published today., external

When the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) made its last set of forecasts in October it estimated that benefits for working age adults would rise from £48.5bn in 2023-24 to £75.7bn in 2029-30.

 A £5bn saving would be less than one fifth of that predicted rise.

 When asked for more details of the costings, Kendall said that we would have to wait for final costings from the OBR during the Spring Statement next week.

Dharshini DavidChief economics correspondent

Today's statement will be worrying for the three million working-age people who receive Personal Independence Payment (Pip). 

But with the number of recipients set to rise to over four million by 2030, adding an extra £12bn to welfare spending, the government's clear on the need to curb ballooning costs. 

And with only 3% of people who are classed as long-term sick returning to employment, this is an area where attention is clearly needed. 

But it is unclear how successful these measures will be in either aim. 

We won't know exactly how much the government hopes each of these measures will save - or the assessment of the independent official forecasters, the OBR, of those estimates until the chancellor's Spring Statement next week. And any estimates are just that - highly uncertain. 

Prior attempts to trim welfare bills have proved tricky for many reasons. 

And that includes the state of the labour market. To get people into work, there have to be jobs. 

As it stands, a recent survey by official statisticians found that one in four medium and large employers were planning to cut jobs - many cited the impact government policies such as the rise in employers NICS and increase in employee rights. 

Some, including the Bank of England, are predicting unemployment to rise and its likely to be lower paid posts that are hardest hit. You may want a job - but finding it may be getting harder

Prime Minister Keir Starmer was sitting behind Liz Kendall in the Commons as she delivered her statement.

He's just now posted on X: "When I talk about opportunity for all, I mean it."

"This government will always protect the most severely disabled people to live with dignity," he adds.

"But we're not prepared to stand back and do nothing while millions of people — especially young people — who have potential to work and live independent lives, instead become trapped out of work and abandoned by the system. 

"It would be morally bankrupt to let their life chances waste away."

China Encourages Babymaking With Free Milk and Childcare Subsidies

Reuters

Women hold childrens' hands as they wait to cross a street after school in downtown Shanghai, China September 12, 2014.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia, announced a slew of childcare subsidies this month and promised to "care" for new mothers by giving them a daily cup of free milk, as local provinces strive to boost the country's flagging population.

More than 20 provincial level administrations across China have started offering childcare subsidies, the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday. Such subsidies have emerged as a key focus for policymakers as they try to encourage young couples to get married and have children.

China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, as marriages plummeted by a fifth, the biggest drop on record.

The country is facing an unprecedented demographic downturn, a result largely of China's one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015, rapid urbanisation and the high cost of raising a family. Couples have been allowed to have as many as three children since 2021.

Earlier this month at the annual meeting of China's parliament, Premier Li Qiang announced childcare subsidies and free preschool education to try and boost the birth rate.

An action plan to boost domestic consumption released on Sunday said that authorities should "study and establish a childcare subsidy system".

Hohhot, a bustling northern city surrounded by verdant grasslands, said couples would receive a 10,000 yuan ($1,382.51)one-off payment for their first child, and 10,000 yuan a year for a second baby until the child reached the age of five.

A third child would receive an annual subsidy of 10,000 yuan until they turned 10, a total figure roughly twice the annual income of local residents.

Hohhot also issued what it called the "One cup of milk fertility care action for mothers" with a cup of milk available for free each day for any mothers who give birth after March 1.

They will also be entitled to an electronic voucher worth 3,000 yuan from two dairy companies Yili and China Mengniu Dairy.

($1 = 7.2334 yuan)

US President Donald Trump has warned Iran that it will face "dire" consequences if Yemen's Houthis continue to attack international shipping lanes.

He said the Iranian leadership would be held responsible for "every shot fired by the Houthis", which have long been backed by Tehran. The group later said it had targeted a US aircraft carrier three times in the past two days.

The Houthis first tried to attack the USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea on Sunday following deadly US strikes on Yemen. 

The Pentagon said it had struck 30 targets in Yemen since Saturday, in the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump returned to the White House.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Monday: "Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN.

"And IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!"

The US president accused Iran of supplying the group with funding, weapons and intelligence, which Tehran denies.

In a letter on Monday to the UN Security Council, Iran's UN envoy denied it was in violation of a UN arms embargo on Yemen, and said it was not involved in any destabilising activities in the region.

Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani accused the US of "baseless accusations" against Iran, Reuters news agency reported.

In a briefing on Monday, Pentagon officials said the US attacks on Yemen were directed at a broader range of targets than the strikes authorised under former President Joe Biden.

Lt Gen Alex Grynkewich said that Houthi drone experts were among those targeted.

He added that there had been "no credible indications of any civilian casualties".

Washington has said some key Houthi figures were among the dead, although the group has not confirmed this.

Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the US was not seeking regime change.

"This campaign will be relentless to degrade their capability and to open up shipping lanes in the region and to defend our homeland," he said.

On Sunday morning, the Houthis launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S Truman.

US fighter aircraft shot down about 11 of the drones, a US official told the BBC's US partner CBS.

The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S Truman, the official added.

On Monday, the group said that it had launched a third attack on the ship in just 48 hours - disrupting US military strikes that were preparing to launch.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to the BBC when asked about the group's latest claims. Earlier on Monday, Pentagon officials said that one missile fired at the ship by the Houthis missed by over 100 miles (160km), and denied that any of the Houthi attacks have been successful.

The Houthis said at least five children were among 53 people killed in the US air strikes on Yemen's Al Jaouf and Hudaydah areas, casualties that the BBC has not independently verified.

The US also launched airstrikes against the group on Saturday and Sunday.

The Houthis said they would continue to target Red Sea shipping until Israel lifted its blockade of Gaza.

The group has claimed - often falsely - that they only target ships linked to Israel, the US or the UK in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Since November 2023, the  Houthis have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.

The group controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government.

A jury found Starbucks responsible for the incident, which caused a Postmates driver third-degree burns to his genital area.

Police have been searching for the missing University of Pittsburgh student, who was on spring break in Punta Cana, for the past two weeks. 

Paul Burke says his daughter Becky has been released from a US immigration centre.

Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement after Trump called for a judge that halted his deportations to be impeached.

President Donald Trump has vowed to impose a sweeping range of tariffs on Irish goods on 2 April.

More than 400 people killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes, Palestinian officials say

Israeli airstrikes pounded Gaza, killing more than 400 people, Palestinian health authorities said on Tuesday — collapsing a two-month ceasefire with Hamas as Israel vowed to use force to free its remaining hostages in the territory.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of "repeated refusal to release our hostages" and rejecting proposals from U.S. President Donald Trump's mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.

"Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," his office said in a statement.

Netanyahu's office said he would deliver a statement at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), while Israeli media reported his cabinet would meet at 9 p.m. local time.

After heavy strikes, the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for a number of neighbourhoods in Gaza, according to the statement.

Meanwhile, Hamas accused Israel of overturning the hard-fought ceasefire deal agreed to in January, leaving the fate of 59 hostages still held in Gaza uncertain.

Strikes in Gaza were reported in multiple locations on Tuesday during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Officials from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said many of the dead were children.

Israel's renewed intense pressure on Hamas came as tensions flared elsewhere in the Middle East, a major supplier of oil to global markets, which has seen the Gaza war spread to Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq.

Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any further attacks on international shipping carried out by the Houthi group, as his administration expanded strikes in Yemen — the biggest U.S. military operation in the region since he returned to the White House.

Strikes were reported in locations including northern Gaza, Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah in central and southern Gaza Strip.

"It was a night of hell. It felt like the first days of the war," said Rabiha Jamal, 65, a mother of five from Gaza City.

"We were preparing to have something to eat before starting a new day of fasting when the building shook and explosions began. We thought it was over but war is back," she told Reuters via a chat app.

In hospitals strained by 15 months of bombardment, piles of bodies in white plastic sheets could be seen stacked up as casualties were brought in. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 404 people had been killed, many of them children, and 562 people were injured.

The Israel Defence Forces said it hit dozens of targets, and that the strikes would continue for as long as necessary and would extend beyond air strikes, raising the prospect that Israeli ground troops could resume fighting.

The strikes drew swift reaction and condemnation.

The United Nations' Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory urged for the ceasefire in Gaza to be immediately reinstated.

"Waves of airstrikes occurred across the Gaza strip since the early hours of the morning ... This is unconscionable," Muhannad Hadi said in a statement.

Russia said on Tuesday that it was concerned by what it called a large number of civilian casualties after Israel struck Gaza and hoped that peace would return.

"Undoubtedly, it's another deterioration in the situation [in Gaza] and another spiral of escalation that is causing our concern," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Egypt said Israel's action violated the ceasefire and marked a dangerous escalation, while Turkey's foreign ministry said Israel's attacks represented a "new phase in its policy of genocide" against Palestinians and urged the international community to take a determined stance to ensure a ceasefire is upheld and humanitarian aid is delivered.

The attacks were far wider in scale than the regular series of drone strikes the Israeli military has said it has conducted against individuals or small groups of suspected militants and follows weeks of failed efforts to agree on an extension to the truce, which began on Jan. 19.

Despite the international condemnation, the airstrikes earned Netanyahu a political boost. Former national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who left the government over disagreements about the Gaza ceasefire, is rejoining the coalition after the resumption of Israeli strikes, a statement said, strengthening Netanyahu's government.

Among those killed was senior Hamas official Mohammad Al-Jmasi, a member of the political office, and members of his family, including his grandchildren who were in his house in Gaza City when it was hit by an airstrike on Tuesday, Hamas sources and relatives said. In all, at least five senior Hamas officials were killed along with members of their families.

Some people were brought to overwhelmed hospitals by private cars.

A strike on a home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed 17 members of one family — including at least 12 women and children, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies.

In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the U.S. administration before it carried out the strikes, which the military said targeted mid-level Hamas commanders and leadership officials as well as infrastructure belonging to the militant group.

"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war," White House spokesperson Brian Hughes said.

Negotiating teams from Israel and Hamas had been in Doha as mediators from Egypt and Qatar sought to bridge the gap between the two sides following the end of an initial phase in the ceasefire, which saw 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

With the backing of the United States, Israel had been pressing for the return of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a longer-term truce that would have halted fighting until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday in April.

However Hamas had been insisting on moving to negotiations for a permanent end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, in accordance with the terms of the original ceasefire agreement.

Each side has accused the other of failing to respect the terms of the January ceasefire agreement, and there were multiple hiccups during the course of the first phase. But until now, a full return to the fighting had been avoided.

Thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.

The Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave.

A visitor to Arlington National Cemetery's website earlier this year would have seen links to information about a wide range of notable African Americans, Hispanic Americans and women buried there.

Not anymore.

The Trump administration unpublished, altered, or hid content and links about all three groups buried at the cemetery ‒ one of the nation's most hallowed military sites.

Links for other "notable graves" of veterans remain, as well as for sports figures, and leaders in politics, medicine, science and culture.

The alterations are part of a sweeping effort by the Trump administration and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove references throughout the department to diversity, equity and inclusion issues or "gender ideology."

Dozens of pages and links on the national cemetery's website appear to have been caught up in the purge.

One now-missing page on the cemetery's website linked to 14 educational lesson plans on African Americans, including walking tours and a unit on the famed Tuskegee Airmen, according to a search of the Wayback Machine by Internet Archive. The unlinked lesson plans are still available through a web search.

A similar lesson plan page devoted to the Borinqueneers ‒ a storied unit of Puerto Rican soldiers awarded for their service in the world wars and the Korean War ‒ is now even more difficult to find.

Other pages also vanished from the website, but are still accessible through Google searches.

In response to questions from USA TODAY, the cemetery stated some of the removed content is being restored, while still complying with the orders from President Donald Trump and the Department of Defense. It did not specify which pages will be restored and when.

Kevin Levin, a historian and educator in Boston who specializes in Civil War history, brought attention to the changes in a newsletter published on March 8. He told USA TODAY he learned of the changes from a teacher using the website.

“The story of Arlington is essentially a story of diversity, equity and inclusion,” Levin said. “That is the very thing that the Trump administration is trying to wipe clean, and that entails erasing our history.”

More than 400,000 people are buried at Arlington. The first military burial at the Virginia cemetery, operated by the U.S. Army, took place on May 13, 1864. Among the historical figures buried there are two U.S. presidents, John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft; Gen. Colin Powell, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Supreme Justice Thurgood Marshall; and boxer Joe Louis, a former world heavyweight champion and grandson of a slave.

"Stepping on the grounds of Arlington offers a powerful reminder of the service and sacrifice of Americans from all walks of life," Levin wrote in his newsletter. In recent years, the cemetery had expanded its historical accounts of people who fought and died for the country, he said, creating a way for students around the country who may not get to visit Arlington, to connect with people from more diverse backgrounds.

With the ongoing changes, Levin said he worries about how materials may be rewritten, "and in what way those revisions prevent us from getting at the full history of Arlington."

From the beginning of his second term, the president made it clear he wanted to eradicate references to diversity, equity and inclusion. He signed an executive order "ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs" on Inauguration Day, and another related order on DEI in the military on Jan. 27.

The Office of Personnel Management sent out a memo on Jan. 21 directing all agencies to take several steps on DEI, including taking down "all outward facing media" of diversity and inclusion offices.

On Jan. 29, the DOD distributed a memo stating diversity, equity and inclusion policies are "incompatible" with the department's values. Hegseth also created a task force to oversee the "standing down" of the diversity and inclusion offices throughout the department and military services and the end of all actions by the offices that promote "ideologies related to systemic racism or gender fluidity."

"The DOD mission is to win the nation's wars," Hegseth said. "To do this, we must have a lethal fighting force that rewards individual initiative, excellence and hard work based on merit."

Hegseth set a March 1 deadline for an initial report from the task force and a final deadline of June 1.

On Feb. 26, Sean Parnell, assistant to the Defense secretary for public affairs, ordered all department news and feature articles, photos and videos that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion be removed. The memo also directed that all removed items be archived.  The memo also stated the websites should provide blanket statements to acknowledge content was being removed to align with the executive orders from the president. 

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, criticized the recent changes in an emailed statement to USA TODAY, calling them "an egregious insult to the people who have served our country valiantly."

"Wasting time on so-called culture wars entirely of the Trump Administration's own making is a monumental waste of time and resources," Smith said. "If they were serious about addressing inefficiency in the Defense Department there are plenty of real issues to focus on."

Committee chair Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., did not respond to requests for comment.

Changes also have occurred to other DOD websites, including military branches and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to eradicate mentions of Black History Month and Pride Month, which celebrates gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and transgender individuals.

In some cases, the keyword searches being used to flag content pulled up subjects that had entirely different meanings. The Associated Press reported, for example, that photos were flagged on the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The news shocked the granddaughter of the pilot Paul W. Tibbetts Jr., whose mother the plane was named for, the Columbus Dispatch reported.

The DOD removed an article linked to Black History Month about Army Maj. Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers, the most senior Black soldier ever awarded the Medal of Honor.

A West Virginia native, Rogers served in the Army for 32 years, including during the Vietnam War. He was recognized for "conspicuous gallantry" for his service while a lieutenant colonel commanding an artillery battalion. He was wounded three times while helping to repel an attack on a forward support base, according to the citation. Awarded the Medal by then-President Richard Nixon in 1970, Rogers was buried at Arlington when he died in 1990.

Social media sleuths noticed the article's web address in a copy available in the Wayback Machine had the letters "dei" added before medal.

After a public outcry, the department reinstated the article as of Monday, flagging it as part of a historical collection. USA TODAY has asked the DOD for comment about the article removal.

Among the other changes:

◾Some videos and at least three pages with articles for Black History Month in 2024 are no longer available on the Army's website.

◾Black History Month photos were removed from the DOD's visual information distribution website.

◾On the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers website, a story about engineering pioneer Hattie Peterson was taken down.

◾On a U.S. Army site, a story with a timeline of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the armed forces is no longer accessible.

George Washington law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss courts blocking President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE cuts as Democrats celebrate.

As the lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump have climbed well past the triple-digit mark less than three months into his presidency, some supporters are questioning what actions – if any – can either members of Congress or the White House take to check the power of the courts.

Trump's supporters have criticized so-called "activist" judges who have ruled against Trump. Notably, some have labeled U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, as such after she sided with Chief Justice John Roberts and left-leaning justices to uphold a lower court decision that forced the Trump administration to unfreeze USAID payments previously authorized by Congress. 

More recently, the White House contested a federal judge's order blocking the administration from using a 1798 wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua. When U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to turn around any plane carrying deported foreign nationals, the administration sent hundreds of deportees to El Salvador anyway, seemingly in defiance of the judge. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News later that the plane in question had already "left U.S. airspace" and later added that the administration should not need to comply with the judge's order. 

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory," Leavitt said, adding, "A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil."

Boasberg ordered the parties back to court Monday for a hearing over the matter and set a Tuesday deadline for the Justice Department to provide the court with more information about what happened. However, Trump's apparent defiance of the court demonstrates how the executive branch is looking to push back against judges whose opinions it does not respect, while supporters in Congress cheer on. 

"Judges targeting President Trump are political hacks and their decisions belong in my SHREDDER," Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., wrote on X last week, sharing a video that criticized another judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali. Ogles called Ali a "Biden-appointed, woke judicial activist" after the judge, following the Supreme Court's guidance, ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in "unlawfully" restricted USAID funds. 

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a frequent critic of the courts, shared Ogles' post and wrote, "Judges aren't presidents." Lee, in recent weeks, suggested that some judges handing down defeats for the Trump administration "might warrant removal." 

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO PAY ‘UNLAWFULLY' RESTRICTED USAID FUNDS

Congress indeed has the power to impeach and remove federal judges for misconduct, corruption or other offenses – Trump has called for Congress to do so – but two-thirds of the Senate would need to vote in favor of removal, and Democrats are unlikely to join Republicans in any such effort. 

Many judges, for their part, have taken umbrage at the sweeping nature of Trump's executive orders, which have called for the gutting of government personnel, halted billions in foreign aid – including funds approved by Congress – and attempted to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, among other actions. 

"An American President is not a king – not even an 'elected' one – and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute," U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell said earlier this month in a court order reinstating a member of the National Labor Relations Board.

Constitutional scholars say these separation of powers conflicts long predate Trump and are somewhat expected because of the recent lack of action from the United States Congress.

Article I empowers Congress to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper" for the executive branch to function. However, when lawmakers focus more on their re-election campaigns or partisan fighting than enacting law, there is a vacuum that is filled by executive action – which faces tough scrutiny from the courts. 

HERE'S WHY DOZENS OF LAWSUITS SEEKING TO QUASH TRUMP'S EARLY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT ARE FAILING

Congress passed slightly fewer than 150 bills during the 118th session, according to data compiled by the firm Quorum and reported by Axios – making that session, which ended in December, the most unproductive since at least the 1980s.

Recent presidents, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, have responded with a flurry of executive orders and actions to enact their agenda, analysts explained to Fox News Digital in an interview. 

According to the Code of Federal Regulations and the Federal Register, a president's executive order can be revoked or modified only by the president or via the legislative branch, if the president was acting on authority that had been granted by Congress. In the Trump era, lawsuits have alleged that Trump has acted without authorization from Congress. 

In the absence of clearly written laws, judges wield enormous power to interpret the lawfulness of the executive's action and have done so. Critics of the judiciary have advocated for Congress to curtail this power by either changing the size or structure of certain lower courts or taking similar action.

Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule opined in a social media post Thursday that Congress, with its Republican majorities in the House and Senate, could simply move to cut off funding for judicial law clerks and other essential legal personnel, making the legislative branch's "power of the purse" painfully clear. 

"If Congress simply refused to fund judicial law clerks, secretaries, or computers, one suspects that the TROs would come out more slowly - and perhaps even that the judiciary would gain a renewed appreciation for the limits of its role," Vermeule wrote on X.

However, given Congress's difficulty in passing legislation, including days of infighting that have delayed the passage of recent stopgap spending bills, it is unclear how effective lawmakers of either party would be at rallying behind a measure like the one he proposed.

Options available to the White House are more limited by the Constitution. The president can appoint federal judges, but he cannot fire them. The executive branch is also responsible for enforcing court rulings and may either slow-roll or de-prioritize decisions the president disagrees with. However, such an action would violate historical deference given to the courts, although Trump now seems to be willing to do so.

After the Supreme Court upheld a district court's decision this month ordering the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion in owed payments to USAID contractors for completed projects, Judge Ali said in his ruling that the Trump administration likely exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to block the payments.

"Here, the executive has unilaterally deemed that funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid will not be spent," Ali said.

"The executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress' exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place." Ali added.

However, it is unclear what remedies the White House would have unilaterally to push back on the decision, short of appealing certain portions to the Supreme Court that were not ruled on directly – prompting criticism from some.

As president, Trump "is exercising Article II power to take care that our federal laws are faithfully executed," Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

"That's his constitutional duty. And that includes weeding out waste, fraud and abuse. That's what he's doing with Elon Musk and with DOGE," said Davis, a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch. 

It is unclear whether the White House plans to appeal any part of Judge Ali's preliminary injunction ruling, and administration officials did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked President Donald Trump from deporting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, is among the judges who have attracted attention from critics. 'Fox News @ Night' takes a closer look.

Federal judges who have attempted to put up roadblocks to President Donald Trump's deportation efforts could endanger national security, according to one expert.

"It's incredible that basically a rogue judge is putting our national security at risk when they block this enforcement action without any legal basis," Alfonso Aguilar, a former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship and the director of Hispanic engagement at the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. "Swift enforcement of the law is essential to dissuade foreign actors from trying to engage in criminal behavior in our country."

The comments come after Judge James Boasberg, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, issued an order Saturday halting one of Trump's rapid deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. 

However, the order was not followed by the administration, who argued that the flight was already in the air before it got word of the judge's order, prompting Boasberg to hold a hearing Monday that set a one-day deadline for the administration to provide more information on the flight, such as how many people it was carrying and how many of those were removed "solely on the basis" of Trump's interpretation of the 1798 wartime-era Alien Enemies Act.

The act, which was last invoked during World War II, provides the president broad powers to imprison or deport foreign nationals during a time of war.

A proclamation signed by Trump on Saturday claimed that gang members belonging to the Venezuelan-based gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) were "conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States," a follow-up to Trump's move last month to designate several drug cartels, including TdA, as "Foreign Terrorist Organizations."

That move prompted a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, eventually resulting in Boasberg's decision to issue a 14-day restraining order halting deportations under the act.

However, Aguilar believes the lawsuits are part of a broader strategy by opponents of the president to bog down his administration, arguing that left-wing groups have engaged in "forum shopping" for judges who they believe will be politically sympathetic to resisting Trump.

"We've seen it since the beginning of the administration, on every single executive order, certainly on immigration enforcement actions, is to go forum shopping, they look for a federal district judge that they know is going to be sympathetic to try to block an order or action from the administration," Aguilar said.

William Jacobson, a Cornell University law professor and founder of the Equal Protection Project, told Fox News Digital that the trend of judges blocking Trump's orders does raise serious legal questions.

"This has been an issue since the start of the Trump second administration," Jacobson said. "There was a very highly organized effort to drown the administration in lawfare and tie it up and essentially freeze the executive branch."

Jacobson argued that there have already been a "number of rulings" that potentially "overstepped the boundaries of separation of powers," something he noted has already caught the attention of four justices on the Supreme Court.

"The courts are not supposed to rule on political issues," Jacobson said. "The courts are supposed to rule on legal rights. And I think the administration's argument is, and they make this argument in the DC Circuit, in the emergency state that's being briefed right now, that if a judge can interfere in something like this, can a judge order the government not to issue drone strikes on terrorists abroad? Where is the limit in that the federal courts have no ability to interfere in the conduct of foreign policy, in the conduct of military action?"

Jacobson believes that the only way to rectify the situation for the administration will be for the Supreme Court to step in, issuing clear guidance to lower court judges on what they can and cannot rule on.

Aguilar also believes the Supreme Court will need to intervene, though he stressed that delays in the meantime could continue to spell trouble for national security.

"If you send a clear message to these individuals that if you're coming here to commit crime or engage in terrorism, we will detain you. We will remove you immediately," he said. "That serves as a powerful form to dissuade this type of behavior. So it does have an impact on the administration's efforts to protect the security of our country."

As part of his efforts to crack down on immigration, President Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an obscure law that has been used sparingly throughout U.S. history to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime or an invasion. 

Trump's directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang that has grown into a multinational crime organization over the last decade and was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in February. 

The proclamation authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens ages 14 and older deemed members of the group and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, calling them "a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States." 

"I find and declare that [Tren de Aragua] is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States," the proclamation reads, borrowing the language of the centuries-old act. 

The Alien Enemies Act is a wartime law: It has its roots in a conflict between the U.S. and France, and the three times it has been used until now were all during major wars. 

Legal experts have long been skeptical of the Trump campaign promise — and facet of the 2024 Republican Party platform — to utilize the act during peacetime since immigration hasn't historically constituted an invasion. Immigration advocates worry the act could lead to the targeting of other groups of immigrants, regardless of their criminal history.

Trump's proclamation was immediately blocked by a federal judge, who ordered deportation flights to turn around — though the administration still deported some 250 people to El Salvador. 

"The Trump administration is seeking to circumvent the process that we have in our country in order to just expand power and do something with no process at all," Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward — which, along the American Civil Liberties Union, sued over the administration's use of the law — told NPR, adding, "It's highly concerning and should be concerning for all Americans." 

The last time the act was invoked was during World War II, when it was used to put thousands of noncitizens of Japanese, German and Italian descent in internment camps — for which the federal government formally apologized decades later. 

"History shows the risks," wrote Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel with the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.

Here's what else to know about the act and Trump's efforts to use it. 

The Alien Enemies Act specifically allows the president to detain, relocate, or deport non-citizens from a country considered an enemy of the U.S. during wartime:

“Whenever there shall be a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States, by any foreign nation or government, and the President of the United States shall make public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being males of the age of fourteen years and upwards, who shall be within the United States, and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies.

Congress, with the support of President John Adams, passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 as the U.S. stood on the brink of war with France.

"There was a lot of fear-mongering about French supporters in the United States and about conspiracies to basically get the United States in on France's side," Georgetown University Law Center professor Steve Vladeck told NPR during the presidential campaign last fall.

The controversial group of laws severely curtailed civil liberties, including by tightening restrictions on foreign-born Americans and limiting speech critical of the government.

After President Thomas Jefferson was elected in 1800, he either repealed or allowed most of the acts to expire, except for the Alien Enemies Act, which does not have an expiration date.

It not only remained on the books but continued to expand in scope: Congress amended it in 1918 to include women.

The Alien Enemies Act has been used only three times before in American history — all in connection with major military conflicts.

During the War of 1812, all British nationals living in the U.S. were required to report information including their age, length of time in the country, place of residence, family description and whether they had applied for naturalization.

A century later, during World War I, President Woodrow Wilson invoked it against nationals of the Central Powers: the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. 

According to the National Archives, U.S. authorities used the law to place over 6,000 "enemy aliens" — many of them Germans — in internment camps, with some remaining in detention up to two years after fighting had ended.

The U.S. Marshals Service says it registered 480,000 German "enemy aliens" and arrested 6,300 between the declaration of war in April 1917 and the armistice in November 1918.

Most recently, President Franklin Roosevelt invoked the act after the attack on Pearl Harbor, designating Japanese, German and Italian nationals as "alien enemies" during World War II.

Roosevelt's proclamation required residents from all three countries to register with the U.S. government and authorized the internment of any alien enemy "deemed potentially dangerous to the peace and security of the US."


                Tom C. Clark, coordinator of the Alien Enemy Control program of the Western Defense Command, points to the first warning card telling "enemy aliens" in Los Angeles to evacuate prohibited areas by midnight, Feb. 15, 1942.

By the end of WWII, over 31,000 suspected enemy aliens and their families — including Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany — had been interned at camps and military facilities across the U.S., according to the National Archives. Several thousand of them were ultimately repatriated to their country of origin, either by choice or by force.

Vladeck says the Alien Enemies Act was used to detain mostly Italian and German nationals. The bulk of the more than 100,000 Japanese Americans who were placed in internment camps during the war were U.S. citizens, detained under different legal grounds.

The act's fine print states that the president can only assume this authority once Congress has declared war. While the U.S. has been involved in plenty of conflicts over the decades, it hasn't done so formally since 1942.

"It hasn't been a source of contemporary controversy because we haven't had a declared war," Vladeck explains. "And no one has tried to argue that that invasion or predatory incursion language could be used in any context other than a conventional war."

Until Trump, that is. The former president — who has a long history of using dehumanizing language against minority groups and political opponents — has repeatedly referred to the influx of migrants to the U.S. as an "invasion" and vowed mass deportations. 

Ebright, with the Brennan Center, called Trump's argument a  "flagrantly illegal" power grab. 

"The president has falsely proclaimed an invasion and predatory incursion to use a law written for wartime for peacetime immigration enforcement," she wrote after Trump invoked the act. "The courts should shut this down."

The Trump administration has defended its actions and pushed back against a federal judge's attempts to intervene, even refusing to answer basic questions about its deportation flights.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the administration "acted within the confines of the law" and is "wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court."

But even some anti-immigration advocates in favor of deploying the act have acknowledged the likely legal obstacles.

Defining illegal immigration as an invasion and migrant gangs as foreign nations would be an "uphill climb in federal court," George Fishman, former deputy general counsel at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Trump, wrote in 2023.

Trump doesn't need the Alien Enemies Act to go after undocumented immigrants, Vladeck says, noting that presidents already have the authority to arrest, detain and remove them.

"The issue that has hamstrung each of the last four presidents, of both parties, has not been legal authority — it's a lack of resources," he says. "The federal government doesn't have the capacity to identify, track down, round up and remove every single one of the 11 million-plus undocumented immigrants in this country."

He said he doesn't expect courts to look kindly upon Trump invoking the act "where, one, he doesn't need it, and two, it would really be a stretch in what is already a pretty controversial legal power." 

Ebright agreed that "immigration law already gives the president ample authority to deport Tren de Aragua members who inflict harm on our communities." Still, she said, it's not completely clear what the courts will do. 

The last time the Supreme Court heard a case on the act, in 1948, it deemed questions about the definition of wartime too political to answer. On the other hand, she noted, a lot has changed since then.  Ebright wrote last year that the surest way to prevent the act from being abused would be for Congress to proactively repeal it.

Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats, have tried to do so in recent years by introducing the "Neighbors Not Enemies" Act, which would repeal the Alien Enemies Act, but hasn't gained traction.

The lawmakers reintroduced the act in January, two days after Trump took office. 

"We cannot allow antiquated laws to continue enabling discriminatory practices that harm immigrant communities," Omar said at the time. "Repealing this law is a necessary step toward creating an immigration system rooted in justice and compassion."

U.S. Justice Department Orders National-Security Lawyers to Review JFK Documents

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department is ordering some of its lawyers who handle sensitive national-security matters to urgently review records from the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy that are due to be released on Tuesday, according to an email seen by Reuters.

Christopher Robinson, a National Security Division official, announced that "all" attorneys who work in the Operations Section of the Office of Intelligence are being ordered to review between 400 and 500 documents each, according to a Monday evening email seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

It is not clear whether that would interfere with the lawyers' regular work, which includes filing court requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor foreigners on U.S. soil. 

A Justice Department spokesman said that "no FISA work was halted" as a result of the review.

Robinson imposed a deadline of noon Tuesday to complete the review, which includes records related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, as well as Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., and "possibly others."

Trump has ordered roughly 80,000 pages of material related to Kennedy's assassination to be released, along with government records related to the assassinations of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and civil-rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

He previously signed an executive order in January, prompting the FBI to search for thousands of records.

"There is an urgent declassification review of documents related to the JFK, RFK, MLK investigations (and possibly others)," Robinson wrote to the attorneys in the Office of Intelligence, adding that the only people exempt from the assignment are those who are on approved leave.

"Everyone is being asked to review a batch of documents (between 400-500 each)," he said.

Robinson said that FBI agents have already reviewed some of those files as part of the declassification review.

Last week, some FBI agents were ordered to stop working on their usual cases so that they could review files related to the 1968 assassination of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

The Operations Section of the Office of Intelligence is in charge of preparing and filing warrant applications with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to collect communications of foreigners on domestic soil.

Former department attorneys said the decision to require all of the attorneys from the Office of Intelligence Operations Section to handle the declassification review is highly unusual, and could undermine legitimate national security work.

"If the commitment of such resources came at the expense of processing FISA applications, that would be to the detriment of U.S. national security interests," said David Laufman, the former chief of the Justice Department's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. 

John F. Kennedy's murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald. The Justice Department and other federal government bodies later reaffirmed that conclusion.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now leads the Department of Health and Human Services, has alleged without evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency was involved. The CIA has repeatedly denied the claim.

He has also claimed his father was killed by multiple gunmen, a claim contradicted by official accounts.

STAFF SHAKEUP

The declassification review follows a staffing shakeup within the National Security Division.

Earlier this month, the head of the Office of Intelligence and another career official were abruptly reassigned to other jobs, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as part of a broader effort to purge career employees.

The leadership of the National Security Division, which would normally be staffed by up to 12 lawyers, has dwindled to about three attorneys, one of the sources said.

Trump and his allies have long complained about the use of FISA warrants after the Justice Department's inspector general in 2019 uncovered widespread errors by the FBI in its warrant applications during its investigation into contacts between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.

Trump announced the files' release while visiting the Kennedy Center Monday.

The Justice Department's National Security Division has been in a scramble trying to meet President Donald Trump's promise on Monday to release declassified information from the JFK assassination investigation today.

Trump, during a visit Monday to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, announced the government would be releasing all the files on Kennedy's assassination on Tuesday afternoon.

Less than half an hour after that announcement, the Justice Department's office that handles foreign surveillance requests and other intelligence-related operations began to shift resources to focus on the task, sources said.

In an email just before 5 p.m. ET Monday, a senior official within DOJ's Office of Intelligence said that even though the FBI had already conducted "an initial declassification review" of the documents, "all" of the attorneys in the operations section now had to provide "a second set of eyes" to help with this "urgent NSD-wide project."

Eventually, however, it was other National Security Division attorneys who ended up having to help, sources said.

Attorneys from across the division were up throughout the night, into the early morning hours, each reading through as many as hundreds of pages of documents, sources said. Only prosecutors with an impending arrest or other imminent work did not have to help, sources said.

A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

In promising the release of JFK files today, Trump said Monday that there is "a tremendous amount of paper."

"You've got a lot of reading," he said. "I don't believe we're going to redact anything. I said, 'Just don't redact. You can't redact.'"

Trump in January signed an executive order directing the "full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy" in order to end the decades-long wait for the release of the government's secret files on Kennedy's 1963 assassination.

Prime Minister Mark Carney says United States President Donald Trump will have to stop his "disrespectful" comments about Canada before the two countries can have comprehensive bilateral conversations about trade and security.

"We've called out those comments. They're disrespectful, they're not helpful, and they need to stop," Carney said in response to a question regarding Trump's repeated remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state. 

"They will have to stop before we sit down and have a conversation about our broader partnership with the United States."

The prime minister made the remarks in London, on the second part of a one-day trip to France and the U.K., which took place just days after he took office. Carney has used the trip to push for closer trade and security ties with Europe.




His European visit comes as Trump has instigated a trade war between the two countries, after pledging to use "economic force" to annex Canada.

Carney told reporters Canada wants to have a "more comprehensive discussion" with the Trump administration about the overall commercial and security relationship.

"When the United States is ready to have that conversation, we're more than ready to sit down," he said.

During a press conference in London, Carney was asked why Canada's allies haven't forcefully criticized Trump's comments about annexing Canada.

"I don't think one needs to respond to every comment about another country," Carney responded. "Canada is strong, we can stand up for ourselves."

Carney began the day in Paris where he had a private meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, before flying to London where he met first with King Charles and then Prime Minister Keir Starmer.




Carney said Monday that "we have a steadfast defender in our sovereign."

Carney and Macron discussed a new bilateral partnership on intelligence and security, focused on enhancing cybersecurity and sharing intelligence on "significant threats," the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement about the conversation.

"Key topics will include economic security, violent extremism, counter-proliferation, interference, espionage, sabotage, and threats associated with advanced technologies."

Carney's European visit comes amid a shakeup in global security and intelligence as Trump has increasingly cozied up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, prompting concerns among some allies whether critical intelligence will end up in Putin's hands.

The PMO said Carney and Macron also discussed strengthening economic ties, including on artificial intelligence, critical minerals and clean energy, as well as their intention to "defend rules-based trade."




Making opening remarks in Paris before the meeting with Macron, Carney stressed both countries' shared values of sovereignty, solidarity and sustainability, and said Canada is the most "European" country outside of Europe.

He said France and Canada have been reliable partners for centuries, and are now committed to "unwavering support" for Ukraine.

Macron, who invited Carney to visit before Carney was even sworn in, called Canada a "unique friend" with a shared vision of freedom. He also underscored a deep strategic partnership for trade, defence, protecting the environment and creating new technologies.

"We believe that fair trade that respects international rules is a good thing for everyone's prosperity and it is far more effective than tariffs, that simply create inflation and destroy the integration of our economies and our supply chain," he said.




Diversifying trade away from the U.S. is becoming a more critical manoeuvre for Canada and Europe is a potentially huge customer.

France has notably not yet ratified CETA, Canada's free trade deal with the European Union, and Canada's talks with the U.K. about an independent free trade deal remain on ice.

On Friday, Carney ordered a review of Canada's F-35 fighter jet purchase from U.S.'s Lockheed Martin. He said Monday that given the "geopolitical environment" and other factors, it's prudent for Canada to review its options. 

Carney said Europe is increasing and consolidating its defence spending.

"That is of interest to us...because it's a potential alternative supplier that creates the potential to create supply chains that mean that Canadian companies are participating in the development of these defence systems."




Carney said Canada is "actively exploring" this and that he discussed the subject during his visits to France and the U.K.

"Diversification of our suppliers in a way that ensures that as much as possible of that production resides in Canada and benefits Canadians in multiple ways is a prudent thing to do," Carney said.

Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer, which Canada is hosting.

The prime minister, however, has not yet spoken to Trump since succeeding Justin Trudeau as prime minister several days ago. A call with the U.S. president is unlikely until Carney returns to Ottawa.

Carney said in London there is a limit to the tariffs Canada should levy against the United States, given the size of the two countries' economies. 




He said the tariffs Canada has currently proposed have maximum effect on the United States and "limited but not zero" impact on Canada.

 "There is a limit to matching these tariffs dollar-for-dollar, given the fact that our economy is a 10th the size of the United States," Carney said.

The issue of diversity, equity and inclusion programs is among the most tightly divided and polarizing questions in the United States at this time, with wide gaps emerging along partisan and racial lines, according to the latest national NBC News poll. 

President Donald Trump has made dismantling DEI programs an early focus of his administration, and voters are split over the future of the programs in the workplace, with deep differences depending on their political party.

Half of registered voters (49%) in the NBC News poll say DEI programs should be eliminated “because they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills and experience.” 

And 48% say DEI programs in the workplace should continue “because diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.” 

Asked to share whether they have positive or negative feelings about DEI programs, a slightly higher share of voters (43%) say they have negative feelings, while 39% have positive views and 14% are neutral. (The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.)The divides over DEI are part of a broader cultural split. In another question in the poll asking them to pick between two different statements, 51% of voters say there is “too much political correctness in our society today, and too much pressure on people to limit what they can do or say to avoid offending other people.” Meanwhile, 45% say there is “too much prejudice in our society today and people need to be more respectful in what they do and say to avoid offending other people.” 

Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office to end DEI programs at federal agencies, which prompted some private companies to also roll back programs focused on increasing diversity in the workplace. The Education Department has launched investigations of more than 50 colleges and universities as part of a broader push against DEI programs. The Federal Communications Commission also moved to open an inquiry into DEI practices at Comcast. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)

“When we see these heated conversations at a partisan level about DEI, it really comes down to: How are they looking at American society today? Where do they see the problems? And that's going to lead to very different solutions and very different approaches,” said Democratic pollster Aileen Cardona-Arroyo of Hart Research Associates, which conducted the poll with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm.

Beneath the surface of the overall division in the electorate are wide gaps depending on voters' party affiliation and race. Fully 80% of Republicans believe there is too much political correctness, while 77% of Democrats say there is too much prejudice. Independents are split, with 46% saying there is too much political correctness and 43% saying there is too much prejudice.An overwhelming share of Republicans (85%) believe DEI programs should be eliminated, while the same share of Democrats believe they should continue. More independents side with Democrats on that question, with 59% saying DEI programs should continue and 39% saying they should be eliminated.  

And while younger people were more likely to support DEI programs than older respondents, the issue highlights another example of a wide gender gap among younger voters on politics in the Trump era.Among women ages 18 to 49, 67% say DEI programs should continue, while 31% want to eliminate them. But among men ages 18 to 49, 40% want to continue DEI programs, while 57% say they should be eliminated. More older women support DEI programs than older men, but the gap between them is not as large.

“The survey also points to there being more political intensity and salience for Republicans around these issues than there is for Democrats,” Cardona-Arroyo said, noting the overwhelmingly negative views of DEI programs from voters who make up Trump's base, including white men without a college education, self-described MAGA Republicans and self-described conservatives.

Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies said that Trump's actions on DEI and other issues such as immigration underscore the president's near-unified support from Republicans, which has bolstered Trump's early approval numbers.

“You can see how his efforts, including on DEI, are just really echoing with his core political base,” McInturff said. 

The survey also finds divisions along racial lines, with a majority of white voters saying DEI programs should end and that there is too much political correctness in society. White women with college degrees were the exception among white voters, with 59% saying there is too much prejudice and two-thirds saying DEI programs should continue. 

An overwhelming share of Black voters (80%) say DEI programs should persist, and 71% say there is too much prejudice in society today. The share of Latino voters in the survey was too small to analyze the group's overall views on the issue. 

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic — The family of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki has asked police in the Dominican Republic to declare her dead, a police spokesman said Monday.

Dominican Republic National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said Konanki's family has sent the agency a letter requesting a declaration of death.

Konanki, 20, was on spring break with friends in the Caribbean island nation when she disappeared early March 6. Despite an extensive search, her body has not been found.

The Konanki family did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

Konanki is a junior in biology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is from Loudoun County, Virginia, where her family lives. 

Konanki was last seen early March 6 after she went to the beach with friends. 

After her friends left the beach, she stayed behind with people she met on the trip. She vanished after 4:15 a.m. that day.

The last person thought to have seen Konanki has been identified as Joshua Riibe, 22, a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is from Rock Rapids, Iowa. 

Dominican authorities confiscated Riibe's passport Friday as part of an investigation, his attorneys told NBC News.

NBC News spotted Riibe with investigators and his attorney on a beach in Punta Cana early Sunday. He was seen pointing toward the sea while a group of security officials kept people away from the area.

Speaking exclusively to NBC News briefly at the resort where Konanki had been staying before she disappeared, and before he was spotted by NBC News on the beach, Riibe said, “I'm just trying to help them out,” adding: “The ocean is a dangerous place.”

Riibe “has been confined to the hotel since the investigation began. He is permanently escorted by the police anywhere he goes. So no, he is not free to leave,” the law firm representing him said in an email Saturday.

Pesqueira, the national police spokesperson, said no signs of violence were found at the beach.

A hotel spokesperson said red flags — which indicate “that the sea had a strong current and very high waves” — were flying when Konanki disappeared.

In an interview last week with Dominican investigators, Riibe said he was on the beach with Konanki shortly before she disappeared.

He said they were “in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,” according to a transcript of the interview obtained by NBC News. A wave crashed, taking them both “out to sea,” it quotes him saying.

“I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,” he said.

Riibe said he got Konanki back to shore before she disappeared.

“The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her answer,” he said. “I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she'd grabbed her things and left.”

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have said no one is considered a suspect in Konanki's disappearance. 

U.S. authorities have said it is a missing persons case and not a criminal matter.

Wildfires fueled by high winds continued to sweep across the state of Oklahoma on Monday. As Oklahomans assessed the devastation to their homes and property, officials warned of an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.

Residents are surveying damage from unusually vicious weather in multiple U.S. states where violent twisters, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires decimated entire neighborhoods. As of Sunday afternoon, at least 37 people had been killed as a sprawling storm barreled across the nation's midsection toward the East Coast.

PLANTERSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — Kim Atchison was hunkered down in her grandmother's storm shelter with her 5-year-old grandson Saturday night in their tiny Alabama hometown of Plantersville when her husband and son raced in.

“Get down; get all the way down to the bottom of the cellar,” they told her, saying they could see a twister coming.

Atchison said she remembers first the “dead silence” and then hearing the wind that felt like a funnel and things outside hitting against each other. 

“All was quiet after that because it was that fast,” she said. “Like a snap of a finger and it was gone.”

Atchison and her family were among the fortunate ones to avoid being killed in the three-day outbreak of severe weather across eight states that kicked up a devastating combination of wildfires, dust storms and tornadoes — claiming at least 42 lives since Friday.

Two people were killed by a twister in Plantersville. One of the lives lost was that of 82-year-old Annie Free, who “just looked out for everyone,” Atchison's husband said. The tornado struck Free's home, leaving only the front patio behind.

Darren Atchison spent Monday delivering granola bars and sports drinks to the pummeled neighborhood, driving his all-terrain vehicle around downed trees. 

More than a half-dozen houses were destroyed while others were left in rough shape, some with walls peeled clean off. The tornado flipped a trailer onto its roof and toppled trees in every direction.




When Heidi Howland emerged from her home after hiding in her bedroom underneath a mattress with her husband, kids and grandkids as the twister approached, she found fallen trees and broken car windows.

Many of her neighbors whose houses were damaged came to her front porch to take refuge from the rain after the storm passed Saturday night. One was Free's daughter, who Howland said cried late into the night because the first responders couldn't find her mother.

Free's body wasn't found until the morning.

Also killed was Dunk Pickering, a fixture in the community who often hosted live music events and helped neighbors during tough times. Neighbor John Green found Pickering's body in the wreckage of a building just across the street from Green's home. 

“Whether he knew you or not, he would help anyone,” Green said. “I've known him for 20 years. He's been like that ever since the day I first met him.”

Green and other neighbors spent at least five hours Saturday night pulling people from the rubble and carrying them to paramedics who were unable to reach the area because roads were blocked by debris.

Wind-driven wildfires across the state destroyed more than 400 homes over the weekend and will continue to be a threat in the coming days because of high winds. 

Dozens of fires were still burning across the state on Monday, said Keith Merckx at Oklahoma Forestry Services, and much of the state including the Oklahoma City area remained under fire warnings.

While conditions over the weekend allowed crews to get a handle on most wildfires across Texas and Oklahoma, forecasters at the National Weather Service said extremely critical fire weather conditions were expected Tuesday over an area spanning from southeastern New Mexico through the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma.

“These fires, once they get started, become really hard to stop. They move more quickly than our resources can keep up with,” Merckx said.

Four deaths so far were blamed on the fires or high winds, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. More than 70 homes were destroyed by wildfire outbreaks Friday in and around Stillwater, home to Oklahoma State University. 

In Mississippi, six people died and more than 200 were displaced by a string of tornadoes across three counties, the governor said. 

Within about an hour of each other on Saturday, two big tornadoes tore through Walthall County, Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service. The strongest one packed winds of 170 mph (274 kph) when it swept a well-built home from its foundation, leaving a pile of debris behind, the agency said in an updated report late Monday. 

Three people died in the county, including 7-year-old Carter Young, who was in a mobile home, Walthall County Coroner Chris Blackwell said. The other two people killed — Gabrielle Pierre, 34, and Jeffery Irvin, 42 — were in a mobile home next door to the one where Young was found, Blackwell said.

Scattered twisters and storm damage led to the deaths of at least 13 people in Missouri, including a 30-year-old man who along with his dog was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning after he was using a generator indoors during the storm, authorities said. In Arkansas, officials confirmed three deaths.

As the storm headed east, two boys ages 11 and 13 were killed when a tree fell on their home in western North Carolina early Sunday, firefighters in Transylvania County said. Firefighters found them amid the uprooted 3-foot-wide tree after relatives said they had been trapped in their bedroom, officials said. 

A tornado touched down at about 3 a.m. Monday in a neighborhood in Perquimans County, North Carolina, destroying three mobile homes and damaging several others, according to the National Weather Service. Eight people were injured in the community, with no reported deaths, the weather service said. The community is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Norfolk, Virginia. 

High winds spurred dust storms that led to almost a dozen deaths in car crashes Friday. 

Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has struck a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's biggest-ever acquisition at the same time it's facing a potential breakup of its internet empire. 

The proposed takeover announced Tuesday is part of Google's aggressive expansion into cloud computing during an artificial intelligence boom. The frenzy is driving demand for data centers that provide the computing power for AI technology and intensifying the competition in that space among Google and two other tech powerhouses, Microsoft and Amazon. 

If the all-cash transaction is approved by regulators, Wiz will join Google Cloud — an increasingly important part of its business separate from the search and advertising operations that account for most of the $350 billion annual revenue at Google's parent company, Alphabet. 

With the advent of AI, however, the cloud division has become a rising star at Google. Annual revenue in the division was $26.3 billion in 2022, and soared 64% to $43.2 billion last year. 

Wiz, a five-year-old startup founded by four longtime friends who met in the Israeli army when they were still teenagers, is on track for an estimated $1 billion in revenue this year. After getting its start in Israel in 2020, Wiz now oversees an operation that makes security tools protecting the information stored in data centers from its current headquarters in New York.

“Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,” Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote in a blog post.




In a Tuesday conference call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted Cloud division's addition of Wiz will result in even better security at a lower cost than can be provided now. That prediction may have been aimed as much at regulators likely to scrutinize how the deal will affect competition and pricing, as much as at prospective customers. 

Google had been courting Wiz for some time before finally settling on a price that's much richer than a reported $23 billion bid that was rejected last July. At that time, Wiz signaled it would instead pivot back to a previously-planned initial public offering. But recent volatility in the stock market has chilled the IPO market, and now Rappaport said Wiz expects to “innovate even faster” by becoming a part of Google.

Wedbush analysts called Google's move to buy Wiz “a shot across the bow” at other tech giants, particularly Microsoft and Amazon, who have already made big bets on cyber security as the fight to dominate cloud computing intensifies. Google had fallen behind its competition in the cloud space, Wedbush said, but the acquisition of Wiz could alter the parameters. 

The bid Tuesday easily eclipses the current largest acquisition in Google's 26-year history — a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012 that didn't pay off the way that the Mountain View, California, company had hoped. The $32 billion purchase of Wiz would also go down at the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition and rank among the 20 most expensive takeovers of a software company in history, according to Mergermarket, a financial intelligence service.

As often happens with high-priced acquisitions, investors reacted coolly to Tuesday's news as Alphabet's shares fell 3% during afternoon trading.

Some of Google's other acquisitions have turned into gold mines, most notably its $1.76 billion purchase of online video pioneer YouTube in 2006 and its $3.1 billion takeover of advertising technology platform DoubleClick in 2008. A $5.4 billion purchase of another security firm, Mandiant, in 2022 also helped fuel the recent growth of Google's Cloud division, which posted an operating profit of $6.1 billion last year.

Google's DoubleClick deal is now part of an antitrust case filed by the U.S. Justice Department targeting Google's technology for distributing ads across the internet. A ruling in that case, involving allegations that Google illegally abused its power to manipulate digital ad prices, is expected this year.

Regulators in the U.S. and abroad are targeting Google on other fronts, too.

Last year, a federal judge in another case brought by the Justice Department last year concluded Google had turned its ubiquitous search engine into an illegal monopoly. The penalization phase of that trial begins next month.

The Justice Department is seeking a rebuke that would include a requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser and would ban the company from making agreements with Apple and other companies to make its search engine the default tool for finding online information on the iPhone and other devices.

The Wiz deal will also get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to be more friendly to business deals, it has also shown itself to be leery of big tech. 

The Wiz deal raises antitrust concerns due to the potential impact on standalone cyber security vendors, as well as potential disruption for bigger rivals. Still, Wedbush's analysts note the industry is “ripe for consolidation” — which could pose “massive growth opportunities on the horizon heading into this AI Revolution.”

Antitrust worries were also believed among the reasons Wiz called off sales talks with Google last year while President Joe Biden's administration was seeking to block a variety of tech deals. Agreeing to a sale now indicates both Google and Wiz are more confident the deal will gain U.S. approval under the Trump administration, Mergermarket analysts Kevin Ketcham and Kevin McCaffrey wrote in a Tuesday note.

“The two sides likely wouldn't have struck the deal if they didn't at least see a potential path to closing,” Ketcham and McCaffrey wrote.

If they get the regulatory greenlight and meet several conditions spelled out in their agreement, Google and Wiz expect the deal to close in 2026.

Oops, something went wrong

At Nvidia's (NVDA) GTC event, the chipmaker added another big carmaker to its list of auto partners.

“I'm super-excited to announce that GM has selected Nvidia to partner with them to build their future self-driving fleet,” CEO Jensen Huang said. “The time for autonomous vehicles has arrived, and we're looking forward to building with GM AI for three areas — AI for manufacturing, AI for enterprise for how they work, and AI for in the car.”

Specifically, GM (GM) will use Nvidia's DRIVE AGX hardware system for in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.

Huang said the companies will also work together to build custom AI systems using Nvidia platforms like Nvidia Omniverse with Nvidia Cosmos to train AI manufacturing models to optimize GM's factory planning and robotics.

Last month, Nvidia announced that Toyota (TM) — the world's largest automaker — will begin using the company's DRIVE AGX Orin chip and the Nvidia DriveOS operating system to power advanced driver-assistance features in its next-generation vehicles.

Nvidia's chips are already used to power self-driving technologies at Mercedes (MGBAF), Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST), China's BYD (BYDDY), and device maker Foxconn, for example. Nvidia chips also power some of Tesla's supercomputers.

Nvidia's auto business is beginning to make some waves, and the chipmaker believes it is just getting started.

Case in point: "Fourth-quarter Automotive revenue was $570 million, up 27% from the previous quarter and up 103% from a year ago. Full-year revenue rose 55% to $1.7 billion," Nvidia revealed in its Q4 earnings release earlier this year.

“Nvidia's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the earnings conference call.

Oops, something went wrong

Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) new attempt to buy Israeli cloud cybersecurity startup Wiz is a fresh test for how aggressively President Trump's antitrust watchdogs will respond to moves by Big Tech.

While there is no guarantee regulators will greenlight the $32 billion all-cash deal merging Wiz into Google Cloud, the transaction may be on more solid footing than it was when first contemplated during the Biden administration.

That optimism is fueled by signs that Trump's antitrust enforcers may be willing to bend in cases where companies can argue that a tie-up would give the US an edge in the global race to dominate artificial intelligence.

"This deal will get careful scrutiny," said Michael Carrier, an antitrust law professor at Rutgers Law School, "but at the end of the day, I believe it is likely to be approved given an anticipated less aggressive blocking of mergers and the AI angle."

The deal would be the largest-ever acquisition for Alphabet, Google's parent company. Wiz leverages AI to enhance its primary business providing cloud security for major tech players, including Google, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL).

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during a webcast on Tuesday that the acquisition would help Google manage the accelerating pace and impact of cloud security breaches, including those introduced by AI.

"AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities," Pichai said.

Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said during the same webcast that the merged company would continue to integrate AI-powered cybersecurity tools for prioritizing threats, analyzing cloud security configurations for risks, and automating AI-powered remediation workflows.

Alphabet stock was down nearly 3% Tuesday afternoon amid a broader sell-off of tech names.

The tie comes after signs that Trump's antitrust officials at the Justice Department may take a lighter approach to AI enforcement.

In a March 7 filing, Trump's DOJ argued to a judge that Google should be able to keep its AI investments in companies such as Anthropic even if other parts of its empire are broken up following a federal judge's ruling that Google illegally monopolized online search markets.

On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order issued by President Biden that directed AI developers to apply AI "responsibly," including by disclosing their safety test results to the government.

The lighter-touch approach also has support from Congress.

JD Harriman noted that a congressional bipartisan task force on AI made it clear in its December report that lawmakers would take a "wait and see" attitude on AI regulation.

They expressed concern over China's AI advancements and the industry's potential impact on military strength, noting that the country had secured more AI patent applications, journal publications, and journal citations.

On his first day back in office, President Trump issued an executive order directing federal advisers in technology and national security to "enhance America's global AI dominance."

At the Paris AI Summit on Feb. 11, Vice President JD Vance then emphasized AI opportunity over safety concerns.

"I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago," Vance said. "I'm here to talk about AI opportunity."

"[T]o restrict its development now would not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations."

But Trump's antitrust cops aren't ignoring AI altogether. The FTC, for example, has broadened a probe into Microsoft (MSFT) and its relationship with AI upstart OpenAI, according to a Bloomberg report.

The probe was first launched by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, a key architect of a new movement seeking to expand the legal theories that can give rise to antitrust claims.

Harry First, a law professor at New York University School of Law, said the DOJ will look into the case of Alphabet and Wiz to "see whether Google has the incentive and ability to foreclose Amazon, let's say, or Microsoft, from the services that with supplies to them."

First said that if officials conclude that the deal threatens competition, Google and Wiz may be asked for concessions. "So this is where the switch of administrations may matter."

As for arguing that an AI connection should allow the deal to sail through, "I'm not sure how much weight, in the end, that's going to have,” he added.

“If they get to that point, they're sort of Hail Mary passing."

Oops, something went wrong

Nvidia (NVDA) stock slid as much as 3% Tuesday ahead of the AI chipmaker's annual GTC conference in California starting Tuesday.

CEO Jensen Huang is set to kick off the event with a keynote previewing what's ahead for the company. His commentary will likely be closely watched by investors evaluating whether the AI trade still has room to run.

Nvidia stock has experienced significant volatility in 2025. Shares started the year with a bang, hitting a record close above $149 in early January. They tumbled when a new AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek reignited concerns over an AI bubble and shaved nearly $600 billion from the chipmaker's market cap in a single day. In its most recent rout, following its fourth quarter earnings and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, Nvidia saw its market cap losses from its record close reach $1 trillion.

But Nvidia bull and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Tuesday that he believes the company's GTC event in San Jose, Calif., this week will be "a wake-up moment for the tech bulls."

Huang is expected to debut the company's upcoming Blackwell Ultra GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip), a successor to Nvidia's current-generation Blackwell AI chip, which the company said achieved full-scale production in the most recent quarter. Huang is also expected to preview Nvidia's Vera Rubin superchip, the next-gen version of its latest Grace Blackwell superchips.

Overall, tech stocks have led the stock market's recent downturn. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory on March 6, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) followed suit a week later, as Trump's tariffs and DOGE-driven cuts to federal jobs fueled concerns over inflation.

"We clearly need stable Trump policy and investors need to know the rules of the game ... but that will all happen over the coming months and we do not believe this dramatically changes the trajectory of the AI Revolution," wrote Ives, later adding, "We believe this week's Nvidia GTC Conference will be a turning point for tech stocks as the Street starts to refocus on the AI Revolution and the massive tech spending ahead for the coming years."

Ives wrote that he expects Huang to highlight Nvidia's "lingering worries about DeepSeek, and also focus on the physical AI future with autonomous and robotics," among other topics.

Truist analyst Will Stein also stayed bullish on Nvidia ahead of GTC, reiterating his Buy rating and $205 price target on the stock in a note to investors Tuesday.

Stein acknowledged bearish arguments against the AI trade: "The biggest investor concern (that was magnified by DeepSeek (private)) is that NVDA's customers are deploying too much AI compute capacity today, and that customers will subsequently enter a period of digestion, causing a cyclical downturn. To us, this dynamic is a certainty; the only question is on timing."

He continued: "The way NVDA might counter this narrative is to borrow a page from AVGO's [Broadcom's (AVGO)] playbook by highlighting customer 'commitments' to build large GPU clusters several years in the future [in other words, commitments to buying Nvidia's AI chips for the next few years]."

Stein continued: “We continue to view NVDA as *the* AI company. Its leadership position is owing less to the architecture, speed, or performance of its chips, and more to the results of its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive ongoing investment in software, training models, and services."

Over the last two years, the Big Four giants have been plagued by rumours of redundancies and now the situation has escalated to the senior partners. 

Over the weekend, The Sunday Times revealed that dozens of senior partners were at risk of being laid off at EY, the most significant redundancy plan in decades.

EY currently has 894 equity partners and 757 non-equity partners, but the paper revealed the firm is expected to axe 30 partners, mainly in its consulting division.

In addition to those facing the chopping block, it was reported that some equity partners will have their positions converted into non-equity partners.

The news about EY follows PwC which recently made a record number of cuts to its partner ranks while pausing its tech apprenticeship scheme to protect partner profits.

It is no secret that the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

EY reported last October that its UK net revenue grew by a single-digit percentage over 2024, but fee income remained flat due to a reduction in significant cross-border transactions.

Deloitte UK's revenue increased slightly by over two per cent, but its profit stalled. 

PwC UK reported single-digit growth in revenue, but this came against the backdrop of the group's profit and partner pay dropping again.

In January, KPMG UK revealed it recorded double-digit growth in profit before tax over 2024, but its revenue only increased by one per cent.

James O'Dowd, managing partner at Patrick Morgan, told City AM that “after years of aggressive post-pandemic hiring, [Big Four firms] are now cutting jobs to protect partner profits and rebalance bloated teams.”

He noted that the consulting boom that followed the pandemic has slowed, and these firms now need to correct that over-hiring strategy.

Fiona Czerniawska, CEO of Source Global Research, explained to City AM that the “relentless pace [of growth] slowed, partly due to the unfavourable macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop.”

She added that the “firms have since found themselves with too many and too expensive people”.

In addition, these firms have focused on considerable investments in technology, including AI. 

Czerniawska noted the aim is “firms will be able to grow and deliver more work, without recruiting evermore talent.”

Over 900 roles were made redundant at the UK Big Four firms in 2024, and some 1,800 jobs were cut in 2023.

The latest moves by EY and PwC have piqued a lot of interest as they focus on the senior partnership level.

Partners manage the firm together, but the equity partners are the ones that own and pull their shares out of the profit pool.

O'Dowd explained: “A major source of frustration for high-performing partners has been the burden of carrying dozens of underperforming colleagues who have contributed little revenue over the past years while still drawing from the profit pool.”

“Many top performers feel their compensation is being diluted by those who do not generate revenue or drive growth, making these redundancies a necessary and inevitable step,” he added.

The firms have been trying to fix their career ladders for some time. Senior PwC staff in the UK, who will never make a partner, were offered ‘managing director' roles last year.

The move behind the ‘managing director' role is to keep senior talent engaged without touching the profit pool.

“This is a turning point for the Big Four,” O'Dowd stated, adding, “The old promise—work your way up and become a partner—no longer holds in the same way.”

“With fewer equity seats, alternative career paths emerging, and AI-driven disruption accelerating, the traditional firm structure is under pressure,” he added.

Despite the losses at the Big Four, the consultancy sector is expected to expand this year. 

Tamzen Isacsson, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association (MCA) noted: “We're upbeat about growth prospects this year with forecast increases in revenue of 6.4 per cent in 2025 and 8.7 per cent in 2026, according to our latest independent research“.

“We're seeing much more activity and opportunity in the market than this time last year,” Isacsson added.

However, MCA's report in January 2024 said activity in the sector was predicted to return “to double digits growth in 2025 (11 per cent)”.

AirExplore, a Slovakia-based contract carrier for other airlines, is disengaging from cargo flying because of limited demand for narrowbody freighters and will focus on its passenger business, FreightWaves has learned.

The news follows other recent examples of small or midsize airlines that provide supplemental capacity to network carriers discontinuing or downsizing cargo operations amid a glut of standard-size freighters and stagnant parcel volumes.

AirExplore, a subsidiary of Lithuanian-owned holding company Avia Solutions Group, earlier this month issued a vague statement about changing its approach to cargo operations to align with market conditions. The statement was buried in a news release about airlines securing additional airlift from third-party providers to keep up with travel demand.

The airline is reducing its cargo fleet by two or three aircraft, returning aircraft to lessors and subleasing some units to other carriers because of the slowdown in business, spokesperson Silvije Sileike said in an email message. It continues to seek long-term transportation service agreements for its remaining aircraft.






“We were presuming that the e-commerce and narrow-body freighter market would grow more significantly after Covid, but the situation in the market is not as we expected. Currently, we are optimizing our fleet and focusing on the passenger business,” she explained.

As recently as last month, AirExplore's operating fleet included eight Boeing 737-800 converted freighter aircraft. It added some cargo jets last year and in November earned U.S. approval to begin passenger and cargo operations in U.S. airspace under a conditional foreign carrier permit using large aircraft on charter from other providers. 

Aircraft tracking site Flightradar24 shows only two cargo jets currently in operation – one in Europe and one in Africa. The Planespotters.net database shows three aircraft are in parked status.

Sileike said AirExplore has leased one freighter aircraft to Allied Air Nigeria, which operates for DHL Express in Africa, and another to Ascend Airways Malaysia, a new carrier owned by Avia Solutions Group that expects to begin operations late this year. Air Ascend Malaysia, a business-to-business passenger and cargo airline, is waiting for Malaysian authorities to issue an air operators certificate. 






AirExplore's rethink about air cargo operations is not unique. Sister company SmartLynx Airlines is shelving its fleet of Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters after losing a contract with DHL Express in Europe and having difficulty finding other customers. It too is returning planes to lessors, placing some aircraft with affiliated companies and subleasing to other carriers.

Avia Solutions Group last year shut down Iceland-based Bluebird Nordic, which operated Boeing 737-400 and 737-800 converted freighters, because it couldn't generate enough business during and after the airfreight downturn that lasted until the second half of 2023. The airline, which provided crewed aircraft to DHL, FedEx, UPS and other airlines, returned its fleet to lessors.

Canadian passenger airline WestJet closed its freighter division, which utilized four 737-800s, after one year because it couldn't generate enough business providing scheduled cargo service.





Global Crossing Airlines in Miami last year capped its freighter fleet at four Airbus A321 freighters because of thin business but has recently seen a pickup in demand.

Miami-based Amerijet, which operates larger Boeing 767 converted freighters, cut its fleet in half over the past two years and currently runs about 11 aircraft.

            The leaders of several US-funded international networks have instructed their organizations to continue broadcasting, ignoring a Trump administration order, because they believe last weekend's terminations were unlawful, according to a person involved in the matter.
    


            The entities – including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks – are continuing to operate around the world while network executives contemplate next steps, including potential legal action.
    


            Lisa Curtis, who chairs the board of Radio Free Europe, wrote on LinkedIn that “our pro bono legal team is prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that RFE/RL continues its Congressionally authorized mission.”
    


            The source who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity did not say if or when a formal legal challenge will happen.
    


            In the meantime, the broadcasters are reporting on the uncertainty over their future.
    


            The top story on the English-language edition of Radio Free Asia's website Tuesday morning noted that “Asian dissidents” and activists were voicing “dismay” over the funding freeze.
    


            President Trump signed an executive order on Friday night calling for the dismantling of the US Agency for Global Media and several other federal agencies. The next morning, journalists at the Voice of America were told to stop working immediately, and employees were placed on administrative leave. Some were officially laid off on Sunday while others remain in a holding pattern.
    


            Voice of America's website is now frozen in time, with old articles like “forecasters warn of tornadoes in US in coming days” still on the home page, even though the stories from Saturday are now out of date.
    


            VOA employees work directly for the federal government, which is why Trump loyalist Kari Lake – recently named a senior adviser to the agency – was able to take such dramatic action.
    


            But most of the agency's other networks are structured as nonprofit organizations that are funded through federal grants, and that distance is making a big difference right now.
    


            Lake sent memos to the networks on Saturday telling them that their grants were terminated, effective immediately, and suggesting that any unused funds must be refunded.
    


            For the journalists who work at the networks, and believe in the mission of providing uncensored news coverage to censored parts of the world, the precipitous termination was a gut punch.
    


            But leaders of the networks said reporting and programming would continue for the time being.
    


            As Radio Free Asia noted in one of its stories, “staff at RFA were still working Monday and the Washington-based news organization has yet to announce how the funding freeze would impact operations.”
    


            Executives are trying to preserve what little money is left, the person involved in the matter told CNN, while coming up with a careful response to Lake's memo.
    


            One outstanding question is whether Lake had the authority to order the funding freeze. The memos identified her as “senior advisor to the acting CEO with authorities delegated by acting CEO.”
    


            Another question has to do with the separation of powers. Radio Free Europe's story about the dispute on Monday repeatedly referred to its “Congress-approved funding.” Curtis wrote on LinkedIn that the termination violates the statute that governs Radio Free Europe and “violates Congressional appropriations laws.”
    


            Over the weekend the American Foreign Service Mission, which represents some VOA employees, said that “unilaterally stripping a congressionally established agency of its core functions amounts to an affront to the constitutional balance of powers.”
    


            A USAGM spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            In Washington on Monday State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the rapid dismantling of the agency “a fluid situation.”
    


            People with knowledge of the situation in both Europe and Asia expressed concern that some journalists could be left in harms' way due to the funding freeze.
    


            Specifically, there are Russian-born journalists living in exile in Europe and working for Radio Free Europe who face imprisonment if they return home.
    


            “If they lose their jobs, that could trigger visa expirations, leaving them essentially in legal limbo,” another source told CNN. “Without further support in the countries where they're currently located, they face the risk of being stateless, deportation – things like that are all possibilities.”
    


            “A lot of people who are citizens of authoritarian countries… are extremely worried, because this could leave them very vulnerable” and upend the “safe haven” they had been granted, the source added.
    


            Although European countries could create legal routes for the most vulnerable journalists, nothing has yet been agreed.
    


            A number of European lawmakers and diplomats have rallied around Radio Free Europe since Saturday, with some suggesting that Europe could provide some funding to fill the American void.
    


            In an interview on “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Russian-American journalist Alsu Kermasheva said Radio Free Europe provides audiences in Russia, Iran and other countries with crucial access to information.
    


            Without the networks, there will be an “empty space” in the global media, and “Russia and Chinese propaganda will fill in,” Kermasheva said.
    


            But for the moment, “we are still in business,” she added, encouraging financial and legal support for the embattled broadcaster.

The SpaceX capsule carrying astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams undocked from the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. ET Tuesday, beginning the pair's long-awaiting trip to Earth. (SpaceX)

Stranded NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams successfully undocked from the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. Tuesday and began their long-awaited journey back home after more than nine months in space.

Wilmore and Williams are returning home in a SpaceX capsule with fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Alexander Gorbunov. They are expected to splashdown off the Florida coast at 5:57 p.m. on Tuesday.

Hours before their departure from the ISS, President Donald Trump said he had been in contact with NASA's acting administrator, Janet Petro, who is coordinating the mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back home.

"She is coordinating our Team of highly respected Scientists, Space Engineers, and various other ‘geniuses,' who has agreed to let our Astronauts come home long prior to the two week period originally approved by NASA," Trump wrote, in part. "Janet was great. She said, ‘Let's bring them home NOW, Sir!' — And I thanked her."

The president also took a swipe at his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and accused him of "forgetting" about Wilmore and Williams. Trump also spoke about Elon Musk and SpaceX's involvement in the return mission.

"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so," Trump claimed. "They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents."

"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home — Taking off tomorrow, and landing on Wednesday," he continued.

Trump also added that officials will release more information about the astronauts' return in the coming days. 

"Safety always comes first, and maximum standards are being adhered to. But after eight long months for a mission that was supposed to be eight days, IT IS TIME," he concluded. "I look forward to seeing Butch and Suni, and thank you again to NASA and Janet Petro!"

President Donald Trump thanked acting NASA administrator Janet Petro for coordinating the mission to bring stranded NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back home.

Williams and Wilmore had been stranded on the ISS since June of last year. 

Originally planning to only be in space for a week, they patiently waited for a return to Earth after issues forced NASA to bring the Boeing Starliner back empty last summer.

The inaugural 'National Geographic 33' list includes the likes of Don Cheadle, Selena Gomez, Sterlin Harjo, Michelle Yeoh and Jason Momoa.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	When the National Geographic Society published the first issue of its namesake magazine in September of 1888, it was, in the words of the publication, “a very staid affair.” There were no photos (those didn't arrive until 1905), and the articles were more akin to what you might find in a scientific journal than a popular magazine.


	Suffice it to say National Geographic evolved over the years, eventually leaning into photography and exploration, bringing the natural and human world to its readers every week during the heyday of magazines, and then every day amid the digital revolution.

	Now, National Geographic is embarking on what it is calling one of its most ambitious efforts yet: A new multi-platform list to highlight and celebrate 33 individuals (in honor of the 33 founders of the Society) “whose imaginative ideas and unstoppable drive are making the world a better place.” The inaugural National Geographic 33 will be featured in the April issue of the magazine, an interactive digital platform, and in a social video series.

	The inaugural list includes familiar faces to Hollywood, including actors Don Cheadle, Jason Momoa, Michelle Yeoh, Edward Norton, Selena Gomez, musicians Bjork and Arlo Parks, and writer-producers like Adam McKay and Sterlin Harjo, as well as some names that may be less familiar, like climate activist Jennifer Uchendu, endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh, and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard.


	You can see the full list of honorees, as well as video and multimedia content, here.


	“For more than 137 years, National Geographic has been driven by the belief that bold thinking and collective action can change the world. This principle is what inspired National Geographic's 33 founder —committed explorers, scientists and scholars—all those years ago,” said Courteney Monroe, president of National Geographic content, in a statement. “Since then and across all our platforms, National Geographic has believed in the power of visual storytelling to spark curiosity and inspire a deeper connection to our world. The inaugural National Geographic 33 represents an exciting milestone for us, as it embodies the very essence of our brand—sharing the stories of extraordinary individuals whose work is making a meaningful impact in the hope of inspiring others to help shape a better future.”

	











	“With the National Geographic 33, we're honoring a diverse group of changemakers, from all over the world and different walks of life, who aren't just recognizing the urgent challenges of our time, they are taking action to address them,” adds Nathan Lump, senior VP and editor-in-chief of National Geographic. “They all share a deep commitment to shaping a better future, and in shining a light on them and their contributions, we hope to elevate their work and showcase to a wide audience the positive impact they're making.”


National Geographic is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Society, with Disney owning a controlling stake which acquired the brand in its deal with Fox. Disney has incorporated the Nat Geo brand in its TV and streaming services, with a particular focus on documentary series.


	It hired Lump in 2022, with a mandate to harmonize the goals of both Disney and the Society, and to try and bring the media brand into a future less forgiving for traditional magazines.


	It is a strategy that has had some success with other storied publications. Time magazine, after all, has turned its Person of the Year and Time 100 list as bona fide franchises, and has had success pushing into film and TV production. Now National Geographic is betting that it can do the same.


	You can see the launch video for the National Geographic 33, below.

Something went wrong

The FTSE 100 and European stocks ticked upwards on Tuesday, while US stocks retreated, as tensions flare again in the Middle East and traders look to central bank meetings later in the week.

On Tuesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said that more than 400 people were killed overnight in air strikes by Israeli forces.

The strikes end a ceasefire which came into effect on 19 January and after talks to extend the ceasefire failed to reach an agreement.

Commodity-related stocks, oil prices and gold rallied in response.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.2% by the closing bell in London. Among top gainers were miners Antofagasta (ANTO.L) as well as oil major BP (BP.L).

Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.8%, as the country's ZEW economic survey beat expectations.

The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris ticked up 0.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) rose 0.5%.

US stocks fell, as traders look to the two-day Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting, which commences today. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee also meets this week, with announcements on the rate path due on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.7% and 1%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 1.6% lower.

Uncertainty still dogs markets as investors debate whether the sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 into correction territory is over. Many on Wall Street don't think the recent bump in stocks signals a clear bottom, amid concerns that president Donald Trump's trade war will hit already weakening economic growth.

Shares in chipmaker Intel rose 2.2% on Monday, after a near-7% bump on Monday, as Lip-Bu Tan prepares to take on the role of CEO.

The stock surged last week after it was announced that chip industry veteran Tan, who has previous served on Intel's board, was taking the helm. Tan is taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. The duo succeeded former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by Intel's board in late 2024.

Reuters reported on Monday that Tan has considered major changes to Intel's chip manufacturing methods and its AI strategy in a bid to turnaround the struggling technology giant.

At a town hall last week, Tan reportedly told employees that Intel would need to make some "tough decisions".

Last year, Intel posted an annual loss of $19bn, which marked its first since 1986, according to Reuters.

Here's Reuters with the info:

Vicky McKeever writes:

Shares in electric vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) fell 4.8% on Monday, with the stock now down 41% since the start of the year.

Shares have halved in value, as of Monday's closing price of $238, since hitting an all-time high closing price of $479.86 in December on the back of US president Donald Trump's election win.

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has faced increasing backlash over his involvement with the Trump administration, heading up the the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His cost-cutting initiative across federal agencies, seeing mass layoffs, has sparked protests at Tesla dealerships across the US.

Meanwhile, data released last month has shown falling sales in Tesla (TSLA) in Europe, where Musk has also made high-profile inventions in politics.

The Financial Times reported on Tuesday, that short sellers had made $16bn in profit from betting against Tesla (TSLA) shares.

Tesla shares were down nearly 1% in pre-market trading on Monday, which came as Chinese EV maker BYD (002594.SZ) unveiled a new ultra-fast five-minute charging system.

The pound is higher against the dollar in early European trading, touching $1.30, a level it had not breached since November.

The uptick is largely attributed to a weaker dollar, which has come under pressure in recent weeks. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is down almost 6% from a two-year peak set in mid-January amid worries that Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries could push the US economy into a recession.

Volatility around sterling is expected this week, particularly with the Bank of England's upcoming policy meeting on Thursday. Investors will be keenly watching for any indications on interest rates, with expectations that the central bank will keep rates unchanged at 4.5%.

Meanwhile, sterling was lower against the euro (GBPEUR=X) on Tuesday morning, at €1.1870.

Trustpilot is rallying in early trade in London, up around 1% as of the time of writing.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:

Pedro Goncalves writes:

The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.5% on Thursday, as it navigates the fallout from US president Donald Trump's trade war and mixed signals from the UK economy.

Since August last year, the BoE has been gradually reducing borrowing costs, offering some relief to mortgage holders. At its February meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 in favour of a rate cut to 4.5%.

However, governor Andrew Bailey has stressed the importance of a “gradual and careful approach” to further rate cuts.

Markets indicate a 95% chance of a rate hold this month, with a 77% probability of a cut at the MPC's May meeting and a 55.6% likelihood of a reduction in August. This marks a significant shift from January, when traders only expected one rate cut for the year, in February, according to Morningstar.

In a yearly update to the basket of items the Office for National Statistics (ONS) uses to calculate UK price rises, pulled pork, virtual reality headsets and yoga mats have been added to the calculation, while local newspaper adverts and DVD rental prices have been taken out.

The virtual basket contains over 700 carefully selected items representative of the goods and services that consumers typically spend their money on.

The inflation basket is updated once a year by the ONS to take account of the changing tastes and habits of UK consumers and to ensure the official yardstick of the cost of living is as accurate as possible. This year, VR headsets make their way into the basket for the first time.

"As a rapidly emerging technology, we have seen growing expenditure on this item, which is expected to continue," the ONS said.

China announced a plan to "boost consumption" over the weekend. Neil Wilson, analyst at TipRanks, breaks it down:

Nvidia stock futures are currently up around 0.7% ahead of the GTC.

Our US team writes:

Nvidia (NVDA) kicks off its annual GTC conference on March 18 with a keynote by CEO Jensen Huang from the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. The event, which runs through March 21, will feature workshops and training for developers and engineers, panels and discussions related to AI and robotics, and exhibits from companies showing off how they're using Nvidia's products in the real world.

Huang is expected to debut the company's latest flagship AI chip: the Blackwell Ultra. A souped-up version of Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip, Blackwell Ultra should get a performance boost over last year's chip to further speed up training and running AI models.

We should also learn more about Nvidia's next-generation GPU platform, dubbed Rubin, and the successor to its Grace line of CPUs, Vera. The combined superchip will be called Vera Rubin, named for the American astronomer, and will take the place of the current Grace Blackwell superchip at the top of Nvidia's hierarchy of AI processors.

During Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call, Huang teased that he'd also discuss the follow-up to Rubin. Nvidia, like most chip companies, is known for providing a broad look at its roadmap to help customers and developers prepare for their upcoming products.

Gold (GC=F) continues to hover around the $3,000 all-time high. Haven demand continues to be pushed worldwide as market volatility rattles investors. It hit its stride in early trade, eheading 0.7% higher.

Bloomberg reported:

From our US team:

US stock future slide after Wall Street digested a second day of gains and braced for the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting.

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.2%, the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F) slid 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (NQ=F) slumped 0.5%.

On Monday, stocks continued to recover from last week's sell-off, which saw the S&P 500 enter correction territory amid concerns about the US economy's ability to sustain President Donald Trump's trade war.

Wall Street's attention is now turning to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which kicks off on Tuesday. The central bank will announce its next monetary policy decision Wednesday.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank will exercise caution when it comes to rate cuts and seek out more economic data. The Fed is largely expected to hold rates steady this week.

Review platform Trustpilot has reported a double-digit increase in revenue and earnings as business adoption and brand awareness “fuel the flywheel”.

Its share price rose more than 13 per cent in early trades. 

The company told markets this morning that revenue rose 19 per cent in the year ended December 31, to $210m (£161m) from $176m (£135) last year.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 55 per cent to $24.1m (£18.6m), supported by operating leverage in general and administrative expenses. 

Trustpilot will continue its share buyback programme by up to £20m this year, adding to the £33m in buybacks in 2024. 

Bookings, which refer to the annual value of contracts signed or renewed with Trustpilot, rose 26 per cent year on year to $239m (£184m). 

Although it is free for users, Trustpilot operates a freemium model for businesses where firms can pay to show Trustpilot reviews on their website.

Trustpilot said the growth in business adoption and brand awareness is “fuelling the flywheel” and supporting bookings by businesses.

“The new product features such as market insights and review spotlight have been well received, and we are encouraged by the number of customers moving up onto higher plans,” the company said.

Consumer adoption continued to grow, with a 23 per cent increase in reviews on the platform to 301m.

Fiona Orford-Williams, Director of TMT at Edison Group, said: “Trustpilot's full year results were as signalled in its January update… in excess of what the market was then forecasting. 

“Trustpilot has continued to innovate to drive additional value for its customers through AI-driven insights.

“The outlook for the current year is… a further good step up in margins as the [business] reaps the benefits of scale.”

The company expects constant currency revenue growth in the high teens this year, with adjusted EBITDA slightly ahead of market expectations and a 2 percentage point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin.

“Our strategy is clear: we operate an open, trusted platform for consumers to help each other make the right choices, and for businesses to build trust, grow, and improve,” CEO Adrian Blair said, adding that he wanted to maximise the platform's “inherent network effects”. 

“We executed well against this in 2024, delivering record bookings, profitability and cash generation, returning $42.9m (£33m) of capital to shareholders through two share buybacks. 

“We refreshed our go-to-market approach by simplifying our packages and updating our pricing. Product innovation is at the heart of our offering and in April we introduced new features which provide unique insights into consumer behaviour and market dynamics.

“Looking forward, we will continue to deliver product innovation to embed trust across commerce, as trust becomes even more important in the age of AI.”

DALLAS — Southwest's iconic blue, red and yellow planes may still be recognizable in the sky after its recent moves — but underneath, the company will operate a lot more like its competition in the skies.

Only time will tell whether that's a good or bad thing.

On March 11, the Dallas-based carrier announced it would do away with its “bags fly free” policy. Alongside other hallmarks of the brand, two free checked bags helped Southwest craft a customer-friendly image for decades. Now that many of those policies are on the chopping block, the airline's offerings are more in line with other carriers.

It remains to be seen whether that will work to Southwest's benefit, but it shows how the company has been forced to juggle the demands of impatient investors, loyal customers and the stark realities of its bottom line.

“Time will tell how consumers view the brand, because it is no longer going to have a real differentiated product,” said Nick Ewen, managing editor at The Points Guy.

“So will it be able to maintain the differentiated feel, the je ne sais quoi, the intangible?”

Southwest is preparing a raft of changes that will be implemented in the near future:

Free bags limited to loyalty program members, Business Select, branded credit cardholders and select others;

Assigned seating;

Premium seating;

International partnership with Icelandair;

Flight credits that only last a year;

New “basic” nonrefundable fare that's ineligible for changes or flight credits;

Reduced loyalty points rates for certain fares; and

First “redeye” flights.

According to an internal memo from Southwest Vice President of Inflight Operations Steve Murtoff viewed by The Dallas Morning News, updated boarding procedures and retrofitted, larger overhead bins are also on the way (though not till 2026) to accommodate a jump in carry-on bags.

“It's undeniable Southwest Airlines is rapidly evolving,” Murtoff said in the memo. “We are in a fight for our future and must quickly adapt to drive our profitability and encourage customer loyalty.”

The scale of Southwest's transformation has been augmented by its speed. The first hint at what was to come came during the company's first-quarter earnings call in 2024.

At the time, CEO Bob Jordan implied the airline was reconsidering its open seating policy. The why wasn't clear then, but the picture has crystalized over time.

June brought the beginning of Southwest's public fight with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, who disclosed an 11% stake in the company in tandem with biting critiques for Southwest's management and finances.

By July, open seating was dead. As Elliott mounted even more pressure, Southwest tried to fight it off. But despite the airline's efforts, Elliott reached the ownership threshold to call meetings in early September.

By the end of the month, Southwest's board of directors was remade to Elliott's liking, and the airline unveiled a “transformational plan” that detailed many of the changes angering customers today.

Jordan has denied that the changes were forced by Elliott, arguing it was “because we owe all of our shareholders better financial performance.” But the investor's influence is hard to ignore.

In a simplified world, Southwest's new policies would boost revenue, while other measures like buyouts and its first-ever layoffs, would cut costs.

However, the industry isn't that simple. For an airline that has always stood out from the crowd — and gained a loyal following because of it — some think these moves risk Southwest losing what helped make it the largest airline by domestic passenger volume in the first place.

Ewen says the task for Southwest will be striking a balance between luring new customers, which could potentially improve financials, and keeping existing customers happy.

But that task has gotten harder.

Southwest joined third-party booking platforms for the first time last year, starting with Google Flights. Analytics from these platforms would eventually get cited by Jordan as a reason for axing “bags fly free” after defending it in September.

These platforms conveniently let customers compare flights, but they also pit airlines against one another. Since Southwest's fare bundled everything and some fares don't bundle anything, it made the company's prices look high by comparison, according to Morningstar Industrials Equity Analyst Nicolas Owens.

That has put Southwest in a pinch, Owens said, as all air carriers fight to increase market share. Surging labor costs have put upwards pressure on fares, while factors such as inflation have made certain customers more sensitive to price.

Other customers, though, have become even more willing to shell out for an elevated experience, increasing demand for premium options.

“Without these options to price discriminate, Southwest just had a blunt instrument trying to pick off these little customer segments,” Owens said. “One size fits all does not work in a more picky product market.”

And Southwest needed to pick up more customer segments. In 2018, Southwest led the industry with 20% of the domestic market. That's now down to 17%, and Delta and American have taken the lead.

Meanwhile, Southwest has remained profitable, but that pot of money has progressively shrunk over the past three years. The airline's stock price has dived nearly 50% since hitting a post-COVID recovery peak of nearly $62 in April 2021.

“I think it's ultimately necessary and probably not surprising in the long run that they would have made some of these changes,” Owens said.

Yet Marbue Brown, author of Blueprint For Customer Obsession, a book that used Southwest as a case study on customer experience, thinks Southwest getting rid of its cherished perks may actually exacerbate financial issues.

“This transformation is going in the wrong direction. That's just my straight-up take,” he said. “I'm just concerned that Southwest is losing its anchor, and once they do, they're also going to lose customers and lose market share.”

The Ship of Theseus thought experiment asks whether an object is the same object if all of the components have been replaced over time. So is Southwest still Southwest if all its distinctive features have been replaced?

In a presentation with J.P. Morgan Chase this past week, Jordan argued the airline is “more than a policy. We're more than the way we paint our aircraft.”

“Southwest is all about very tangible things,” he said, referencing things like its point-to-point network. “But we're also about the intangibles, the best people in the business, the best hospitality in the business. And none of that is going to change.”

Morningstar's Owens largely agreed, and dismissed concerns that policy changes would affect Southwest's unique vibe.

“I think that the idea that Southwest culture somehow permanently goes away ... is overstated,” he said. “I think they still have probably the funnest flight attendants and kind of team spirit that you don't see everywhere.”

The analyst said Southwest did a lot of legwork to rebuild trust after its 2022 holiday meltdown, simply by getting passengers from Point A to Point B more efficiently. Part of that credit belongs to having good workers.

“They definitely pick people of a certain personality to deliver a certain kind of experience. And to that extent, they will probably still have some uniqueness to them,” said Brown.

“But if the policies are not supportive of the people, if the whole fly-feel doesn't work together, you're not going to get Herb Kelleher's Southwest Airlines,” he said.

While each change can, in a vacuum, improve financials, and Southwest can do its best to keep that quirky culture, airlines are a complicated web of real people and logistics.

Brown pointed out that baggage fees means more carry-ons, which means less available overhead space and more gate-checked bags. That makes boarding more stressful and potentially frustrating.

The best flight attendants can't make more overhead space appear or make oversized backpacks fit in the bag sizer. Over time, that unique vibe begins to fade.

“As they make this tweak here, and they make this tweak there, there are dominoes that are falling,” Brown said.

“As these dominoes fall, I think what you will wind up seeing is that, the more they look like other companies, then some of the other companies that do well from a customer experience perspective might surface as legit competitors to them.”

According to Crypto Rover, a potential full ceasefire and permanent peace negotiation between Trump and Putin is seen as highly bullish for Bitcoin. This development could lead to increased investor confidence in cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset during times of geopolitical stability.

Boxford police Detective Nathaniel Peabody presents a check for the recovered cryptocurrency funds to resident Paul Miller at the station.

BOXFORD — Police say they have successfully recovered funds for a Boxford resident who fell victim to a sophisticated PayPal/Bitcoin scam last summer, marking the first time in Essex County authorities have been able to seize and reclaim cryptocurrency from an exchange.

The case began June 26, when the resident reported being scammed out of $13,000 after receiving a fraudulent email from PayPal, Boxford police said in a news release this week. The scam led the victim to a phone number displayed on his computer, where he was misled into believing a refund error had occurred and instructed to send funds back via Bitcoin.

Tech giant Microsoft shared a new report warning of malware that targets 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets used with the Google Chrome extension.



Microsoft's Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post.



According to the team, the malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet.



While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software.



“Due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape,” the team wrote.

It is not every day that you hear someone call Bitcoin BTCUSD not just a bad investment but outright harmful to the economy. But then again, Peter Schiff is not just anyone. 

The economist, known as the biggest skeptic of cryptocurrencies and an equally popular gold proponent, has once again taken aim at Bitcoin, this time framing it as a destructive force for the United States of America. 

While his views might not sit well with crypto enthusiasts, Schiff's arguments are hard to ignore, especially when you look at what is happening on the markets.

Bitcoin will cause a lot of people to lose a lot of money, and its been very harmful to the U.S. economy.

Bitcoin vs. gold

The precious metal has been on a tear recently, closing above $3,000 for the first time ever, a milestone that Schiff believes is just the beginning. Silver, too, is flexing its muscles, trading at $34.10, while U.S. stocks are lagging behind their foreign counterparts. 

The expert points out the irony in the new U.S. administration's reported moves: selling domestic stocks to buy foreign ones and, as he alleges, dumping Bitcoin to invest into gold. It is an occurrence that, in his view, shows where smart money is at.TradingView">

But let's talk about Bitcoin for a moment. Schiff is not buying the hype, and he is not alone. Since its peak in November 2021, the cryptocurrency has lost 26% of its value against gold, a trend that Schiff says underscores the growing outflow of investors from crypto to the precious metal.

“What do you think they're buying with the money?” he asks, pointing to the downtrend in Bitcoin's price as evidence that gold is leaving "crypto in the dust."

Then there's inflation

He argues that while the "tariff war" is often blamed for rising prices, the real issue is inflation - something the Federal Reserve has failed to take under control. 

As the cost of goods climbs higher, Schiff believes gold will continue to shine, while Bitcoin's so-called resilience will be put to the test as ETF investors start cashing out.

For now, Bitcoin is indeed struggling, losing the $82,000 price point today. But whether Schiff's predictions come true remains to be seen.

Bitcoin could shoot up in the near future.

The wider crypto market is certain to feel the change if the Federal Reserve ends its quantitative tightening program in May. There is some indication that this could happen, with crypto prediction platform Polymarket anticipating a high probability of that occurring.



This policy permits the central bank to sell bonds that reduce the supply of cash floating around in order to keep inflation low and keep the economy in a safe place. If this policy winds down, as many expect it to, that could drastically increase the value of cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin. Because these digital funds get a large part of their value from their limited supply, they could become more valuable if the U.S. government takes its hands off the fiat currency supply.

Bitcoin is down 0.95% today to $82,273 (BTC/USD), and it has gained slightly over the last week. Tariff concerns and sticky inflation are keeping Bitcoin low, as both of these factors limit how much money people have available to risk on cryptocurrency.

Discretionary spending has been tight this year, with January marked as a month of high consumer prices and tight inflation. February was a bit better, but the economy is still in a rough spot, and the stock market is also being hit hard by new tariff policies that have kept the stock indices negative for four weeks. All of this hurts cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and makes investors wary of putting their money into decentralized finance.

What may happen, though, if the Federal Reserve decides to decrease their quantitative tightening (QT), is that Bitcoin and other crypto tokens could shoot up. This may happen near the end of April in anticipation of the end of QT. That could bring Bitcoin back over the $100K mark in a big way. While it is still unlikely that the coin will hit $150K this year, it is the potential for QT ending that holds the most promise right now that Bitcoin will skyrocket.

Investors are also hoping that President Donald Trump will improve the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrency. If that happens this year, it could mean that there will be fewer crypto restrictions, and it will become easier to trade Bitcoin.

Key Takeaways

The biggest financial manager in the world, BlackRock, just bought Bitcoin valued at $42.3 million, therefore underlining its increasing dedication to digital assets. Especially via its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has drawn significant investor attention, the company has progressively raised its exposure to Bitcoin.

The purchase fits BlackRock's more general plan of increasing its range of cryptocurrencies. The new Bitcoin acquisition by BlackRock fits CEO Larry Fink's changing attitude on cryptocurrencies, from doubt to strong encouragement. Institutional players like BlackRock are positioned to gain from Bitcoin's long-term growth as acceptance of the cryptocurrency picks speed. The company's ongoing Bitcoin accumulation points to growing faith in its function as a store of value and counter against economic volatility.

BlackRock's interest in Bitcoin is notable given its weight in conventional finance. With more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM), the company's support of Bitcoin provides institutional investors contemplating exposure to digital assets with a great confirmation.  Since its introduction, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has been performing rather well and drawing billions of inflows.

Apart from BlackRock's investment, ARK Invest under Cathie Wood bought $88.5 million worth of Bitcoin, therefore proving institutional conviction in the commodity. Regularly raising its visibility via both direct investments and its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), ARK Invest has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin's promise.



This purchase fits ARK Invest's optimistic long-term view of Bitcoin; Cathie Wood has projected that by 2030 Bitcoin might be valued at $1 million each coin. In the changing financial scene, the company sees Bitcoin as a major asset especially as demand for distributed assets driven by global economic instability and inflation worries shapes the scene.

One of the most ardent institutional backers of Bitcoin, ARK Invest's most recent acquisition lends more validity to the asset's prospective.

With BlackRock's combined investments of more than $130 million in a single day plus ARK Invest's, the market receives a strong positive signal.

The growing curiosity of institutional players like BlackRock and ARK Invest has significant effects on the direction of the Bitcoin market.

The crypto market was little changed-to-lower on Tuesday, with dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP leading declines among major tokens with losses of just over 3% in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, fell 2%.

The lack of volatility comes as bitcoin (BTC) traders largely brace for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday, which could set the tone for monetary policy and influence risk assets including cryptocurrencies.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates — widely expected to remain unchanged at 4.25%–4.50% — and any comments from Chair Jerome Powell could sway investor sentiment. A hawkish stance, signaling tighter policy or a slower path to rate cuts, might pressure bitcoin and lead to more pronounced losses in altcoins. Conversely, a dovish tilt hinting at future easing could spark a relief rally.

“A rate cut this Wednesday remains highly unlikely as the U.S. pivots away from fiscal dominance, where government spending fueled growth, toward [President Donald] Trump's push for deficit reduction,” traders from QCP Capital shared in a broadcast message Tuesday. “The shift puts the burden back on monetary policy. While we do not anticipate a surprise cut, any dovish signal from Powell could be the catalyst that sparks upside momentum.

“Capital may be rotating out of Trump-driven momentum trades like NASDAQ and Bitcoin and into long-overlooked European and Chinese markets. Historically, crypto prices have lagged shifts in global liquidity conditions,” QCP Capital traders added.

Agne Linge of WeFi noted that broader market volatility remains elevated, with the crypto fear and greed index at 22 — indicating "extreme fear" — as investors grapple with uncertainties around inflation, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions.

“In the United States, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recorded their fourth consecutive weekly declines last week, with the Dow Jones dropping by 3.1% to record its worst weekly turnover in about 24 months. While the previous week saw an unusual drawdown, more uncertainty lies ahead for the rest of the month,” Linge said, noting any macroeconomic headwinds could ultimately weigh down bitcoin prices.

At Bitget Research, chief analyst Ryan Lee said bitcoin remains in a tight range with a move to either $75,000 or $90,000 equally likely, based on how traders react to the U.S. rate decision.

“Bitcoin's recent pullback has traders watching key support levels between $82,000 and $85,000. It's a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether the recent momentum has real staying power,” Lee said in an email to CoinDesk. “Any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market.

“If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000,” he added.

Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto.

Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump's White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom.

“When there's financial distress, they always print money. It doesn't matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News.

The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump's on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession.

"When the floodgates open, it's go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they're going to reflate and print more money than anyone's ever printed before.”

The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing.

“We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said.

Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices.

“All eyes are on the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week,” BlackRock analysts wrote in a note.

The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed's latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump's campaign to see them brought down.

Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell's all-important, post-decision press conference.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the Governor of the Bank of France and a prominent member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has cautioned against the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., hinting at possible global financial instability. In a recent interview with La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy de Galhau criticized the policies of the Trump administration here, characterizing them as potential precursors to future crises.

The support for the cryptocurrency industry from the Trump administration has been significant, with initiatives such as the formation of a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets and the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated volatility, with Bitcoin's value plummeting below $80,000—a stark 25% decrease from its January high of $109,000. This slump reflects broader investor uncertainty, as evidenced by the S&P 500's more than 10% decline following Trump's tariff threats on European spirits.

While the ECB remains wary of cryptocurrencies, describing them as speculative assets, Europe is actively pursuing a more structured approach through its digital payments infrastructure initiative. This reflects the ECB's preference for a digital euro, a central bank digital currency that stands in contrast to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.

Villeroy de Galhau's comments also underscore Europe's apprehension regarding the U.S.'s relaxed regulatory stance on crypto. This concern is evidenced by the European Union's introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), aiming to establish a coherent regulatory framework across its member states. Although MiCA seeks to provide clarity and stability, its rigorous requirements may pose challenges for smaller crypto firms.

As the U.S. and Europe continue to develop divergent regulatory philosophies on cryptocurrency, the impact of these differences on the global crypto industry's future remains to be seen.

The Bitcoin price appears to be holding its breath ahead of tomorrow's Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has slid just below $83,000, having lost 0.8% in the past day, according to CoinGecko data.

Traders are moving a lot less Bitcoin than they were this time last week, when President Donald Trump's trade war again got put on pause. In the past 24 hours, $22 billion worth of Bitcoin has changed hands—a very sharp drop from the $49 billion worth of volume BTC saw a week ago.

Only 1% of traders are holding out hope that the Federal Reserve will announce a rate cut tomorrow, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. President Trump has been among the voices calling for the Fed to drop rates.

"I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world," Trump said in remarks made over video to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The Bank of England and European Central Bank have all cut rates recently. And the Bank of Japan is expected to pause its rate hikes at its next meeting.

But the Fed hasn't budged.

Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said markets could see some positive action if Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at least keeps hope alive that the FOMC will cut rates later in the year.

"Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin's growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact," he said in a market note shared with Decrypt.

Analysts at Singapore-based QCP Capital agreed that traders could shift sentiment if Powell leaves hope alive. "While we do not anticipate a surprise cut, any dovish signal from Powell could be the catalyst that sparks upside momentum," they wrote in a market note Tuesday morning.

Although Lee expects some volatility immediately during and after Powell's remarks, scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m. EST, Lee added that Bitcoin could drop as low as $80,000.

"Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence," he said, "while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level."

Users of MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, are evenly split on whether Bitcoin's price will top $83,000 by the end of the day on March 23.

As macroeconomic turmoil has battered markets, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has taken a big hit since the start of the year.

Open interest reached a 2025 peak of $69 billion on January 21, but has since dropped by 30% to $48 billion, according to Coinglass data. Derivatives traders use futures contracts to bet on future price movements. That cuts both ways. When uncertainty lingers, open interest starts to dry up.

Unrealized profits of Strategy from Bitcoin holdings have fallen below $8 billion, putting increasing pressure on Michael Saylor's Bitcoin investment strategy. The cryptocurrency market is clearly struggling, and Bitcoin has failed to maintain its recent bullish momentum.

Since 2020, MicroStrategy — now known as Strategy — has been actively buying Bitcoin, steadily growing its holdings even during downturns. However, the company's profit margins have drastically decreased as a result of Bitcoin's current price of about $83,000. According to recent disclosures, some of its most recent acquisitions were made for more than $97,000, putting them at an immediate loss. BTCUSDT Chart by TradingView">

Although the company's dollar-cost averaging approach has held up well over time, its viability is called into question by the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin. Future purchases may become more cautious if the bearish trend persists because the unrealized gains may decrease even more.

Technically, it is still unclear how the price of Bitcoin will move. The 200-day moving average is serving as a crucial threshold as the asset is presently testing important support levels. If this level is broken, selling pressure may increase, and Bitcoin may enter a more severe correction phase.

The long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin, according to bulls, are still solid, and institutional adoption is still rising. Bears, on the other hand, point to declining volume and a dearth of pressing factors that might raise the price in the near future. 

Right now everyone is watching to see if Bitcoin can recover from higher resistance levels. A successful push above $90,000 might boost confidence, but if important supports are broken, there may be a protracted consolidation or more decline. Strategy's next course of action will probably rely on how well Bitcoin stabilizes and regains its bullish momentum.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and a key member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has warned that the U.S.'s increasing embrace of cryptocurrencies.

Trump's administration has been actively supporting the cryptocurrency industry, pushing for major reforms to make the U.S. the global leader in digital assets. Under his leadership, the U.S. has formed a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and introduced several crypto-friendly initiatives. However, the market's reaction has been volatile. Bitcoin, for example, recently dropped below $80,000, marking a 25% decline from its January peak of $109,000, highlighting investor uncertainty. The S&P 500 also fell over 10% after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European spirits.

The ECB has been critical of crypto's speculative nature, with ECB President Christine Lagarde previously calling Bitcoin a “speculative asset with no intrinsic value.” The bank has warned that unregulated digital currencies could undermine global financial stability. In contrast, the ECB has been working toward a more controlled approach with its digital payments infrastructure initiative, which aims to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), such as the digital euro. This initiative reflects the ECB's preference for safer, state-backed solutions as opposed to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.

Villeroy de Galhau's comments reflect Europe's growing concern about the U.S.'s laissez-faire attitude toward crypto. He believes Europe must strengthen its negotiating position to counterbalance the U.S. and avoid complacency in the face of the shifting global financial landscape. The ECB's regulatory approach stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has eased its regulatory crackdown on crypto platforms.

Furthermore, the European Union has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), designed to create a unified regulatory framework for the crypto sector across its 27 member states. While MiCA aims to provide more clarity and stability in the market, its strict licensing and compliance requirements could pose challenges for smaller crypto firms, especially those struggling to meet capital reserve and consumer protection standards.

As both the U.S. and Europe continue to shape their approaches to cryptocurrency, the potential clash in their regulatory philosophies could have lasting effects on the future of the global crypto industry.

The calm that has returned to the bitcoin (BTC) market may be short-lived, potentially setting the stage for a storm that could trigger significant price volatility, according to insights from the decentralized crypto on-chain options platform Derive.

Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve.

With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive.

"BTC's weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today," Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk.

It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin. 

“Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%)," Forster added.

Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction.

According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including "a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration."

Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date.

Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well. 

The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher.

Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock.

"Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don't point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut," BlackRock said in a weekly note.

The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.

Analysts speculate that a whale may have set up a $520 million Bitcoin short 40x leverage position on Hyperliquid as a trap to trigger a massive long.

On Mar. 16, a Bitcoin (BTC) whale placed a massive $520 million short position on Hyperliquid (HYPE) using 40x leverage, making it one of the largest known trades on the decentralized exchange. 

With a liquidation price of $85,561, the trade would be wiped out if Bitcoin rose just 1.75% from his entry at $83,898. This immediately drew the attention of traders who saw an opportunity to force a liquidation.

Pseudonymous trader Cbb0fe took to X  to rally a group to push Bitcoin's price higher and trigger the liquidation. The price surged by 2.5% within minutes on the same day, nearly hitting the whale's threshold before they added more funds to raise their liquidation price.

According to 10x Research's Mar. 17 report, analyst Markus Thielen noted that this event is part of a growing trend involving the democratization of stop-loss hunting. In this trend, independent traders, not just institutions, coordinate to move the market, powered by the transparency of leverage trading on DEXs.

Some analysts, however, think the whale's massive position might be a calculated strategy rather than a case of a careless short gone wrong. According to cryptocurrency analyst Josh Man, the whale might be intentionally exposing their position to liquidation in order to support a price rally, a rare tactic known as “self-liquidation.” 

So this there is a fairly rare and not widely used technique of self-liquidation and this FEELS a little like that.   In such events, the seller is actually creating a bomb designed to go off and create a rally from the liquidation of his own short.   One would expect that he has… https://t.co/JNcnCLO2E0

If the whale holds an even larger long position elsewhere, their own short liquidation could send Bitcoin higher, benefiting their long position significantly.

This isn't the first time Hyperliquid has seen such high-stakes plays. Just last week, a trader placed a $285 million leveraged Ethereum (ETH) bet that resulted in a $4 million loss for the platform. In response, Hyperliquid reduced leverage limits for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Now, the crypto community is watching the price movement of Bitcoin. Further upward momentum could be fueled if the whale's short position is liquidated. In any case, independent traders and the whale are currently engaged in a risky game of high-stakes competition in this trade.

Some cities in the metro area are making an effort to ban cryptocurrency machines due scam risks. FOX 9's Mike Manzoni has the story.

FOREST LAKE, Minn. (FOX 9) - The Forest Lake City Council met Monday night to discuss how to handle a surge in scams involving cryptocurrency kiosks.

The backstory:

Forest Lake police said victims have lost more than $300,000 in schemes involving cryptocurrency kiosks over the last two years. The Forest Lake City Council met Monday night to consider how to clamp down on the scams. The options include regulating or banning virtual currency machines.

What is cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is purchased electronically. Both Bitcoin and Ether are popular cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency is used for payments and as an investment.

How the scams work:

The scammers typically impersonate police officers or government officials, often convincing victims over the phone that they have committed a crime and need to pay money to avoid jail time. The scammers then stay on the phone and force the victims to lie to bank tellers, police officers and others. The scams conclude when the victims wire funds to the scammers via cryptocurrency kiosks, which are found at many convenience stores.

Scammers also commonly use investment fraud schemes, which involve convincing victims to send them funds under the guise of investments. In many cases, the victims never recover their lost money.

What are the city's options:

The city council has three options: do not take any action, pass an ordinance requiring owners to register kiosks or ban them outright.

During Monday night's meeting, the council expressed support for an ordinance.

The ordinance would impose a $2,000 to $3,000 fee and require signage and cameras at kiosk locations to deter fraud. In addition, a kiosk operator would not be allowed to register if there were three or more reported instances of fraud involving one of their kiosks in the preceding 12 months.

What they're saying:

"The employees will even see people come in all confused standing at the kiosk and they'll ask them questions like, ‘Do you know what you're doing? Do you need help?' And they're so wrapped up in the scam that they just brush everyone off," explained Forest Lake police Detective Nathan Olstad.

The City of Woodbury has reported $6.6 million in cryptocurrency losses from kiosks and online transactions since 2021. The City of White Bear Lake reported about $125,000 in losses in 2023.

The cities of Stillwater, Hastings and Cottage Grove are considering banning kiosks.

Big picture view:

In 2023, the FBI received more than 5,500 complaints involving cryptocurrency kiosks, with losses totaling more than $189 million. There were nearly 70,000 reports of fraud involving cryptocurrency, with total losses of $5.6 billion, a 45 percent increase from the previous year, according to the FBI. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the losses have increased tenfold since 2020.

In 2023, there were 976 complaints involving cryptocurrency fraud in Minnesota, with total losses of more than $75 million, according to the FBI. The state ranks in the top 20 for both virtual currency fraud reports and losses.

What's next:

The city council will discuss an ordinance requiring owners to register cryptocurrency kiosks at its March 24 meeting.

Mount Spurr near Anchorage has been showing signs of unrest for a year. Now scientists think it's creeping closer to an eruption.

A huge volcano in Alaska appears to be "moving closer to an eruption," scientists monitoring it have said.

Mount Spurr, which sits 81 miles (130 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is now releasing unusual levels of volcanic gases near its summit and from a flank vent that last erupted in 1992.

The 11,000-foot (3,370-meter) volcano has been undergoing an uptick in earthquakes and snow and ice melt on its slopes in the past year, indicating magma movement under the surface. Now, according to scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), it's most likely that this unrest will end in an eruption.

That's an increase in risk from the observatory's last assessment in February, which gauged that Mount Spurr was equally likely to simmer down as it was to erupt. Now, observations of increased carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from the volcano have tipped the balance toward an eruption, said Matt Haney, the scientist-in-charge of the AVO at the U.S. Geological Survey.

"This time period of unrest will eventually most likely end in an explosive eruption like the ones that happened in 1953 and 1992," Haney told Live Science.

Those eruptions both took place at Crater Peak, a flank vent about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the stratovolcano's summit. The last time the mountain's peak erupted was likely more than 5,000 years ago, Haney said, so scientists don't expect an eruption there — most likely, the rock between the eruptible magma and the summit crater is well-solidified and would be hard for any magma to burst through.

Any eruption will probably occur at Crater Peak, which has been more recently active and which probably has easier pathways to the surface for magma to move.

Crater Peak exploded three times over several months in 1992 and once in 1953. In both cases, ash erupted at least 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) in the atmosphere, Haney said. One of the explosions in 1992 sent the cloud drifting over Anchorage, blanketing the city in an eighth an inch (3.1 millimeters) of dust. In 1953, Anchorage experienced a quarter-inch (6.4 mm) ashfall.

If the magma movement beneath the volcano doesn't settle down, the next sign of an eruption will likely be volcanic tremor, Haney said.

Unlike the brief, small earthquakes that have been shuddering the volcano over the last year, volcanic tremor is a long, ongoing shaking that can last for minutes, hours, or days. It indicates that magma is rising and that an eruption is likely imminent.

In 1992, volcanic tremor started about three weeks before Mount Spurr erupted. Another nearby volcano that erupted in 2009, Mount Readout, showed volcanic tremor for two months before it blew its top.

"If we see [tremor]," Haney said, "that will be the next sign that Spurr is further progressing toward an eruption."

Environmentalist and author Paul Hawken speaks to Live Science about the worldview that has led to the mindless exploitation of the planet — and how we can shift perspectives for a better future.

The element carbon, in its oxidized form, is at the center of discussions about climate change. Carbon is often vilified and cast as the culprit for global warming, destruction and loss.

But what we tend to forget is that carbon is the main ingredient for life. And we are the only species on Earth that disrupts the natural flow of carbon, says environmentalist and author Paul Hawken.

Hawken's new book, "Carbon: The Book of Life" (Viking, 2025), shines a spotlight on the countless flows of carbon that power life, from individual cells to vast underground fungal networks and entire human societies. Through the lens of carbon, the author takes the reader on a journey through corporate retreats, the pharmaceutical sector, the food industry and the realms of plants, insects and fungi.

Live Science sat down with Hawken before the book's publication on March 18 to discuss the language we use to talk about the climate and the paradigm shift needed to start valuing, restoring and protecting the natural flow of carbon on Earth.

Q: "Carbon" is about showing that carbon is not just a problem we need to neutralize, but also a vital force that flows through every living being and Earth system. How does this encourage us to think differently about climate change?

Hawken: The narrative [around global warming] is really screwed up, frankly, because it has objectified carbon, the atmosphere, climate change, etcetera. It's the same mindset that caused the problem: We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends.

When people say we're going to "fix" the climate, or "tackle" or "combat" climate change, to me it's just so emblematic of this profound disconnection between self and other. We don't have a climate crisis; the climate cannot have a crisis. We are the crisis. That's what I want to explore. [I want] to go to a place that's not just insular and about self, but actually [gives rise to] a sense of being in the world that can create a sensibility that forms community. Because all of life as we know it exists in a community.



Q: I found the book very uplifting and hopeful. How do you find the drive to write about the climate when everything we hear from scientists is so bleak?

Hawken: What I'm trying to do in my own life, certainly, but also in communication, is to create the context in which people can see the world. Because what you see and receive really determines your mindset, your consciousness, your awareness and your sense of stress, anxiety and equanimity in the face of events that are troubling. Rather than going to the trouble and staying with that, I'm looking for a conversation that makes sense. That's where change needs to happen.

We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends."

Q: Could you give an example of where the current conversation does not make sense to you? 

Hawken: People talk about "net zero." I'm not a physicist, but I can tell you that "net zero" does not exist in terms of carbon. "Carbon neutrality" does not exist.

If you look at the proposals to really shift away from fossil fuels, what we're talking about is renewable energies to energize an economy that's skyrocketing in consumption, which is destruction. Renewable energy doesn't really take a step back to ask: "Energizing yes, but what?" And if we don't look at that, then we're just in a gerbil wheel. We may have the illusion that the faster we go, the faster we're getting somewhere, but actually we're not — it's almost the opposite.

Q: A few chapters of the book focus on health and the food industry. How do those topics relate to carbon and why was it important to include them?

Hawken: The book is about life and about carbon as an element. The flow of carbon is, in a sense, the flow of life. I began to look at the food system and what was being sold, what was being promoted. One thing led to another in terms of looking at health and self and food and agriculture as a system that is inseparable from the rest. That goes back to carbon, because if you look at a healthy agricultural system, it's full of carbon. That whole systemic understanding of food and health and farming and soil and agricultural practices and chemistry is also a way of looking at the other systems we have and that we take for granted.

Q: This leads nicely into the "spaceship Earth" you mention in the book. Spaceship Earth is a concept that encourages us to think of the planet as a closed system with limited resources. Humanity is the crew, and every passenger should work toward the greater good of this crew. Why do you like this metaphor?

Hawken: Earth is so big, we don't even understand our own cities. It leads to ways of thinking where [we don't consider where] our trash and sewage go. The spaceship is an imaginative exercise, where you imagine that a group of you is going on a spaceship for 10, 50, 100 years and you ask yourselves what is allowed on board and what is not. There's no spatial limit — it's more about the system, its inputs and outputs. It's just to bring it down to a scale where people can understand what happens on Earth without being a scientist.

—Michael Mann: Yes, we can still stop the worst effects of climate change. Here's why.

Q: The central message in "Carbon" is that we need to reconnect with the world around us to shape a better future than what we're currently headed for. One of your previous books is called "Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation" (Penguin, 2021) — and I was wondering what regeneration means to you. How do we end the climate crisis?

Hawken: Regeneration for me is pretty simple. It means that your life, your being, your presence here is about creating more life — not in the sense of making children, but in every sense of life. That means you start thinking about consumption, about what to buy and what you take, and the implications of that.

The purpose of "Carbon" is to suggest there is this beautiful flow of wonder and majesty that is inseparable from us. The purpose is to ask: What if we truly believed that Earth is our home? And what if we acted that way? Because we don't.

South African officials say a member of a research team at an isolated Antarctica base has been put under psychological evaluation after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues

Fear at Isolated Antarctica Base as a Man Is Accused of Attacking a Colleague and Making Threats

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.

The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.

The email pleaded for help.

“His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the email said, according to The Sunday Times. “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.

South Africa's Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely “to mediate and restore relationships at the base.” They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.

“The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,” the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.

The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.

The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.

The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.

Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.

The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.

“It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said.

Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.

In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.

The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they'd experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.

Satellite images taken more than three decades apart show the disappearance of Iceland's Okjökull, the first glacier to be officially declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change.

Where is it? Ok volcano, Iceland [64.60038686, -20.87986624]

What's in the photos? A comparison of Okjökull, a glacier atop Ok volcano, before and after it was declared dead

Which satellites took the photos? Landsat 5 and Landsat 8

When were they taken? Sept. 14, 1986, and Aug. 1, 2019

Two satellite photos taken 33 years apart show the disappearance of a glacier in Iceland that was the first ice mass to be declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change.

Okjökull was a dome-shaped glacier situated around the summit crater on Ok (pronounced Auk), a 3,940-foot-tall (1,200 meters) shield volcano located 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Reykjavík. (The name Okjökull translates to "Ok glacier" in Icelandic.)

In 1901, Okjökull's ice covered an area of around 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), but when the first of the two satellite photos was taken in 1986, there was less than 1 square mile (2.6 square km) of ice left. By the time the second image was captured in 2019, the ice covered less than 0.4 square miles (1 square km), according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

The glacier was declared dead in 2014, when Icelandic glaciologists revealed that the ice had become so thin that it was no longer being slowly pulled down the mountain by gravity, meaning it had stopped moving for the first time in tens of thousands of years, according to a 2024 paper summarizing Okjökull's demise.

The glacier's death was showcased and explored in a 2018 short film titled "Not Ok," which was made by researchers from Rice University in Texas.

In August 2019, around 100 people, including researchers and politicians, attended a funeral for Okjökull near the summit of Ok, according to The Guardian. During this ceremony, a commemorative plaque, inscribed with a message titled "A letter to the future," was placed near the summit.

It reads as follows: "Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it."

The plaque also listed the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which was 415 parts per million at the time. As of March 2025, the concentration is over 428 ppm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In 2023, Iceland also created the world's first iceberg graveyard, where ice-like headstones were constructed for the 15 major glaciers listed on the Global Glacier Casualty List, all of which are either dead or critically endangered, according to the United Nations. This list includes the Anderson Glacier in Washington state, which, in 2015, became the first U.S. glacier to be declared dead.

Because of inconsistent monitoring and debates about the true sizes of glaciers, it is unclear exactly how many glaciers have been lost due to climate change, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. However, some researchers estimate that up to 10,000 glaciers of various sizes may have already been lost to climate change, The Washington Post reported in 2024.

A novel genetic model suggests that the ancestors of modern humans came from two distinct populations that split and reconnected during our evolutionary history.

The ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago, a new genetic model suggests. The unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function.

"The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined," study co-author Aylwyn Scally, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement.

In a study published Tuesday (March 18) in the journal Nature Genetics, researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called "cobraa," that has allowed them to trace the evolution of modern humans (Homo sapiens).

By applying their new method to modern human DNA data published in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project, the researchers discovered that there were two main ancestral groups that split around 1.5 million years ago, which they called Population A and Population B.

Just after that split, Population A experienced a bottleneck when the population plummeted and likely lost a significant amount of genetic diversity. But Population A grew over time, and Neanderthals and Denisovans branched off from it.

Then, around 300,000 years ago, Population A mixed with Population B, the researchers found. Their genetic analysis suggests that 80% of the genome of all present-day humans comes from Population A, while 20% of our genome comes from Population B.

Some of the genes from Population B, "particularly those related to brain function and neural processing, may have played a crucial role in human evolution," study co-author Trevor Cousins, a postgraduate student in genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. In general, the genetic material from Population B reduced the ability of individuals to have children, Cousins told Live Science in an email, but "the genome is a complicated place, and regions outside of genes can still do important things."

The new model suggests that, around 300,000 years ago, Population A, which eventually gave rise to humans, had "deep structure," Cousins said, meaning it was formed from "two or more genetically distinct populations that mixed with each other."

Who those populations were, however, is not clear. In the study, the researchers noted that "various Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis populations that are potential candidates for lineages A and B existed both in Africa and elsewhere in the relevant period."

But "the genetic model cannot indicate which fossils should be assigned to Population A or B," Cousins said. "We can only speculate."

Some experts use the term "ghost populations" to talk about groups that branched off and then reconnected later through interbreeding resulting in gene flow, John Hawks, a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email.

"What is interesting about this paper is that the pattern in the model is a deep African structure that is shared by everyone living today," Hawks said. "It is not 'ghost populations' contributing to one particular group, it is one big ghost that merged in with the African source population for all modern humans."

—28,000-year-old Neanderthal-and-human 'Lapedo child' lived tens of thousands of years after our closest relatives went extinct

—1.5 million-year-old bone tools crafted by human ancestors in Tanzania are oldest of their kind

—Neanderthal 'population bottleneck' around 110,000 years ago may have contributed to their extinction

But one of the drawbacks to the new model, according to Hawks, is that it is based on the 1000 Genomes Project, which has a low representation of African populations. "So I see this as more a proof of principle than a real guide to what ancient humans were doing," Hawks said.

The origin of modern humans is a long-standing question in paleoanthropology, and improvements in DNA and genomic analysis in the past two decades have provided new insights and raised new questions.

"What's becoming clear is that the idea of species evolving in clean, distinct lineages is too simplistic," Cousins said in the statement. "Interbreeding and genetic exchange have likely played a major role in the emergence of new species repeatedly across the animal kingdom."

PLYMOUTH MEETING, PA [March 17, 2025] The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) is sharing a webinar today that answers critical patient questions about cancer clinical trials. The newly released, on-demand webinar is titled “Why Should I Consider a Clinical Trial?” It is available for free at NCCN.org/patientwebinars thanks to funding from the NCCN Foundation®, along with a handout summarizing the key information.

Cancer clinical trials play a critical role in advancing treatment and improving patient outcomes. However, confusion about their purpose, benefits, and accessibility keeps many people from enrolling. This free webinar features leading experts in oncology and patient advocacy, who break down the complex concepts, making them accessible to all.

“Every standard treatment we have today was found by the intellect of science and the courage of patients who participated in clinical trials,” said Ann Fish-Steagall, RN, BSN, SVP Patient Services and Health Care Delivery, LUNGevity, who was one of the presenters. “Clinical trials provide the medical community with important building blocks to further research and improve treatment options for all.”

“Clinical trials are a cornerstone of cancer research, but many patients are unsure how to approach them,” said Patrick Delaney, Executive Director, NCCN Foundation. “Our goal with this webinar is to empower individuals with knowledge, address misconceptions, and make the whole process feel less daunting.”

“Diversity in clinical trial participation is essential to ensuring that new treatments work for everyone, regardless of their background,” Delaney continued. “This session emphasizes the importance of inclusive participation and explores how to make that easier across every demographic.”

The webinar addressed key questions:

Tiffany Colvin, CCRP Sr. Director Clinical Trial Operations, Fred Hutch Cancer Center— another presenter—emphasized the dedication of the people involved in running a clinical trial, spanning various areas of healthcare: “Without collaboration, we couldn't offer the latest and greatest treatment options. We hold ourselves accountable to transparency, quality, safety, and integrity in conducting these clinical trials. Trials offer patients early access to promising new therapies under strict supervision and comprehensive support from a dedicated research team."

The newly posted on-demand webinar occurred live on February 28. Support was provided by AstraZeneca; Daiichi Sankyo; Genentech, Inc; and GSK.

NCCN has long advocated for clinical trial participation through the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)—evidence-based, expert consensus-driven recommendations used to guide cancer care decisions around the world. On every guideline, the front cover includes the statement: “NCCN recognizes the importance of clinical trials and encourages participation when applicable and available. Trials should be designed to maximize inclusiveness and broad representative enrollment.”

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has received approval from the Centre for the Chandrayaan-5 mission, ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan confirmed. The mission, aimed at further advancing India's lunar exploration capabilities, is part of the country's long-term goal of achieving a human landing on the Moon by 2040. The announcement was made during an event held in Chennai, where Narayanan also outlined ISRO's roadmap, including the development of an Indian Space Station by 2035. The Chandrayaan-5 mission is expected to feature a 350 kg rover and will involve collaboration with Japan.

According to reports, ISRO has outlined multiple upcoming missions, including Chandrayaan-4, which will focus on landing and sample collection. Chandrayaan-5 is expected to enhance lunar exploration by deploying a high-capacity lander, a critical step towards future human landings. Last year, Union Minister Jitendra Singh confirmed government approval for Chandrayaan-4, which will test key technologies for landing, sample collection, and a safe return to Earth.

Additionally, ISRO has been tasked with the development of an independent space station, named "Bharatiya Antriksh Station," scheduled for completion by 2035. Plans are also underway to send Indian astronauts to the Moon aboard an indigenous rocket.

Reports indicate that ISRO has been expanding its launch capabilities, with significant progress made in satellite deployment. Since 2014, India has launched satellites for 34 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Canada. Over the past decade, 393 foreign satellites and three Indian commercial satellites have been launched using PSLV, LVM3, and SSLV launch vehicles.
The upcoming rocket launch facility at Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu is expected to play a key role in small satellite launches. Construction began on March 5, 2024, following the foundation stone-laying ceremony by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The spaceport will focus on polar launches using the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), with production supported by Indian industry.

During the Chennai event, Narayanan highlighted ISRO's achievements, including Chandrayaan-1's discovery of water on the Moon and Chandrayaan-3's successful landing at the lunar south pole, making India the first country to achieve this milestone. He also mentioned India's progress in solar research, stating that the country has become the fourth nation to launch a dedicated satellite for studying the Sun.

The event was attended by several dignitaries, including former Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, former MLA Vijayadharani, and former Chennai Mayor Saidai Duraisamy.

Initially developed for Bitcoin transactions, blockchain has evolved into a powerful tool for securing data, automating processes, and improving transparency. Governments, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and supply chain managers are exploring blockchain's potential.

This article explores blockchain's future, its applications, and the challenges it must overcome.

Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain is immutable, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be altered. This feature makes it valuable for applications requiring trust and security.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies use blockchain to facilitate secure, borderless transactions. Blockchain reduces reliance on banks, enabling faster and cheaper international payments.

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with terms written in code. They eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency in legal, financial, and business transactions.

Companies use blockchain to track products from manufacturing to delivery. This improves transparency, reduces fraud, and ensures authenticity in industries like food safety, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods.

Blockchain enables secure storage and sharing of patient records. Hospitals and clinics can access verified data while maintaining patient privacy, reducing errors and improving treatment efficiency.

Blockchain-based voting systems enhance election security by preventing tampering and ensuring transparency. Several countries and organisations are exploring blockchain voting solutions to increase trust in electoral processes.

DeFi platforms use blockchain to provide financial services without banks. Users can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, increasing financial inclusion.

Blockchain's encryption and decentralised nature make it resistant to hacking. Industries handling sensitive data, such as banking and healthcare, benefit from its security features.

Blockchain creates permanent, tamper-proof records, reducing fraud and corruption. Businesses and governments can use it to increase accountability in transactions and record-keeping.

Real estate, art, stocks, and commodities can be tokenised on the blockchain, allowing fractional ownership and easier asset trading. This can increase liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets.

Blockchain can complement AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. For example, blockchain can enhance IoT security by preventing data breaches in connected devices.

Many blockchain networks struggle with slow transaction speeds and high fees. Solutions like layer-2 scaling and blockchain sharding aim to address these limitations.

Governments worldwide are still developing blockchain regulations. Inconsistent laws create uncertainty for businesses and investors, slowing adoption.

Some blockchain networks, like Bitcoin, consume large amounts of energy due to mining processes. Sustainable alternatives, such as proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, are being developed to reduce environmental impact.

Businesses and governments must invest in infrastructure and workforce training to implement blockchain effectively. Adoption remains slow due to high costs and resistance to change.

Blockchain technology is expected to evolve with innovations that address scalability, security, and energy concerns. Key trends include:

Blockchain technology offers immense opportunities for businesses, governments, and individuals. While challenges remain, ongoing advancements in scalability, security, and regulation will drive its growth. As blockchain becomes more integrated into everyday life, it will revolutionise industries and redefine digital trust.

CorPower Ocean has secured financial backing from Vinnova, Sweden's national innovation agency, for a project exploring the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for improved performance and control in wave energy technology.

The WACE project, short for Wave energy AI-based Control Enhancement, is now underway and is set to run until November 2025.

CorPower Ocean is being supported by project partner Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

A model-based design framework will be used in the WACE project. After establishing requirements for the closed-loop control system, an AI-based optimal control strategy is being designed along with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test setup.

CorPower Ocean anticipates that its wave energy converters are operated in arrays or farms which will generate a vast amount of data. This project also aims for utilizing the available data to enhance an existing model-predictive control strategy combining optimal model-based control with AI.

This combination allows the exploration of more performant control schemes while keeping the devices in its feasible operating region. The performance of the developed algorithm will be proven using HIL testing providing a realistic real-time environment while using the existing operating strategy as a baseline.

“The optimal operation of wave energy converters is one of the key factors to lower the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ultimately making it an attractive part of the future clean energy mix. The main goal of the WACE Project is to combine AI methods with optimal control to enhance our existing operating strategy and further improve the performance of our point absorber type wave energy converter,” said Gabriel Forstner, WACE Project Lead and CorPower Ocean Control Engineer.

A key feature of CorPower Ocean's technology is its ability to tune and detune according to ocean conditions, limiting the response to storms and amplifying the motion and power capture in normal waves.

This feature has been demonstrated during the operational period of the company's C4 device in Aguçadoura, off Portugal. The verification of the amplified motion and power capture by the phase control system is seen as a key outcome from the HiWave-5 demonstration project.

Wave farm projects are being developed by customers using CorPower Ocean's technology along the Atlantic Arc, including sites in Scotland, Ireland, Portugal and Norway.

One project is being developed by Ireland's state-owned energy supplier, ESB, off the coast of County Clare, following two decades of investigating a wide variety of technologies.

The pre-commercial phase of the EU-backed Saoirse Wave project, will involve CorPower Ocean wave energy converts as part of a CorPack cluster.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Facebook (now Meta) executive, has published a shocking memoir, Careless People: A Story of Where I Used to Work, exposing the inner workings of the social media giant. The book details Facebook's toxic work culture, aggressive global expansion tactics, and how CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team prioritized growth over ethics. Originally reported by The Guardian, Wynn-Williams' revelations highlight Facebook's failures, from data privacy concerns to enabling political manipulation and even workplace harassment.

Wynn-Williams worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2018, rising to the position of director of global public policy. She describes the company as an almost “cult-like” environment, where employees were expected to be devoted to its mission at all costs.

In one shocking incident, she recalls working on a memo during labour, moments before giving birth. She was drafting an update on Facebook's expansion in Myanmar for then-COO Sheryl Sandberg. Her husband was furious, but the hospital doctor had to step in and physically close her laptop.

She also highlights Facebook's extreme work expectations for women, referencing Sandberg's Lean In philosophy, which encouraged women to work tirelessly, even during pregnancy. The reality, she later realized, was that this culture promoted self-exploitation rather than empowerment.

One of the book's most alarming revelations is Facebook's role in fueling hate speech and violence in Myanmar. Zuckerberg's Free Basics program, which aimed to provide free internet access in developing countries, was marketed as a philanthropic effort. However, Wynn-Williams exposes how it was a strategy for Facebook to dominate the internet in those regions.

She admits that initially, she believed in Facebook's mission to connect the world. However, she later realized that in Myanmar, Facebook became a tool for the military junta to spread hate speech and incite violence against the Muslim Rohingya population.

Wynn-Williams writes, “Myanmar would have been a better place if Facebook had not arrived.”

The book also details widespread sexual harassment on Facebook. Wynn-Williams recounts how senior executives, including Meta's global affairs chief Joel Kaplan, allegedly made inappropriate advances toward female employees. She describes a company culture where high-ranking men were protected while women were expected to stay silent.

She also shares a disturbing incident in which Sandberg invited her to sleep in the same bed during a work trip. While she declined, she later worried that rejecting the offer might have harmed her career.

According to Wynn-Williams, Facebook's leadership, including Mark Zuckerberg, knew about these issues but did little to address them.

Wynn-Williams criticizes Facebook's handling of political advertising and misinformation, particularly during the 2016 US elections. She describes how Facebook's ad-targeting system was used to spread disinformation, influence elections, and manipulate users.

She accuses Zuckerberg of misleading Congress about the extent of Facebook's cooperation with the Chinese government. She claims that behind closed doors, Facebook was developing censorship tools to comply with China's strict regulations, contradicting Zuckerberg's public statements.

Following the book's release, Meta dismissed Wynn-Williams' claims, stating that she was a disgruntled former employee trying to sell books. A company spokesperson labelled the memoir “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims, along with false accusations about our executives.”

Despite this, Wynn-Williams argues that Facebook's culture remains unchanged, even after rebranding to Meta. She warns that as Zuckerberg expands into artificial intelligence, the company's irresponsibility and pursuit of profit could pose even greater risks.

Her book, published by Pan Macmillan, serves as a critical insider account of Facebook's rise to power, its internal dysfunction, and the consequences of its unchecked influence on society.

OpenAI and Google, having long trained their ravenous bots on the work of newsrooms like this one, now want to throw out long-established copyright law by arguing, we kid you not, that the only way for the United States to defeat the Chinese Communist Party is for those tech giants to steal the content created with the sweat equity of America's human journalists.“With a Chinese Communist Party determined to overtake us by 2030,” OpenAI wrote Thursday to the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy, “the Trump administration's new action plan can ensure that American-led A.I. built on democratic principles can prevail over CCP-built, autocratic, authoritarian AI.”Built on democratic principles? More like built on outright theft.That's why news organizations, including this one and the New York Times, have sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft over their breaking copyright law by vacuuming up millions of newspaper articles without permission or payment, constituting copyright infringement on a colossal scale.Now OpenAI comes back with the absurd argument that this was somehow necessary for national security.In their letter, Sam Altman's crew added a whole lot of obfuscating, self-serving blather about “scaling human ingenuity” and “freedom of learning and knowledge” while describing the innovations of ChatGPT as part of some great and glorious trajectory from domesticated horses to steam power to electricity to printing presses and the internet.You see the irony there? Printing presses.For generations, those presses sent out the work of America's reporters, the fruits of capital invested, and hard labor performed, in city halls and crime scenes and throughout all the communities they served.

INDIO, Calif. (KESQ) – Congressman Raul Ruiz met privately with local physicians Tuesday in Indio to discuss mounting concerns over healthcare policy changes under the Trump administration.

During the closed-door roundtable, doctors voiced frustration over funding cuts and restrictions on critical healthcare information, which they say are impacting patient care.

In an exclusive interview airing tonight on News Channel 3, Ruiz sits down with Garrett Hottle to address these concerns and discuss potential solutions.

DispatchHealth and Medically Home have entered into a definitive agreement to merge, creating a single provider of medical care at home.

Once the deal closes, Medically Home will become part of DispatchHealth. The combined entity will extend care into the homes of patients across 50 major metropolitan areas in partnership with nearly 40 health systems, as well as most major health plans and value-based care entities, the organizations said.

"This merger unlocks a future where high-acuity care at home is the new standard," said Dr. Mark Prather, co-founder and executive chair of the board for DispatchHealth, in a statement.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

To illustrate patients' increasing preference for receiving care at home, the companies cited Chilmark research showing that the hospital-at-home market is projected to reach $300 billion by 2028, driven by improved patient outcomes and cost efficiency.

The combined entity, they said, will be positioned to deliver services such as same-day medical care for serious health concerns, and complex, hospital-level care in the home. The organizations said they will aim to reduce the total cost of care by up to 30% over a 30-day period.

With expanded capabilities, the combined organization could free up more than 62,000 bed days, easing strain on health systems, the companies said.

"For many patients, the best hospital bed is the one at home," said Medically Home CEO Graham Barnes. "By joining forces with DispatchHealth, we're creating a stronger, more integrated model that will enable more patients, providers, and health systems to embrace high-acuity home-based care with confidence."

The merger is expected to close mid-year. The terms of the definitive agreement were not disclosed.

THE LARGER TREND

The home care and hospice market is growing along with an aging population. 

Reflecting the growing demand for home care services, home health volumes are expected to increase 22% by 2034, according to a November report from Research and Markets.

ON THE RECORD

"Hospital-at-home has consistently demonstrated better outcomes, and we believe every patient – regardless of where they live – deserves access to that level of care," said Pippa Shulman, chief medical officer and chief strategy officer, Medically Home. "This merger allows us to break down barriers, reaching more families in underserved communities with high-quality, advanced medical care in their homes."

Oops, something went wrong

The projected fair value for Acadia Healthcare Company is US$56.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Acadia Healthcare Company is estimated to be 48% undervalued based on current share price of US$29.43

Our fair value estimate is 15% higher than Acadia Healthcare Company's analyst price target of US$49.46

How far off is Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.

Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

 See our latest analysis for Acadia Healthcare Company 

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2b

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$321m× (1 + 2.8%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.8%) = US$7.9b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$4.0b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$5.3b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$29.4, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Acadia Healthcare Company as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.965. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Strength

Debt is well covered by earnings.

Weakness

No major weaknesses identified for ACHC.

Opportunity

Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.

Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.

Threat

Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Acadia Healthcare Company, there are three important factors you should explore:

ROCKVILLE, Md., March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Association of Cancer Care Centers (ACCC), in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company, is pleased to announce the seven recipients of the "Improving the Precision Oncology Care Pathway" Request for Proposals (RFP).

The grant program invited community hospital-based programs and physician group practices to apply for grants to develop targeted, actionable solutions, based on quality improvement methodology, to effectively address patient loss along the precision oncology care pathway.

Awardees

The following cancer programs have been selected to receive funding for their innovative proposals:

"Precision medicine requires a deep understanding of the nuances of tumor molecular testing, but also a systematic plan for implementation and integration into everyday practice," said ACCC member Stacey Cohen, MD. "Through this grant program, ACCC member programs and practices are offered a unique opportunity to explore quality improvement initiatives that expedite the implementation and sustainability of precision oncology efforts within their own health systems."

"Lilly is committed to supporting initiatives that foster the translation of scientific evidence into clinical practice and improve patient outcomes," said Kara Clinton, Senior Vice President of Oncology Global Medical Affairs, Eli Lilly and Company.  "This initiative was an opportunity for Lilly to collaborate with ACCC to support community healthcare systems in addressing barriers preventing optimal biomarker-informed cancer care and ensure more patients can benefit from precision oncology." 

Addressing Clinical Gaps in Precision Oncology

This grant program asked that oncology programs identify site-specific challenges and develop clear, actionable strategies to  address them, with a strong emphasis on improving patient care. The funded proposals are designed to:

Lifestyle and health factors that are linked with heart disease appear to have a greater impact on cardiovascular risk in women than men, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25).

While factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and blood pressure have long been linked with heart disease risk, the new study is the first to show that these associations are collectively stronger in women than men. According to the researchers, the findings suggest that sex-specific screening or risk assessment approaches could give a more accurate picture of cardiovascular risk and better motivate people to adopt heart-healthy habits.

For the same level of health, our study shows that the increase in risk [related to each factor] is higher in women than in men—it's not one-size-fits-all. This is novel and something that hasn't been seen in other studies."

Maneesh Sud, MD, PhD, assistant professor in the department of medicine, interventional cardiologist and clinician scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto and the study's lead author

The study focused on eight factors associated with heart disease: diet, sleep, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure. Overall, the results showed that women were more likely to have fewer negative risk factors and more positive ones compared with men. However, women with more negative risk factors faced a more pronounced increase in their chance of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event compared to men with a similar risk factor profile.

"We found that women tend to have better health than men, but the impact on outcomes is different," Sud said. "The combination of these factors has a bigger impact in women than it does in men."

The researchers analyzed data from over 175,000 Canadian adults who enrolled in the Ontario Health Study between 2009-2017. None of the participants had heart disease at baseline and about 60% were women. Each participant was classified as having ideal or poor health in terms of each of the eight risk factors, and these scores were combined to calculate an overall risk factor profile as poor (fewer than five positive factors or more than three negative factors), intermediate (five to seven positive factors) or ideal (ideal across all eight factors).

During a median follow-up period of just over 11 years, researchers tracked the incidence of seven heart disease outcomes—heart attack, stroke, unstable angina (chest pain that results from restricted blood flow to the heart), peripheral arterial disease (narrowed blood vessels in the arms or legs), heart failure, coronary revascularization (procedures to open blocked arteries) and cardiovascular death—among participants in each of the three groupings.

In the study population, significantly more women were categorized as having ideal health, with 9.1% of women and 4.8% of men scoring a perfect 8 out of 8. Women were also less likely to be categorized as having poor health, with 21.9% of women and 30.5% of men falling into this category. In terms of individual risk factors, women were more likely than men to have ideal diet, blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure, while women were slightly less likely than men to have ideal physical activity levels.

After adjusting for age, the results showed that participants of both sexes saw an elevated risk of heart disease if they had poor or intermediate health compared to those with ideal health, but these differences were more extreme in women than men. Women with poor health had nearly five times the risk of heart disease as women with ideal health, while men with poor health had 2.5 times the risk of heart disease as men with ideal health. Women with intermediate health had 2.3 times the risk as those with ideal health, while men with intermediate health had 1.6 times the risk as those with ideal health.

Further study is needed to understand how each factor might be affecting outcomes differently in men and women based on either biological or sociocultural factors, the researchers said.

The researchers plan to conduct additional analyses to determine whether there are any differences in risk factor impacts among people of different racial and ethnic groups or among women before and after menopause.

WTOL 11 Vault on Plus | News of the Week from 1991

TOLEDO, Ohio — Five years after COVID-19 transformed healthcare operations virtually overnight, medical professionals are reflecting on the lasting changes to hospitals, staff and patient care.

In March 2020, healthcare systems were forced to adapt rapidly as the first wave of COVID-19 cases arrived. Hospitals implemented temperature checks at entrances, questionnaires about health history and eventually universal masking policies.

"I think that everyone can probably say that their lives have been changed through COVID," said Dr. Brian Kaminski, vice president of medical affairs for ProMedica's Metro Hospitals.

Hospitals quickly reorganized their facilities to handle the emerging threat. 

"We even had separate areas for our waiting rooms for people who were presenting with COVID or non-COVID-like symptoms," Kaminski said. "We had installed a variety of different ways to provide negative pressure ventilation in our emergency departments and in our rooms."

Dr. James Tita, chief clinical officer for Mercy Health Toledo, recalled the urgent need for isolation protocols. 

"We weren't even sure exactly how contagious it was, but given the fact that we didn't have any effective treatment, given the fact that it seemed to have a high mortality rate, we had to go to great lengths to make sure that we protected the staff, we protected each other, and of course, we protected the patients," Tita said.

Both health systems struggled with critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). 

"We were rationing masks, we were rationing gowns, we were trying to get as much equipment as we could," Tita said.

The pandemic created significant staffing challenges that continue today. 

"There was a big turnover of our bedside workers, so nurses, respiratory therapists, it took a terrible toll on them," Tita explained. "In terms of replenishing those ranks and recruitment for all health care systems, that continues to be a challenge."

Kaminski noted that staffing shortages forced difficult adjustments. 

"What we had to do, as did many other health organizations, is hire agency staffing, which is staff that's not permanent, often not from the area, qualified and competent, but not familiar with our organization, also very costly," Kaminski said.

Healthcare workers also experienced shifting public sentiment throughout the pandemic. Initial community support gave way to anger and mistrust as the crisis dragged on. 

"Suddenly, those heroes that we celebrated taking care of COVID initially turned into villains," Tita said.

The doctors noted that 1.2 million Americans died from the virus, many in isolation, leaving psychological, emotional and spiritual scars. 

"At some point, we will have to deal with this, and I'm sure we are dealing with it, maybe not in the best way," Tita said. "This was a history-changing, a life-changing event for all of us."

Despite ongoing questions about long COVID, both doctors said immunity through prior infection or vaccination has improved the situation. Most pandemic-era precautions like temperature checks and distancing markers have disappeared from hospitals.

"Most people can go out in public, do the activities that they're used to doing, not have to worry about entry into public facilities, and most people aren't masking right now," Kaminski said. "It definitely feels good to me and it's nice to have a normal cadence and routine back again."

Healthcare systems have applied lessons from the pandemic to other challenges. Kaminski said ProMedica used its "COVID playbook" when IV fluids became scarce following Hurricane Helene's impact on Puerto Rico and North Carolina.

Both hospital systems continue to utilize telemedicine services implemented during the pandemic.

The good news is that U.S. hospital organizations are doing relatively well in the first quarter of the year, as rising patient volume has helped to offset the impact of rising operational costs, according to leaders at the Chicago-based consulting and advisory firm Kaufman Hall, a Vizient company.

In January of this year, according to data released by Kaufman Hall on March 17 in its “National Hospital Flash Report,” average monthly operating margins for U.S. hospitals were 4.4 percent, up from 3.7 percent in December, and considerably above the 0.5 percent in November of last year. Indeed, throughout 2024, the average monthly operating margin hovered between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent consistently, except in April, when it reached 2.0 percent, and in December, when it hit 2.1 percent.

Per the stabilized numbers, Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of dataand analytics at Kaufman Hall, said in a statement contained in Monday's press release, that “January was a relatively stable month for hospitals, as more people received care due in part to seasonal challenges like flu and other respiratory diseases. Hospitals are also experiencing more rapid revenue growth from inpatient than outpatient services. Expenses are also rising, driven primarily by drug costs, though the rate of cost growth has slowed.”

The report, which can be accessed here, offered the following “Key Takeaways”;

Ø   Hospital performance remains stable at the start of 2025. This is due to a confluence of greater service volume and rising expenses.

Ø  Expenses continue to be driven primarily by the cost of drugs. However, the rate of cost growth has slowed considerably.

Ø  Inpatient revenue grew more quickly than outpatient revenue in January. More patients were treated in the hospital and emergency room.

Humana Inc.'s HUM senior-focused primary care providers, CenterWell and Conviva, have partnered with Icon Health to enhance access to musculoskeletal care for seniors. This initiative, set to launch in Palm Beach County, will integrate musculoskeletal specialists within primary care centers, ensuring a streamlined and high-quality care experience for elderly patients.

This collaboration is expected to bolster HUM's CenterWell segment, which saw an 8.9% year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. Expanding service offerings under value-based contracts could further drive growth. Musculoskeletal conditions are major contributors to disability among seniors, often requiring multi-specialist care. By embedding advanced practice providers within primary care settings, this initiative aims to simplify access to comprehensive treatment, improving both patient outcomes and convenience. The model provides both in-person and virtual care options to cater to the diverse needs of patients.

For HUM, this partnership reinforces its commitment to value-based care, strengthening its position as an innovator in senior healthcare. By addressing musculoskeletal issues through early intervention and coordinated care, the initiative is expected to reduce emergency room visits and hospital admissions, resulting in improved patient health and increased operational efficiency. These factors could contribute to cost savings and have a positive impact on HUM's financial performance.

By providing seamless access to specialized care, CenterWell is well-positioned to attract more seniors looking for integrated healthcare solutions. As value-based care continues to shape the industry, HUM's investment in comprehensive musculoskeletal services supports its long-term growth strategy and competitive edge in senior healthcare.

WOOD COUNTY, Ohio — The World Health Organization predicts a global shortage of at least 10 million workers in the health care industry by 2030. To help curb this growing issue of fewer nurses, physicians, technicians, and specialists, Owens Community College has decided to expand and renovate its Healthcare Education Center. 

The more than $31 million dollar expansion, Dean of Nursing & Health Professionals Cathy Ford said, was to give all Owens Community College students more hands-on training tools. 

The classrooms are filled with state-of-the-art simulators and equipment aimed at giving current and future students a more immersive experience. The new building offers dedicated sections and rooms to 10 of the 11 departments. 

“All of the labs have been greatly expanded in square footage, but that is in comparison in the amount of technology that is available in each of the labs spaces," Ford said. "That's really important now because we need to meet students where they are and in their learning process. Students learn very differently now than they did a decade ago and we're prepared for that now.”

Owens offers 22 degrees and certificates across its 11 healthcare disciplines:  

There are specific highlights like the Interprofessional Education and Simulation Center, where several of the disciplines collaborate with a goal of improving patient outcomes as a team versus just a few students learning at a time. There are simulated hospital rooms, high-fidelity mannequins, and flexible spaces, to name a few features. 

Owens celebrated the $31.3 million renovation and expansion, which started back in November 2023, at the Healthcare Education Center during a grand opening ceremony Monday. For more information about the 86,500 square foot space and the classes offered, click here.

Health systems are under increasing pressure to retain their patients – who have a variety of care options to choose from, both in-person and virtual. At the same time, inpatient capacity is limited and hospital care teams face a lot of strain.

By using cardiac data gathered through remote devices, ambulatory care is helping these facilities preserve and care for patients within the health system, but not always in the hospital.

Philips is one company that plays in this arena, and has insights on what facilities should know about leveraging this data to better work within their existing capacity and retain patients.

Healthcare IT News spoke recently with Julia Strandberg, chief business leader for connected care at Philips, to talk about some of the challenges hospitals and health systems face with patient retention. She also discussed capacity issues, how leveraging cardiac data via remote patient monitoring technologies can help overcome them – and what it will take for more healthcare organizations to adopt remote patient monitoring technologies.

Q. What are the challenges hospitals and health systems face regarding patient retention?

A. Impactful patient care in and out of the hospital is a non-negotiable – it's what patients require and desire. In the hospital, they seek high-quality care that is delivered quickly. Once home, they want to remain an active partner in their treatment, looking for timely updates on their health and clear guidance on next steps, including whether their healthcare provider recommends an in-person visit.

However, ongoing clinical staffing shortages and the complexities brought on by siloed hospital data often lead to longer wait times and delays in care.

As patient volumes grow and cases become more complex, fragmented data poses a significant challenge for hospitals and health systems. When clinicians lack a comprehensive, holistic view of a patient's health, it can add unnecessary roadblocks to determining a diagnosis and necessary treatment.

As a result, patients may be subjected to unnecessary tests and specialty visits. Not only can this increase patient stress, cost of care and dissatisfaction, but it can also take time away from patients who actually do require that specialty care.

To improve efficiency and ensure timely, high-quality care, hospitals should prioritize interoperability across all systems and devices, regardless of vendor. With seamless data access, clinicians can quickly review a patient's condition history and current health status, leading to faster, more accurate diagnoses.

These workflow improvements also free up clinicians' time, allowing them to focus more on direct patient care – whether in-person or remote – rather than sifting through disjointed records.

Q. What are the challenges hospitals face regarding capacity?

A. Health systems nationwide continue to struggle with overwhelming patient volumes and staffing shortages. These issues will only worsen as the population ages, and simultaneously, patients have become more complex, their conditions more acute. These factors significantly impact both patients and staff – eroding staff satisfaction and contributing to burnout, while decreasing patient safety and satisfaction.

One of the growing challenges healthcare professionals are facing, however, is they are overwhelmed by the volume of data generated. Almost 4 in 10 healthcare leaders (38%) say staff lose precious time pulling patient data together, leaving less time to care for patients.

Other administrative tasks such as scheduling and reporting also are time-consuming, with nurses spending 15-20 mins per hour on such tasks, taking time away from patients.

Open, interoperable systems will eliminate barriers and turn the vast pools of clinical data into actionable insights. For companies like Philips, it's critical we team up with healthcare providers and ecosystem partners to co-create systems that enhance care pathways and operational workflows, while reducing costs and the burden on staff.

Q. How can leveraging cardiac data via remote patient monitoring technologies help overcome some of these challenges?

A. Remote patient monitoring technologies, paired with advanced data analytics, are game changers when it comes to alleviating capacity bottlenecks.

Consider this scenario: a patient arrives at the ED following syncope, a fainting episode. While historically, this patient may have been admitted for observation, remote monitoring technology – in this case, a mobile cardiac telemetry device – can allow them to safely return home while their cardiac rhythms are monitored in real time.

Meanwhile, their data is shared with care team members, and their cardiologist will have this information in hand before their follow-up appointment, accelerating diagnosis and subsequent care.

This model reduces overcrowding by removing unnecessary admissions, allowing staff to focus more on acute cases. And the patient avoids a hospital stay and can recover comfortably at home.

Q. What will it take for more hospitals and health systems to adopt remote patient monitoring technologies?

A. We need to begin with an industry-wide mindset shift. First, we must recognize how quickly the care delivery model is evolving beyond the walls of the hospital and recognize the potential of this evolution.

Moving forward, we'll continue to see the advancement of home-based care technology, which is proven to improve patient outcomes, minimize acute care setting stay lengths for patients, and reduce the strain on healthcare facilities.

Riding the wave of this shift, we're in a better position to prioritize high-quality care delivery to patients virtually anywhere – and leverage remote patient monitoring tech to do so. Health systems can retain their patients while freeing up capacity by opening doors for more care outside the hospital.

Finally, hospitals and health systems must partner with technology vendors that prioritize interoperability. This approach gives clinicians access to high-quality, real-time patient information for enhanced care delivery.

Having a solid foundation of interoperability creates both clinical efficiencies and sets the stage for AI to empower providers with more timely, informed decision making across the care continuum – ultimately improving patient outcomes, cost savings and resource management.

Not far from the joint police/fire rescue building along Northwest Martin Luther King Ave. is a place that offers health care for those underserved and anyone needing quality care.

Recently, a Star-Banner reporter went to the center and spoke with CEO Levonda Goodson.

Here's what we know:

Estella Byrd Whitman Community Health Center at 819 NW Seventh St., a non-profit primary health care clinic. Ironically, the location is on the grounds that used to be the home of Estella Byrd Whitman.

Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m.-4 p.m., and Friday from 8 a.m.-2 p.m. It's closed on Saturday and Sunday, and is staffed with three nurse practitioners and a medical director.

It was founded in 2009 by Carolyn Adams, Dr. Pamela Lewin and the late Arthur Adams. Estella Byrd Whitman Community Health Center got its name from Carolyn Adams' grandmother, Estella Byrd Whitman. The goal is to fulfill a promise of establishing a medical venue/home for those living in Tucker Hill, an historic Black community that's on the same street as the center. It was established because residents living in the area didn't have easy access to health care. And secondly, it was a way to treat the underserved. The center opened its doors in 2009 at St. Paul AME Church, which is a few yards away. Through donations and support from city officials, the center entered its present building in 2018.

On average, anywhere from 12 to 15 per day. Patients come from Ocala, Summerfield, Belleview and Citrus County. The staff provide services to those who are underserved, in between jobs, can't afford health insurance or people with insurance.

Multiple, to include regular check-ups, vaccinations, health screenings and primary care services.

Yes, along with walk-ins, sliding fee scales based on income and anyone who needs assistance. Goodson said their goal is to be an impact to the community which fuels them to move forward. She said they thrive on patient care, which is most important to the staff. For appointments, call (352) 875-2226.

Several days ago, SMA Healthcare announced they were partnering with the center for primary care services at its main facility in southwest Ocala. The northwest Ocala health center will start the care in April, according to a news release. The center won the non-profit of the year award that came from the Ocala/Marion County Community Foundation at their Inspire Gala held March 8.

Presently, they're working on funding to get another building so they can expand services for patients under one roof. The center is hosting a spring fund raising event on April 6 from 4-8 p.m. at The Reilly Arts Center at 500 NE Ninth St. The theme is a Roaring 20's Gangster and guests can wear clothing that matched the occasion.

For more information about the center, visit www.ebwchc.org.

Healthcare providers are under immense pressure to deliver high-quality care while managing financial constraints, operational inefficiencies, and an ever-evolving regulatory landscape. Vital to overcoming these challenges is the need for seamless communication and data exchange across systems. Fewer than one in three hospitals can electronically find, send, receive, and integrate patient information from another provider, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving full interoperability.

Legacy systems are often what stands in the way between seamless integration and interoperability. While electronic health records (EHRs) and other modern platforms have transformed aspects of healthcare delivery, traditional fax systems continue to serve as the basis for transmitting critical patient records, authorizations, and referrals. However, these legacy systems often create barriers for healthcare organizations. The key to realizing the full potential of legacy systems in modern healthcare lies in overcoming interoperability challenges — ensuring seamless data exchange between various systems while preserving the trusted reliability and security healthcare providers depend on. This modernization is not just about maintaining outdated legacy systems, it's about building a stronger, scalable foundation for the future of healthcare.

Interoperability: A crucial step toward modernization


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

A significant barrier to digital transformation in the healthcare industry is achieving interoperability — the smooth flow of data between systems that typically operate in isolation. Despite the rising adoption of EHRs and other digital communication platforms, many organizations struggle to integrate their legacy fax systems into modern workflows. This creates silos where vital patient information becomes trapped in outdated formats, further increasing administrative burdens.  

Modern cloud-based fax solutions offer a bridge between traditional and digital systems. By leveraging APIs and technology partnerships, cloud fax can automatically integrate faxed documents into EHRs or other healthcare platforms. This ensures that vital information is accessible in real time while remaining confidential and HIPAA-compliant, enhancing coordination and decision-making. Moreover, interoperability facilitated by cloud fax lays the groundwork for adopting advanced technologies, such as predictive analytics and remote patient monitoring, which rely on seamless data exchange.

In 2023, 70% of hospitals engaged in all four domains of interoperable exchange, compared to 46% in 2018. This growing commitment underscores the importance of modernization efforts that enhance interoperability, allowing healthcare providers to unlock the full potential of their existing systems. 

Rather than eliminating legacy fax systems altogether, modernization efforts can build upon the reliability and trust that these systems have established over time. By enhancing these systems with cloud-based interoperability, healthcare providers can drive significant improvements in efficiency and patient care without the disruption of a complete overhaul. In fact, the global healthcare interoperability solutions market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2024 to 2029, highlighting the increasing demand for seamless integration and innovation in the sector.

Operational advantages & the path to digital transformation  

Healthcare providers face substantial financial and operational pressures, with over $8 billion lost annually due to IT inefficiencies, system downtime, and lack of integration. Interoperability and operational efficiency go hand in hand as seamless data exchange across systems reduces redundancies, minimizes downtime, and ensures that critical resources are utilized to their fullest potential. 

This is where cloud-based solutions come in. By eliminating the need for on-premises equipment, these solutions empower healthcare organizations to scale their communication capabilities without the limitations of traditional hardware. 

This scalability is especially crucial during peak periods, such as open enrollment or public health crises, when legacy servers often struggle to manage increased volumes. When integrated seamlessly with existing systems, cloud fax solutions enhance operational workflows, reduce administrative overhead, and allow IT teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine maintenance. 

These efficiencies not only support day-to-day operations but also provide a solid foundation for broader digital transformation, advancing interoperability and enabling a more connected healthcare ecosystem.

The future of healthcare communication  

As the healthcare landscape evolves, so must its communication systems. Cloud Fax represents the immediate future of healthcare communication: a secure, efficient, and compliant solution that meets the demands of a rapidly changing industry. By modernizing healthcare systems with cloud-based solutions, healthcare providers can preserve the reliability of traditional systems while overcoming their limitations to achieve ongoing growth. For organizations seeking to balance innovation with regulatory requirements, it offers a clear path forward.

Yesterday the Health Impact Investment Platform (HIIP) held its inaugural Steering Committee meeting, marking a significant milestone in advancing innovative financing for global health. As the Platform's highest decision-making body, the Committee – consisting of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank – reviewed progress, endorsed key governance and operational priorities, and provided strategic guidance on HIIP's efforts to expand primary health care (PHC) services in low- and middle-income countries. The meeting represents a significant step forward in advancing sustainable financing solutions for global health.

The HIIP was unveiled during the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris in 2023, and is a landmark partnership between WHO, multilateral development banks and beneficiary countries. Amid a US$ 371 billion annual health financing gap for health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a US$ 31.1 billion annual funding requirement for pandemic preparedness, the Platform innovates multilateral solutions to increase the share of development funding going to the health sector. Integrating technical expertise, financial resources and local knowledge into impactful, country-driven investments in vulnerable communities, the Platform has mobilized over US$ 30 million of investment for WHO to support countries in developing prioritized investment plans for potential support from MDBs and donors.

The Platform aims to use these plans to generate over US$1.5 billion funding for low- and middle-income country governments to build resilience against pandemic threats and the climate crisis.

“Primary health care is the cornerstone of equitable, cost-effective, and inclusive health systems,” said Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General at the World Health Organization. “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a transformative initiative to mobilize financing for climate-adaptive and crisis-resilient primary health care in the countries that need it most. WHO is proud to partner with multilateral development banks and countries to ensure these funds deliver tangible impact for the communities we serve.”

The First Steering Committee builds on months of progress since the Platform's official launch in September 2024, with early-stage engagements in more than 10 countries. During the meeting, Committee members approved key operational documents for the platform, reviewed Concept Notes developed to operationalize primary health care investments in Burundi, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Morocco and Zambia and formally approved the Proposal for Action in Ethiopia, unlocking funding to support the finalization of its national PHC investment plan. Members reinforced the platform's core focus on scaling primary health care investments, accelerating progress toward universal health coverage, and strengthening health system resilience in low- and middle-income countries.

Issa Faye, Director General of Global Practice and Partnerships at the Islamic Development Bank noted, “We are committed to catalyzing impactful, sustainable investments that strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Today's discussions reaffirmed our shared vision and commitment to scaling up investment in primary health care, ensuring that no country is left behind in achieving universal health coverage and pandemic preparedness.”

The next Steering Committee meeting will convene on the margins of the Seventy-Eighth World Health Assembly (19–27 May 2025), where progress on Ethiopia's investment plan and new country engagements will be reviewed.

Thomas Östros, Vice President at the European Investment Bank and the newly appointed Chair of the Steering Committee emphasized, “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a unique opportunity to bridge the health financing gap and drive sustainable investments where they are most needed. As we look ahead to the next Steering Committee, our focus remains on turning commitments into action. We call on all stakeholders to join us in expanding access to quality primary health care, ensuring that investments today translate into stronger, more resilient health systems for the future.”

Going forward, the HIIP will deepen engagements with the first wave of applicants and expand support to other interested countries. Eligible countries for the HIIP include low- and middle-income countries which are a country of operation for at least one of the partner Multilateral Development Banks. Governments seeking to strengthen PHC through tailored technical assistance and investment support are invited to express their interest via an email addressed to hiip_secretariat@who.int.

We need to embrace a more holistic, integrated approach to mental healthcare: one that combines the best of human expertise with rapid innovations of technology, all while being mindful of the real-world challenges faced by marginalized and underserved communities.

Many would describe the current state of the mental healthcare system today as bleak. High costs of care, long wait times, and staffing shortages have left many people feeling disillusioned, disconnected, and, at times, hopeless. Not only do we need new solutions, we also need to be cautious not to simply scale what isn't working. 

Consider this analogy: two men started a business selling melons. They bought melons for $1 each and sold them for $1 each. After multiple trips between the farmer's field and their roadside shed, one partner remarked, “We're not making much money, are we?” The other replied, “Do you think we need a bigger truck?”

This story is a perfect metaphor for a problem we often see in the healthcare system: continuing to scale a broken model instead of rethinking it. It's not about getting a bigger truck – it's about rethinking the road we're traveling.

Not everyone needs or wants therapy 

The rapid expansion of teletherapy has opened up much needed access to mental healthcare. But as highlighted in Ellen Barry's recent New York Times article, a growing body of research demonstrates the teletherapy boom has disproportionately benefited privileged groups while leaving marginalized communities behind. 

As we look for answers, the demand for innovative solutions has surged. Over the last decade, people were increasingly turning to search engines for help, using Google to ask “How can I feel better?” or “Do I have depression?” in search of support. Today, they're turning to ChatGPT and other chatbots in the absence of an abundance of mental health clinicians. This isn't just a trend; it's a sign that people are actively seeking help but, for various reasons, are not engaging with traditional therapy. Whether due to stigma, cost, availability, or even uncertainty about where to start, too many individuals are left to navigate mental health challenges on their own.

But here's the question: what if we could offer a seamless bridge to human-led care and clinically proven digital mental health tools that provide real-time, evidence-based support? This vision doesn't replace human therapists; rather, it complements and enhances the existing system by ensuring the vast majority of people who need help have access to a safe, supportive, and ethical entry point for their mental health journey. 


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

AI is here to stay

As a clinical psychologist who has spent the vast majority of my career seeing patients in a therapy setting, I wholeheartedly believe that this is where AI and technology can play a transformative role. While many people find benefit from working with a clinician at varying points throughout their lives, there is a growing need to incorporate AI-driven support into the system. For many, technology offers a way to open up about their mental health in a way that feels less daunting. Subclinical AI tools can guide individuals with in-the-moment support during times of distress, help manage or understand symptoms, offer a judgment-free place to reflect, and connect them to resources for further support – all while offering anonymity and privacy. With the proper guardrails and training, AI can empower people who are otherwise hesitant to reach out or don't have access to traditional care.

But, like any innovation, we must tread carefully. The integration of AI into mental healthcare must be grounded in safety, evidence-based practices, and strong ethical considerations. That's why at Headspace, we're not just building technology for technology's sake; we're engaging clinicians and other mental health professionals, researchers, and data security experts to ensure our solutions complement and enhance traditional care, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for our members.

Yet, we have a responsibility to recognize and address the shortcomings that exist outside of technology. We know teletherapy isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, so we can't simply scale this model and expect to solve the deep disparities that exist in mental healthcare.

Reimagining the future of mental healthcare 

Instead, we need to rethink the infrastructure and design of mental healthcare altogether. This means:

The truth is, we don't need a bigger truck. We need to redesign the road entirely. To do this, we need to embrace a more holistic, integrated approach to mental healthcare: one that combines the best of human expertise with rapid innovations of technology, all while being mindful of the real-world challenges faced by marginalized and underserved communities. Only then can we begin to solve the crisis at hand.

Madaket Health Achieving Rapid Growth Due to Increased Demand for Healthcare Administration Automation and Provider Data Accuracy

Newly appointed veteran executive and sales teams to lead the company through next phase of growth

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Madaket Health, a leader in provider-payer collaboration and data exchange, today announced rapid growth fueled by increased demand for accurate, reliable provider data in healthcare. To further the company's success and continued market expansion, Madaket has fortified its leadership and sales teams.


The healthcare industry is under great pressure to provide visibility into more of their practices and operations, which increases the necessity of having the most accurate data available. During 2024, Madaket achieved incredible growth in revenue and partnerships and is on course to exceed projections this year.




To meet demand, Madaket has appointed Gregg Morin as vice president of partnerships, Scott Acrey and Ed Calderon as senior sales executives, and Devon Hunter as sales executive. With more than 70 years of collective sales and healthcare industry knowledge, this team has held positions at top organizations, including Softeq, Epiq, symplr, Virsys12, Oracle, Aramark Healthcare, and PerfectServe. These appointments come at a pivotal time as healthcare organizations face mounting regulatory pressures, including the No Surprises Act and recent price transparency mandates, which demand more precise and up-to-date provider data.




Madaket has established strategic partnerships with leading healthcare technology solutions providers, including Verisys, ProviderTrust, and NextGen Healthcare. By integrating Madaket's capabilities into their platforms, organizations have enhanced provider data accuracy across payer-provider ecosystems and streamlined payer enrollment for provider networks.




“Inaccurate provider data has long been one of healthcare's most complex and costly challenges,” said Madaket Health CEO Eric Demers. “With our new team members on board, we're well-positioned to help more organizations – payers, providers, and industry partners – streamline their data, reduce administrative burden, and ultimately, help deliver better patient care.”




Alongside provider enrollment platforms and services, Madaket's Provider Data Management (PDM) platform and Provider Directory offer a comprehensive, single source of truth for the most accurate, up-to-date information on the market through its Provider Data Exchange (PDX) system. Real-time and automated updates to the Provider Directory help payers effortlessly comply with the No Surprises Act's 48-hour requirement.

Oops, something went wrong

Google on Tuesday announced new products and features aimed at healthcare use cases, including improved overviews in Google Search for health queries, medical records APIs, and new health-focused "open" AI models.

In Search, Google says it's using AI and ranking systems to expand "knowledge panel" answers on thousands of health-related topics, and adding support for healthcare queries in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese on mobile. Search already provided knowledge panel answers for ailments such as the flu or the common cold, but the update greatly expands the number of topics the knowledge panels cover, the company said.

Google is also debuting a Search feature it's calling "What People Suggest" on mobile in the U.S. to highlight content from users with shared experiences relating to health conditions. For instance, if someone asks about common exercises for people dealing with arthritis, What People Suggest will collate reports from various forums around the web using AI.

What People Suggest builds on capabilities like Google's personal health stories feature on YouTube, and seems pretty clearly aimed at keeping people from leaving Search for Reddit and other sources of health advice.

"While people come to Search to find reliable medical information from experts, they also value hearing from others who have similar experiences," Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer at Google, wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. "Using AI, we're able to organize different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes, helping you quickly grasp what people are saying."

Google on Tuesday also launched new medical records APIs globally for its Health Connect platform for Android devices. These will help collect data from medical providers and let users see this data across different apps, as well as make it easier to access the info on devices like phones, Google said.

"These APIs enable apps to read and write medical record information like allergies, medications, immunizations, and lab results in standard FHIR format," DeSalvo explained in the blog post. "With these additions, Health Connect supports over 50 data types across activity, sleep, nutrition, vitals, and now medical records — making it easier to connect your everyday health data with data from your doctor's office."

In other product announcements pertaining to health, Google said that the Loss of Pulse Detection feature on its Pixel Watch 3 smartwatch, which has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will launch by the end of March in the U.S. The feature can detect when you've experienced a loss of pulse — for example, due to primary cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning — and automatically prompt a call to emergency services if you're unresponsive.

Google also unveiled new open AI models for drug discovery called TxGemma, following the company's launch of a collection of Gemini AI models for multimodal use cases in healthcare. TxGemma is set to be released in the coming weeks.

The Yukon Party wants to see U.S. doctors set up shop in the Yukon — and they want to see the governing Liberals do everything they can to help facilitate that.

In the legislative assembly on March 13, Lake Laberge MLA Brad Cathers presented a motion urging the government to start taking steps to recruit American healthcare workers, including setting up a marketing campaign, allowing U.S.-certified doctors, surgeons and specialists to practice in the territory, and speeding up the licensing of American nurses and other healthcare workers.

As the News has reported, the territory is experiencing a physician shortage. None of the visiting physicians who practiced in the territory in 2024 put down roots, and a surgeon left the territory, stating the “systemic underfunding” of the territory's surgical services as a reason.

Geraldine Van Bibber, MLA for Porter Creek North, referenced the tumultuous political climate stateside in question period.

“Right now, given what is going on south of the border, there seems to be a unique opportunity to recruit American doctors who wish to leave the U.S.,” said Van Bibber, referencing Nova Scotia's 2023 move to allow American board-certified physicians to practice in the province without extra certification.

“Will the Government of Yukon take steps to quickly allow U.S. board-certified doctors, surgeons, and specialists to practise in the Yukon?”

The B.C. government is currently crafting a similar approach. According to a March 11 press release, that government is working with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. to allow American doctors, certified with the American Board of Medical Specialties to become fully licensed to work in B.C. “without the need for further assessment, examination or training.”

The release also says the province is working with the B.C. College of Nurses and Midwives to hasten the process of getting U.S.-registered nurses working in British Columbian healthcare.

With the new process, the B.C. government said that American nurses can apply directly to the college for licensing.

In answering Van Bibber's question, Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai said that the territorial department of community services is working closely like the health department to recruit healthcare workers.

In his response Pillai also mentioned a collaborative letter of intent about health human resources which signed between the Yukon and Nova Scotia on July 26, 2023.

A press release issued at the time said the two jurisdictions will “share best practices on the recruitment, retention and training of health care providers, including the credentialing and licensing of internationally educated health providers.”

He referenced the territory's newly-launched navigator system for foreign healthcare workers looking to become licensed and practice in the territory.

Health Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee said the government is working with regulators — as well as provinces, territories and the feds — to find ways to get physicians licensed, including internationally-educated ones.

She also said YG's goal is a recruiting system geared towards all sorts of internationally-trained healthcare workers, not just Americans.

Outside the legislature, Cathers told reporters he and his party want to see a marketing campaign promoting the Yukon, directly targeted at healthcare workers in the United States.

“There's a unique opportunity to, to go after them right now, to reach out to those people and to encourage them to come and work here,” Cathers said.

Cathers said YG needs to be competitive with other jurisdictions in terms of offers to attract healthcare workers. He said incentives should target American healthcare workers interested in moving north and providing service to Yukoners.

On March 17, Cathers and Yukon Party leader Currie Dixon asked questions about attracting U.S. healthcare workers in the legislative session, continuing the push from the previous week.

In 2019, Cristina Iglesias filed a lawsuit that changed the course of treatment for herself and other transgender inmates in federal custody.

Iglesias, a trans woman who had been incarcerated for more than 25 years, was transferred from a men's prison to a women's one in 2021. And in 2022, she reached a landmark settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to receive gender-affirming surgery, which the agency said it had never provided for anyone in its custody.

By the time she got the surgery 10 months later, another federal inmate had also received a procedure to align their body with their gender identity. No other such surgeries for people in federal custody are publicly documented, although some people in state prisons have also received gender-affirming surgery, including at least five in Illinois and 20 in California within a U.S. prison population that tops 1.25 million people.

Still, those procedures loomed large in the 2024 presidential election. Political advertising for President Donald Trump and other Republicans included $215 million on anti-trans ads, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. One such ad declared that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris supported "taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners," and concluded, "Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you." Some Democrats bemoaned the ads as having helped tip the election.

In the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, 55% of voters felt support for trans rights had gone too far, according to VoteCast, a survey by The Associated Press and partners including KFF, the health policy research, polling, and news organization that includes KFF Health News.

On Inauguration Day, Trump issued a flurry of executive orders that included a directive to bar federal spending on gender-affirming care in federal prisons and to "ensure that males are not detained" in federal women's facilities.

"President Trump received an overwhelming mandate from the American people to restore commonsense principles and safeguard women's spaces — even prisons — from biological men," White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email. "Forcing taxpayers to pay for gender transition for prisoners is the exact sort of insanity that the American people rejected at the ballot box in November."

But for Iglesias, 50, Trump's order was a shocking reversal.

"It puts someone's life in danger being in a men's prison as a trans woman," she said from Chicago, where she's lived since her release in 2023. "It'd be like putting sheep in a hyenas' den."

Iglesias said she faced emotional and physical abuse from her father for her desire to be female. When she was 12, she said, he put a gun in her mouth after finding her wearing her sister's clothes. Iglesias said she ran away from home, stole checks, cars, and jewelry, and ended up in jail.

Lockup was not fun, Iglesias said, but it was the first place she got to be treated as a woman. So, she said, she wanted to stay. In 1994, she landed in federal prison after writing threatening letters to federal judges and prosecutors, according to court filings. In 2005, records show, she pleaded guilty to sending a letter to British officials that she falsely claimed contained anthrax. She told investigators she hoped to get extradited.

"I was reading these things where they were allowing trans females to start living with females," Iglesias said.

She said her outlook changed after the death of her mother in 2010, which prompted her to get serious about having a life outside of prison, and about improving her life inside it.

She began requesting hormone therapy in 2011 and was approved for it in 2015, according to court records. The 2019 lawsuit that led to her transfer to a women's prison and her surgery was initially handwritten and prepared with the help of only another inmate.

"The lawsuit was the foundation for everything that I am today," Iglesias said. "For the first time in my life, instead of digging myself in these holes, I was digging myself out."

Along with her settlement, Iglesias received a commitment from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to create a timeline for considering other inmates' requests for gender-affirming care, and to recognize permanent hair removal and gender-affirming surgery as medically necessary treatments for gender dysphoria — a medical condition in which the discrepancy between a person's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth causes significant distress.

In February, in response to Trump's executive order, the bureau issued new guidelines requiring prison staffers to refer to inmates' "legal name or pronouns corresponding to their biological sex," and ending clothing requests "that do not align with an inmate's biological sex." The guidelines end referrals for gender-affirming surgery but allow inmates already receiving treatment, such as hormone therapy, to continue.

However, in a lawsuit filed March 7, a trans prisoner alleged the hormone therapy she had been receiving since 2016 was stopped on Jan. 26.

Spokespeople for the bureau did not respond to requests for comment.

The bureau spent $153,000 on hormone therapy in fiscal year 2022, its former director told Congress, 0.01% of its total spending on health care.

The new guidelines on trans inmates say that Trump's executive order "does not supersede or change" the obligation to comply with federal regulations. But the executive order calls for amending them to prevent trans women from being housed in women's prisons.

"It hurt my heart when I seen that because I do know other girls that are still in prison," said Iglesias, who spent more than 25 years in male facilities. "Female prison is safe for a trans woman, and you can be who you are. You're not penalized because you're feminine."

But requesting a transfer to a facility matching inmates' gender identity had not been easy, and few prisoners had been moved before the order. A 2025 government court filing said that federal prisons house 2,198 trans prisoners out of over 155,000 inmates. Of those, the filing said, 22 are trans women housed in female facilities, and one is a trans man in a men's facility. Although courts have blocked attempts to move that small subset of trans prisoners after the order, a trans prisoner not included in those suits had been relocated, The Guardian news outlet reported.

A Department of Justice report from 2014 estimated that trans inmates in state and federal prisons were 10 times as likely as other prisoners to report incidents of sexual victimization.

Iglesias said she experienced such violence firsthand. Included in her suit was a copy of a 2017 psychological report that said Iglesias reported being the victim of sexual misconduct or abuse in 1993, 2001, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Later filings included allegations of having been raped in 2019 and 2020, and a series of rapes, threats, and other abuse in 2021 before she was transferred to a female facility. Iglesias said she faced more abuse than she officially reported.

"Just because you commit a crime doesn't mean you deserve to have violence against you," said Michelle García, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Illinois and one of the attorneys who ultimately represented Iglesias.

Federal law requires all inmates to be protected from abuse. A 1994 Supreme Court decision acknowledged trans inmates as particularly vulnerable to attack. Regulations from the Prison Rape Elimination Act, passed unanimously by Congress in 2003, contain specific provisions for trans inmates, including allowing them to shower separately from other inmates and requiring prison officials to consider their health and safety when deciding whether to house them in male or female facilities.

Courts also have ruled that "deliberate indifference" to an inmate's "serious medical needs" violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on "cruel and unusual" punishments. The quality of overall medical care for federal prisoners has come under scrutiny amid reports of inmates going without needed medical care and preventable deaths.

Iglesias successfully argued in court that gender-affirming surgery was necessary for her gender dysphoria. She was diagnosed with what was then called "gender identity disorder" soon after entering federal custody in 1994, according to court filings. Her diagnosis was updated to gender dysphoria in 2015.

Iglesias' court filings documented her having been assessed for the risk of suicide 33 times and placed on suicide watch 12 times, as well as an attempt at self-castration in 2009.

"Defendants are aware of Iglesias's suffering, but have delayed her treatment without evaluating her medically," the judge in her case wrote.

García called the Trump administration's targeting of care for trans inmates cruel, unnecessary, and illogical.

"They're not assessing the constitutional rights of people," García said. "They're making choices because this is a vulnerable community that they can rally people behind to hate."

Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, area hospitals and health systems are still reeling from its impact.

In the spring of 2020, hospitals were the first to feel the full force of the pandemic as they scrambled to find enough beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE). And yes, health care providers learned lessons that continue to help them care for the sick and prepare for any future outbreaks.

Anyone can see the impact in the easy availability of hand sanitizer and masks in health care facilities, the absence of salad bars in cafeterias and the prevalence of mental health therapists offering telehealth appointments.

And hospitals no longer struggle with a lack of basic outbreak supplies.

But the pandemic created huge staffing and financial challenges that have not gone away, health officials said.

“Our hospitals are still experiencing vacancy rates more than double pre-pandemic levels,” said Lauren Ford, vice president, strategy and analysis for the Iroquois Healthcare Association, which represents more than 50 hospitals and health systems in 32 upstate counties.

And those vacancies are hitting all departments, she said.

To fill the clinical vacancies, hospitals now rely far more heavily on traveling, or agency, nurses and other staff, driving expenses up. That's one factor that led to 60% of their hospitals ending 2023 in the red, Ford said.

The pandemic also created an atmosphere in which disease prevention has actually gotten harder, Dr. Gary Zimmer, chief medical officer in the Mohawk Valley Health System, argued. Too many people believe health misinformation, which has proliferated, and don't trust the advice coming from public health professionals, he said.

“I think that we'll be better prepared to respond to whatever the next outbreak is from a health system perspective,” Zimmer said.

But the public might be even less willing to follow the advice of public health officials given “such weaponization of information right now”, exacerbating any outbreak, he added.

“It's very interesting to me,” Zimmer said, “how it has been turned into some political agenda, which is a shame.”

One of the biggest benefits of the pandemic lockdown was simply a fortunate side effect. With people staying home when they got sick, with people spending less time together in general and with people wearing masks, almost no one caught the flu during the first and second winter of COVID-19, Zimmer said.

But the discovery that flu really is preventable hasn't changed much or prevented the rampant spread of flu, COVID-19, RSV and norovirus this winter.

Too many people aren't wearing masks when they're sniffling or coughing, or staying home from work when they're sick, Zimmer said. And too many people don't trust vaccines, he said.

“To me, it's mind boggling that we didn't learn our lesson,” he said.

He blamed conspiracy theories and the “politicization of science.”

“People don't trust what they're seeing (from public health officials),” Zimmer said. “I think we do know (best practices). I worry that that information is not being widely adopted.”

Health care providers and public health officials are doing a better job of reacting to outbreaks of illness, he added. But that's not enough.

They need to get better at giving the public proactive messages about, for example, what to do when flu cases are rising: stay home, don't go to the emergency room with sniffles, take a decongestant, stay well hydrated, don't get other people sick, Zimmer said.

“Those, we still have more work to do,” he said, “to be able to get the word out to the community in a way that they believe it's coming from a good place for their own health and welfare.”

Health care providers and public health officials did learn a lot during the country's first pandemic in a century. That knowledge led to new protocols, procedures and data collection in hospitals for infection prevention, treatment and tracking, Zimmer said.

In the Mohawk Valley Health System, the changes were as small as more masks kept at the front desk, ready for visitors with respiratory symptoms, and the end of the salad bar and self-serve soup in the cafeteria, said Caitlin McCann, vice president of marketing and communications.

 Wynn Hospital in Utica also restricted the public to accessing the hospital through its front door and emergency department door to improve security, but also to make it easier to ensure that infection control procedures are followed, McCann said.

The hospital has also put formal visiting hours back in place, no longer allowing visitors to stay past 8 p.m., except in special circumstances, to minimize exposure to infections, said Zimmer, who said he's spoken to colleagues about changes since he did not work at the hospital during the height of the pandemic.

In one sense, the pandemic came along at a fortuitous time for MVHS since it was still designing Wynn Hospital, which opened in October, 2023.

A few things in the hospital's design were changed based on what doctors learned about infection control and dealing with outbreaks during the pandemic, Zimmer said.

One big change was the inclusion of better isolation capabilities, he said. For example, an entire pod with 10 beds in the emergency department can turn into a negative pressure unit, which stops the spread of infection outside the room, if needed.

That's in addition to regular negative pressure rooms in the department, Zimmer said.

And there are more inpatient isolation units than had originally been planned, he said.

On a treatment level, doctors learned a lot about managing an infectious respiratory illness when resources, especially beds and ventilators, were tight, Zimmer said. As the pandemic progressed, they got better at deciding exactly which patients needed to be in the hospital; managing low-oxygen patients when there weren't enough ventilators, treating patients on other oxygen-delivering devices and managing patients on ventilators or other devices outside the intensive care unit, he said.

The pandemic changed “the dynamic about the care of contagious people and people with respiratory illnesses very dramatically,” Zimmer said.

And hospitals also learned about preparation.

 “We have lot of ventilators (now),” Zimmer said.

Rome Health also learned from capacity issues during the pandemic.

“COVID-19 was a catalyst for Rome Health to refocus efforts to ensure access to care was available in Rome,” said Cassie Winter, vice president of communications and marketing. “With regional demand exceeding capacity, we needed to be ale to provide the care locally because of the difficulty of transferring patients due to a lack of capacity at tertiary care facilities and the lack of ambulance availability due to staffing shortages.”

Winter also noted another big change that has done a lot to increase access to care: telehealth. Medicare, Medicaid and insurers wouldn't generally pay for providers for services delivered through telehealth before the pandemic. But that changed during the pandemic and telehealth continues to be used far more frequently.

And now providers all have telehealth infrastructure for smoother transitions during future crises, Winter said.

 “For example, during the snow emergencies this season,” she said, “some in-person visits could be converted to telehealth and some job functions could telecommute.”

One of the biggest impacts of the pandemic on health care has been how difficult it's gotten to hire and retain employees in every department, Zimmer said.

And for workers not involved in direct patient care, commutes have become a major problem, he said.

“People have opportunities to work in a lot of other areas that don't require them to drive to work every day,” he said.

There are even fewer volunteers now than before the pandemic, Winter said.

And burnout and anxiety from the pandemic continue to plague many clinical workers, which has contributed to staffing shortages, she said.

For registered nurses, the job with the highest gap between need and employees, the vacancy rate across the Iroquois Healthcare Association's member hospitals and health systems was 15.4% as of January, Ford said. That translates to over 2,600 unfilled nursing jobs, she said.

And in the long term care facilities run by the association's members, about 20% of positions for R.N.'s, licensed practical nurses and certified nursing assistants are unfilled, limiting facilities' capacity to care for patients just when the demand for services is rising, Ford said.

There's also a big shortage of behavioral health workers and a physician shortage that cuts down on services and leads to lower revenues, Ford said.

Even vacancies among, for example, patient registration clerks, affects operations and patient experience “in really meaningful ways,” she said.

With all the staffing issues, hospitals have been forced to hire workers, particularly nurses, who work for agencies and take on jobs per diem, Ford said. During the pandemic, these nurses made up staffing shortfalls given the surge in patients.

But hospitals have continued to rely on them to make up for unfilled positions, she said. At the height of reliance on them in 2022, some hospitals' costs for contract labor went up as much as 300% to 400%, she said. That year association member hospitals spent close to $1.2 billion on contract labor, Ford said.

By 2024, that had fallen to about $700 million, but that's still considerably more than they spent before the pandemic, she said.

Hospitals are trapped in a vicious cycle in which the cost of travel nurses prevents them from offering the kinds of compensation packages that would help them to hire the permanent staffing they'd prefer, Ford said.

Some hospitals never even used travel nurses before the pandemic, but they now form a consistent percentage of everyone's workforce, she said.

“I think there's just been a fundamental change in staffing models,” she said.

Total labor expenses for area hospitals and health systems have gone up 37% since 2019, Ford said. And other expenses have risen sharply, too, with medication showing the sharpest increase, she said.

And that's all contributed to financial struggles for hospitals and health systems. By the end of 2023, 60% of hospitals in the association had negative operating margins, Ford said. Things improved somewhat in 2024 given strong investments in health care by the federal and state governments, she said.

But some hospitals remained in the red and very few reached the 2.5% operating margins that experts in hospital finance believe to be healthy, Ford said.

And that means that the final state budget and the federal government's decisions on how much to cut health care expenses, Ford said, will play a big role in determining the health and stability of upstate New York's hospitals.

NEW HAVEN, CT – With Medicaid facing unprecedented cuts at the federal level, Connecticut is on the verge of a healthcare crisis that could devastate families, strain hospitals, and upend community health centers already struggling to stay afloat, officials said Monday.





Lawmakers, healthcare administrators, and advocates gathered Monday at Fair Haven Community Health Care for a roundtable discussion to address the potential consequences of these budget reductions, stress the urgency of action, and dispel widespread misconceptions about the program.





“Medicaid is often thought of as a program for people who don't work, but that's simply not true,” said Tiffany Donelson, CEO of the Connecticut Health Foundation. “Sixty-six percent of Medicaid recipients are employed. They're childcare workers, grocery store clerks, and home health aides. When we cut Medicaid, we are cutting the foundation that supports the workforce Connecticut depends on.”


Far from being a program that affects only the most economically disadvantaged, Medicaid serves 1.2 million Connecticut residents – a third of the state's population – including low-income families, people with disabilities, seniors in nursing homes, and even middle-class individuals who lack employer-sponsored insurance.





“There is not a single district in Connecticut without Medicaid recipients,” Donelson continued. “Even in our wealthiest towns, people depend on this program. Yet we are watching a situation unfold that could dismantle that support overnight.”





Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon said that Medicaid is woven into the financial structure of the state's healthcare system.


“Every hospital in Connecticut could not operate as it does without Medicaid,” he said. “Our nursing homes, our intermediate care facilities, all depend on it. If these cuts go through, it will devastate our healthcare infrastructure.”





Connecticut's Medicaid system had been facing challenges long before federal cuts were proposed. Health centers, which provide care for more than 440,000 low-income residents, have already resorted to depleting cash reserves and freezing hiring just to remain operational. Last week, Connecticut's Federally Qualified Health Centers filed a Declaratory Ruling Request with the Department of Social Services, arguing that the agency has failed to comply with both state and federal laws requiring reimbursement rates to reflect actual costs.





Sean Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, addressed the strain that health centers have been under. 


“We are already being forced to cut back on services due to underfunding,” Frick said. “If Medicaid funding is reduced even further, it will devastate healthcare access for the most vulnerable in our state.”





State leaders, including Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, discussed the fiscal constraints Connecticut is already facing. “We're already at our spending cap,” Looney said. “Even a small cut in federal Medicaid reimbursement could throw our state budget into chaos.”





The effects of Medicaid cuts will be widespread, with hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers uncertain about the future. Many Connecticut nursing homes depend on Medicaid funding, and further reductions could force closures, leaving thousands of elderly and disabled residents without care.


“We've already lost nursing homes due to financial pressures,” said Matt Barrett, president of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities. “If these cuts take effect, more will follow.”





Hospitals are also warning that reduced Medicaid reimbursements will push more patients into emergency rooms, further straining a system already struggling with staffing shortages and financial uncertainty.





The lessons learned about preventative health care from the COVID-19 pandemic were still fresh in many healthcare providers' minds as they expressed fear that Medicaid cuts will lead to worsening health outcomes for those who rely on the program.


“When people lose access to primary care, they don't disappear,” said Dr. Suzanne Lagarde, CEO of Fair Haven Community Health Care. “They show up in the emergency room, where hospitals are legally required to treat them. But ERs aren't designed for routine care. That means sicker patients, higher costs, and an overwhelmed healthcare system.”





“Medicaid pays for two in five births,” said US Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. “What happens before and after birth determines the trajectory of a person's health for life. If we start cutting these services, we're setting up entire generations for worse outcomes.”





DeLauro has been one of the most vocal opponents of the federal cuts, warning that the reductions wouldn't just hurt Connecticut but would create ripple effects across the country.


“This isn't a blue-state issue or a red-state issue – this is an American issue,” she said. “Speaker Mike Johnson himself represents a district where nearly half of his constituents rely on Medicaid. Yet here we are, fighting to protect a program that keeps people alive.”





Despite the looming threat, advocates and healthcare providers refuse to back down.





“We are releasing a story every week from a Medicaid recipient,” Donelson said. “We want Connecticut residents to see their neighbors, to understand why this matters. These are real people – not statistics, not abstract figures, but parents, children, workers, and seniors who rely on Medicaid to survive.”





DeLauro ended the roundtable with a warning: “This is not a policy debate. This is about whether people live or die. Every member of Congress who votes for these cuts should look into the eyes of the people they are hurting and explain why their healthcare isn't worth saving.”

But ERs aren't designed for routine care. That means sicker patients, higher costs, and an overwhelmed healthcare system.”





“Medicaid pays for two in five births,” said US Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. “What happens before and after birth determines the trajectory of a person's health for life. If we start cutting these services, we're setting up entire generations for worse outcomes.”





DeLauro has been one of the most vocal opponents of the federal cuts, warning that the reductions wouldn't just hurt Connecticut but would create ripple effects across the country.


“This isn't a blue-state issue or a red-state issue – this is an American issue,” she said. “Speaker Mike Johnson himself represents a district where nearly half of his constituents rely on Medicaid. Yet here we are, fighting to protect a program that keeps people alive.”





Despite the looming threat, advocates and healthcare providers refuse to back down.





“We are releasing a story every week from a Medicaid recipient,” Donelson said. “We want Connecticut residents to see their neighbors, to understand why this matters. These are real people – not statistics, not abstract figures, but parents, children, workers, and seniors who rely on Medicaid to survive.”





DeLauro ended the roundtable with a warning: “This is not a policy debate. This is about whether people live or die. Every member of Congress who votes for these cuts should look into the eyes of the people they are hurting and explain why their healthcare isn't worth saving.”

							By D. Taylor and Katy Johnson 

March 18, 2025


							Taylor is the current chair of Unite Here Health. Johnson is president of the American Benefits Council.						

As the new Congress and administration are settling in, all eyes in Washington are focused on the trillion-dollar question: whether and how to pay for the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law in President Trump's first term.

Among the various revenue-generating proposals emerging from GOP circles — including some of the president's most trusted advisers — is one that would increase taxes on American workers with employer-provided health care coverage. How to pay for the forthcoming tax bill is a valid debate, but one thing is certain: Burdening hardworking Americans with new taxes on something as fundamental as health care coverage is not the solution voters are looking for.

advertisement

We have seen proposals and recommendations from the Paragon Health Institute, Heritage Foundation, Republican Study Committee, and the Cato Institute — all of which boast close ties to President Trump — to tax employer-provided health care coverage.  The Bipartisan Policy Center also specifically highlighted a tax on employer-provided health care as an option to pay for extending the TCJA. Given how many identical proposals have surfaced from these conservative and bipartisan thought leaders, coupled with a need for federal revenue, employers and unions alike are understandably concerned workers' benefits could be taxed.

Employer-provided health care coverage is a cornerstone of American employment. More than 178 million Americans have employer-provided health care coverage. That's more people than Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchange marketplaces, TRICARE, and Veterans Affairs health care benefits combined.

Since their inception, these benefits have been “excluded” from income, meaning employees are not taxed on the cost employers pay for their health care coverage. Any proposal to add new taxes to workers' health coverage would undermine this system upon which the majority of Americans and their families rely.

Many American families are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of food, housing, and other essential needs. Health care is no exception. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, annual per-capita health expenditures are expected to exceed $15,700 in 2025 — a 59% increase since 2015 — and rise to nearly $22,000 by 2032.

The soaring cost of health care is one of the fundamental economic challenges of our age. It is a crisis born of multiple problems: inflation, market consolidation, and a lack of price transparency, among many others. It would add insult to injury (and illness) if workers who are at their most vulnerable are forced to pay taxes on the insurance that makes it possible to afford the ever-increasing cost of health care. As demonstrated in 2024 Election Night polling, 93% of voters want employer-provided health care coverage to remain tax-free because it encourages employers to provide high-quality, affordable health care coverage.

Policy proposals to tax health care coverage can vary by design, but one option examined by the Congressional Budget Office could leave a working family making $35,000 paying an additional $1,100 in taxes in 2025 and by 2030, inflation would increase it to an additional $2,325 in taxes, resulting in a 62% higher tax burden.

Some proponents of taxing health coverage assert that they would only impose a tax on those with higher incomes or “Cadillac” plans. But once the concept is enshrined in law, every time Congress needs billions of dollars — perhaps to pay for some initiative completely unrelated to health care — it could turn the dial lower (or let inflation do it for them), subjecting many more people to the tax.

To what end? Perhaps the true goal is to push employers out of their role as sponsors of health care coverage. This would be deeply counterproductive. Not only do employers add value and innovation to the design and operation of health care coverage, but the government's own data shows that employer coverage is a tremendous bargain for the American taxpayer.

According to the White House Office of Management and Budget, $216 billion in forgone taxes on workers and families was attributable to the income tax exclusion for employer-provided health coverage in 2023. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that employer group health insurance funds paid out $1.3 trillion that same year. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of $1.3 trillion divided by $216 billion reveals that each dollar of federal expenditure yielded approximately $6.02 in benefits for covered employees and their families — a more than 6-to-1 return on the government's investment.

Employer-provided health insurance not only brings value to the economy, but of all the health coverage options in the United States it also yields  the best bang for the taxpayer's buck. On a per-patient annual basis, the government (and taxpayers) pay the most for Medicare at nearly $18,000 per enrollee, then the Affordable Care Act's exchange marketplaces at nearly $6,000 per enrollee, then Medicaid at more than $5,500 per enrollee, and lastly employer plans at $2,000 per enrollee. While some of this delta reflects health status and demographic differences, it's safe to say employer plans are still a bargain to taxpayers in comparison. Recent Congressional Budget Office data also indicates that with the ACA's enhanced subsidies, the cost to the federal government of exchange marketplace plans will actually be higher than $6,000 this year and topping $7,000 in 2027. If Congress makes the wrong choice and eliminates the health care tax exclusion, people who leave employer coverage will likely be forced into the more costly markets in our health care system.

Furthermore, if the policy is designed to target the employers, they might cut benefits or drop coverage altogether, potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common reason adults between the ages of 18 and 64 choose to remain uninsured is because coverage is unaffordable. This means more healthy adults are likely to go without coverage than absorb a significant increase to their health care costs. When healthy adults leave the risk pools of large group plans, premiums rise even further for those who remain insured.

In 2019, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act's 40% tax on employer-provided health care coverage — then known as the “Cadillac Tax.” This tax operated like a cap on the exclusion but was designed with a different policy mechanism. The biggest question now is, will President Trump double down on his support for millions of American workers and their families by rejecting proposals to tax health benefits for the first time.  

There is broad bipartisan support for protecting workers' health care coverage and opposing short-sighted and misguided proposals to tax health benefits.  As the current chair of UNITE HERE HEALTH and the president of the American Benefits Council, we recently joined a broad stakeholder group of 70 employer groups, unions, patient groups, and other health care stakeholders who urged Congress not to disrupt the vital employer-provided health coverage that the majority of Americans rely upon for lifesaving care every day.

Congress must wholeheartedly reject any proposal that seeks to undermine the health and financial security of American workers.

Correction: A previous version of this essay misstated the Bipartian Policy Center's position on taxing health benefits.

Delaware's congressional delegation and health care leaders are sounding the alarm over proposed Medicaid funding cuts, warning of severe consequences for thousands of residents and the state's community health centers.

At a press conference Monday morning, Sen. Chris Coons, Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester and Rep. Sarah McBride joined health care professionals and Medicaid recipients to denounce House Republicans' budget resolution, which aims to slash Medicaid spending to fund tax cuts and increased defense and border security allocations. The proposed cuts could strip Delaware of an estimated $200 million in Medicaid funding, threatening access to care for more than 300,000 residents — nearly one in four people in the state.

Medicaid is integral to Delaware's health care system, providing access to essential services such as doctor visits, hospital care and prescription medications for thousands of residents. Delaware's four federally qualified community health centers would face significant operational challenges if the cuts take effect.

While many patients rely on Medicaid, these centers provide care to both insured and uninsured individuals on a sliding scale.

These centers include:

During the news briefing, representatives from several community health centers discussed the impact the proposed cuts would have on their organizations and patients. Chief Operating Officer Rosa Rivera of La Red Health Center expressed concern about patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

"Without Medicaid, they would likely put off care and medications they need," Rivera said.

Chris Fraser, president and CEO of Westside Family Healthcare, cautioned that reduced funding would force more Delawareans to delay care, worsening health outcomes and increasing costs across the system. "Without this funding, more Delawareans would not be able to afford health care," Fraser said, stressing delayed care, worsened outcomes and an added financial strain on the health care system would result.

The Delaware Healthcare Association projects dire consequences if the cuts are enacted. According to Brian Frazee, president and CEO of the organization, Delaware could see "a 40% change in Medicaid enrollment," while the uninsured rate could surge by more than 50% if Medicaid expansion is eliminated.

The providers warned that if the cuts proceed, the ripple effects would extend far beyond Medicaid recipients, potentially destabilizing the entire state healthcare system and leading to increased costs for all Delaware residents.

The financial fallout from Medicaid cuts would extend beyond individual patients. A report from the Urban Institute estimates significant nationwide impacts if Congress reduces federal support for state Medicaid programs. The study projects an $80 billion decrease in health care service spending by 2026, with hospitals facing revenue losses of approximately $31.9 billion.

Hospitals and health care providers could see an increase in uncompensated care costs by nearly $19 billion nationwide.

For Delaware, this could mean:

The proposed cuts would impact coverage for pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, seniors and lower-income adults.

"I can think of nothing worse than to advocate slashing Medicaid funding to pay for tax cuts for billionaires," said Sen. Chris Coons at the press conference.

Delaware's congressional delegation stressed that stopping these cuts would require bipartisan opposition.

Coons noted that while Democrats alone cannot block the legislation, public pressure on Republican lawmakers could prove crucial in preventing the cuts from advancing.

Blunt Rochester, who serves on the Senate committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, became emotional while addressing the implications of the proposed cuts. Drawing from her experience as Delaware's former deputy secretary of Health and Social Services, she emphasized the importance of public involvement in opposing the cuts.

"The power of the people is always greater than the people in power," Blunt Rochester said, urging constituents to contact their congressional representatives.

LOS ANGELES, CA — March 18, 2025 – Solinco, a leader in high-performance tennis equipment, has taken its newest co-polyester string, Mach-10, to new heights–literally. In a daring campaign and bold fusion between sports and aerospace, the brand partnered with an aerospace engineering firm to launch its new Mach-10 into space – making it the first-ever tennis string to leave Earth's atmosphere.

“We spent five years of research and development perfecting Mach-10, and feel like we have achieved a breakthrough in what it can deliver to the modern player,” said KT Kim, Solinco Director. “It's a true testament to the hard work behind it. Just like in tennis, the path to innovation requires a commitment to push boundaries in the pursuit of excellence, no matter the obstacle.”

Solinco's Mach-10 made history recently at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, where its space launch footage debuted alongside the string's official release. Fans tuned in through digital campaigns and a YouTube documentary to witness its journey 110,000 feet into space.

A custom-engineered rig carried the Mach-10 string set on its epic journey to space. Suspended beneath a hydrogen-filled stratospheric balloon, the string ascended 110,000 feet, the equivalent of stacking 1,410 tennis courts end to end. After spending two hours in space, Mach-10 made its return to Earth, landing in the hands of the legendary Bryan Brothers. The Bryan Brothers are tennis' greatest doubles team of all time, having won 16 Grand Slam titles and held the No. 1 ATP doubles ranking for 438 weeks. Having endured the ultimate test beyond our planet, the space-traveled string will now be put through its paces on the court, proving its performance where it truly matters.

For over a decade, Solinco has been a lead innovator of high-performance tennis strings, redefining what players can expect from their equipment. Tour Bite changed the game in 2008, setting new benchmarks for spin and durability. Hyper-G—the neon green icon—became the No. 1 string in America and a go-to for players at every level. Now, after years of development, Mach-10 has made its mark—launching with a bold campaign that reflects its innovation.

Mach-10 ushers in a new era of high-performance co-polyester strings, a testament to Solinco's relentless innovation in the space. Engineered for the modern player, it pushes performance to unprecedented heights with its unique combination of power, feel, and tension maintenance.

Changes in WTA tour means the days of child stars are gone, which is why 17-year-old's achievements are so significant

There are two teenagers in the top 100 of the WTA rankings at the moment. Women's tennis, in some ways, was built on the success of its child prodigies – Chris Evert, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters – who audaciously stormed towards the top in their youth, demanding attention.

Those days are long gone. Between the improved depth, physicality and professionalism at the lower levels, possibly a more sparse talent pool and the WTA's age eligibility rules restricting the number of tournaments a child can contest, it is increasingly more difficult to flit up the rankings so early.

For those reasons, the first three months of the season have been fascinating. Mirra Andreeva continued to defy trends and patterns on Sunday by winning the biggest title of her career at Indian Wells at 17 years old.

It is difficult to overstate the significance of this achievement. A few weeks after winning her first WTA 1000 title in Dubai last month, Andreeva triumphed in California by outplaying and outsmarting Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka, the two best players in the world, in consecutive three-set matches to win the title. She is now on a 12-match winning streak and has risen to No 6 with a bullet.

Before Andreeva, two players under 18 had beaten the top two in a WTA event: Steffi Graf and Serena Williams. The other teenager in the top 100, meanwhile, is the 18-year-old Australian Maya Joint, at No 80.

Despite her youth, it still feels like Andreeva has not missed any steps in her development and her recent form is right on schedule. Two years ago, Andreeva broke through, defeating two top 20 players en-route to the fourth round of the 2023 Madrid Open. Since then, she has rapidly risen up the rankings, reaching the French Open semi-finals and breaking into the top 20 last year. The obstacles she has faced and the tough lessons learned on her path have been just as important in her growth. She has endured plenty of difficult losses that sharpened her game and strengthened her character.

From the moment she emerged on the tour, it was clear Andreeva was blessed with a unique improvisational game. She possesses a large variety of shots, intelligent point construction and the ability to time the ball sweetly and redirect pace, particularly with her wicked two-handed backhand. Her game was sometimes underpowered against the top players, but as she continues to grow into an adult and gain physical strength, she has made significant offensive improvements. Her increased ball speed and weight of shot this year have allowed her to trade from the baseline with the best players as equals.

That growth was particularly on show in the final stages of her title run. Against Swiatek, Andreeva was spectacular in horrendous windy conditions, overpowering the Pole from the baseline as she lasered down-the-line backhand winners from all parts of the court. The added pace on her first serve was astonishing; the 126mph ace she struck in the first-set tiebreak is one of the fastest women's serves of all time. After trailing by a set against Sabalenka, Andreeva expertly soaked up the world No 1's enormous strokes, again serving well and dragging the Belarusian into uncomfortable parts of the court with her drop shots and low slices. At such a young age, Andreeva's game is already complete.

The momentum Andreeva has built has much to do with her blossoming partnership with the 1994 Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martínez, who Andreeva has frequently bantered with during her on-court interviews. Aside from being a quality coach – she helped Garbiñe Muguruza to a Wimbledon title in 2017 – she seems an enjoyable person to work with.

After Elena Rybakina's former coach, Stefano Vukov, was banned by the WTA for a year due to alleged emotionally abusive behaviour, which he denied, their success underlines the importance of female coaches in women's tennis, of which there are still too few.

Indian Wells 2025 will represent two young talents marking themselves as true contenders on the world stage. The next challenge for Andreeva and Jack Draper is simply to move on. The Miami Open main draw began on Tuesday with Naomi Osaka in action. While Emma Raducanu plays her first match against the 19-year-old Japanese wildcard Sayaka Ishii on Wednesday, Andreeva and the other seeded players have received a first-round bye.

In the men's draw, which will showcase Novak Djokovic's return to Miami for the first time since 2019, Draper will begin his pursuit of the “Sunshine Double” against either Jakub Mensik or Roberto Bautista Agut in round two.

The reality of being a top player and consistently making deep runs in the biggest events is that they have less time to reflect on those successes.

American tennis star Ben Shelton and USWNT star Trinity Rodman made their relationship official on Monday when Shelton posted a picture of the couple on Instagram.

Fans had been speculating this month that the two sports stars were an item, especially after Shelton and Rodman made similar TikToks with the same sound seemingly directed to each other. Shelton's caption said "T****** wsp with u," which fans figured spelled "Trinity." Rodman's caption said "_ _ _ wassup w you," seemingly spelling out "Ben." These videos were both posted on March 6.

Shelton's fellow American tennis players couldn't contain their excitement when the 22-year-old posted on Instagram. Frances Tiafoe commented "We gram now" with three eye emojis, while both Coco Gauff and Sloane Stephens commented "hard launch" on the post.

Shelton will begin his Miami Open campaign on Friday, and it'll be fun to see whether Rodman appears in his player's box at some point during the tournament. Rodman and the Washington Spirit will be hosting the Kansas City Current this Saturday.

Rodman helped the USWNT secure a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer by scoring three goals during their run. Shelton skipped out on the Olympics last summer to instead focus on his hard court season ahead of the U.S. Open, where he lost in the third round.

The Professional Tennis Players Association sued several organizations, including the ATP, WTA and International Tennis Federation, likening them to a "cartel," alleging several antitrust violations, systemic abuse, collusion to reduce competition, exploiting players financially, and forcing athletes to play an unsustainable schedule.

Court documents filed in New York City, London and Brussels and obtained by USA TODAY Sports, name 22 players, including Vasek Pospisil, Nick Kyrgios, Sorana Cirstea and Reilly Opelka as plaintiffs, who demand a jury trial.

"Tennis is broken," Ahmad Nassar, executive director of the PTPA, said in a statement. "Behind the glamorous veneer that the Defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts."

The Professional Tennis Players Association, which was co-founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and Pospisil in 2019, says their mandate is to unite and mobilize "tennis players to foster transparency and fairness in professional tennis."

The 162-page lawsuit filed Wednesday details some of those complaints and the PTPA says they are backed by more than 250 players, many of whom are ranked in the top 20.

"Defendants do so by capping the prize money tournaments award and limiting players' ability to earn money off the court," the lawsuit says. "Rather than being determined by market forces, players' earnings are instead subject to limitations agreed upon by the defendants and their co-conspirators."

Another grievance in the lawsuit is the tour schedule, which the lawsuit says the men's tour, the ATP, "schedules an annual slate of over 60 tournaments in which male players play," leaving little time to rest and recover.

"Defendants do so by capping the prize money tournaments award and limiting players' ability to earn money off the court. Rather than being determined by market forces, players' earnings are instead subject to limitations agreed upon by the defendants and their co-conspirators."

The lawsuit says that four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open, are co-conspirators with the defendants who use the tournaments "to enrich themselves at the players' expense, to the detriment of fans and the game."

The International Tennis Integrity Agency, which says it tries to safeguard tennis to make sure the sport is free from corruption and doping, is also a defendant in the case.

"The ITIA's aggressive, unrelenting, and, at times, illegal investigative processes subject players to dozens of drug tests (both blood and urine), invasive searches of their personal cell phones, hours-long interrogations without counsel, and harassment by unaccountable and ill-trained investigators," the lawsuit says.

The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), an organisation co-founded by Novak Djokovic, has launched legal action against tennis' governing bodies.

The lawsuits are against the ATP and WTA tours, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA). The PTPA has labelled the governing bodies a “cartel” and accused them of implementing “anticompetitive restraints and abusive practices.”

The 163-page complaint was filed in the United States District Court in New York, where the PTPA is seeking a jury trial. PTPA co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios are two of 12 current or former professional players listed as plaintiffs.

A statement from the PTPA read: “Following years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has taken decisive legal action.

“Today, the PTPA, alongside over a dozen professional tennis players, and on behalf of the entire player population, and renowned international law firm and historical player advocates Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP initiated a series of legal actions in the U.S., UK, and EU against the sport's governing bodies—the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

“The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades.

“The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anticompetitive restraints and abusive practices.”

The PTPA also claimed that the lawsuit has been “backed overwhelmingly by the top 250+ men's and women's players including a majority of the top 20 players.”

Ahmad Nassar, the Executive Director of the PTPA, said: “Tennis is broken. Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.

“We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.

“Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis – it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

In a tweet, Nassar explained: “The legal challenges centre on the following illegal actions:

Schedule abuse
Data misappropriation and betting collusion
Prize money manipulation
Player exploitation and hostile work environment
Abuse of power
Health and safety malpractice
Massive conflicts of interest
Investigative abuses and privacy rights violations

We stand ready to engage with anyone to solve these problems and lead tennis to a bright future for all.”

The Professional Tennis Players Association, along with 22 players, have filed multiple lawsuits in several countries against the ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA. The suit alleges that those international tennis organizations have engaged in anticompetitive business practices that suppress their potential earnings and cast aside health and safety concerns, according to ESPN.

PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar, who has worked with the NFLPA in the past, claims that players are being exploited by aforementioned organizations.

"Tennis is broken," Nassar said in a statement. "Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety."

The complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, obtained by ESPN, describes the ATP, WTA, ITF and ITIA as a "cartel" that works together to fix tournament prize money. The suit also alleges that some tournament owners won't even allow players to request an increase in prize money.

Other allegations include unfair name, image and likeness deals, a lower cut of revenue sharing than other professional sports, privacy violations via drug testing and poor tournament and match conditions.

The players association has filed suits in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  One of the players named in the suits is Vasek Pospisil, co-founder of the PTPA and 2014 Wimbledon doubles champion.

Pospisil explained that he began his career sleeping in his car while traveling to matches. He noted that would never be allowed to happen for rookies in the NFL or any other major league.

"I'm one of the more fortunate players and I've still had to sleep in my car when traveling to matches early on in my career -- imagine an NFL player being told that he had to sleep in his car at an away game," Pospisil said. "It's absurd and would never happen, obviously. No other major sport treats its athletes this way."

The PTPA hopes that these suits will create a handful of positive changes for the players. Among them are better scheduling, higher revenue sharing and more consideration for players' concerns.

Other notable names in the lawsuit include Nick Kyrgios, Reilly Opelka, Sorana Cirstea, Ingrid Neel and Corentin Moutet.

Nassar and Pospisil said the PTPA met with over 250 players about the suits, and the majority were supportive. However, many players were concerned about putting their name on the suits due to fear of "repercussions."

Former World No. 1 Iga Swiatek posted a lengthy explanation on social media this week after the tennis pro faced heavy criticism for nearly hitting a ball boy out of frustration during her semifinal loss at the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, last week. 

During the third set of the match, a ball boy tossed a ball in Swiatek's direction, which she then immediately swatted back at him – just missing him.

The ball hit the ground and deflected into the crowd behind the ball boy, prompting a harsh reaction from fans in the stands. That criticism continued on social media in the days that followed the Friday match.

On Monday, Swiatek responded with a lengthy post explaining the situation and also calling out the double standard of fans. 

"I see there's been a lot of recent talk about changes in my on-court behavior and emotions. Although I'm not comfortable explaining myself, it's time I share my perspective to stop the speculation and baseless theories," her post began.

"First, about the incident during my last match. It's true - I expressed frustration in a way I'm not proud of. My intention was never to aim the ball at anyone but merely to release my frustration by bouncing it on the ground. I immediately apologized to the ball boy, we made eye contact, and nodded to each other when I expressed regret that it happened near him."

Swiatek said she has seen many players "bounce balls in frustration" and was surprised by the criticism she received for it.

"I didn't expect such harsh judgments. Usually, I control such impulses, so half-jokingly I can say I lack experience in this and misjudged my aim in the heat of the moment."

Swiatek also lamented the "constant judgement" she said she is subjected to. 

"When I'm highly focused and don't show many emotions on court, I'm called a robot, my attitude labeled as inhuman. Now that I'm more expressive, showing feelings or struggling internally, I'm suddenly labeled immature or hysterical. That's not a healthy standard-especially considering that just six months ago, I felt my career was hanging by a thread, spent three weeks crying daily, and didn't want to step on the court."

Swiatek made reference to her recent doping scandal, when, in August, she tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, or TMZ. The results of that test were made public in November and the International Tennis Integrity Agency accepted her explanation that the result was unintentional and caused by the contamination of the non-prescription medication melatonin that she was taking for issues with jet lag and sleeping.

"Today, after everything I've been through, I'm still processing and coming to terms with those experiences. Will sharing this change anything? Probably not, because I clearly see how much we love judging, creating theories, and imposing opinions on others. But perhaps a few people who genuinely want to understand what I'm experiencing will understand this. In any case, this external standard is definitely not my standard, and I don't accept my team and me being boxed into external expectations."

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Calling the groups in charge of professional tennis “a cartel,” the players' association co-founded by Novak Djokovic filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's and men's tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport's integrity agency on Tuesday in federal court in New York.

The suit by the Professional Tennis Players' Association says the organizations that run the sport hold “complete control over the players' pay and working conditions” and their setup constitutes “textbook violations of state and federal law” that “immunize professional tennis from ordinary market forces and deny professional tennis players and other industry participants their right to fair competition.”

The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and wants players to gain access to more earnings, arguing that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments — Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open — and other professional events “cap the prize money tournaments award and limit players' ability to earn money off the court.”

The WTA Tour and ATP Tour issued separate statements Tuesday saying they would “vigorously” defend themselves.

The WTA said it has “committed to a $400 million increase in player compensation” in recent years and labeled the PTPA action a “baseless legal case” that is “regrettable and misguided.” The ATP touted a “major increase in player compensation” that created a jump of “$70 million in the past five years,” and called the PTPA's case “entirely without merit.”




“The PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,” the ATP's statement said. “Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.”

The ITF and the International Tennis Integrity Agency — which investigates and adjudicates doping and corruption cases — declined to comment.

The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in August 2020, aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport. One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a sort of full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports.

“For the past few years, the PTPA, an organization I've worked on tirelessly since its inception, has made countless efforts to collaborate with the tours in hopes of achieving positive change for players. Despite these efforts and attempts to engage in constructive dialogue, we were met with resistance and a lack of meaningful action. It is because of this ongoing disregard for players that we were left with no alternative but to take action of our own,” Pospisil posted on social media. “For too long, players have been forced to accept a broken system that ignores our well-being, undervalues our contributions, and leaves us without real representation.”

Djokovic is not one of the players listed as a plaintiff.

“His support for this is already explicit. It's redundant since PTPA (is) named as plaintiff, and he is on (the executive committee),” PTPA spokesman David Cooper wrote in an email. “He wanted to allow others to step up since this is not just Novak's (organization).”

The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players — women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings — before going to court.

“Tennis is broken,” PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said in a news release. “Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis — it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

If anyone is qualified to advise a teenage sporting prodigy, it's LeBron James. The Lakers star walked into the NBA as a 17-year-old and more than lived up to the hype, and continues to shatter expectations at 40.

Tennis has seen its share of teenage prodigies, but 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva promises to transcend the sport like few before her. On Sunday, she followed in Steffi Graf and Serena Williams's footsteps as the first teenager to beat the top two ranked players at the same event en route to her second ATP1000 title within a month. 

After her win, the Russian told Tennis Channel that she was inspired by an old interview with James in which the basketball legend spoke on the importance of the mental aspect in sports. Andreeva revealed she remembered James' words when she dropped the first set to World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Sunday's Indian Wells final.

"I was listening to LeBron James' interview and he was saying that even if you don't play at 100% or if you don't feel 100% physically, I'm going to choose to be 100% mentally," the teenager recalled. "He said that's what makes us champions. So, I kind of tried to do the same." 

Andreeva admitted her mind-over-matter gameplan didn't "really work in the beginning," but when it did, she knew there was no stopping her.

"I managed to overcome that and really go for my shots and act like one of those legends," she added. 

A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)

This wasn't the first time she credited James. Andreeva praised the Lakers star after winning the Dubai Tennis Championship, her first-ever WTA1000 title, last month.

Mirra Andreeva: I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews & he said that It's easy to be confident & play good when everything goes your way, but what makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. So that's what I tried to do today. pic.twitter.com/u3pvTggjFU

James took to social media to share encouraging words for the rising tennis superstar. 

"Congratulations!! Happy to have helped, but honestly YOU did THAT!! All your hard work, drive, and dedication towards your craft! KEEP GOING!"

Andreeva has arrived in South Florida for the prestigious Miami Open, which begins this week. The teenager is trying to win a hat trick of WTA1000 titles after her wins in Dubai and Indian Wells. No teenager in tennis history, male or female, has won the Indian Wells and Miami titles, dubbed the Sunshine Double, in the same season.

Novak Djokovic co-founded the PTPA in 2020

The players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic has begun legal action against tennis' governing bodies, citing "anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare".

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has filed papers at the United States District Court in New York, where it is seeking a jury trial.

The 163-page lawsuit, which has been seen by BBC Sport, says "professional tennis players are stuck in a rigged game" which gives them "limited control over their own careers and brands".

It criticises the schedule, ranking systems and control over image rights.

The complaint is being brought by the PTPA and 12 players - including Djokovic's co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios. The PTPA says it is acting "on behalf of the entire player population".

Formed in 2020, the PTPA wants to increase the power of the players, and reduce the control of the governing bodies.

The ATP Tour, the men's professional body, said it "strongly rejects the premise of the PTPA's claims", declaring the case to be "entirely without merit" and promising to "vigorously defend" its position.

In a statement,, external it accused the PTPA of having "consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress" and said the ATP "remains committed to working in the best interests of the game".

The WTA, which runs the women's tour, also said it will defend its position and said in a statement the legal action is "both regrettable and misguided".

It added: "Contesting this baseless legal case will divert time, attention, and resources from our core mission to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole."

The lawsuit seeks an end to "monopolistic control" of the tennis tour, as well as financial compensation from the ATP, the WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

The organisation has also started legal proceedings in the UK and the EU to end what it considers the "unchecked authority of the sport's governing bodies".

"Tennis is broken," said Ahmad Nassar, the executive director of the PTPA, who told the BBC in October the organisation would have no qualms about going down this route.

"Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.

"We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.

"Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis - it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come."

The ITF and the ITIA say they do not wish to comment at this stage.

The PTPA believes, external the governing bodies act as a "cartel" by forming agreements with tournaments that cap prize money and prevent potential competitors entering the market.

The union describes the ranking points system as "draconian" as it effectively forces a player to enter their tournaments in order to build a status and reputation as a professional.

The lawsuit also takes aim at an "unsustainable" schedule which runs for 11 months of the year, and can require players to compete in excessive heat or in the early hours of the morning.

It alleges players suffer serious wrist, elbow and shoulder injuries because the type of ball used changes regularly throughout the season - and that the governing bodies' control of image rights diverts money from players' pockets.

The ITIA is accused of a "gross invasion of privacy" for searching the phones of players under suspicion of corruption or doping offences.

The ATP Tour is staging 60 events across 29 countries this year, and also runs its own Challenger Tour. The ATP says it distributed $241.6m to players in 2023 through prize money, bonuses and retirement plan contributions.

The WTA, which is offering 51 tournaments across 26 countries this season, said it paid out record prize money of $221m in 2024. It has also just introduced paid maternity leave for the first time.

Players have frequently complained they do not receive a high enough percentage of the revenue generated by the sport, especially the four Grand Slams.

It was the driving force behind Djokovic's desire to form the PTPA.

The Grand Slams tried to develop the concept of a Premium Tour - featuring a streamlined season and greater financial rewards - but have so far found too many obstacles in their path.

Pospisil says the lawsuit is about "fairness, safety and basic human dignity".

"I'm one of the more fortunate players and I've still had to sleep in my car when traveling to matches early on in my career," Pospisil added.

"Imagine an NFL player being told that he had to sleep in his car at an away game. It's absurd and would never happen. No other major sport treats its athletes this way."

"It is time for free-market forces to enter professional tennis," said Drew Tulumello of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm instructed by the PTPA.

The PTPA looks enviously at the rewards earned by players in team sports such as football, NFL, baseball and basketball - and also the more comparable sport of golf.

Many of those who joined the breakaway LIV Tour now enjoy even greater wealth but have lost the ranking points which facilitate entry into the major championships.

Saudi Arabia's intervention caused much bitterness and the new tour changed golf dramatically.

The PTPA's methods are very different, but they could yet have a similar effect.

Ben Shelton's Indian Wells campaign was ended by eventual champion Jack Draper but it appears the tennis star had a shoulder to cry on. 

On the eve of the Miami Open, Shelton and USWNT star Trinity Rodman shocked fans when they made their relationship Instagram official Monday. 

Shelton shared a series of photos of off-court moments to his profile, and buried amongst them was the revealing snap. 

Shelton, 22, and Rodman, also 22, were captured in a loved-up pose with the soccer player wrapping her arm around her tennis beau's neck and plating a kiss on his cheek while he snapped the moment in an elevator mirror. 

'I been focused, but I'm steady climbin', I'm nowhere near my peak,' wrote Ben in the post's caption. 

The post contained other snaps, including Shelton posing with his dad - former tennis pro Bryan Shelton - and a friend outside a private jet. 

But it was the 'hard launch' that captured the attention of fans - and the tennis world. 

Shelton's on-tour friends rushed to share their support with fellow Americans Coco Gauff and Frances Tiafoe flooding the comments. 

'hard launchhhhh !!,' an excited Gauff, the World No 3 and Shelton's mixed doubles partner, wrote. 

'We gram now,' Tiafoe added, alongside a series of side-eye emojis. 

Meanwhile, Rodman, who is the daughter of NBA icon Dennis Rodman, commented, writing, 'Shooters shoot I guess.' 

The couple first spoarked romance rumors earleir this month when fans became convinced that they were flirting over social media. 

Shelton posted a TikTok video of him listening to GloRilla and Jorjiana's song, 'ILBB2,' which includes the lyrics, 'They say shooters shoot Duke Dennis whats up with you.'

Text appeared across the video which read, 'T****** wsp with u,' leading fans to believe he was referring to Rodman.

🔫

Rodman then seemingly responded with a video of her own, in which she mouthed the same lyrics with the text across the screen reading, '_ _ _ wassup w you.'

Rodman was previously in a relationship with NFL wide receiver Trinity Benson, going public with their relationship last May in an Instagram post that was captioned: 'Trinity squared.' 

It is unclear when the Olympic gold medalist and Benson, who hasn't played in the NFL since 2022, split. 

The Washington Spirit player made headlines back in December when she took aim at her famous father. 

Trinity hit out at her 'alcoholic' father, Dennis Rodman, in an astonishing appearance on Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy podcast. 

She accused Dennis of being absent for the majority of her life while claiming he is only her father 'by blood'.

'He's not a dad,' she told Cooper. 'Maybe by blood, but nothing else.'

'We tried to live with him,' Trinity added, likely referring to herself and brother DJ. 'But he's having parties 24/7, bringing random b****es in. He loves the spotlight'

After the damning interview, Dennis sent an apology to Trinity on Instagram, insisting he will keep trying to fix things with her no matter how long it takes.

However, Rodman's attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter has not gone down well, with Trinity instead claiming she is 'done' with him in a furious response.

Throughout his career Rodman was known just as much for his partying antics as he was for his legendary defensive and rebounding skills over two decades in professional basketball.

When he bowed out from the sport in 2006 those antics didn't slow down, and he has since sought treatment for alcohol abuse.

Tennis

When reflecting on his favourite moment of 2024 in December, Jack Draper didn't pick reaching the U.S. Open semifinal, winning his first and second ATP Tour titles, or beating Carlos Alcaraz.

He picked the aftermath of his most disappointing defeat of the year, a loss to qualifier Jesper de Jong at the French Open in May.

“When I came home from Paris, I was all over the place thinking: ‘I need to get my s— together, what am I doing? I'm not fulfilling my potential. I'm not the player I want to be,'” he told a small group of reporters in a pub in west London just before Christmas.

“When I look back over this year, that's something that actually brings me the most satisfaction. The most joy is working out certain situations and then turning into a different player.”

Draper, 23, was ranked No. 40 and having an identity crisis about his game. He had brought on former world No. 6 Wayne Ferreira to support his main coach James Trotman, and Ferreira wanted Draper to use his bulky 6ft 4in (193cm) frame more. But after a disappointing clay-court season, Draper decided instead to lean on his other talents: soft hands, athleticism, and a heavy forehand that he could blast through the court or kick up above an opponent's shoulders.

“Wayne wanted me to try to be braver,” he said.

“I suppose I needed that, but at the same time, I needed to understand that that's not the player I am as well. One of my main attributes as a player is my ability to move well for my size, and be able to get that one more ball back in court.

“That's how I won matches when I was younger, when I was small.”

Draper and Ferreira split after the grass-court season, and while Draper took some of Ferreira's advice to heart by not being so “one-paced,” he has embraced the natural variety he possesses and stormed up the tennis ranks ever since.

Last Sunday, Draper won the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. It is his first ATP Masters 1,000 title — the rung just below the Grand Slams — and it moved him into the ATP top 10 for the first time. The slow, grippy hard courts in the Californian desert reward players who can mix up their shots; witness Alcaraz, who Draper stunned in the semifinals despite being on the ropes in the third set. The 21-year-old Spaniard is perhaps the most dexterous player in the world and a two-time Indian Wells champion.

During the Indian Wells final against Holger Rune, Draper demonstrated his mental strategy, centering his vision on his thumb at changes of ends. Because he is so open about discussing the mental side of the game — including on-court anxiety — and his misfortune with injuries, the texture of his tennis and its specifics sometimes get overlooked. In the California Desert, it was in full bloom.

Draper's forehand is his most devastating ground stroke, but his backhand is his most reliable. Like another tennis southpaw, Rafael Nadal, Draper is a natural right-hander who plays left-handed, so he finds natural stability on the two-handed backhand.

“I think that really helps me, because my forehand has been improving all the time,” he said in a news conference after beating Alcaraz on Saturday. “My forehand is naturally the shot where I'm not as comfortable. It's always been my backhand which I can hit with my eyes closed.”

Draper's solidity on the backhand side is discomfiting for his opponents. Against most lefties, the go-to play for a right-hander is to try and get into a cross-court rally in which they hit their forehand to their opponent's backhand, which is typically the weaker shot.

“I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand,” Draper continued. “Usually that's something where players struggle, but with myself, that's a big strength.”

According to data from TennisViz and Tennis Data Innovations (TDI), we can see that over the last year, opponents won 42.8 percent of points when hitting cross-court forehands against Draper, compared to the tour average of 45 percent. Last week at Indian Wells, this figure for Draper's opponents was even lower, down at 41.7 percent — a significant drop below the average for one of the most important and regularly deployed shots in tennis.

By contrast, Draper's forehand was even more devastating than usual, particularly against Rune in a one-sided final. When hitting it from the middle of the court, with the choice to go to his opponent's forehand or backhand, Draper destroyed Rune's forehand, winning 100 percent of points behind that play.

Draper has worked with Trotman on his movement to stabilize the forehand, acknowledging that he used to struggle when anyone went after it — as he did to Rune Sunday.

“Any pace into it was a problem,” he told a small group of reporters on a video call.

“I remember when I played Carlos Alcaraz here a couple of years ago, I felt like I couldn't hit the skin off a rice pudding. So I just feel like I've come a long way with that.

“I think a lot of it has to do with my positioning, with my body. I've worked on that feeling of being balanced a lot on the forehand and not lifting off. I still lift off some forehands, but I feel like most of the time my commitment is to go through the ball and to feel like I'm hurting off that shot instead of it just being a kind of average, spinny ball.”

In that match against Alcaraz, he lost 6-2, 2-0 by retirement. Things looked very different in their semifinal.

Despite Draper's evolution as a player, there is still no weapon in his game bigger than his serve. That too developed relatively late, since Draper was only 5 feet 6 inches until a handy growth spurt in his mid-teens.

Speaking after his devastating serving display against Rune, Draper said: “My rhythm and my placement has been really, really good. And it's obviously a huge, huge part of my game. If I can get that right, that sets me up well for the rest of my tennis.”

At Indian Wells, Draper improved his second-serve points won from 52 percent over the last year to 54 percent. He also used his accuracy to account for the slower courts' effect on his speed, winning 78 percent of points behind serves to the T on the deuce side, and 83 percent on the ad; 40 and 39 percent of those serves went unreturned, respectively.

The serving display gave him the platform to play with more of the variety he has been striving for, mixing up his pace and coming to the net at various points. Against Ben Shelton in last week's quarterfinals, Draper somehow manoeuvred his body to hit a volley that was flying towards his chest, fell down, and got back up to win the point.

Against Rune, Draper showcased some outstanding defense to go alongside his devastating attack, winning 43 percent of points when defending, per the TDI “steal score” metric. Draper's average in the past 52 weeks is 35 percent. It was his rich mix of attacking and defending options, rather than a brute force approach, that took him to the title.

Draper is one of many ATP players who are facing up to how Alcaraz and world No. 1 Jannik Sinner have reconfigured tennis, but he appears better placed to embrace that change than some of his peers in the rankings. 1990s-born players, including world No. 2 Alexander Zverev, No. 4 Taylor Fritz and No. 6 Casper Ruud have openly said that they feel ill-positioned to adjust to the huge hitting and court coverage. Draper has studied them both carefully and gotten to know them well, too; Sinner is a friend and former doubles partner, while Draper was planning on spending the most recent off-season with Alcaraz in Spain before a hip injury intervened.

Draper is ranked No. 3 by his 2025 results, and has won 13 of his 15 matches this year, including 10 of the last 11. He heads to Miami as one of the tournament favorites, and then has very few points to defend during the clay-court swing. But the biggest challenge is the Grand Slams — the biggest tournaments in the world which bring the elongated five-set format in which Draper has struggled more in the past. His recent form, however, is making him believe he is on his way.

“I can compete consistently against top players in the world. I feel like I belong completely,” he said.

Ashley and Grant arrive as a couple on Netflix's "Temptation Island," hoping to mend their relationship.

However, Grant cheats and moves on to Natalie, and Ashley dates Danny and Logan.

Here's what we know about who Ashley, Grant, Natalie, Danny, and Logan are dating.

Ashley and Grant went on Netflix's first season of "Temptation Island" to mend their trust issues.

Instead, they found new lovers. And it seems that Ashley could still be with her new beau, Danny.

Losing your partner is the risk contestants take when they sign up for the dating show, where couples are separated and taken to live with singles who try to seduce them.

On this season, which is Netflix's first, four couples are featured, including Ashley and Grant. Ashley says on the show that Grant cheated on her a month into their relationship.

"Over time, it's just built up into this huge mess of mistrust and resentment, and I think if we can get through this, maybe it will clear that up," Grant says.

Grant says he wants to prove to Ashley and his daughter from a previous relationship that he can keep his word and resist temptation.

Ashley and Grant stay committed to each other in the first few days of the process.

But in the first of the show's bonfires in episode two, where contestants are shown what their partners have been up to, Grant sees a clip of Ashley complaining about his behavior and saying she's "never going to trust him."

Grant says this hurts him, and he gets closer to Natalie, one of the single contestants. By the end of episode three, Grant and Natalie kiss, and have sex in a shower in the following episode.

At the episode five bonfire, Ashley says she feels "relief" after seeing the videos of Grant cheating.

"I think I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting for the proof," Ashley says.

Grant initially regrets cheating. But after he sees another clip of Ashley bad-mouthing him at the bonfire, he deepens his relationship with Natalie when he returns to the villa.

At the same time, Ashley announces that she's single and starts to properly pursue Logan and Danny. As the show continues, she gets closer to Danny, eventually kissing him off-camera in episode six.

When Grant and Ashley reunite during the season one finale, he says he wants to leave the show alone, seemingly splitting up with Ashley and Natalie. Meanwhile, Ashley leaves the show in a relationship with Danny.

Ashley and Danny may still be dating, while it seems Grant and Natalie are over.

The finale aired a week ago, but none of the couples have publicly confirmed their relationship status. This could mean that Netflix is planning a reunion episode or will publish a "Where Are They Now" video like they do for "Perfect Match." Netflix declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider.

But on Tuesday, Ashley shared a photo of her and Danny on Instagram, captioned: 'This man always had me smiling ☺️"

They also follow each other on Instagram and TikTok. On their TikTok and Instagram feeds, they have shared videos featuring Logan where they joke about their throuple dynamic on the show.

On Monday, Ashley shared an Instagram story with a picture of her and Danny showing their close body language before the show's premiere party on March 15, captioned "eyes up here."

That day, Ashley reposted a video on her story of her interactions with Danny on the show, captioned: "Wouldn't have survived without you."

There are not many clues online about Grant's relationship status. On Sunday, he posted a video on Instagram and TikTok defending Natalie and told viewers to stop sending her hate.

Grant follows Natalie on both Instagram and TikTok, but she doesn't follow him. Natalie follows Ashley on Instagram. This suggests that Grant and Natalie are likely not together anymore. Natalie also hasn't said anything supporting Grant amid the backlash against them.

Season one of Netflix's "Temptation Island" is available to stream.

Gal Gadot is speaking out about her views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

If you don't know, the 39-year-old Snow White actress used to serve in the Israel Defense Forces under the country's compulsory military service laws. She expressed her support for Israel after the October 7 attacks, writing,  "At least 250 Israeli have been murdered and dozens of women children and elders held as hostages in Gaza, by Palestinian military group Hamas. Starting early morning more than 3,000 rockets were fired. Hamas is holding hostages, controlling bases and settlements in Israel. There have been more than 1,500 injured and heavy fighting is still ongoing. 'I hear their voices and they are banging on the door. I am with my two little children'. My heart is aching. Praying for all of those in pain."

Now, in a new interview, she's speaking out about her support of Israel, which has caused some backlash.

In a new interview published on Tuesday (March 18), Gal told Variety, “After October 7th [2023], I don't talk politics — because who cares about the celebrity talking about politics? I'm an artist. I want to entertain people. I want to bring hope and be a beacon of light whenever I say anything about the world. But on October 7th, when people were abducted from their homes, from their beds, men, women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors, were going through the horrors of what happened that day, I could not be silent. I was shocked by the amount of hate, by the amount of how much people think they know when they actually have no idea, and also by how the media is not fair many times. So I had to speak up.”

“I'm not a hater. I'm a grandchild of a Holocaust survivor who came to Israel and established his family from scratch after his entire family was erased in Auschwitz. And on the other side of my family, I'm eighth generation Israeli. I'm an indigenous person of Israel," she continued.

On why she spoke out, she explained, “I am all about humanity and I felt like I had to advocate for the hostages.” And about criticism she's faced for her views, she added, “when your compass is clear, your conscience is clean. I know what I'm advocating for, and I know what I wish for the world.”

“I am praying for better days for all. I want everybody to have good life and prosperity, and the ability to raise their children in a safe environment,” she said.

Following October 7, more than 700 Hollywood figures signed an open letter condemning Hamas and supporting Israel.

Ayelet Zurer originated the role of Vanessa Fisk in Netflix's Daredevil series, but when Marvel/Disney+ rebooted the series with Daredevil: Born Again, she was originally recast.

Sandrine Holt took over the role, before Ayelet was quietly added back and Sandrine was no longer involved.

Now, Ayelet is speaking out about the big change that happened.

“I never really quite understood why they made that decision to not keep not just me but more almost all the actors but [Wilson Fisk actor Vincent D'Onofrio] and [Daredevil actor Charlie Cox]. But I can say that when they did change the creative and decided to go back to the original cast, I was very, very happy to join. Because I really like that character, and I thought there was so much more to explore with her," Ayelet told TV Line.

She added she's “not sure” how many of Sandrine's scenes were reshot with her in the role once again.

Daredevil: Born Again has a brand new episode debuting today on Disney+.

Pete Davidson is in a new relationship, and his partner is "very different from anybody else he's ever dated."

An insider recently told Page Six that the comedian is very happy with his new girlfriend, and that, unlike Davidson's most recent exes, she's not a celebrity. 

"She respects Pete and his desire for privacy. Although things are new for Pete, he really likes this woman." The source also unveiled that Davidson's mother, Amy Waters Davidson, and sister, Casey Davidson, "approve of this relationship and love seeing Pete so happy." 

While the name of the star's current partner was not revealed, it was made very clear that he is in a good place and is enjoying where things are headed with his new flame. 

In recent years, Davidson has been romantically linked to reality star Kim Kardashian, songstress Ariana Grande, actresses Kate Beckinsale, Margaret Qualley, and Phoebe Dynevor, and model Kaia Gerber, per Elle. 

Just last month, the standout made a rare comment about the "7 Rings" hitmaker, whom he dated for a few months in 2018, revealing there's no bad blood between them during an interview with Page Six ahead of Saturday Night Live's 50th Anniversary Special, "SNL50". 

"When we see each other, which is few and far between, because we're not in the same circles, it's all love. I hope she wins the Oscar, I hope she takes the gold," he remarked, referencing her performance in 2024's Wicked. Davidson continued, praising all the women he's ever dated in a blanket statement. 

"I've had some pretty adult relationships with some pretty amazing women, and when it's ended it's been cool."

A Hollywood intimacy coordinator believes there was, at least at one point, some “affection” between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.

Mia Schachter, whose credits include Apple TV+'s Lessons in Chemistry and HBO's Insecure and Perry Mason, weighed in on the dramatic on-set feud between the It Ends With Us costars, which is now the subject of multiple lawsuits. (Baldoni also directed the film.)

Dueling lawsuits filed by Lively, 37, and Baldoni, 41, include text messages the stars sent one another while filming the movie, including a discussion in which the pair discussed script changes that Baldoni ultimately acquiesced to.

“From reading their text messages, I do get the sense that, at one point, there was genuine affection between them and what felt like a friendship,” Schachter, who was not involved in the making of It Ends With Us, opined during a new television documentary, He Said, She Said: Blake Lively vs Justin Baldoni, which aired on Channel 5 in the U.K. on Monday, March 17.



In her December 2024 lawsuit accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment, among other things, Lively alleged that Baldoni wanted to add sex scenes that weren't in the film's script, improvised unwanted kissing and that there was often no intimacy coordinator on set. In a January counter lawsuit, Baldoni claimed Lively declined to meet the film's appointed intimacy coordinator before production began. (Both Lively and Baldoni have denied one another's accusations against the other.)

“In my experience, when an actor says, ‘I don't need to meet the intimacy coordinator until we're shooting,' as much as it hinders my process, it does typically indicate that they trust their scene partner,” Schachter said during Monday's documentary. “ And those texts made me think that at one point, she did feel a lot of trust with him.”

Schachter also dissected raw production footage shared by Baldoni's team in January that shows him and Lively filming a dancing scene for a slow-motion montage. According to Lively's lawsuit, Baldoni “leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, ‘It smells so good.' … None of this was remotely in character. When Ms. Lively later objected to this behavior, Ms. Baldoni's response was, ‘I'm not even attracted to you.'” Lively said she tried to avoid kissing Baldoni by suggesting they talk in the scene.

In his countersuit, Baldoni denied “that this scene was filmed in any manner other than pure professionalism,” noting that he was in character. He alleged that Lively tried to take over the direction of the scene and “insisted” they talk, claiming she was “consistently unable to take direction” and “continued to break character” while shooting.

“His team seemed to be accusing Blake of trying to direct that scene and undermine his creative vision. I don't see that,” Schachter said. “I see an actress trying not to kiss her coworker and instead of saying, ‘I don't want to do that,' she's making other suggestions, which is actually pretty considerate because I think it could be humiliating for everyone there to see Blake Lively tell Justin Baldoni, ‘Stop trying to kiss me.'”

Tracy Morgan shared a selfie from his hospital bed — along with a health update — after a scary medical incident at the New York Knicks game on Monday, March 17.

"Thank you for all your concern! I'm doing ok now and doctors say it was food poisoning," Morgan, 56, wrote via Instagram on Tuesday, March 18, alongside a photo of himself smiling and giving the camera a thumbs-up. "Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!"

Despite the scary situation, Morgan — who had wires stuck to his chest — proved that he hadn't lost his sense of humor. "More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I'll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅 #goknicks," he quipped.

Morgan made headlines on Monday night when he was photographed vomiting courtside while the Knicks took on the Miami Heat. He was then escorted out in a wheelchair as Madison Square Garden staff cleaned the area around his seat — halting the game for 10 minutes before the Knicks ultimately defeated the Heat 116-95.

A post shared by instagram

The 30 Rock alum has faced his fair share of health issues through the years, most notably from a 2014 Walmart truck accident that killed his friend, comedian James McNair, and left Morgan in a coma with a broken leg.

In 2024, Morgan addressed the 10-year anniversary of the accident — which occurred when the truck slammed into Morgan's limo on the New Jersey Turnpike — revealing he has forgiven the driver of the vehicle.

"Today is 10 years since our fateful accident, and I want to say to everyone who was in the van with me that night I Love you, and we miss you, Uncle Jimmy Mac and God bless your family," the comedian said in a statement to People. "To the driver that night and his family, me and my comrades forgive you."

Justin Theroux & Nicole Brydon Bloom's Star-Studded Wedding Guest List Revealed, Including Famous Celebs in the Bridal Party! 

Mariah Carey Sparks Romance Rumors with a Fan Favorite Rapper

Justin Theroux and Nicole Brydon Bloom are married, and they're sharing their sweet story of how they met following their star-studded wedding this past weekend in Mexico.

The actors first met in 2022, when their mutual friend Louisa Jacobson introduced them at a private party at The Nines, a bar in Manhattan, back in 2022.

“After the party, a group of us went to grab a drink nearby,” Nicole told Vogue. “It was an abnormally cold night in New York City—about six degrees—and Justin very kindly offered me his gloves, which I gratefully accepted and promptly returned once we were back inside.”

Keep reading to find out more…

The next morning, Nicole got a text from Justin that said: “This yours?” with a photo attached. “It was a picture of him holding my little criss-crossed diamond ring which I had worn, and sadly assumed I'd lost, the night before,” she said.

“Turns out it had slipped off my cold finger into his large gloves when I returned them. Justin put his hands into the glove the next morning and the ring slid halfway onto his finger. He likes to joke that I proposed first, the very first night we met!”

“I for sure thought leaving the ring in my glove was a move,” Justin added. “Which now, knowing Nicole as well as I do, it certainly was not. She has left more jewelry, jackets, and bags in places than I can count. So, definitely not a move.” 

Justin recalled being smitten with Nicole within the first 10 minutes of talking to her.

“I pointed her out across the room to my friend Rassi and when he saw her he did a double take, turned to me and literally said, ‘She is the one,'” Justin revealed. 

“I had no way of knowing how prescient his comment would turn out to be. I then begged him to go over to collect her name, which like an idiot I had not gotten.”

Justin proposed during a vacation on the coast of Italy at Hotel Il Pellicano on the coast of Monte Argentario.

“We almost skipped dinner but decided to take advantage of our first evening on the coast together and ended up having a really poignant conversation over a candlelit dinner,” Nicole said. 

“While eating, a radiant, full blue moon came out and left us both in awe. Justin suggested bringing our drinks down to the water. He popped back to the room, under the guise of getting us some towels, but was really collecting the ring. We were looking out at the water and the moon when he proposed. He said some of the most beautiful things. It was wonderful—we were both crying.”

They just had their wedding at Hotel Esencia in Xpu Há, Mexico. Get all the details and see the guest list!

Justin Baldoni's attorney insisted they may not be open to a settlement with Blake Lively.

The actress, 36, and 41-year-old filmmaker have been embroiled in a bitter labyrinthine legal dispute for months after she accused him of harassment while they made domestic abuse movie ‘It Ends With Us'.

Appearing on Matthew Belloni's podcast 'The Town', Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman was asked "what it would require for this to go away", as he referred to the "potential for the circus and the damage to both sides".

But Freedman argued: "You keep referring to it as a circus and I get it. You see a lot of cases.

"You see a lot of things, but the reality is this is not a circus when you go through an experience like this.

"I've represented a lot of people in the worst moments of their career, the worst moments of their life. Justin has been destroyed by this."

Freedman suggested "the only way" to really attempt to prove his client's innocence could be in court.

He continued: "In this day and age, the only way that you can truly get back is to prove your innocence and that's what we're actively working to [do].

"That may only be able to be done in a courtroom."

Justin, 41, completed filming on 'It Ends With Us' in early 2024 and started a press tour in August, and after fans noted Blake did not participate in interviews with him or attend the film's premiere.

Blake then filed a sexual harassment complaint against Justin – alleging that he and his agents conducted a smear campaign against her.

Her lawsuit against him is set to go to trial in March 2026, following her initial filing in New York Federal Court.

Blake - who played Justin's on-screen love interest in the movie - previously told the New York Times newspaper: "I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted."

Justin - who also directed the 2024 romantic drama film - has denied the allegations, with his lawyer describing the claims as "categorically false".

Bryan, who is acting as a lawyer for the actor and his Wayfarer Studios production company, told Variety: "These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media."

India TV 'She' Conclave: At the India TV 'She' Conclave, Bollywood actor, director and producer Kangana Ranaut came to speak candidly about her journey. The actor, known for her wit and talent, is also the Bhartiya Janata Party's (BJP) MP from Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. While talking about her last release, Emergency, Kangana Ranaut said that her film was not given the film certificate because people questioned the authenticity of her film. However, she believed that the film would see the light of day, and it did. She also mentioned the Chandigarh slap controversy and said that she was threatened before the release of the film. She said that people warned her to not show the Bhindranwale sequence from Emergency.

Talking about the sexism in the entertainment industry, Kangana said that not just Bollywood but society loves to undermine women writers, actors and directors. 'This should change, and we as a society should bring this change,' the Queen actor added.

"Every field has its own mathematics, and this depends on several variables. You also see the filmgoing audience is largely men, and hence, that is shown on screen more. The more the women will move out of their homes and take charge, the more this situation will change," the Mandi MP said. Saying the same, the actor added that pay disparities are unfair towards women.

When asked about the biggest actor in Indian cinema, Kangana was quick to mention the late actor Rajesh Khanna. When she was asked for a female actor, she said her personal favourite is Vyjayanthimala. The National Award-winning actor added that she's influenced by her grace in real life.

For those who don't know, Kangana Ranaut marked her debut in 2006 with Emraan Hashmi and Shinny Ahuja starrer Gangster. She rose to fame with the 2008 movie Fashion. While Priyanka Chopra was in the leading role, Kangana made her presence felt, won her first National Award in a supporting role and told the world that she was here to stay. Over the years, Kangana has given several memorable films, like the Tanu Weds Manu movie series, Queen, Katti Batti, Rangoon, Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and Emergency, among others. She has won four National Awards in total for movies like Fashion, Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Queen and jointly for Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and Panga. She was awarded the Padma Shri in the year 2020 by the Government of India.

Comedian Tracy Morgan left his courtside seat at the New York Knicks game on Monday (March 17) in a wheelchair after apparently falling ill during the team's matchup with the Miami Heat.

Cellphone footage taken at Monday night's game shows Morgan wiping what appeared to be vomit from his face before he was wheeled away from his courtside seat at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 

Following the incident, an announcer said the situation briefly delayed the game. The Knicks won their matchup against the Heat 116-95.

“We hope Tracy feels better soon and look forward to seeing him back courtside,” a Madison Square Garden spokesperson said in a statement.

Several celebrities offered their support for Morgan after video of the apparent health incident circulated online.

"Sending good thoughts to Tracy Morgan," Ben Stiller wrote on X.

"Prayers up for Tracy Morgan," former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III tweeted.

In his post-game interview, Knicks shooting guard Josh Hart told reporters, "We hope everything's good with Tracy Morgan."

"[He's an] avid, lifetime Knicks fan so prayers go out to him and his health and safety," he added.

On Tuesday (March 18), Morgan took to Instagram to reveal that he vomited at the Knicks game due to food poisoning. The comedian shared an update on his health alongside a photo of him from a hospital bed. 

"Thank you for all your concern! I'm doing ok now and doctors say it was food poisoning. Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!" Morgan wrote on social media.

"More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I'll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅 #goknicks," he added.

Actresses have to struggle a lot to get into films. Some don't get work due to their height, some due to obesity, and some have to face rejection due to their dark or dusky complexion. Recently an actress opened up about her initial days and revealed that she was replaced by a dog. Yes! We are talking about Sobhita Dhulipala, the daughter-in-law of Akkineni family. The Made in Heaven actor has made her mark in both Bollywood and OTT. She made her Bollywood debut in 2016 with 'Raman Raghav 2.0' directed by Anurag Kashyap.

Sobhita Dhulipala faced many challenges before entering the film industry. In an old interview with The Indian Express, the actress revealed that she used to face criticism for her dark complexion. Sobhita recalled, 'Everything is a struggle when you start. I don't come from a film family. I remember many times during auditions for ad films, I was told that I was less fair. Many such things happened, looking at my face, I was told that I am less beautiful. It did not happen that I got disappointed.'

She was replaced by a Dog

Apart from this, she also recalled that she was disqualified as a background model for the audition and was replaced by a dog. Sobhita told how she ignored such things in her early days. The actress said, 'I started thinking how I can be creative, yet remain a part of this industry because I am really passionate about it and work for it every day. This is the time when you start thinking out of the box, instead of waiting for some brilliant successful commercial filmmaker to discover you. What is in my control is to go for the audition and give my 100 per cent.'

Sobhita's love story

Her journey of popularity started when she participated in the Miss India 2013 contest as a finalist. Later her interest turned towards acting and became a famous name in the entertainment world. Apart from Hindi films, she acted in films like 'Kurup', 'Major', 'Moothan' and 'Goodachari'. Sobhita was last seen in Mani Ratnam's 'Ponniyin Selvan' first an second part and in 'The Night Manager Series'. Talking about Sobhita's personal life, she married Tollywood star Naga Chaitanya in a traditional Telugu wedding ceremony in Hyderabad on December 4, 2024. For the unversed, Chaitanya is the son of Telugu superstar Nagarjuna who is the richest actor in South cinema. The actor's family is considered to be the most influential family of Tollywood. Chay was earlier married to Samantha Ruth Prabhu.

Interested in reading the Andor season 1 scripts? You're out of luck.

Tony Gilroy, the creator of the Star Wars Disney+ series, told Collider in a recent interview that he is no longer making any of the show's scripts public out of fear they will be used to train artificial intelligence.

Gilroy had been planning to release a book filled with the first season's scripts, but the rise of AI has put an end to that goal.

“I wanted to do it,” Gilroy said. “We put it together. It's really cool. I've seen it, I loved it. AI is the reason we're not. In the end, it would be 1,500 pages that came directly off this desk. I mean, terribly sadly, it's just too much of an X-ray and too easily absorbed. Why help the f****** robots anymore than you can? So, it was an ego thing. It was vanity that makes you want to do it, and the downside is real. So, vanity loses.”

Andor follows a year in the life of Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna. It showcases how he was radicalized into the rebel who helped steal the plans for the Death Star, which directly sets up the plot to the first Star Wars film, A New Hope.

Gilroy says the show has a "pretty fancy bunch of writers."

"Everybody's very experienced,” Gilroy said. “We only get together for five or six days in the beginning to talk about the story, and then we kind of go, and they do their thing, and then they go away. But I always have them as a reference to call upon.”

The second and final season of Andor premieres on April 22.

Disney is the parent company of Lucasfilm and ABC News.

Grant Ellis dropped an L-bomb on The Bachelor — but was quick to wonder if he jumped the gun.

The 31-year-old Bachelor had overnight dates with his final three, Juliana Pasquarosa, Litia Garr and Zoe McGrady, (at the Secrets Tides Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic!) on the Monday, March 17, episode after the three women had visits from ghosts of Bachelor Nation past.



Juliana was up first, revealing to Bachelor season 28 runner-up Daisy Kent that she was nervous about the fantasy suites because of infidelity in her past relationship.

“I was cheated on for so long. He had a bunch of chicks on the side,” Juliana explained.

Daisy, who ended things with Joey Graziadei just before he proposed to Kelsey Anderson, advised Juliana to take this time to talk to Grant. “I had a hard time opening up too. … [But] I started opening up and it kind of changed everything for me,” she said. “I know I did everything I could and I gave it my all. I look back on it and I don't regret it.”

Grant and Juliana subsequently headed out on an ATV date.

“This week is hard, but I want to let you know that I think about you a lot,” Grant told Juliana, adding that even the thought of her makes him smile. “It's scary for me, too.”

During the evening portion of the date, Juliana opened up to Grant about her ex having affairs “for six or seven years” of her life. “It's such a challenge to go from feeling so minimized in somebody's life and that just screwed me up so bad,” she said through tears. “I'm a little broken and I'm still working to fix myself. I want it so bad.”

Grant got teary listening to Juliana and noted that there's part of him that is broken too. “That's what love is for, it fixes you,” he said, telling her that he sees “treasure” when he looks at her.

They spend the night together and are all smiles in the morning. “We got a lot of questions answered. Said a lot of things, had a lot of fun,” Juliana said, with Grant applauding Juliana for opening up about her feelings.

Zoe then met up with Bachelor season 28 second runner-up Rachel Nance. (Tell Us Zoe is going to be the second runner-up without telling Us Zoe is going to be the second runner-up.) While Rachel was labeled as the girl with “the least amount of time” with Joey prior to the fantasy suites, she couldn't hide her shock when Zoe revealed she never had a one-on-one with Grant — which is tough since the pair then head to a silent Yoga date. (Justice for Zoe?)

While Grant opened up to Zoe about his dad's past struggles with addiction during the night portion of their date, it's hard not to feel like Zoe is still far behind. However, they opt to spend the night together.

Bachelor season 27 winner Kaity Biggar is called in to talk to Litia, which makes sense as Litia is struggling with the idea of Grant sleeping with someone else since she has decided she will not have sex with Grant in the fantasy suite.

“Zach basically went into this week and made, like, this whole declaration — sex is off the table,” Kaity recalled to Litia — as if anyone could forget how Zach Shallcross handled “sex week” with now-fiancée Kaity and runner-up Ariel Frenkel.

“I was the third girl that went, so he had previously had two overnights, two other women, and so I finally, like, meet up with him. About 30 minutes into our date, he tells me that he got intimate with another woman,” Kaity continued. “I tried so hard to compartmentalize each relationship, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I, like, broke down, started shaking. I was like, ‘I don't know how we recover from this.' I knew that this was a potential that could happen, and I didn't want to hear it. I wanted to focus on him and I.”

Litia explained to Kaity that she also doesn't want to know whether Grant is intimate with anyone else and Kaity advised her to make sure the lead knows that before it's too late.

Before she can rely Kaity's advice to Grant, however, Litia is forced to face a different fear — zip-lining.

When the duo do finally talk, it's clear how serious they are getting. They discuss moving to New York to be closer to Grant's dad in rehab in New Jersey, Litia's hopes to have kids in two years and finally, why Litia doesn't want to have sex in the fantasy suite.

“I have to make choices to protect my feelings and my peace, so sex is just, like, not on the table for me,” Litia, who is Mormon, told Grant.

“Honestly, I respect that. 100 percent,” Grant replied, agreeing with Litia that sex is “important” and “special” but not everything. “It's not the foundation of the relationship because when you make that your foundation, [your relationship] is not built the right way.”

Grant continued to praise Litia and dropped the bomb. “I think the maturity that you bring is big. I like the ground that you stand on, and I know where your priorities are, and I know what's important to you, it's what you are on the inside that I can see myself with you,” Grant said. “And see you as my wife, because I do love you.”

Litia said “I love you, too” — and they agree to spend the night together.

Grant later revealed to the cameras that this is only the second time he has said “I love you” in his life and he has fears that he shouldn't have said it on the show with other women left.

“Maybe I should have waited a little longer,” he admitted. “I do love her, but I also am falling hard — and, if not, very close to — in love with somebody else. I never thought it would be possible to be in love with multiple women.”

At the rose ceremony, Grant gave roses to Litia and Juliana, sending Zoe home.

Before the episode ended, fans saw a sneak peek at Grant's conversation with his family about being torn between his final two — and it's safe to say his mom is concerned about how this will all shake out. Grant even warned the cameras: “Stay tuned for my demise.”

The Bachelor season 29 finale airs on ABC Monday, March 24, at 8 p.m. ET.

Below Deck Down Under‘s Adair Werley faced her fair share of challenges trying to navigate working on deck and in the galley, which wasn't always easy while working with two different heads of departments.

“You have to do everything whether you like it or not. You see such small bits of the entire situation with everything that's going on — and there's so much that goes on,” Adair exclusively told Us Weekly. “We all have to pitch in and we all do everything. As you see, we're understaffed and we are lacking people.”



Adair noted she was willing to help wherever she was needed, adding, “We are all filling in places that we're not comfortable — but you're expected and obligated to do everything the second that you step on that boat. Whether you like it or not.”

She continued: “As much as we sit and tease and laugh that, ‘Oh, I can't do this or I don't do that.' You do it all with a smile on your face. And you do it for not only your crew but you do it for the guests and for the money. So there's a lot worse that I can do than cleaning heads and beds. There's a lot worse. That's the easy part.”

Adair admitted the complications came from reporting to two different people: bosun Wihan du Toit and chief stew Lara Rigby.

“I don't think there was ever a point where I ever once ever said that there was something that I'm not going to do. If anything, I was the one that was saying I'm going to do anything and everything. That's the purpose of my role as a deck stew is to do whatever I'm needed to do,” she explained. “I think it was an imbalance of what my priorities were at the time. Because it's like, ‘Do I go help out on deck? Do I go rinse off all of our beach setup stuff, help put things away, help lift the jet skis and help clean the deck for tomorrow? Or do I help serve plates and help with turndowns? Do I go to laundry and restock and clean the crew mess? What am I supposed to do?'”

While reflecting on season 3, Adair recalled not always being split evenly, saying, “I'm just running around trying to do a little bit of everything. So it is hard for myself — especially when you have heads of department that are not necessarily meshing to know what to do or to do what everyone wants me to do. Everybody wants me to do something differently because they want me to help them on their task so I'm just trying to bounce around and help everybody.”

Adair admitted it can “sting” when the feedback doesn't take into account her hard work.

“[Especially] when you're grinding and you're busting your butt to try and help everyone and then your heads of department are not fulfilled enough with what you're trying to do,” she noted. “But everyone [on Below Deck Down Under] was very thankful. We all were working really hard together.”

The Below Deck universe has occasionally had crew members who were both on deck and a stew. While those positions usually didn't work out, Adair appeared more positive about her outcome on the Katina.

“As someone going into my third year in the yachting industry now, I still consider that newer in the industry. There was a lot of responsibility and a lot of communication that you have to have and so many things that you have to stay persistent and consistent on,” she detailed. “So the way that [the heads of department] have to work together on top of what their own responsibilities are and then also directing their people, I give them the biggest shout-out ever. I'm not prepared for that yet. I'm nowhere near that and it's definitely difficult, and it takes a lot of work and effort.”

Below Deck Down Under airs on Bravo Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. New episodes stream the next day on Peacock.
