The findings could shed new light on how species are dispersed across oceans in a process that has long captivated scientists and is regarded as critical in the establishment of new species of plants and animals. Other animals such as primates, rodents, geckos, skinks and frogs have all been able to cross oceans, with lizards particularly adept “overwater dispersers,” researchers said. However, nailing down the specifics of how such events occurred and the plausibility of animals traveling between continents on rafts has been “vigorously debated,” researchers said, with other theories, such as land bridges, thought to be more likely. “That they reached Fiji directly from North America seems crazy,” said co-author Jimmy McGuire, a UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology. “Iguanas and desert iguanas in particular are resistant to starvation and dehydration, so my thought process is, if there had to be any group of vertebrate or any group of lizard that really could make an 8,000-kilometer journey across the Pacific on a mass of vegetation, a desert iguana-like ancestor would be the one,” Scarpetta said in the news release.</p>

A dead person killed during an Israeli army strike is taken into the hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Tuesday March 18, 2025. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians. Strikes across Gaza pounded homes, sparked fires in a tent camp outside the southern city of Khan Younis and hit at least one school-turned-shelter. The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.</p>

Ovcharenko, who had arrived with his unit in August, said that on New Year's Eve drones swarmed six Ukrainian military vehicles as they entered Sudzha, quickly destroying them. “Russia controlled Ukrainian logistic lines going into Kursk,” said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan defense consultancy. “We've found their maps: hand-drawn, extremely detailed,” said Artem, a soldier in Sumy who is familiar with the Kursk operation. Each line was meticulously drawn, as if by someone who had spent their entire life training for this.” Though he didn't know what would happen next, Oleksandr said, Sumy had been well fortified with trenches and infantry.</p>

US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin spoke for over two hours during a phone-call, discussing ways to end the ongoing war in Ukraine and ways to establish "lasting peace". Vladimir Putin informed that on March 19, a prisoner exchange will be carried out between the Russian and Ukrainian sides - 175 for 175 people. For this purpose, Russian and American expert groups are being created. Joint efforts will be made to stabilize the situation in crisis areas, establish cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation and global security. This, in turn, will contribute to improving the overall atmosphere of Russian-American relations.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday reacted to comments made by a French politician who made headlines in his country for suggesting the U.S. is no longer worthy of the Statue of Liberty, Leavitt shot back. Glucksmann, in turn, then shot back that French gratitude for Americans' wartime sacrifices is “eternal,” but added: “If the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.” French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government. Macron has let his prime minister, François Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. “My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,” Leavitt said, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with Allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation during World War II and alongside France during World War I.</p>

Mark Carney-led ruling party projected to form majority months after political wipeout seemed inevitable In January, Canadian pollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects of Justin Trudeau's Liberal party, musing whether it would be a wipeout of existential proportions, or merely a catastrophic blowout. On Tuesday, the political analyst Philippe Fournier updated his closely watched website 338Canada, which tracks and aggregates national polls, converting those figures into projected election results. But Justin Trudeau's resignation days later, and Donald Trump's threats to take over Canada, changed everything. Unlike other notable shifts in public sentiment, he says, the result is heavily skewed by threats from Donald Trump.</p>

Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke of President Donald Trump on Tuesday, criticizing the president's call for the impeachment of a federal judge over an immigration-related ruling. "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said in a statement released by the Supreme Court. Roberts' comments followed Trump's call for the impeachment of Washington-based District Judge James Boasberg. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!" The president argued that the law authorized his administration to bypass standard immigration procedures and deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a criminal gang he claimed had ties to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p>

The Texas Civil Rights Project said that officials presented the parents with “an impossible choice” between either leaving their children in US government custody “and never see them again” or being deported together.</p>

Wiz, which offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks, turned down a $23bn takeover bid from Alphabet last summer. The talks failed in part because Wiz and some of its investors were concerned about gaining clearance from regulators. “For Google this [will] be a shot across the bow at other big tech stalwarts, especially Microsoft and Amazon, making a major bet on the cybersecurity space to complement its cloud offering.” Alphabet's previous biggest deal was its $12.5bn acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012, which it sold two years later for $2.9bn. The company hopes that Wiz will help it to increase its global market share of the cloud market from 12%, a distant third behind Microsoft Azure at 21% and Amazon Web Services, which has almost a third.</p>

Opposing legislators led a vivid protest in the legislature involving rainbow-colored smoke bombs. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event. The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities. Hungary's government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls “gender madness,” and argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.” Tamás Dombos, a project coordinator at Hungarian LGBTQ+ rights group Háttér Society, said that Orbán's assault on minorities was a tactic to distract voters from more important issues facing the country, and that allowing the use of facial recognition software at prohibited demonstrations could be used against other protests the government chooses to deem unlawful.</p>

Officials claim attacks will bring release of more hostages, but some suggest political factors at play for Netanyahu Israel has resumed large-scale attacks in Gaza with a wave of airstrikes and artillery fire against targets throughout the devastated territory. Ammunition stocks have been replenished – partly due to US deliveries – and new potential targets among Hamas' leaders identified. This would inevitably mean considerable civilian casualties there, further mass displacement and even more destruction. Aid agencies and shops in Gaza currently have stocks of essentials to last around three weeks, humanitarian officials say, but the new violence will make distribution much harder.</p>

The move comes as Europe scrambles to strengthen its security amid concerns over U.S. commitments under President Donald Trump. BERLIN — German lawmakers passed a mammoth spending plan Tuesday that could allow for up to a trillion dollars in debt-fueled investments in defense and infrastructure over the next decade, according to some estimates. Addressing parliament, presumed next chancellor Friedrich Merz said such huge sums of debt can only be justified under “very extraordinary circumstances.” “The circumstances are determined above all by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Europe. A survey published by Infratest dimap earlier this month suggests that public support for more defense spending is also high.</p>

Israeli tanks maneuver on the border with northern Gaza Strip as seen from southern Israel, Tuesday, March 18, 2025. Opposition parties have promised to support him in any agreement that brings back hostages, but his coalition would still be severely weakened, making early elections likely. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while making “entirely impractical” demands. Israel also said it would not withdraw from a strategic corridor on Gaza's border with Egypt, as stipulated in the agreement. Trump took credit for brokering the ceasefire in January, but since then has appeared to sour on it.</p>

In an article on Tuesday, Orda.kz, citing Economy Minister Serik Zhumangarin's response to a parliamentary inquiry, claimed that a special working group was set up within Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry last year, which is tasked with scrutinizing USAID's activities in the country. The publication quoted the official as clarifying that a “detailed analysis of funded projects and programs will be conducted, including an assessment of their alignment with stated goals and actual results.” Moreover, the US agency's “relationships with other organizations, including governmental and non-governmental” as well as its financial flows will reportedly be put under the auditors' microscope to check for “possible cover-up schemes, inconsistencies in spending, and conflicts of interest.” Last month, the Indian Express reported that USAID's allocation of $21 million, which had been frozen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and was presumably meant to foster “voter turnout in India,” was earmarked for neighboring Bangladesh. Last August, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to step down following massive student-led protests.</p>

China is expected to reshape its Arctic policy, backtracking on its ambition to become a major polar power by 2030, the South China Morning Post has reported, citing insiders. Beijing first outlined its vision for a ‘Polar Silk Road' in a 2018 white paper, positioning it as an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative. “I believe China is still very interested in many of the opportunities that exist to become more involved in Arctic science and commerce,” Duncan Depledge, an Arctic expert and lecturer in geopolitics and security at the UK's Loughborough University, told the outlet. However, US President Donald Trump's shift on Ukraine, pushing for a ceasefire and restoring ties with Moscow, has created uncertainty for Beijing, according to Depledge. In such a scenario, Russia would have to decide whether to align with China, cooperate with Trump, or maintain a balance between the two, the expert added.</p>

New Zealand is responsible for about 80% of the global orange roughy catch.

Kenya's government has been accused of arresting and detaining critics, especially after the June anti-government protests, during which demonstrators stormed parliament and torched a section of the building because they were angry over new taxes passed by legislators. In December, during protests against widespread kidnappings and abductions, dozens of peaceful protesters were arrested. More than 20,000 Kenyans signed the petition on Change.org asking Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima to reconsider their visit. Willem-Alexander was honored with a 21-gun salute and inspected an honor guard, the office of President William Ruto said on Tuesday morning. “There generally is low trust for the government and what it claims to stand for in part because such critical public institutions as health and education are not working,” Munene said.</p>

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two NASA astronauts, are about to return to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS), where they have been living for nine months in a drawn-out mission fraught with technical challenges, schedule changes and politics. Sunita Williams, 59, and Butch Wilmore, 62, had been stuck on the ISS after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a roughly week-long test mission. The absence of gravity has its effects on long-duration space travellers, who experience dizziness, nausea and an unstable gait when they return to Earth. "Astronauts returning to earth often experience dizziness when standing up, known as orthostatic hypotension. The lack of gravity causes significant and often irreparable bone density loss.</p>

Russia “has not lost hope” in a possible ceasefire and resolution of the Ukraine conflict despite Kiev's stepped up attacks on Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov has said. Speaking to Kommersant on Tuesday ahead of a planned phone conversation between Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, Ushakov said that Moscow is “grasping at every opportunity” for a swift settlement. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin and Trump are scheduled to talk on March 18, their second telephone call since the US president's inauguration in January. Trump has said that he will discuss control over territory and “dividing up certain assets” with Putin on Tuesday. Moscow has strongly condemned such “barbaric” attacks involving hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some reportedly loaded with shrapnel to maximize casualties.</p>

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said. The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June. The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.</p>

Russian oil refinery on fire after Ukrainian drone strike; Russia claims advances in southern Ukraine. Russia has rejected the idea of soldiers from countries belonging to Nato being stationed in Ukraine, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, declared on Sunday that such a force would not be seeking Russia's permission. Asked about Russia's position, Keir Starmer's spokesperson said: “It is worth remembering that Russia didn't ask Ukraine when it deployed North Korean troops to the frontline last year.” With some partners potentially wary of committing troops, Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance. Ukrainian drones set on fire an oil refinery in Russia's southern Astrakhan region, local authorities said. Ukraine would not agree to territorial concessions, exclusion from Nato, or limits on its defence capabilities, the Ukrainian parliament's foreign policy committee head, Oleksandr Merezhko, has told the BBC in an interview setting out Kyiv's “red lines” for peace negotiations.</p>

Roberts is considered part of the court's conservative bloc and has repeatedly joined rulings that Trump supports, perhaps most notably last year's decision granting presidents immunity for official acts. The Trump administration has moved to reinstate at least 24,500 recently fired probationary workers following a pair of orders from federal judges last week. Roberts is considered part of the court's conservative bloc and has repeatedly joined rulings that Trump supports, perhaps most notably last year's decision granting presidents immunity for official acts. “ICE did not simply rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures, or tattoos alone,” Cerna wrote. The Trump administration has suffered several legal setbacks and was accused of violating a judge's order by deporting about 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador.</p>

The Extra EA-400 propeller plane took off from the Samedan airfield at 5:20 p.m. Monday, police in Graubuenden canton (state) said in a statement. The plane had arrived from Denmark on March 13 and was en route back to Roskilde, near Copenhagen. The plane crashed two minutes after takeoff on the edge of the village of La Punt Chamues-ch and burned out, police said. They added that the victims have still to be formally identified.</p>

Daily figures often vary widely based on statements by the Taiwanese authorities or their U.S. partners. Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te also raised Beijing's hackles last week when he said that Taiwan law designates mainland China as a “foreign hostile force” and said tougher measures were being taken to prevent Chinese subversion through the media and civic exchanges. China on Saturday lashed out at accusations by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies who said Beijing is endangering maritime safety. Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but Chinese leader Xi Jinping has continued to make bringing the island to heel a top priority of his administration even as it faces economic headwinds and a race for high technology with the West.</p>

Kendall accepts spending will rise, but she says the way to put welfare on a more "sustainable footing" is by getting people into work. But this is trumped by their concern about the £5bn-a-year cuts, which they say will create greater hardship for a group of people already struggling to make ends meet. Liz Kendall's plan merely acknowledges, and repeats, that there will have to be discussions with the Scottish government. But the Treasury's insistence on immediate cuts means that most anti-poverty campaigners see these reforms as simply a dash to save cash.

We have been promoting peace since day one and that cannot be achieved without Ukraine taking part in talks. The agreed format – with focus on energy infrastructure and further talks on stopping hostilities at sea – appears to be closer to the much narrower original proposal made by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and first publicly floated by French president Emmanuel Macron. The Kremlin's text also says that Putin “responded constructively” to proposal of a ceasefire at sea, with further negotiations expected on this issue.

Experts told Euronews that these G7 countries, which are all non-nuclear states, will continue to depend on the US for nuclear deterrence against their adversaries. Following the end of World War II, Germany, which was divided into East and West, had to comply with strict military limitations. French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken about the possibility of extending his country's nuclear deterrence to Germany and other EU partners, who would help financially with its enlargement. One area that Tokyo, which has China, Russia and North Korea as neighbours, plans to improve on is its air defence systems.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) for over nine months, have finally begun their journey home. NASA explains that as a spacecraft plunges into the atmosphere, it encounters extreme conditions, including temperatures reaching up to 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Using heat shields, parachutes, and advanced software, NASA engineers develop solutions that help spacecraft survive the fiery descent. Even the Space Shuttle programme, which featured reusable orbiters, provided valuable insights into reentry aerodynamics. NASA's Lessons Learned Information System (LLIS) supports knowledge-sharing, allowing engineers to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in future missions.</p>

Those stories, from all corners of the British Isles, are struggling to be made in today's economic reality. Audiences are now watching more on streaming services and digital platforms like YouTube, while the costs of making TV have spiralled. Low confidence means less appetite for risk and we have built the industry on taking creative risks. It has given us Happy Valley, Shameless, Fleabag, Skins, Life on Mars, to name just a few.

“Today's notice not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense.” At VOA, which was set up during the second world war to counter Nazi propaganda, Trump's decision has seen almost 1,300 staff placed on administrative leave, according to VOA director Mike Abramowitz. Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House bureau chief, said in a statement on social media: “I do not know a single VOA journalist who is not fiercely protective of our charter and the editorial independence it provides, especially those of us born in countries where there is no such concept.” Former Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen, an authoritarian who handed power to his son in 2023, also weighed in publicly to praise the Trump administration decision, describing the cuts as a “major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement, and chaos around the world”.

Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas – thousands of miles and one giant ocean away. That journey is thought to be a record – further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever travelled on the ocean. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31m years ago. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America. Many Fijian iguana species are endangered, and an invasive green iguana roams the islands today, said study author Robert Fisher of the United States Geological Survey.</p>

However, the administration's policies and enforcement priorities can indeed create risks for permanent residents, especially those whose immigration histories are complex. Immigration enforcement has been ramped up by the Trump administration, with Green Card holders' past records coming under intense scrutiny. While these are mainly aimed at visa holders and new entrants, Green Card holders from certain countries wondered if they would be permitted to get back to the US if they travelled abroad. Green Card holders can always defend themselves before an immigration judge, should such a need arise. Green Card status is usually secure for people who have maintained their residency properly and complied with the law.</p>

Palestinian Hamas group has accused Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "sacrificing" its hostages after fresh strikes jolted Gaza this morning, raising questions over future ceasefires to bring back the Israeli citizens still held captive. "Netanyahu's decision to resume war is a decision to sacrifice the occupation's prisoners and impose a death sentence on them," said Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq, accusing the Prime Minister of using the conflict as a political "lifeboat" to distract from internal crises. Israeli forces announced "extensive attacks" on Hamas targets this morning and ordered all schools to stay shut in Gaza. "Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," it declared.

The US Department of Justice provided those details as it sought to assure a federal judge in Boston that US Customs and Border Protection did not willfully disobey an order he issued on Friday that should have halted Alawieh's immediate removal.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are beginning their journey back to Earth today after being stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) for nine months. NASA's live coverage of the Earthbound journey showed Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore posing for their final photos aboard the station before they packed up and closed the hatches to begin a 17-hour trip back to Earth early on Tuesday. They will be flown to NASA's Johnson Space Center for a few days of routine post-mission medical checks. NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, the other two members of Crew-9, flew to the ISS in September on a Crew Dragon craft with two empty seats. The ISS, about 254 miles in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy mainly managed by the US and Russia.</p>

French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks. “I advocate great caution when it comes to those frozen assets,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at a March 6 EU summit. Opponents of seizure also fear that countries and investors would hesitate to use European financial institutions if they are afraid assets could be seized, undermining the euro's role as an international currency for state reserves. She favors seizure, however, arguing that the European Central Bank has tools to thwart any unjustified bond selloff by purchasing government bonds. “We view those intentions as unlawful, and any attempt to fulfill them would entail very serious legal consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this month.</p>

The United States has firmly rejected a suggestion by French politician Raphael Glucksmann that the Statue of Liberty should be returned to France, dismissing his remarks as unwarranted and politically motivated. His remarks were seen as a direct criticism of US President Donald Trump's policies, particularly regarding scientific freedom and international relations.

BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares gained 4.1% on Tuesday to hit a record high of 408.80 Hong Kong dollars, as investors bet that the company could strengthen its already commanding position as one of the world's biggest electric carmakers. Two new BYD models will be capable of receiving peak charging power of 1,000 kilowatts (kW), enabling them to travel 400km (249 miles) on a five-minute charge, the BYD founder, Wang Chuanfu, said at an event livestreamed from the company's Shenzhen headquarters on Monday. Wang, who is often described as China's answer to the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, started the business as a battery maker in 1995, before starting car manufacturing in 2003. It is also facing increased competition with more affordable EV models, including those produced by BYD and other Chinese companies. “In order to completely solve our users' charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,” Wang said.</p>

South Africa's Environment Minister, Dion George, confirmed that an assault had taken place and stated that the individual responsible had shown remorse and undergone psychological evaluation. With the base located more than 2,600 miles south of Cape Town and surrounded by harsh Antarctic conditions, the team is not expected to be relieved until December, when South Africa's SA Agulhas II ship returns.

But over the weekend, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been leading mediation efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately “or pay a severe price.” Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population.

At least 200 Palestinians, including many children, were killed, medics told news agency Reuters as Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early on Tuesday. Over the weekend, US envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been leading mediation efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately “or pay a severe price."

Taiwan detected 59 Chinese aircraft around the self-ruled island, the defence ministry said Tuesday, the highest tally since a record in October and days after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te called China a "foreign hostile force". China insists democratic Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring the island under its control. Beijing has increased the deployment of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty, which Taipei rejects. Last Thursday, Lai branded China a "foreign hostile force", as he proposed measures to combat deepening Chinese infiltration in the island.

Kate Randolph, the acting president of Hunter Wildlife Rescue, described the incident as “extremely confronting” and said volunteers and local vets were doing everything they could to rescue surviving, severely sick birds. Bishop said the results of toxicology studies identifying potential poisons or toxins could take weeks. She said the incident was a reminder that feeding birds came with risks, encouraging the birds to trust humans, which made them more vulnerable to deliberate poisoning.</p>

In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said his country would “defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests under international law against any hostile action.” The Houthis claimed there had been additional U.S. airstrikes overnight, though American officials did not immediately acknowledge them.</p>

This follows Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators. Hamas, however, said Mr Netanyahu had decided to "sacrifice" hostages by resuming war. A White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted President Donald Trump's administration before it carried out the strikes. The Gaza war began when Hamas led a cross-border raid into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel's retaliatory strikes since then have killed more than 48,000 Palestinians and injured over 1.12 lakh, according to reports.</p>

At al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, survivors held rushed funeral rites for dozens of body bags lining the yard. Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said Israel had launched strikes after discovering Hamas was planning new raids to capture or kill Israeli civilians or soldiers and because Hamas had refused to release more of the 59 hostages held in Gaza, thus breaking the ceasefire agreement that came into effect in January. It could have chosen to release all the hostages but instead chose refusal, terror, and war,” Shoshani said in a statement. Hamas said hostage releases were due only during a scheduled second phase that Israel agreed in January but has since refused to discuss or implement. Earlier this month, Israel blocked deliveries of aid from entering Gaza and cut off remaining electricity supplies in an effort to pressure Hamas.</p>

Reuters quoted a senior Hamas official as saying that Israel has “unilaterally” ended the ceasefire brokered by the US and Arab states. Under the deal that came into effect on January 19, Hamas handed over 25 hostages and the bodies of eight captives in exchange for the release of around 1,500 Palestinians from Israeli prisons, according to AP. Israel and Hamas have been unable to agree on next steps since the first phase of the truce expired on March 1.</p>

The Israeli military has said that it conducted extensive strikes on targets belonging to Hamas in Gaza.

In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate". The escalating violence comes amid disagreement between Israel and Hamas on how to sustain the three-phase ceasefire that came into effect on January 19. The first phase of the agreement, which ended earlier this month, saw Hamas release more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.</p>

The Trump administration claimed to a federal judge on Monday that it did not recall deportation flights of hundreds of suspected Venezuelan gang members over the weekend despite his specific instructions because that was not expressly included in the formal written order issued afterwards. All three flights landed in El Salvador, where the deportees were taken to a special maximum security prison, after Boasberg issued his written order. “My equitable powers are pretty clear that they do not lapse at the airspace's edge.” Boasberg expressed doubt at the strength of that argument, as well as Kambli's separate claim that he could not provide more details about when the deportation flights took off and how many flights left the US on Saturday, before and possibly after his order.

Notably, some have labeled U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, as such after she sided with Chief Justice John Roberts and left-leaning justices to uphold a lower court decision that forced the Trump administration to unfreeze USAID payments previously authorized by Congress. "The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory," Leavitt said, adding, "A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. Lee, in recent weeks, suggested that some judges handing down defeats for the Trump administration "might warrant removal." Many judges, for their part, have taken umbrage at the sweeping nature of Trump's executive orders, which have called for the gutting of government personnel, halted billions in foreign aid – including funds approved by Congress – and attempted to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, among other actions. "Here, the executive has unilaterally deemed that funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid will not be spent," Ali said.</p>

They tumbled when a new AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek reignited concerns over an AI bubble and shaved nearly $600 billion from the chipmaker's market cap in a single day. But Nvidia bull and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Tuesday that he believes the company's GTC event in San Jose, Calif., this week will be "a wake-up moment for the tech bulls."

And as of Tuesday midday, the iPhone maker's market cap stood at roughly $3.2 trillion. “Given our prior iPhone forecast assumed the iOS18.4 launch in April '25 would integrate a more advanced Siri alongside broader Apple Intelligence language support and accelerate upgrade rates this fall, we believe it is necessary to lower our [iPhone] upgrade rate assumption, and FY26 shipment forecast, as a more advanced Siri is unlikely to be available until after the iPhone 17 launch,” he wrote. “That's not to say other factors cannot support iPhone growth in FY26 ... but without a ‘killer AI app' in market ahead of the iPhone 17 launch, we don't see AI features contributing to accelerating upgrade rates as meaningfully as we did previously,” he added. The Trump administration is also putting a massive chunk of Apple's annual revenue at risk. That's because the DOJ last week stood firm with the prior administration in asking a federal judge to block Google (GOOG) from paying companies like Apple to secure its search engine as a default on devices like smartphones — which generates $18 billion to $20 billion in revenue for Apple per year, Bernstein analysts estimate.</p>

As markets attempt to recover from recent sell-off action that's left the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) in correction territory, one major catalyst this week could make or break a comeback: Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy decision. A bleak economic scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, stagflation has become the latest buzzword in financial markets as investors attempt to understand the administration's shifting trade narrative and other policy unknowns, including recent efforts to cut government jobs from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Powell recently argued that sentiment readings "have not been a good predictor of consumption growth in recent years." That's been followed by a handful of downward revisions for year-end S&P 500 targets, with RBC Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs, and Yardeni Research all lowering their respective calls over the past week. "FOMC participants will have to rethink their projections now that the first tariffs have taken effect and the White House looks set to eventually impose larger tariffs than initially seemed likely," Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a Sunday note.</p>

Global investors have fled US stocks at their fastest rate on record in favour of UK stocks, making their highest allocation to British equities since June 2021. UK equities were the third most overweight sector from global investors this month, beaten out only by utilities and banking stocks, Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey revealed. Just a month ago, the UK was rated as the least attractive market to invest in among fund managers, with an 18 per cent underweight to British equities. Meanwhile, March saw the biggest drop in US equity allocation ever, amid fears that president Donald Trump's tariffs policy may kick off a global trade war. Along with the UK, Europe has also been a beneficiary of a shift in investment behaviour, with allocation to Eurozone stocks at the highest since July 2021.</p>

Fiona Orford-Williams, Director of TMT at Edison Group, said: “Trustpilot's full year results were as signalled in its January update… in excess of what the market was then forecasting. The company expects constant currency revenue growth in the high teens this year, with adjusted EBITDA slightly ahead of market expectations and a 2 percentage point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. “Our strategy is clear: we operate an open, trusted platform for consumers to help each other make the right choices, and for businesses to build trust, grow, and improve,” CEO Adrian Blair said, adding that he wanted to maximise the platform's “inherent network effects”. “We executed well against this in 2024, delivering record bookings, profitability and cash generation, returning $42.9m (£33m) of capital to shareholders through two share buybacks.</p>

The president's louder message about tariffs when compared with taxes was also touched on by Evercore ISI's Sarah Bianchi in a recent research note. The contrast between Bessent's interview this weekend and earlier moments like his confirmation hearing is stark. During that hearing, Bessent called tax cuts the most important issue before him and described getting them done as "pass-fail." Instead, markets are much more likely to hear things like rhetoric used by Trump ally Chris Lacivita, who recently called those worried about stock losses "bed wetters."

Speaking virtually at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 18, Wood said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent isn't worried about a recession. “I think what's happening, though, is that if we do have a recession, declining GDP, that this is going to give the president and the Fed many more degrees of freedom to do what they want in terms of tax cuts and monetary policy,” said Wood. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded heavy outflows in recent weeks, but the overall trend shows investors are holding their positions. “[W]e've built out positions in more than just the big three,” she said, referring to Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Pro-crypto policy changes are “giving institutions the green light, and if you look at our studies as long ago as 2016, we wrote a paper called ‘Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class,' and, yet many institutions just dismissed it out of hand,” said Wood.</p>

A new report by Cointelegraph Research and Elastos delves into how Bitcoin's security helps to create trustless, scalable financial ecosystems. Elastos stands out as one of the leading players in this evolution by incorporating merged mining, a method that allows secondary blockchains to inherit Bitcoin's security. At the core of Elastos' infrastructure is its Elastic Consensus model, a hybrid mechanism that integrates auxiliary proof-of-work, bonded proof-of-stake, and proof-of-integrity. Despite these hurdles, Elastos' combination of Bitcoin security, trustless smart contract execution and institutional backing positions it for potential growth in the evolving BTCFi sector. With Bitcoin-secured finance projected to expand significantly, Elastos' infrastructure provides a robust foundation for the next wave of decentralized financial applications.</p>

Stablecoins break down key barriers in cross-border payments, empowering small businesses and enabling financial inclusion. Higher interest rates and tighter economic circumstances have since tempered that exuberance, but funds continue to pile into the sector. Indeed, the global fintech sector is expected to see a rebound in investment activity throughout 2025. SWIFT is nothing more than a messaging system that enables banks to communicate around transactions.

He told Cointelegraph that Swyftx's deal with Easy Crypto was underway before Trump was elected, but now we are on “the cusp of sensible regulation in the US” that will bring liquidity and put pressure on other governments to legislate. “This hesitation has extended to other markets where regulators have sat on the fence and shown a lack of commitment to introducing clear legislation that supports blockchain and digital assets,” he said. “We expect dealmaking to increase over the next few quarters and then stay elevated after that. Meanwhile, research by Web3 consumer research firm Protocol Theory, in partnership with Easy Crypto, estimates almost 50% of New Zealand's 5.2 million population are either current crypto investors or are considering investing in the future. “The region is undergoing increasing levels of regulation, which will help to drive trust, much like other regions.”</p>

Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at global asset management firm Bernstein, initiated coverage of Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) stock with an outperform rating and a price target of over $310. “COIN offers an exchange, broker/dealer, institutional prime desk, stablecoin banking, crypto payments, custodian bank, software and blockchain ecosystem services, all combined into a full stack ‘Amazon' of crypto financial services,” added the report. “The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph. While Trump has previously highlighted his intentions to bolster crypto innovation in the US, issuing regulatory frameworks takes time and setting the “right regulatory tone” will be crucial for the administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum — a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

Onchain data from Santiment shows that wallets holding at least 1 million DOGE have increased by 1.24% since early February, despite declining prices. Meanwhile, active addresses have surged to a four-month high, suggesting rising network activity. Typically, when large holders accumulate an asset while prices decline, it signals that they see undervaluation and are positioning for a future rebound. An increase in active addresses indicates higher engagement on the network—possibly reflecting growing retail interest. If this surge in user activity stems from real adoption rather than speculative trading or panic selling, it could provide the onchain foundation needed for a price recovery.</p>

Jose Fabrega, head of marketing at Ethereum-based blockchain Metis, called Durov's arrest the “Tornado Cash case all over again.” Natalia Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, has previously told Cointelegraph that “Historically, software developers were seen as neutral creators of tools and platforms, responsible for their technical functionality but not for how those tools were used.” However, she said this has been changing with the proliferation of decentralized tools that “challenge traditional regulatory frameworks.” Gregory Alburov, an investigator for the Anti-Corruption Foundation of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, said the case “in addition to being unjust as hell (Durov obviously isn't engaged in terrorism or weapons trafficking), is also a huge blow to freedom of speech.”</p>

Tech giant Microsoft has discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT) that targets crypto held in 20 cryptocurrency wallet extensions for the Google Chrome browser. Losses to crypto scams, exploits and hacks totaled nearly $1.53 billion in February, with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack accounting for the lion's share of losses, according to blockchain security firm CertiK. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its 2025 Crypto Crime Report that crypto crime has entered a professionalized era dominated by AI-driven scams, stablecoin laundering, and efficient cyber syndicates, with the past year witnessing $51 billion in illicit transaction volume.

Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol and Meteora have been sued in a New York court for their alleged role in the Libra token scandal, which saw around $107 million pooled from investors. The Libra token scandal is set to be reviewed by the Supreme Court of New York after a newly filed class-action lawsuit accused its creators of misleading investors and siphoning over $100 million from one-sided liquidity pools. Burwick Law filed the suit on behalf of its clients against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol and Meteora on March 17 for launching the Libra (LIBRA) token in a “deceptive, manipulative and fundamentally unfair” manner. Within hours, the insiders “rapidly siphoned approximately $107 million from the liquidity pools,” causing a 94% crash in LIBRA's market value, Burwick Law said in a March 17 filing shared on X.

Bitcoin's nearly $12 billion open interest shakeout earlier this month might be just the catalyst needed for the asset to regain its upward momentum, according to a crypto analyst. CoinGlass data shows that on Feb. 20, Bitcoin's (BTC) open interest (OI) — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled Bitcoin derivative contracts such as options and futures — stood at $61.42 billion before dropping 19% to $49.71 billion by March 4. “Following the recent panic triggered by political instability linked to Trump's decisions, we witnessed a massive liquidation of leveraged positions on Bitcoin,” DarkFost said. Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee recently told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin hovering in the low $80,000s, its price and OI could see more volatility if the March 19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting delivers any surprises.

Acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda said he's asked his staff to look at possibly withdrawing a proposed crypto custody rule for investment advisers. This meant that investment advisers would have to custody their clients' crypto with a qualified custodian. Gensler said at the time that investment advisers “cannot rely on” crypto platforms as qualified custodians due to how they operate. Uyeda's latest remarks come days after he said on March 10 that he had asked SEC staff “for options on abandoning” part of a proposal pushing for some crypto firms to register with the regulator as exchanges.

It follows an earlier March 3 Semafor report, where Mueller said financial disclosures had held Atkins back from scheduling a Senate hearing to review his standing. “It's a lot to go through,” one former Senate Banking Committee staffer reportedly told Mueller on March 3.

Even if the union does go that route, these matters take time to resolve and seldom result in anything of note. The Marlins are projected to enter the season with a luxury tax payroll around $86 million (according to FanGraphs) despite receiving at least an estimated $70 million in revenue sharing funds. Teams are supposed to spend 150% of what they receive in revenue sharing, meaning the Marlins would be expected to field a luxury tax payroll of around $105 million. While failing to meet that mark doesn't mean the Marlins would lose a grievance, it does increase the chances of MLBPA submitting a grievance -- if only to keep revenue-sharing recipients honest about their spending.

Today, we're handing out grades based on how each team did overall in free agency. If you're wondering which positions NFL teams value the most, this list would seem to answer that question. There are nine names and they all play one of two positions: Receiver or pass rusher. QB: Aaron RodgersRB: J.K. DobbinsWR: Stefon DiggsTE: Tyler ConklinOT: Joe Noteboom C: David AndrewsOG: Teven Jenkins Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot spent the offseason saying that his team would NOT be releasing Kirk Cousins, and he wasn't kidding.</p>

Spurs forward Keldon Johnson revealed what happened during that late-February meeting in an interview with ESPN, and it's clear that Popovich is still locked in on what's happening on the court. Popovich, 76 and already a Hall of Famer, has made excellent progress since November. Ramona Shelburne and Michael C. Wright reported in their story that, "another source said the coach has advanced in five months of rehab to the point where many who suffer strokes progress over nine months." This has been a difficult season in San Antonio even beyond Popovich's health scare. Star big man Victor Wembanyama was ruled out for the remainder of the season in February after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his shoulder, and recently acquired point guard De'Aaron Fox underwent season-ending surgery on his finger this month.</p>

As the football world awaits Aaron Rodgers' decision regarding his future, many are getting impatient. On the latest episode of his Not Just Football podcast, Steelers defensive end Cameron Heyward shared his thoughts on Rodgers' decision-making process, saying he is "tired of talking about the quarterback situation." Rodgers is reportedly waiting to hear from the Minnesota Vikings before making a decision. This offseason, the Steelers signed Mason Rudolph, but no other major moves have been made at QB. After not playing in 2023 due to an Achilles injury suffered four offensive snaps into the season, Rodgers finished last year with 3,897 yards passing, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.</p>

This season, it seems like most of the true impact players changing teams in free agency were on defense. Among the top 20 highest-paid non-quarterbacks who changed teams so far this offseason, 15 of them were defensive players, according to Spotrac. Arizona desperately needed a high-level player coming off the edge, and we know Sweat can succeed in this system. As we wrote last week when naming him one of our best value signings, Ford is coming off a really solid year with the Chargers during which he picked up 21 run stops and 23 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. Placing him on the defensive line with Jared Verse, Braden Fiske, Kobie Turner and Byron Young should make for a really fun, flexible group.</p>

With that result, the Heat have now dropped eight games in a row, which is their longest losing streak under long-time coach Erik Spoelstra. Only the openly tanking Sixers and Utah Jazz have been worse in that stretch. All of this losing has put the Heat in an interesting spot. Their 2025 first-round pick belongs to the Oklahoma City Thunder, but is protected 1-14 this year before becoming unprotected in 2026.

Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said he has not had any conversations with the NCAA about a potential postseason ban stemming from the NCAA's investigation into allegations of impermissible scouting, according to 247Sports. Michigan has received a notice of allegations covering the purported sign-stealing scheme orchestrated by former football staffer Connor Stalions and in January filed a formal response. "I have not had any conversation about postseason bans or penalties that are coming," Manuel told 247Sports. In its January response, Michigan accused the NCAA of "grossly overreaching" and "wildly overcharging" the university despite a lack of evidence, according to documents obtained by Yahoo Sports. The university alleges much of Stalions' sign-stealing operation was achieved through legal avenues, and not in a way that would provide an unfair advantage.</p>

This is a safe space to share opinions and ask questions without fear or ridicule. Most schools have started spring drills as they introduce new players, a few superstar transfers and attempt to make sense of their depth charts before the transfer portal opens again in April. It might not be as crazy as past years, but plenty of fringe players -- scholarship-worthy walk-ons and backups -- will enter the portal in April looking for new homes that may no longer exist because of roster limits. His name comes up for jobs at more prominent programs every other year, and he hasn't taken the bait. There is no active effort to aggressively expand in the MAC, Conference USA or AAC.</p>

It probably goes without saying, but the Jets' 2025 season may hinge on if Justin Fields is a good quarterback or not. Key additions: S Camryn Bynum, CB Charvarius Ward, QB Daniel JonesKey losses: OG Will Fries, EDGE Dayo Odeyingbo, C Ryan Kelly Ladd McConkey can't do everything by himself, and I wonder how effective Mike Williams will be in his return to the Chargers. Hopkins turns 33 in June, and is probably more of a move-the-chains possession guy than someone who averages 70-80 receiving yards per game.

In a game that Houston badly needed for seeding purposes, they trapped and face-guarded him on critical possessions. Now, to be fair, Houston felt comfortable guarding him like this because he's playing on a tanking roster, but consider the alternative. If he keeps playing this well, Nick Nurse won't be able to keep him off of the floor. Yet Grimes played inconsistently, averaging 22.8 minutes as a Maverick, but with pretty wild swings depending on team health and game-to-game performance. The 76ers have, either through shrewd scouting or sheer, dumb luck landed on one of this season's breakout players.</p>

Like this year's visit, all five prior trips to Japan have been two-game series played at the Tokyo Dome. Over the last decade or so, Japanese-born starting pitchers matching up in a regular-season game has become commonplace thanks to Ohtani, Yu Darvish, Hiroki Kuroda, Masahiro Tanaka, and others who've had long MLB careers. Suzuki was on Japan's original WBC roster, but had to withdraw from the event with an oblique injury. Like Hoerner, May remained in Arizona to continue working out there, and occupies one of the team's three "inactive" spots.

Michigan infielder Mitch Voit apologized for his celebration that imitated snorting cocaine following a triple in Sunday's 11-0 win over USC, calling it "an immature decision in the heat of the moment" on social media. "I would like to apologize for my actions on third base yesterday," the apology reads. He then mocked snorting the chalk of the third base line in a manner similar to how one would snort cocaine.

While Ohtani continues to break records never imagined before, including becoming the first player to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a single season, the comparisons never stop. Babe Ruth, one of the few players to both pitch and hit, as Ohtani does. But for today's baseball-playing youth, Ohtani is their hero, the man who can do what almost no one else can and do it better than almost everyone else. Thus far, he sure hasn't let anyone down on the field. Ohtani, 30, hit .310/.390/.646 (190 OPS+) with 38 doubles, seven triples, 54 home runs, 130 RBI, 134 runs, 59 steals and 9.2 WAR last season, winning his first NL MVP after taking AL MVP in two of the previous three seasons.</p>

They concluded that kefir shows promise as a potential complementary treatment for Alzheimer's disease, offering neuroprotective benefits due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Kefir's potential brain-boosting effects may extend beyond Alzheimer's disease, with emerging research suggesting that it could help regulate mood and stress by influencing the gut-brain axis. Some studies suggest that kefir could help improve lactose digestion over time by increasing the presence of beneficial gut bacteria. Moreover, researchers emphasize that kefir's therapeutic potential is influenced by variations in microbial content and fermentation conditions, necessitating further standardization efforts before clinical implementation.

She had a feeling her character, Laurel Lance, was getting killed off — and that turned out to be true. Cassidy allowed herself an “anger moment” despite always being “a professional” on set. “I think that them killing me off the show was actually, for me personally, a very good thing, because like I said, you sometimes need to get knocked down,” she told TVLine in 2020.

In a January counter lawsuit, Baldoni claimed Lively declined to meet the film's appointed intimacy coordinator before production began. “In my experience, when an actor says, ‘I don't need to meet the intimacy coordinator until we're shooting,' as much as it hinders my process, it does typically indicate that they trust their scene partner,” Schachter said during Monday's documentary. “ And those texts made me think that at one point, she did feel a lot of trust with him.” Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</p>
