SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has struck a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's biggest-ever acquisition at the same time it's facing a potential breakup of its internet empire. 

The proposed takeover announced Tuesday is part of Google's aggressive expansion into cloud computing during an artificial intelligence boom. The frenzy is driving demand for data centers that provide the computing power for AI technology and intensifying the competition in that space among Google and two other tech powerhouses, Microsoft and Amazon. 

If the all-cash transaction is approved by regulators, Wiz will join Google Cloud — an increasingly important part of its business separate from the search and advertising operations that account for most of the $350 billion annual revenue at Google's parent company, Alphabet. 

With the advent of AI, however, the cloud division has become a rising star at Google. Annual revenue in the division was $26.3 billion in 2022, and soared 64% to $43.2 billion last year. 

Wiz, a five-year-old startup founded by four longtime friends who met in the Israeli army when they were still teenagers, is on track for an estimated $1 billion in revenue this year. After getting its start in Israel in 2020, Wiz now oversees an operation that makes security tools protecting the information stored in data centers from its current headquarters in New York.

“Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,” Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote in a blog post.




In a Tuesday conference call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted Cloud division's addition of Wiz will result in even better security at a lower cost than can be provided now. That prediction may have been aimed as much at regulators likely to scrutinize how the deal will affect competition and pricing, as much as at prospective customers. 

Google had been courting Wiz for some time before finally settling on a price that's much richer than a reported $23 billion bid that was rejected last July. At that time, Wiz signaled it would instead pivot back to a previously-planned initial public offering. But recent volatility in the stock market has chilled the IPO market, and now Rappaport said Wiz expects to “innovate even faster” by becoming a part of Google.

Wedbush analysts called Google's move to buy Wiz “a shot across the bow” at other tech giants, particularly Microsoft and Amazon, who have already made big bets on cyber security as the fight to dominate cloud computing intensifies. Google had fallen behind its competition in the cloud space, Wedbush said, but the acquisition of Wiz could alter the parameters. 

The bid Tuesday easily eclipses the current largest acquisition in Google's 26-year history — a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012 that didn't pay off the way that the Mountain View, California, company had hoped. The $32 billion purchase of Wiz would also go down at the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition and rank among the 20 most expensive takeovers of a software company in history, according to Mergermarket, a financial intelligence service.

As often happens with high-priced acquisitions, investors reacted coolly to Tuesday's news as Alphabet's shares fell 3% during afternoon trading.

Some of Google's other acquisitions have turned into gold mines, most notably its $1.76 billion purchase of online video pioneer YouTube in 2006 and its $3.1 billion takeover of advertising technology platform DoubleClick in 2008. A $5.4 billion purchase of another security firm, Mandiant, in 2022 also helped fuel the recent growth of Google's Cloud division, which posted an operating profit of $6.1 billion last year.

Google's DoubleClick deal is now part of an antitrust case filed by the U.S. Justice Department targeting Google's technology for distributing ads across the internet. A ruling in that case, involving allegations that Google illegally abused its power to manipulate digital ad prices, is expected this year.

Regulators in the U.S. and abroad are targeting Google on other fronts, too.

Last year, a federal judge in another case brought by the Justice Department last year concluded Google had turned its ubiquitous search engine into an illegal monopoly. The penalization phase of that trial begins next month.

The Justice Department is seeking a rebuke that would include a requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser and would ban the company from making agreements with Apple and other companies to make its search engine the default tool for finding online information on the iPhone and other devices.

The Wiz deal will also get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to be more friendly to business deals, it has also shown itself to be leery of big tech. 

The Wiz deal raises antitrust concerns due to the potential impact on standalone cyber security vendors, as well as potential disruption for bigger rivals. Still, Wedbush's analysts note the industry is “ripe for consolidation” — which could pose “massive growth opportunities on the horizon heading into this AI Revolution.”

Antitrust worries were also believed among the reasons Wiz called off sales talks with Google last year while President Joe Biden's administration was seeking to block a variety of tech deals. Agreeing to a sale now indicates both Google and Wiz are more confident the deal will gain U.S. approval under the Trump administration, Mergermarket analysts Kevin Ketcham and Kevin McCaffrey wrote in a Tuesday note.

“The two sides likely wouldn't have struck the deal if they didn't at least see a potential path to closing,” Ketcham and McCaffrey wrote.

If they get the regulatory greenlight and meet several conditions spelled out in their agreement, Google and Wiz expect the deal to close in 2026.

Oops, something went wrong

At Nvidia's (NVDA) GTC event, the chipmaker added another big carmaker to its list of auto partners.

“I'm super-excited to announce that GM has selected Nvidia to partner with them to build their future self-driving fleet,” CEO Jensen Huang said. “The time for autonomous vehicles has arrived, and we're looking forward to building with GM AI for three areas — AI for manufacturing, AI for enterprise for how they work, and AI for in the car.”

Specifically, GM (GM) will use Nvidia's DRIVE AGX hardware system for in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.

Huang said the companies will also work together to build custom AI systems using Nvidia platforms like Nvidia Omniverse with Nvidia Cosmos to train AI manufacturing models to optimize GM's factory planning and robotics.

Last month, Nvidia announced that Toyota (TM) — the world's largest automaker — will begin using the company's DRIVE AGX Orin chip and the Nvidia DriveOS operating system to power advanced driver-assistance features in its next-generation vehicles.

Nvidia's chips are already used to power self-driving technologies at Mercedes (MGBAF), Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST), China's BYD (BYDDY), and device maker Foxconn, for example. Nvidia chips also power some of Tesla's supercomputers.

Nvidia's auto business is beginning to make some waves, and the chipmaker believes it is just getting started.

Case in point: "Fourth-quarter Automotive revenue was $570 million, up 27% from the previous quarter and up 103% from a year ago. Full-year revenue rose 55% to $1.7 billion," Nvidia revealed in its Q4 earnings release earlier this year.

“Nvidia's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the earnings conference call.

Over the last two years, the Big Four giants have been plagued by rumours of redundancies and now the situation has escalated to the senior partners. 

Over the weekend, The Sunday Times revealed that dozens of senior partners were at risk of being laid off at EY, the most significant redundancy plan in decades.

EY currently has 894 equity partners and 757 non-equity partners, but the paper revealed the firm is expected to axe 30 partners, mainly in its consulting division.

In addition to those facing the chopping block, it was reported that some equity partners will have their positions converted into non-equity partners.

The news about EY follows PwC which recently made a record number of cuts to its partner ranks while pausing its tech apprenticeship scheme to protect partner profits.

It is no secret that the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

EY reported last October that its UK net revenue grew by a single-digit percentage over 2024, but fee income remained flat due to a reduction in significant cross-border transactions.

Deloitte UK's revenue increased slightly by over two per cent, but its profit stalled. 

PwC UK reported single-digit growth in revenue, but this came against the backdrop of the group's profit and partner pay dropping again.

In January, KPMG UK revealed it recorded double-digit growth in profit before tax over 2024, but its revenue only increased by one per cent.

James O'Dowd, managing partner at Patrick Morgan, told City AM that “after years of aggressive post-pandemic hiring, [Big Four firms] are now cutting jobs to protect partner profits and rebalance bloated teams.”

He noted that the consulting boom that followed the pandemic has slowed, and these firms now need to correct that over-hiring strategy.

Fiona Czerniawska, CEO of Source Global Research, explained to City AM that the “relentless pace [of growth] slowed, partly due to the unfavourable macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop.”

She added that the “firms have since found themselves with too many and too expensive people”.

In addition, these firms have focused on considerable investments in technology, including AI. 

Czerniawska noted the aim is “firms will be able to grow and deliver more work, without recruiting evermore talent.”

Over 900 roles were made redundant at the UK Big Four firms in 2024, and some 1,800 jobs were cut in 2023.

The latest moves by EY and PwC have piqued a lot of interest as they focus on the senior partnership level.

Partners manage the firm together, but the equity partners are the ones that own and pull their shares out of the profit pool.

O'Dowd explained: “A major source of frustration for high-performing partners has been the burden of carrying dozens of underperforming colleagues who have contributed little revenue over the past years while still drawing from the profit pool.”

“Many top performers feel their compensation is being diluted by those who do not generate revenue or drive growth, making these redundancies a necessary and inevitable step,” he added.

The firms have been trying to fix their career ladders for some time. Senior PwC staff in the UK, who will never make a partner, were offered ‘managing director' roles last year.

The move behind the ‘managing director' role is to keep senior talent engaged without touching the profit pool.

“This is a turning point for the Big Four,” O'Dowd stated, adding, “The old promise—work your way up and become a partner—no longer holds in the same way.”

“With fewer equity seats, alternative career paths emerging, and AI-driven disruption accelerating, the traditional firm structure is under pressure,” he added.

Despite the losses at the Big Four, the consultancy sector is expected to expand this year. 

Tamzen Isacsson, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association (MCA) noted: “We're upbeat about growth prospects this year with forecast increases in revenue of 6.4 per cent in 2025 and 8.7 per cent in 2026, according to our latest independent research“.

“We're seeing much more activity and opportunity in the market than this time last year,” Isacsson added.

However, MCA's report in January 2024 said activity in the sector was predicted to return “to double digits growth in 2025 (11 per cent)”.

AirExplore, a Slovakia-based contract carrier for other airlines, is disengaging from cargo flying because of limited demand for narrowbody freighters and will focus on its passenger business, FreightWaves has learned.

The news follows other recent examples of small or midsize airlines that provide supplemental capacity to network carriers discontinuing or downsizing cargo operations amid a glut of standard-size freighters and stagnant parcel volumes.

AirExplore, a subsidiary of Lithuanian-owned holding company Avia Solutions Group, earlier this month issued a vague statement about changing its approach to cargo operations to align with market conditions. The statement was buried in a news release about airlines securing additional airlift from third-party providers to keep up with travel demand.

The airline is reducing its cargo fleet by two or three aircraft, returning aircraft to lessors and subleasing some units to other carriers because of the slowdown in business, spokesperson Silvije Sileike said in an email message. It continues to seek long-term transportation service agreements for its remaining aircraft.






“We were presuming that the e-commerce and narrow-body freighter market would grow more significantly after Covid, but the situation in the market is not as we expected. Currently, we are optimizing our fleet and focusing on the passenger business,” she explained.

As recently as last month, AirExplore's operating fleet included eight Boeing 737-800 converted freighter aircraft. It added some cargo jets last year and in November earned U.S. approval to begin passenger and cargo operations in U.S. airspace under a conditional foreign carrier permit using large aircraft on charter from other providers. 

Aircraft tracking site Flightradar24 shows only two cargo jets currently in operation – one in Europe and one in Africa. The Planespotters.net database shows three aircraft are in parked status.

Sileike said AirExplore has leased one freighter aircraft to Allied Air Nigeria, which operates for DHL Express in Africa, and another to Ascend Airways Malaysia, a new carrier owned by Avia Solutions Group that expects to begin operations late this year. Air Ascend Malaysia, a business-to-business passenger and cargo airline, is waiting for Malaysian authorities to issue an air operators certificate. 






AirExplore's rethink about air cargo operations is not unique. Sister company SmartLynx Airlines is shelving its fleet of Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters after losing a contract with DHL Express in Europe and having difficulty finding other customers. It too is returning planes to lessors, placing some aircraft with affiliated companies and subleasing to other carriers.

Avia Solutions Group last year shut down Iceland-based Bluebird Nordic, which operated Boeing 737-400 and 737-800 converted freighters, because it couldn't generate enough business during and after the airfreight downturn that lasted until the second half of 2023. The airline, which provided crewed aircraft to DHL, FedEx, UPS and other airlines, returned its fleet to lessors.

Canadian passenger airline WestJet closed its freighter division, which utilized four 737-800s, after one year because it couldn't generate enough business providing scheduled cargo service.





Global Crossing Airlines in Miami last year capped its freighter fleet at four Airbus A321 freighters because of thin business but has recently seen a pickup in demand.

Miami-based Amerijet, which operates larger Boeing 767 converted freighters, cut its fleet in half over the past two years and currently runs about 11 aircraft.

            The entities – including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks – are continuing to operate around the world while network executives contemplate next steps, including potential legal action.
    


            Lisa Curtis, who chairs the board of Radio Free Europe, wrote on LinkedIn that “our pro bono legal team is prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that RFE/RL continues its Congressionally authorized mission.”
    


            The source who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity did not say if or when a formal legal challenge will happen.
    


            In the meantime, the broadcasters are reporting on the uncertainty over their future.
    


            The top story on the English-language edition of Radio Free Asia's website Tuesday morning noted that “Asian dissidents” and activists were voicing “dismay” over the funding freeze.
    


            President Trump signed an executive order on Friday night calling for the dismantling of the US Agency for Global Media and several other federal agencies. The next morning, journalists at the Voice of America were told to stop working immediately, and employees were placed on administrative leave. Some were officially laid off on Sunday while others remain in a holding pattern.
    


            Voice of America's website is now frozen in time, with old articles like “forecasters warn of tornadoes in US in coming days” still on the home page, even though the stories from Saturday are now out of date.
    


            VOA employees work directly for the federal government, which is why Trump loyalist Kari Lake – recently named a senior adviser to the agency – was able to take such dramatic action.
    


            But most of the agency's other networks are structured as nonprofit organizations that are funded through federal grants, and that distance is making a big difference right now.
    


            Lake sent memos to the networks on Saturday telling them that their grants were terminated, effective immediately, and suggesting that any unused funds must be refunded.
    


            For the journalists who work at the networks, and believe in the mission of providing uncensored news coverage to censored parts of the world, the precipitous termination was a gut punch.
    


            But leaders of the networks said reporting and programming would continue for the time being.
    


            As Radio Free Asia noted in one of its stories, “staff at RFA were still working Monday and the Washington-based news organization has yet to announce how the funding freeze would impact operations.”
    


            Executives are trying to preserve what little money is left, the person involved in the matter told CNN, while coming up with a careful response to Lake's memo.
    


            One outstanding question is whether Lake had the authority to order the funding freeze. The memos identified her as “senior advisor to the acting CEO with authorities delegated by acting CEO.”
    


            Another question has to do with the separation of powers. Radio Free Europe's story about the dispute on Monday repeatedly referred to its “Congress-approved funding.” Curtis wrote on LinkedIn that the termination violates the statute that governs Radio Free Europe and “violates Congressional appropriations laws.”
    


            Over the weekend the American Foreign Service Mission, which represents some VOA employees, said that “unilaterally stripping a congressionally established agency of its core functions amounts to an affront to the constitutional balance of powers.”
    


            A USAGM spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            In Washington on Monday State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the rapid dismantling of the agency “a fluid situation.”
    


            People with knowledge of the situation in both Europe and Asia expressed concern that some journalists could be left in harms' way due to the funding freeze.
    


            Specifically, there are Russian-born journalists living in exile in Europe and working for Radio Free Europe who face imprisonment if they return home.
    


            “If they lose their jobs, that could trigger visa expirations, leaving them essentially in legal limbo,” another source told CNN. “Without further support in the countries where they're currently located, they face the risk of being stateless, deportation – things like that are all possibilities.”
    


            “A lot of people who are citizens of authoritarian countries… are extremely worried, because this could leave them very vulnerable” and upend the “safe haven” they had been granted, the source added.
    


            Although European countries could create legal routes for the most vulnerable journalists, nothing has yet been agreed.
    


            A number of European lawmakers and diplomats have rallied around Radio Free Europe since Saturday, with some suggesting that Europe could provide some funding to fill the American void.
    


            In an interview on “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Russian-American journalist Alsu Kermasheva said Radio Free Europe provides audiences in Russia, Iran and other countries with crucial access to information.
    


            Without the networks, there will be an “empty space” in the global media, and “Russia and Chinese propaganda will fill in,” Kermasheva said.
    


            But for the moment, “we are still in business,” she added, encouraging financial and legal support for the embattled broadcaster.

Stranded NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams successfully undocked from the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. Tuesday and began their long-awaited journey back home after more than nine months in space.

Wilmore and Williams are returning home in a SpaceX capsule with fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Alexander Gorbunov. They are expected to splashdown off the Florida coast at 5:57 p.m. on Tuesday.

Hours before their departure from the ISS, President Donald Trump said he had been in contact with NASA's acting administrator, Janet Petro, who is coordinating the mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back home.

"She is coordinating our Team of highly respected Scientists, Space Engineers, and various other ‘geniuses,' who has agreed to let our Astronauts come home long prior to the two week period originally approved by NASA," Trump wrote, in part. "Janet was great. She said, ‘Let's bring them home NOW, Sir!' — And I thanked her."

The president also took a swipe at his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and accused him of "forgetting" about Wilmore and Williams. Trump also spoke about Elon Musk and SpaceX's involvement in the return mission.

"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so," Trump claimed. "They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents."

"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home — Taking off tomorrow, and landing on Wednesday," he continued.

Trump also added that officials will release more information about the astronauts' return in the coming days. 

"Safety always comes first, and maximum standards are being adhered to. But after eight long months for a mission that was supposed to be eight days, IT IS TIME," he concluded. "I look forward to seeing Butch and Suni, and thank you again to NASA and Janet Petro!"

President Donald Trump thanked acting NASA administrator Janet Petro for coordinating the mission to bring stranded NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back home.

Williams and Wilmore had been stranded on the ISS since June of last year. 

Originally planning to only be in space for a week, they patiently waited for a return to Earth after issues forced NASA to bring the Boeing Starliner back empty last summer.

The inaugural 'National Geographic 33' list includes the likes of Don Cheadle, Selena Gomez, Sterlin Harjo, Michelle Yeoh and Jason Momoa.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	When the National Geographic Society published the first issue of its namesake magazine in September of 1888, it was, in the words of the publication, “a very staid affair.” There were no photos (those didn't arrive until 1905), and the articles were more akin to what you might find in a scientific journal than a popular magazine.


	Suffice it to say National Geographic evolved over the years, eventually leaning into photography and exploration, bringing the natural and human world to its readers every week during the heyday of magazines, and then every day amid the digital revolution.

	Now, National Geographic is embarking on what it is calling one of its most ambitious efforts yet: A new multi-platform list to highlight and celebrate 33 individuals (in honor of the 33 founders of the Society) “whose imaginative ideas and unstoppable drive are making the world a better place.” The inaugural National Geographic 33 will be featured in the April issue of the magazine, an interactive digital platform, and in a social video series.

	The inaugural list includes familiar faces to Hollywood, including actors Don Cheadle, Jason Momoa, Michelle Yeoh, Edward Norton, Selena Gomez, musicians Bjork and Arlo Parks, and writer-producers like Adam McKay and Sterlin Harjo, as well as some names that may be less familiar, like climate activist Jennifer Uchendu, endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh, and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard.


	You can see the full list of honorees, as well as video and multimedia content, here.


	“For more than 137 years, National Geographic has been driven by the belief that bold thinking and collective action can change the world. This principle is what inspired National Geographic's 33 founder —committed explorers, scientists and scholars—all those years ago,” said Courteney Monroe, president of National Geographic content, in a statement. “Since then and across all our platforms, National Geographic has believed in the power of visual storytelling to spark curiosity and inspire a deeper connection to our world. The inaugural National Geographic 33 represents an exciting milestone for us, as it embodies the very essence of our brand—sharing the stories of extraordinary individuals whose work is making a meaningful impact in the hope of inspiring others to help shape a better future.”

	











	“With the National Geographic 33, we're honoring a diverse group of changemakers, from all over the world and different walks of life, who aren't just recognizing the urgent challenges of our time, they are taking action to address them,” adds Nathan Lump, senior VP and editor-in-chief of National Geographic. “They all share a deep commitment to shaping a better future, and in shining a light on them and their contributions, we hope to elevate their work and showcase to a wide audience the positive impact they're making.”


National Geographic is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Society, with Disney owning a controlling stake which acquired the brand in its deal with Fox. Disney has incorporated the Nat Geo brand in its TV and streaming services, with a particular focus on documentary series.


	It hired Lump in 2022, with a mandate to harmonize the goals of both Disney and the Society, and to try and bring the media brand into a future less forgiving for traditional magazines.


	It is a strategy that has had some success with other storied publications. Time magazine, after all, has turned its Person of the Year and Time 100 list as bona fide franchises, and has had success pushing into film and TV production. Now National Geographic is betting that it can do the same.


	You can see the launch video for the National Geographic 33, below.

Something went wrong

The FTSE 100 and European stocks ticked upwards on Tuesday, while US stocks retreated, as tensions flare again in the Middle East and traders look to central bank meetings later in the week.

On Tuesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said that more than 400 people were killed overnight in air strikes by Israeli forces.

The strikes end a ceasefire which came into effect on 19 January and after talks to extend the ceasefire failed to reach an agreement.

Commodity-related stocks, oil prices and gold rallied in response.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.2% by the closing bell in London. Among top gainers were miners Antofagasta (ANTO.L) as well as oil major BP (BP.L).

Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.8%, as the country's ZEW economic survey beat expectations.

The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris ticked up 0.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) rose 0.5%.

US stocks fell, as traders look to the two-day Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting, which commences today. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee also meets this week, with announcements on the rate path due on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.7% and 1%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 1.6% lower.

Uncertainty still dogs markets as investors debate whether the sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 into correction territory is over. Many on Wall Street don't think the recent bump in stocks signals a clear bottom, amid concerns that president Donald Trump's trade war will hit already weakening economic growth.

Shares in chipmaker Intel rose 2.2% on Monday, after a near-7% bump on Monday, as Lip-Bu Tan prepares to take on the role of CEO.

The stock surged last week after it was announced that chip industry veteran Tan, who has previous served on Intel's board, was taking the helm. Tan is taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. The duo succeeded former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by Intel's board in late 2024.

Reuters reported on Monday that Tan has considered major changes to Intel's chip manufacturing methods and its AI strategy in a bid to turnaround the struggling technology giant.

At a town hall last week, Tan reportedly told employees that Intel would need to make some "tough decisions".

Last year, Intel posted an annual loss of $19bn, which marked its first since 1986, according to Reuters.

Shares in electric vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) fell 4.8% on Monday, with the stock now down 41% since the start of the year.

Shares have halved in value, as of Monday's closing price of $238, since hitting an all-time high closing price of $479.86 in December on the back of US president Donald Trump's election win.

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has faced increasing backlash over his involvement with the Trump administration, heading up the the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His cost-cutting initiative across federal agencies, seeing mass layoffs, has sparked protests at Tesla dealerships across the US.

Meanwhile, data released last month has shown falling sales in Tesla (TSLA) in Europe, where Musk has also made high-profile inventions in politics.

The Financial Times reported on Tuesday, that short sellers had made $16bn in profit from betting against Tesla (TSLA) shares.

Tesla shares were down nearly 1% in pre-market trading on Monday, which came as Chinese EV maker BYD (002594.SZ) unveiled a new ultra-fast five-minute charging system.

The pound is higher against the dollar in early European trading, touching $1.30, a level it had not breached since November.

The uptick is largely attributed to a weaker dollar, which has come under pressure in recent weeks. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is down almost 6% from a two-year peak set in mid-January amid worries that Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries could push the US economy into a recession.

Volatility around sterling is expected this week, particularly with the Bank of England's upcoming policy meeting on Thursday. Investors will be keenly watching for any indications on interest rates, with expectations that the central bank will keep rates unchanged at 4.5%.

Meanwhile, sterling was lower against the euro (GBPEUR=X) on Tuesday morning, at €1.1870.

Trustpilot is rallying in early trade in London, up around 1% as of the time of writing.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:

Pedro Goncalves writes:

The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.5% on Thursday, as it navigates the fallout from US president Donald Trump's trade war and mixed signals from the UK economy.

Since August last year, the BoE has been gradually reducing borrowing costs, offering some relief to mortgage holders. At its February meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 in favour of a rate cut to 4.5%.

However, governor Andrew Bailey has stressed the importance of a “gradual and careful approach” to further rate cuts.

Markets indicate a 95% chance of a rate hold this month, with a 77% probability of a cut at the MPC's May meeting and a 55.6% likelihood of a reduction in August. This marks a significant shift from January, when traders only expected one rate cut for the year, in February, according to Morningstar.

In a yearly update to the basket of items the Office for National Statistics (ONS) uses to calculate UK price rises, pulled pork, virtual reality headsets and yoga mats have been added to the calculation, while local newspaper adverts and DVD rental prices have been taken out.

The virtual basket contains over 700 carefully selected items representative of the goods and services that consumers typically spend their money on.

The inflation basket is updated once a year by the ONS to take account of the changing tastes and habits of UK consumers and to ensure the official yardstick of the cost of living is as accurate as possible. This year, VR headsets make their way into the basket for the first time.

"As a rapidly emerging technology, we have seen growing expenditure on this item, which is expected to continue," the ONS said.

China announced a plan to "boost consumption" over the weekend. Neil Wilson, analyst at TipRanks, breaks it down:

Nvidia stock futures are currently up around 0.7% ahead of the GTC.

Our US team writes:

Nvidia (NVDA) kicks off its annual GTC conference on March 18 with a keynote by CEO Jensen Huang from the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. The event, which runs through March 21, will feature workshops and training for developers and engineers, panels and discussions related to AI and robotics, and exhibits from companies showing off how they're using Nvidia's products in the real world.

Huang is expected to debut the company's latest flagship AI chip: the Blackwell Ultra. A souped-up version of Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip, Blackwell Ultra should get a performance boost over last year's chip to further speed up training and running AI models.

We should also learn more about Nvidia's next-generation GPU platform, dubbed Rubin, and the successor to its Grace line of CPUs, Vera. The combined superchip will be called Vera Rubin, named for the American astronomer, and will take the place of the current Grace Blackwell superchip at the top of Nvidia's hierarchy of AI processors.

During Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call, Huang teased that he'd also discuss the follow-up to Rubin. Nvidia, like most chip companies, is known for providing a broad look at its roadmap to help customers and developers prepare for their upcoming products.

Gold (GC=F) continues to hover around the $3,000 all-time high. Haven demand continues to be pushed worldwide as market volatility rattles investors. It hit its stride in early trade, eheading 0.7% higher.

Bloomberg reported:

From our US team:

US stock future slide after Wall Street digested a second day of gains and braced for the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting.

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.2%, the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F) slid 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (NQ=F) slumped 0.5%.

On Monday, stocks continued to recover from last week's sell-off, which saw the S&P 500 enter correction territory amid concerns about the US economy's ability to sustain President Donald Trump's trade war.

Wall Street's attention is now turning to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which kicks off on Tuesday. The central bank will announce its next monetary policy decision Wednesday.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank will exercise caution when it comes to rate cuts and seek out more economic data. The Fed is largely expected to hold rates steady this week.

Hello from London. Lucy Harley-McKeown here, ready to bring you the latest business news and updates on what's moving markets.

This morning there'll be UK consumer price updates, as well as new information about what's changed in the way the ONS calculates price rises for goods.

Today will also bring the German ZEW economic survey and data on US housing.

DALLAS — Southwest's iconic blue, red and yellow planes may still be recognizable in the sky after its recent moves — but underneath, the company will operate a lot more like its competition in the skies.

Only time will tell whether that's a good or bad thing.

On March 11, the Dallas-based carrier announced it would do away with its “bags fly free” policy. Alongside other hallmarks of the brand, two free checked bags helped Southwest craft a customer-friendly image for decades. Now that many of those policies are on the chopping block, the airline's offerings are more in line with other carriers.

It remains to be seen whether that will work to Southwest's benefit, but it shows how the company has been forced to juggle the demands of impatient investors, loyal customers and the stark realities of its bottom line.

“Time will tell how consumers view the brand, because it is no longer going to have a real differentiated product,” said Nick Ewen, managing editor at The Points Guy.

“So will it be able to maintain the differentiated feel, the je ne sais quoi, the intangible?”

Southwest is preparing a raft of changes that will be implemented in the near future:

Free bags limited to loyalty program members, Business Select, branded credit cardholders and select others;

Assigned seating;

Premium seating;

International partnership with Icelandair;

Flight credits that only last a year;

New “basic” nonrefundable fare that's ineligible for changes or flight credits;

Reduced loyalty points rates for certain fares; and

First “redeye” flights.

According to an internal memo from Southwest Vice President of Inflight Operations Steve Murtoff viewed by The Dallas Morning News, updated boarding procedures and retrofitted, larger overhead bins are also on the way (though not till 2026) to accommodate a jump in carry-on bags.

“It's undeniable Southwest Airlines is rapidly evolving,” Murtoff said in the memo. “We are in a fight for our future and must quickly adapt to drive our profitability and encourage customer loyalty.”

The scale of Southwest's transformation has been augmented by its speed. The first hint at what was to come came during the company's first-quarter earnings call in 2024.

At the time, CEO Bob Jordan implied the airline was reconsidering its open seating policy. The why wasn't clear then, but the picture has crystalized over time.

June brought the beginning of Southwest's public fight with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, who disclosed an 11% stake in the company in tandem with biting critiques for Southwest's management and finances.

By July, open seating was dead. As Elliott mounted even more pressure, Southwest tried to fight it off. But despite the airline's efforts, Elliott reached the ownership threshold to call meetings in early September.

By the end of the month, Southwest's board of directors was remade to Elliott's liking, and the airline unveiled a “transformational plan” that detailed many of the changes angering customers today.

Jordan has denied that the changes were forced by Elliott, arguing it was “because we owe all of our shareholders better financial performance.” But the investor's influence is hard to ignore.

In a simplified world, Southwest's new policies would boost revenue, while other measures like buyouts and its first-ever layoffs, would cut costs.

However, the industry isn't that simple. For an airline that has always stood out from the crowd — and gained a loyal following because of it — some think these moves risk Southwest losing what helped make it the largest airline by domestic passenger volume in the first place.

Ewen says the task for Southwest will be striking a balance between luring new customers, which could potentially improve financials, and keeping existing customers happy.

But that task has gotten harder.

Southwest joined third-party booking platforms for the first time last year, starting with Google Flights. Analytics from these platforms would eventually get cited by Jordan as a reason for axing “bags fly free” after defending it in September.

These platforms conveniently let customers compare flights, but they also pit airlines against one another. Since Southwest's fare bundled everything and some fares don't bundle anything, it made the company's prices look high by comparison, according to Morningstar Industrials Equity Analyst Nicolas Owens.

That has put Southwest in a pinch, Owens said, as all air carriers fight to increase market share. Surging labor costs have put upwards pressure on fares, while factors such as inflation have made certain customers more sensitive to price.

Other customers, though, have become even more willing to shell out for an elevated experience, increasing demand for premium options.

“Without these options to price discriminate, Southwest just had a blunt instrument trying to pick off these little customer segments,” Owens said. “One size fits all does not work in a more picky product market.”

And Southwest needed to pick up more customer segments. In 2018, Southwest led the industry with 20% of the domestic market. That's now down to 17%, and Delta and American have taken the lead.

Meanwhile, Southwest has remained profitable, but that pot of money has progressively shrunk over the past three years. The airline's stock price has dived nearly 50% since hitting a post-COVID recovery peak of nearly $62 in April 2021.

“I think it's ultimately necessary and probably not surprising in the long run that they would have made some of these changes,” Owens said.

Yet Marbue Brown, author of Blueprint For Customer Obsession, a book that used Southwest as a case study on customer experience, thinks Southwest getting rid of its cherished perks may actually exacerbate financial issues.

“This transformation is going in the wrong direction. That's just my straight-up take,” he said. “I'm just concerned that Southwest is losing its anchor, and once they do, they're also going to lose customers and lose market share.”

The Ship of Theseus thought experiment asks whether an object is the same object if all of the components have been replaced over time. So is Southwest still Southwest if all its distinctive features have been replaced?

In a presentation with J.P. Morgan Chase this past week, Jordan argued the airline is “more than a policy. We're more than the way we paint our aircraft.”

“Southwest is all about very tangible things,” he said, referencing things like its point-to-point network. “But we're also about the intangibles, the best people in the business, the best hospitality in the business. And none of that is going to change.”

Morningstar's Owens largely agreed, and dismissed concerns that policy changes would affect Southwest's unique vibe.

“I think that the idea that Southwest culture somehow permanently goes away ... is overstated,” he said. “I think they still have probably the funnest flight attendants and kind of team spirit that you don't see everywhere.”

The analyst said Southwest did a lot of legwork to rebuild trust after its 2022 holiday meltdown, simply by getting passengers from Point A to Point B more efficiently. Part of that credit belongs to having good workers.

“They definitely pick people of a certain personality to deliver a certain kind of experience. And to that extent, they will probably still have some uniqueness to them,” said Brown.

“But if the policies are not supportive of the people, if the whole fly-feel doesn't work together, you're not going to get Herb Kelleher's Southwest Airlines,” he said.

While each change can, in a vacuum, improve financials, and Southwest can do its best to keep that quirky culture, airlines are a complicated web of real people and logistics.

Brown pointed out that baggage fees means more carry-ons, which means less available overhead space and more gate-checked bags. That makes boarding more stressful and potentially frustrating.

The best flight attendants can't make more overhead space appear or make oversized backpacks fit in the bag sizer. Over time, that unique vibe begins to fade.

“As they make this tweak here, and they make this tweak there, there are dominoes that are falling,” Brown said.

“As these dominoes fall, I think what you will wind up seeing is that, the more they look like other companies, then some of the other companies that do well from a customer experience perspective might surface as legit competitors to them.”
