Prices in the UK rose by 3% in the 12 months to January, well above the Bank of England's target.

The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and has cut three times since August 2024.

Announcing the latest cut, the Bank warned that it expected inflation to rise again in 2025. 

Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time.

For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. 

The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with virtual reality headsets and yoga mats added in 2025, and local newspaper adverts removed.

The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation.

The main inflation measure is called the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), external, and the latest figure is published every month.

CPI was 3% in the year to January 2025,up from 2.5% in the 12 months to December. It means that consumer prices rose at the fastest rate for 10 months.

This was largely as a result of rising food prices, VAT on private school fees and airfares failing to fall by as much as usual. 

Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.

However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.

Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. 

It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.

When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. 

The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.

In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.

But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.

For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. 

Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. 

The Bank of England cut rates to 5% in August 2024, to 4.75% in November and again to 4.5% in February.

The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. 

Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. 

This was 3.7% in January, up from 3.2% in December 2024.

After the October Budget, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - including an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers - would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices.

In February, governor Andrew Bailey warned that the Bank's approach to future cuts would be ""gradual and careful"" because of increased economic uncertainty. 

The Bank expects inflation to spike at 3.7% between July and September 2025 due to higher energy prices, water bills and bus fares.

It then thinks inflation will drop back towards the 2% target towards the end of 2027, having previously predicted this would happen earlier in the year. 

The next interest rate announcement is on Thursday 20 March. 

The following Wednesday, 26 March, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her plans for the UK economy. 

Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper?

What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?

The latest official figures, external show that regular pay grew by more than inflation between October and December 2024.

Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.9%, up from 5.6% between September and November. 

After taking CPI into account, wages grew by 3.4%. 

Private sector earnings increased by more than public sector pay.

The US and EU countries have also been trying to limit price increases. 

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.5% in January 2025, up from 2.4% in December. 

In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%, the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates a further five times, taking its key rate to 2.5%.

Inflation in the US fell to 2.8% in February, which was down from 3% the previous month but still above the US central bank's 2% target. 

After a string of cuts in the latter part of 2024, the US Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its first 2025 meeting in January.

The Fed also signalled it was not likely to change rates in the near future as it waits to see the impact of US President Donald Trump's economic policies.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announces changes to the welfare system aimed at saving £5bn by the end of 2030 - BBC Verify has taken a look at this number

Personal Independence Payments (Pip): Eligibility for the main disability benefit will be narrowed

Changes to Pip are likely to be the most politically controversial element of today's announcements, our political correspondent Henry Zeffman writes

Universal credit: The measure used to determine if someone is able to work will be scrapped in 2028 and will instead be assessed through Pip

Edited by Emily Atkinson and Barbara Tasch

We've spent today covering the announcement of plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed at cutting the growing amount the UK spends on welfare.

Here's a quick look at six key proposals we heard of today:

The Scottish government says Liz Kendall's announcements are “devastating for disabled people”.

Scotland's Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville tells BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime: “I know the announcement has been made, but I would strongly, strongly urge the UK government to reconsider.”

She says the reaction from disabled people shows the “strength of anger, real concern and desperate worry” put on some of the most vulnerable in our society.

“That surely can't be what a Labour government are supposed to be doing to some of our most vulnerable.

“They have got this wrong, they need to reflect on that, reflect on it quickly and this is one of those times when the UK government needs to develop a conscience and actually respond to what disabled people are saying to them.”

Chris Mason now puts it to Liz Kendall that the benefits bill is still going up and would continue to do so with these planned reforms in place.

Kendall accepts spending will rise, but she says the way to put welfare on a more ""sustainable footing"" is by getting people into work. 

""That is what we have failed to do for years and years,"" she says.

Watch more below as our political editor asks Kendall if the changes announced this afternoon are sustainable - both for the national finances and for recipients.

Liz Kendall: There is a Labour case for welfare reform

Asked by Chris Mason if she didn't go further with her reforms because of ""jitters within her own party"", the work and pensions secretary says Labour wants to ""fix a failing system."" 

""My starting point is not how far or how tough the government is, my starting point is how do we get a system that works for people who depend on it and works for taxpayers in the country as a whole.""

Our political editor, Chris Mason, now puts it to Kendall that she should talk to people with disabilities or health conditions who cannot do daily tasks and say they deserve less money.

""That is not what we're saying,"" the work and pensions secretary replies, adding that changes are ""not coming in overnight"".

Benefits for people with severe disabilities ""who will never work"" will be protected, Kendall adds.

She says new claimants will have their cases assessed based on specific individual needs from 2026.

Over now to the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, who's been speaking to Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall after she unveiled the government's reforms to welfare.

He starts by asking her how many current benefits claimants would get less money under the changes.

Kendall does not answer the question directly, saying the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will come forward with an estimate by the Spring Statement.  

Asked why the government won't publish its assessment of the figure now, Kendall says it's because they wanted to publish their Green Paper before the Spring Statement.

Tom EspinerBusiness reporter

The government's reforms are the biggest welfare cut since 2015, and tilt the welfare system away from disabled people to the unemployed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says.

For decades the UK incapacity benefit - now paid through Universal Credit - has been separated from payments for higher living costs from a disability, which are paid through Personal Independence Payment (Pip).

From 2028-2029, they will be amalgamated - meaning there will be no support specifically for disabilities that
prevent work. This will leave 600,000 people worse off by £2,400, it says.

Furthermore, 2.4 million families that get incapacity benefit will get £280 less a year in 2029-2030 - but 4.5 million other families on universal credit will get £150 more a year.

Those who continue to get Pip will also be able to claim incapacity benefit - which is an extra £2,400.

The IFS says ""there's
a clear risk here"". It will weaken the incentives for people who can work to do so, while targeting stronger
incentives and employment support at those who may not be able to work.

It's unclear how much tightening the Pip eligibility criteria will save the government because claimants are incentivised to approach the assessment differently.

""Previous
governments attempting similar reforms have found that they have saved much
less than hoped,"" the IFS says.

Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent

This is a complex set of proposals, but the response from charities representing benefit claimants is quite simple to summarise.

In short, they say there is some good in here  - specifically the “right to try” plan of allowing people to have a go at returning to work without putting their benefit entitlement at risk.

But this is trumped by their concern about the £5bn-a-year cuts, which they say will create greater hardship for a group of people already struggling to make ends meet.

Thomas Lawson, chief executive of the anti-poverty charity Turn2us, says: “The cuts will harm more people than they help.”

Eleanor LawrieSocial affairs reporter

In her speech, Liz Kendall suggested
the number of people reporting a mental health condition had risen 190%. 

More
than half of the rise in working age people claiming disability benefits since
the pandemic stems from claims relating to mental health or behavioural
conditions, according
to think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), external. 

About 1.3 million people - or 44% - of all claimants are
claiming disability benefit primarily for one of these conditions, the IFS
says, while 86% report having a mental health condition.

Why has there been such a big increase? 

According to the
Labour Force Survey, the number of people who report having a long term mental
health condition has increased from about 8% a decade ago to over 14% last
year. 

Deaths of despair - those from suicide, drug and alcohol
poisoning and alcohol-related conditions - have also been steadily rising. 

Douglas FraserBusiness and economy editor, BBC Scotland

In trying to balance reform with savings, one casualty
of Liz Kendall's plans has been the opportunity to simplify.

Navigating through the system was already complex.

Now, with Personal Independence Payments (Pip) being replaced in
Scotland by an Adult Disability Payment, the thresholds to qualify look set to
diverge, and likewise the case review process.

Holyrood has been using its limited devolved powers over
welfare benefits to design a system with ""dignity, respect and
fairness"" at its heart. 

Yet it looks like a Scottish government
official will be applying the toughened rules for the non-devolved Universal
Credit.

Employability support is partly devolved. With more
requirements from Whitehall for engagement, a Scot with ""risk of long-term
unemployment"" may be handled differently in a Holyrood-backed programme
compared with a work search interview required of GB claimants to qualify for
Universal Credit.

Liz Kendall's plan merely acknowledges, and repeats, that
there will have to be discussions with the Scottish government. 

But as
her plan implies big cuts to the Treasury block grant to Holyrood, such
discussions are unlikely to start with much warmth or goodwill.

Gareth LewisPolitical editor, BBC Wales

Changes to welfare could have a disproportionate impact in
Wales, where places like Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil have some of the
highest health-related claim rates in England and Wales.

During today's First Minister's Questions, the leader of
Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, invited the FM, Eluned Morgan, to condemn the
changes.

She stopped short, saying that reform was needed, but
admitted not only that she had concerns, but also that she had called Downing
Street last week and had written to Liz Kendall about them.   

She told the Senedd that “some” of the points were taken on
board, which suggests that not all of them were.

The political stakes are high – the next Senedd election is
just over a year away, and both Labour and Plaid are trying to convince voters
that they offer the best option for Wales.

Michael BuchananSocial affairs correspondent

My inbox is full of responses to the government's
announcement, virtually all of them opposed to the plans. 

The changes
will “shame” the government, said one charity. A lack of moral choices, said
another. A third expects the cuts to push more people towards food
banks. 

Many of those charities, it must be said, were already unhappy
after the government cut the winter fuel allowance last year, a change
ministers applied knowing it would push tens of thousands of pensioners into
poverty.

Few organisations argue with providing more opportunities
for people to move into work, with appropriate support, and the government's
recent rhetoric about making job centres places where people find work rather
than a place to comply with benefit rules has been welcomed. 

But the Treasury's insistence on immediate cuts means that
most anti-poverty campaigners see these reforms as simply a dash to save
cash.  

A number of Labour MPs expressed disquiet in the Commons after the work and pensions secretary outlined her plans. 

Here's whip-around of what some of the more sceptical Labour MPs had to say: 

We've had a lot of technical detail on the government's plans to reform welfare. 

If you're looking for a quick overview, our chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman's got you covered:

Faisal IslamEconomics editor

There's something a little odd about the fact we are getting no breakdown of which of these welfare policies is generating the £5bn per year cash saving by 2029/30. 

Liz Kendall suggested that the final costing was still to be done ahead of the Spring Statement next week, by the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

But the government will already have a clear idea of how many people are affected, and by how much, and many are concerned right now.

The bottom line is that you cannot generate £5bn in savings without hundreds of thousands of people losing thousands of pounds.

While in the universal credit savings, much of the impact is generated by changes for future claimants, raising the eligibility age to 22 and halving the health payment, this does not appear to be the case for Personal Independence Payments (Pip).

Pip payments are determined by a questionnaire about daily life. Claimants will no longer be eligible unless they score four points, indicating a more severe disability in one area. (Our head of statistics, Robert Cuffe, explained how this would work in our previous post).

The bottom line here is that a pattern of recent mental health claims has been based on a range of less severe issues. 

The changes announced today aim to take Pip payments away from such people from November 2026. The government knows how many, and who they are. 

For now, until the Spring Statement next week, we can deduce that there are hundreds of thousands who will lose their entire £70 a week or £3,500 a year payment.

Robert CuffeHead of statistics

Pip assessments involve questions about parts of your daily life - like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed or communicating and reading. 

Each are scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.

Your payment depends on the total score across all areas. 

The proposed change is that people will need to score at least four on one item, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of activities. 

For example, needing an aid or appliance to speak or hear counts as two points, while needing support to express or understand complex verbal information counts as four points. 

And needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has announced a number of changes to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) - a key disability benefit paid to people in England and Wales.

So what were they?

By Anthony Reuben

The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, said that the package of measures announced today would save £5bn a year in 2029-30.

 That figure is not mentioned in the document the government published today., external

When the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) made its last set of forecasts in October it estimated that benefits for working age adults would rise from £48.5bn in 2023-24 to £75.7bn in 2029-30.

 A £5bn saving would be less than one fifth of that predicted rise.

 When asked for more details of the costings, Kendall said that we would have to wait for final costings from the OBR during the Spring Statement next week.

Dharshini DavidChief economics correspondent

Today's statement will be worrying for the three million working-age people who receive Personal Independence Payment (Pip). 

But with the number of recipients set to rise to over four million by 2030, adding an extra £12bn to welfare spending, the government's clear on the need to curb ballooning costs. 

And with only 3% of people who are classed as long-term sick returning to employment, this is an area where attention is clearly needed. 

But it is unclear how successful these measures will be in either aim. 

We won't know exactly how much the government hopes each of these measures will save - or the assessment of the independent official forecasters, the OBR, of those estimates until the chancellor's Spring Statement next week. And any estimates are just that - highly uncertain. 

Prior attempts to trim welfare bills have proved tricky for many reasons. 

And that includes the state of the labour market. To get people into work, there have to be jobs. 

As it stands, a recent survey by official statisticians found that one in four medium and large employers were planning to cut jobs - many cited the impact government policies such as the rise in employers NICS and increase in employee rights. 

Some, including the Bank of England, are predicting unemployment to rise and its likely to be lower paid posts that are hardest hit. You may want a job - but finding it may be getting harder

Prime Minister Keir Starmer was sitting behind Liz Kendall in the Commons as she delivered her statement.

He's just now posted on X: ""When I talk about opportunity for all, I mean it.""

""This government will always protect the most severely disabled people to live with dignity,"" he adds.

""But we're not prepared to stand back and do nothing while millions of people — especially young people — who have potential to work and live independent lives, instead become trapped out of work and abandoned by the system. 

""It would be morally bankrupt to let their life chances waste away.""

China is expected to reshape its Arctic policy, backtracking on its ambition to become a major polar power by 2030, the South China Morning Post has reported, citing insiders. The shift comes amid intensified scrutiny from Arctic nations and the potential for US-Russia cooperation in the region. 

Beijing first outlined its vision for a ‘Polar Silk Road' in a 2018 white paper, positioning it as an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative. The plan implied increased access to the Arctic's abundant natural resources and an expanded role in the region's governance, the SCMP reported on Sunday.

However, China's self-designation as a “near-Arctic state” – despite being 1,400km (870 miles) south of the Arctic Circle with no territorial claims in the region – faced pushback from Arctic nations, including Russia, which controls over half of the region's coastline and has long prioritized protecting its sovereignty, the article claimed.

“The Chinese interest was really first announced quite aggressively in the white paper [with] the term near-Arctic state that everybody seems to have had problems with,” the insider told the SCMP. China has since dropped the term, and there appears to be a retreat or a significantly reduced interest in the Arctic, the source added.

Beijing has reportedly shifted its focus on the development of heavy icebreakers and conducting polar research while downplaying its broader ambitions.

The development comes as the US and Russia have held discussions on potential economic cooperation in the Arctic as part of recent bilateral contacts.

Other observers note that Beijing's continued push for building heavy icebreakers indicates that its interest in the Arctic has not declined.

“I believe China is still very interested in many of the opportunities that exist to become more involved in Arctic science and commerce,” Duncan Depledge, an Arctic expert and lecturer in geopolitics and security at the UK's Loughborough University, told the outlet.

China's deepening partnership with Russia, reinforced by shared rivalry with the US over the past few years, led to a “no-limits” partnership with Moscow, the report said.

However, US President Donald Trump's shift on Ukraine, pushing for a ceasefire and restoring ties with Moscow, has created uncertainty for Beijing, according to Depledge. Trump has shown interest in the Arctic, and a potential US-Russia deal on regional cooperation could follow negotiations on Ukraine.

China is likely to face challenges, especially if Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin strike an Arctic deal, according to Depledge. In such a scenario, Russia would have to decide whether to align with China, cooperate with Trump, or maintain a balance between the two, the expert added.

Russia “has not lost hope” in a possible ceasefire and resolution of the Ukraine conflict despite Kiev's stepped up attacks on Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov has said.

Speaking to Kommersant on Tuesday ahead of a planned phone conversation between Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, Ushakov said that Moscow is “grasping at every opportunity” for a swift settlement. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin and Trump are scheduled to talk on March 18, their second telephone call since the US president's inauguration in January.

Trump has said that he will discuss control over territory and “dividing up certain assets” with Putin on Tuesday. They are also expected to discuss the 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US.

“A week has already passed since Trump's proposal [for a 30-day truce]. And what do we see? The most powerful drone attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory in history. And then another attack,” Ushakov stated. “But we have not lost hope. We are grasping at every opportunity. But they need to talk to each other.”

The March 11 kamikaze drone attack referenced by Ushakov was the largest ever by Kiev. It targeted multiple regions, including Moscow, and resulted in 11 civilian deaths and multiple injuries.

Moscow has strongly condemned such “barbaric” attacks involving hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some reportedly loaded with shrapnel to maximize casualties. The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the assault was planned in advance and timed to coincide with the US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia on resolving the conflict.

At the Jeddah negotiations last week, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire. Shortly afterward, Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Moscow to present Putin the details of the proposal.

The Russian president has endorsed the ceasefire in principle but insisted on resolving several issues before it can go into effect, including the fate of Ukrainian forces currently encircled in Russia's Kursk Region.

Although the details of Witkoff's meeting with Putin have not been undisclosed, Trump has suggested progress was made, stating that the White House received “some pretty good news” on the ceasefire plan and that recent US-Russia discussions had been “very productive.”

The Kazakh government is planning to audit all programs being implemented in the Central Asian nation under the auspices of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), local media outlet Orda.kz has reported.

Washington's primary agency for funding political projects abroad found itself in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump shortly after he assumed office in January. The new administration imposed a 90-day funding freeze on USAID pending a review, citing concerns of corruption and inefficiency.

In an article on Tuesday, Orda.kz, citing Economy Minister Serik Zhumangarin's response to a parliamentary inquiry, claimed that a special working group was set up within Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry last year, which is tasked with scrutinizing USAID's activities in the country.

The publication quoted the official as clarifying that a “detailed analysis of funded projects and programs will be conducted, including an assessment of their alignment with stated goals and actual results.”

Moreover, the US agency's “relationships with other organizations, including governmental and non-governmental” as well as its financial flows will reportedly be put under the auditors' microscope to check for “possible cover-up schemes, inconsistencies in spending, and conflicts of interest.”

According to the Kazakh Foreign Ministry, throughout 2024, USAID had 28 long-term programs running in the country, encompassing the economy, energy, healthcare, civil society, and media sectors. The activities of some of those extended beyond Kazakhstan, targeting the broader Central Asian region.

The total funding allocated for Kazakhstan in 2023–2024 stood at $26.5 million.

Last month, the Indian Express reported that USAID's allocation of $21 million, which had been frozen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and was presumably meant to foster “voter turnout in India,” was earmarked for neighboring Bangladesh.

Last August, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to step down following massive student-led protests.

In an interview with Tucker Carlson in February, Mike Benz, a former State Department official, alleged that USAID had funded last year's regime change in the South Asian nation because of Hasina's opposition to a US military base in the region. The US Department of State previously dismissed similar claims made by the deposed prime minister as “laughable.”

Amid reports of USAID's involvement in India's political processes, the Foreign Ministry in New Delhi stated that authorities were looking into the “deeply troubling” information.

The militaries of Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania have called on their governments to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty, an international agreement which bans the use of anti-personnel landmines, claiming an increased military threat from Russia requires it.

In a joint statement on Tuesday, the defense ministries of the four NATO members bordering Russia expressed a need for “flexibility and freedom of choice to potentially use new weapons systems and solutions.”

Drafted in 1997, the Ottawa Treaty aimed to eradicate landmines due to their long-term risk to civilians. Notably, several significant powers are not parties, including China, Russia, and the United States.

The joint declaration asserted that “despite withdrawing, [the four nations] will remain committed to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians during armed conflict.”

Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia contend they face the risk of an attack by Russia. In May, Warsaw initiated the extensive 10 billion zloty ($2.6 billion) ‘Eastern Shield' project to beef up its borders, with senior Polish officials indicating that anti-personnel landmines could play a critical role.

Last year, General Janne Jaakkola, Finland's defense chief, suggested withdrawing from the Ottawa Treaty, saying that anti-personnel mines would be effective against Russian ground forces. The Nordic country, which also borders Russia, joined NATO in 2023, asserting it needed the protection of the US-led military bloc.

Ukraine, while technically a signatory of the convention, has effectively suspended its participation since 2014. The administration of President Joe Biden authorized the delivery of landmines to Ukraine. Biden officials argued that the weapons would help Kiev slow Russian advances.

Russia has consistently denied having any aggressive intentions towards NATO and insists that the Ukraine conflict was caused by the bloc's expansion towards its borders.

Israel has resumed airstrikes in Gaza following the collapse of talks with Hamas over the release of the remaining hostages and the implementation of the ceasefire.

In a statement in the early hours of Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were “conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the strikes are a response to “Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators.”

“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” the prime minister's office said.

More than 200 have been killed in the strip since hostilities resumed, Al Jazeera reported, citing authorities in Hamas-run Gaza. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported strikes in the central and southern parts of the densely populated enclave.

Reuters quoted a senior Hamas official as saying that Israel has “unilaterally” ended the ceasefire brokered by the US and Arab states. Under the deal that came into effect on January 19, Hamas handed over 25 hostages and the bodies of eight captives in exchange for the release of around 1,500 Palestinians from Israeli prisons, according to AP.

Israel and Hamas have been unable to agree on next steps since the first phase of the truce expired on March 1. The Israeli government accused Hamas of “manipulation and psychological warfare,” and blamed the militant group for the rejection of the plan presented last week by American envoy Steve Witkoff.

Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua told Reuters earlier this month that the group was working with the mediators to “compel” Israel to implement the next phases of the ceasefire.

The wave of Israeli strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday was the culmination of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to get out of the ceasefire with Hamas that he agreed to in January.



Since the start of the war, Netanyahu has faced dueling, possibly incompatible pressures: Families of the hostages want him to cut a deal with Hamas to free them, while his far-right coalition partners want to continue the war with the aim of annihilating the militant group.

On Tuesday, he appeared to cast his lot with the latter — and U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has backed Netanyahu's decision to unilaterally walk away from the ceasefire it took credit for brokering.






Both Israel and the United States blame the renewed hostilities on Hamas' refusal to release more hostages before negotiations on ending the war proceed — which was not part of the ceasefire agreement. Israel has accused Hamas of preparing for new attacks, without providing evidence. The militant group has denied those allegations.



Hamas — which has yet to respond militarily to the Israeli strikes — has spent weeks calling for serious talks on the ceasefire agreement's second phase, which calls for the release of the remaining living hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.



Those talks were supposed to begin in early February. Now they may never happen.

The agreement reached in January, under pressure from the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump one, called for a phased ceasefire aimed at freeing all the hostages abducted in Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, attack and ending the war it caused.



Under the first phase, which ran from Jan. 19 to March 1, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in return for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remained of their homes, and there was a surge of humanitarian aid.



Each side accused the other of violations, and Israeli strikes killed dozens of Palestinians the military accused of engaging in militant activities or entering no-go zones. But the truce held.



Still, the second phase was always seen as far more difficult. 



Through months of negotiations, Netanyahu had repeatedly cast doubt on it, insisting Israel was committed to returning all the hostages and destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities — two war goals that many believe are irreconcilable.



In a TV interview last June, Netanyahu cast doubt on the possibility of a lasting ceasefire before Hamas is destroyed. “We are committed to continuing the war after a pause, in order to complete the goal of eliminating Hamas. I'm not willing to give up on that,” he said.



On Jan. 18, the eve of the ceasefire, he said “we reserve the right to return to war if necessary with the backing of the United States.”

Agreeing to a permanent ceasefire would almost certainly plunge Netanyahu into a political crisis that could end his nearly uninterrupted 15-year rule.



Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had threatened to leave the coalition if Netanyahu progressed to Phase 2 instead of restarting the offensive. Opposition parties have promised to support him in any agreement that brings back hostages, but his coalition would still be severely weakened, making early elections likely.



By resuming the fighting, Netanyahu ensured Smotrich's continued support. After the strikes, the Israeli leader regained another far-right partner, Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose party had bolted in January over the ceasefire but returned to the coalition Tuesday.

Beyond the political jockeying, Netanyahu's stated goal of annihilating Hamas would have almost certainly eluded him had he stuck with the ceasefire agreement.



Hamas survived 15 months of Israeli bombardment and ground operations that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of Gaza. When the truce took hold, the militant group immediately reasserted its rule.



There's no agreement on who should govern Gaza after the war, and even if the Western-backed Palestinian Authority were granted nominal control, Hamas would have strong influence on the ground and could rebuild its military capabilities.



For many Israelis, especially Netanyahu's hawkish base and far-right allies, that would look like defeat. It would add to the criticism he already faces over security failures surrounding the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.

After the first phase ended, Netanyahu said Israel had agreed to what he described as a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a seven-week extension of the truce and a vague promise to launch negotiations over a lasting ceasefire.



Hamas refused, pointing out that the new proposal was different from the one they had agreed to in January and again called for the immediate launch of talks on Phase 2. 



It even offered to return an America-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages to get the talks back on track, an offer dismissed as “psychological warfare” by Israel. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while making “entirely impractical” demands.



In an attempt to impose the new arrangement on Hamas, Israel halted the import of all food, fuel and other humanitarian aid to Gaza. It later cut off electricity, affecting a vital desalination plant. Israel also said it would not withdraw from a strategic corridor on Gaza's border with Egypt, as stipulated in the agreement.



In recent days, Israel stepped up strikes across Gaza, targeting people it said were planting explosives or engaging in other militant activities. On Tuesday, at around 2 a.m., it launched one of the deadliest waves of strikes since the start of the war.

Trump took credit for brokering the ceasefire in January, but since then has appeared to sour on it. He has warned that “all hell” will break loose if Hamas does not immediately release the hostages, while saying that's a decision for Israel to make.



Trump has also proposed that Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians be permanently relocated so the U.S. can take ownership of Gaza and develop it as a tourist destination. Netanyahu has embraced the plan, which has been universally condemned by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who say it would violate international law.



The White House said it was consulted ahead of Tuesday's strikes and supported Israel's decision.

Russia's seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine exactly 11 years ago on March 18, 2014, was quick and bloodless, but it sent Moscow's relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War.



It also paved the way for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, during which Moscow annexed more land from the war-torn country. 



A look at the diamond-shaped peninsula in the Black Sea. coveted by both Russia and Ukraine for its naval bases and beaches:

Crimea's unique location makes it a strategically important asset, and Russia has spent centuries fighting for it.



Crimea was home to Turkic-speaking Tatars when the Russian empire first annexed it in the 18th century. It briefly regained independence as a Tatar republic two centuries later before being swallowed by the Soviet Union.



In 1944, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin deported nearly 200,000 Tatars, or about a third of Crimea's population, to Central Asia, 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) to the east. Stalin had accused them of collaborating with Nazi Germany — a claim widely dismissed by historians. An estimated half of them died in the next 18 months of hunger and harsh conditions.







Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the peninsula from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, the peninsula became part of newly independent Ukraine.



Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it.






Sevastopol also was a preferred holiday destination for Nicholas II, the last Russian czar. The southern town of Yalta was a prime holiday destination in Soviet times, with many sanatoriums there. It drew worldwide renown when Stalin, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met there in 1945 to discuss the fate of Germany and Europe after World War II.

For Kyiv, Crimea had been a strategic asset, too. By the time Russia annexed it in 2014, it had been a part of Ukraine for 60 years and had become part of the country's identity. 



Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine, said Kyiv had invested some $100 billion into the peninsula between 1991 and 2014.



From a security perspective, Ukraine needs Crimea in order to have control over activities in the Black Sea.

In 2014, a massive popular uprising in Ukraine forced pro-Moscow President Victor Yanukovich from office. 



Putin responded by sending troops to overrun Crimea -– they initially appeared on the peninsula in uniforms without insignia -– and calling a plebiscite on joining Russia, which Ukraine and the West dismissed as illegal.



Russia's annexation of Crimea was recognized internationally only by countries such as North Korea and Sudan. In Russia, it touched off a wave of patriotism, and “Krym nash!” -– or “Crimea is ours!” -– became a rallying cry. 



This move sent Putin's popularity soaring. His approval rating, which had declined to 65% in January 2014, shot to 86% in June, according to the Levada Center, an independent Russian pollster.

Putin has called Crimea “a sacred place,” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine. Repressions against the Crimean Tatars continued under Putin, despite Moscow's denials of discrimination. They strongly opposed the annexation, and an estimated 30,000 of them fled the peninsula between 2014 and 2021. 



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to retake it and said that Russia “won't be able to steal” the peninsula. 



Russia's relations with the West plummeted to new lows. The United States, the European Union and other countries imposed sanctions on Moscow and its officials. 



Weeks after the annexation, fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine between pro-Kremlin militias and Kyiv's forces. Moscow threw its weight behind the insurgents, even though the Kremlin denied supporting them with troops and weapons. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court's finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard.



Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles.



The fighting in eastern Ukraine continued, on and off, until February 2022, when Putin recognized the two war-torn Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states and several days later launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In its assault on Ukraine, Moscow deployed troops and weapons to Crimea, allowing Russian forces to quickly seize large parts of southern Ukraine in the first weeks of the war.



A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin insisted on calling its “special military operation” in Ukraine. 



Before the invasion, Zelenskyy focused on diplomatic efforts to get Crimea back, but after Russian troops rolled across the border, Kyiv started publicly contemplating retaking the peninsula by force.



The peninsula soon became a battleground, with Ukraine launching drone attacks and bombing it to try to dislodge Moscow's hold on the territory. 



The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin's prized asset -– the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022 and again in July 2023.

Military personnel search for Sudiksha Konanki, a university student from the U.S. who disappeared on a beach in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, Monday, March. 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Francesco Spotorno, File)

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The parents of a U.S. college student who vanished almost two weeks ago in the resort town of Punta Cana have asked authorities to declare her legally dead.

In a letter to Dominican police dated Monday, Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki state that after an extensive search, local authorities believe that Sudiksha, a 20-year-old student at the University of Pittsburgh, drowned.

“Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” they wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.”

A police official not authorized to speak about the case confirmed Tuesday that authorities received the letter.

Michael Chapman, sheriff of Loudoun County in Virginia, where the Konankis live, said in a statement Tuesday that officials have been working with Dominican authorities and continue to review evidence in the case. 

“The disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki is tragic, and we cannot imagine the grief her family has been feeling,” he said. “Sudiksha's family has expressed their belief that she drowned. While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible.”

Sudiksha Konanki and five female friends had traveled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break. Police said she disappeared at a beach by her hotel before dawn on March 6.




Authorities have interviewed people who were with Konanki before she vanished, including Joshua Riibe, a senior at St. Cloud University in Minnesota.

Riibe has been detained by Dominican police and is believed to be the last person to see Konanki. He has not been named as a suspect.

He is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday afternoon following a request from his attorney that he be released.

According to the transcript of an interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media as well as NBC and Telemundo, Riibe told police he was drinking with Konanki on the beach and they were kissing in the ocean when they got caught in a current. Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and helped bring her ashore.

He told investigators he vomited upon reaching the beach and that Konanki said she was going to fetch her things. When he looked up, she was gone. He said he was later surprised to hear of her disappearance.

In their letter, the Konankis wrote that “the individual” last seen with their daughter is cooperating and that no evidence of foul play has been found.

Sudiksha Konanki was born in India and later became a U.S. permanent resident.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A new anti-LGBTQ+ law passed in Hungary on Tuesday bans Pride events and allows authorities to use facial recognition software to identify those attending the festivities, leading to a large demonstration on the streets of Budapest.



More than 1,000 protesters gathered hours after the vote outside Hungary's parliament in opposition to the measures. Chanting anti-government slogans, they then marched to the Margaret Bridge over the Danube and blocked traffic, drawing a big police presence.



The move by Hungarian lawmakers is part of a crackdown on the country's LGBTQ+ community by the nationalist conservative party of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.



The measure in Hungary, reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia, passed in a 136-27 vote. The law, supported by Orbán's Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted on Monday.

The bill amends Hungary's law on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under 18.



Attending a prohibited event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state must forward to “child protection,” according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event.











As the vote was held in Hungary's parliament in Budapest, opposition lawmakers ignited smoke bombs in the chamber, filling it with thick plumes of colorful smoke. The opposition Momentum party called for a protest outside Hungary's parliament later in the day. 



In a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organizers said the aim of the law was to “scapegoat” the LGBTQ+ community in order to silence voices critical of Orbán's government.



“This is not child protection, this is fascism,” wrote the organizers of the event, which attracts thousands each year and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.



Following the law's passage Tuesday, Budapest Pride spokesperson Jojó Majercsik told The Associated Press that despite Orbán's yearslong effort to stigmatize LGBTQ+ people, the organization had received an outpouring of support since the Hungarian leader hinted in February that his government would take steps to ban the event.



“Many, many people have been mobilized,” Majercsik said. “It's a new thing, compared to the attacks of the last years, that we've received many messages and comments from people saying, ‘Until now I haven't gone to Pride, I didn't care about it, but this year I'll be there and I'll bring my family.'” 







The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.



In 2022, the European Union's executive commission filed a case with the EU's highest court against Hungary's 2021 child protection law. The European Commission argued that the law “discriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.”



Hungary's “child protection” law — aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors, including in television, films, advertisements and literature — also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth.”



Booksellers in Hungary have faced hefty fines for failing to wrap books that contain LGBTQ+ themes in closed packaging. Critics have argued Orbán's campaign amounts to an attempt to cut LGBTQ+ visibility, and that by tying it to child protection, it falsely conflates homosexuality with pedophilia. 



Hungary's government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls “gender madness,” and argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.”







Hungary's methods resemble tactics by Putin, who in December 2022 expanded Russia's ban on “propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations” from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities.



Orbán, in power since 2010, faces an unprecedented challenge from a rising opposition party as Hungary's economy struggles to emerge from an inflation and cost of living crisis and an election approaches in 2026. 



Tamás Dombos, a project coordinator at Hungarian LGBTQ+ rights group Háttér Society, said that Orbán's assault on minorities was a tactic to distract voters from more important issues facing the country, and that allowing the use of facial recognition software at prohibited demonstrations could be used against other protests the government chooses to deem unlawful. 



“It's a very common strategy of authoritarian governments not to talk about the real issues that people are affected by: the inflation, the economy, the terrible condition of education and health care,” Dombos said.



Orbán, he continued, “has been here with us for 15 years lying into people's faces, letting the country rot basically, and then coming up with these hate campaigns.”



Aside from Budapest Pride, another event in the southern Hungarian city of Pécs has also been held in recent years. Budapest Pride is marking its 30th anniversary this year, and is scheduled to take place on June 28.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.

The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.

The email pleaded for help.

“His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the email said, according to The Sunday Times. “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.

South Africa's Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely “to mediate and restore relationships at the base.” They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.

“The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,” the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.

The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.




The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.




The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.

Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.

The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.

“It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said.

Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.

In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.

The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they'd experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.

GENEVA (AP) — A small plane that was headed for Denmark has crashed in the Alps in southeastern Switzerland, killing the three people who were believed to be on board, police said Tuesday.

The Extra EA-400 propeller plane took off from the Samedan airfield at 5:20 p.m. Monday, police in Graubuenden canton (state) said in a statement. The plane had arrived from Denmark on March 13 and was en route back to Roskilde, near Copenhagen.

The plane crashed two minutes after takeoff on the edge of the village of La Punt Chamues-ch and burned out, police said. They added that the victims have still to be formally identified.

There was no immediate word on the possible cause of the crash.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian state closed two beaches after dead fish and an unusual off-white foam washed ashore while surfers reported feeling unwell, officials said on Tuesday.

A microalgal bloom created by unusual weather conditions was suspected to have sickened humans and marine life as well as creating the foam that has covered hundreds of meters (yards) of coastline, South Australian Environment Protection Authority principal scientific officer Sam Gaylard said.

“It is very concerning,” Gaylard told Australian Broadcasting Corp.

“It is unusual at this scale. At this time of year, when the weather conditions allow, we do occasionally get isolated blooms, but something of this scale is definitely a little bit unusual,” Gaylard added.

Waitpinga Beach and neighboring Parsons Beach, both south of the South Australia state capital Adelaide, have been closed to the public since Monday in response to a “fish mortality event in the area,” the Department for Environment and Water said in a statement.

“The beaches will be re-opened as soon as possible,” the department said.

Dozens of dead fish have reportedly been washed shore.

Surfers have been complaining since the weekend of getting sore eyes, sore throats and coughing after contact with the water, said local Anthony Rowland, who surfed at Waitpinga on Saturday.

“While we were out there, we started coughing,” Rowland said, referring to his surfing comrades. He said he was overwhelmed by the response from other surfers after posting his experience online. 




“Lots of people reached out – so many people have said they're had exactly the same symptoms,” Rowland said.

Marine scientists took water samples from the foam, which is a byproduct of the toxic organisms' decay, on Monday, but it could take until the end of the week to identify the organism, Gaylard said.

A bloom of microalgae – microscopic, single-celled organisms – could have been caused by a recent extended period of hot and dry weather with little wind and low tides, Gaylard said.

A swell has picked up in the area since Sunday, and the turbulence could break up the algae while generating more foam, he said.

“At the moment, we're not sure how long this will last,” Gaylard said.

Peru's president declared a state of emergency in the capital Monday and ordered the deployment of soldiers to help police address a surge of violence, amid widespread outcry a day after the killing of a popular singer.

LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru's president declared a state of emergency in the capital Monday and ordered the deployment of soldiers to help police address a surge of violence, amid widespread outcry a day after the killing of a popular singer.

President Dina Boluarte's government published a decree saying that the state of emergency will last 30 days, and authorities will restrict some rights, including the freedom of assembly and movement. That means the police and the army would be able to detain people without a judicial order.

Peru has seen an increase of killings, violent extortion and attacks on public places in recent months. Police reported 459 killings from Jan. 1 to March 16, and 1,909 extortion reports in January alone. But outrage crested after the killing Sunday of Paul Flores, the 39-year-old lead singer of the cumbia band Armonia 10. 

In Congress, opposition lawmakers requested a vote of no confidence against Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez for what they say is a lack of a plan to fight rising violence. The vote is expected to be discussed in the Congress' plenary later this week.

Flores was shot to death early Sunday when assailants attacked the bus he and bandmates were traveling after a concert in Lima. Cumbia is a Latin music style that people dance to the rhythm of drums, maracas and other instruments.

The attack against the popular singer was not the only violent event over the weekend. On Saturday, an object exploded at a restaurant in the capital, injuring at least 11 people.

Boluarte's government previously decreed a state of emergency in an attempt to stem the violence between September and December.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — With U.S. support for Ukraine in doubt, Kyiv's European allies are weighing whether to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian assets and use the money to compensate Ukraine, support its military and help rebuild shattered homes and towns.

For now, the assets are still on ice, with opponents of seizure warning that the move could violate international law and destabilize financial markets.

Here are key things to know about the debate surrounding the Kremlin assets that were frozen shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022:

Originally, the money was in short-term government bonds held as reserves for the Russian central bank. By now, most of the bonds have have matured and turned into cash piling up in custodian banks. Some 210 billion euros are in European Union member states, with the biggest chunk, some 183 billion euros, at Euroclear, a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions. Other amounts are at financial institutions in Great Britain, Japan, France, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Singapore.

So far, the Group of Seven democracies have used the interest on the frozen cash to fund $50 billion in upfront assistance to Ukraine by borrowing against future interest income. That solution avoids legal and financial complications associated with outright confiscating the money and giving it it to Ukraine.




Some of Ukraine's friends — Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — want to do more by taking the principal as well, given the enormous damage Russia has done. The World Bank estimates that reconstructing Ukraine will cost $524 billion over 10 years, already more than the total of the Russian assets. If one or more Western governments resists seizing the assets, the others that want to could still go ahead. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine's allies in Europe are contemplating stepping up their financial aid in the wake of statements by U.S. President Donald Trump that Europe must take care of its own security. Several of those allies — France and Belgium, for instance — are already saddled with troublesome debt levels above 100% of gross domestic product. 

European leaders say seizing the assets now would mean they couldn't be used as a bargaining chip in any peace deal or to help enforce a ceasefire.

French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks. If Russian assets were seized without legal grounds, “it could pose a risk to European financial stability,” he said.

“I advocate great caution when it comes to those frozen assets,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at a March 6 EU summit. “At the moment, that is actually a chicken that also lays golden eggs. Those windfall profits are going to Ukraine.”

Opponents of seizure also fear that countries and investors would hesitate to use European financial institutions if they are afraid assets could be seized, undermining the euro's role as an international currency for state reserves.

More specifically, governments worry that countries such as Saudi Arabia and China may sell European government bonds in response, said Elina Ribakova, an economist with the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. That would raise borrowing costs for governments already deep in debt.

She favors seizure, however, arguing that the European Central Bank has tools to thwart any unjustified bond selloff by purchasing government bonds.

Also looming over the issue are memories of the 2010-2012 European government debt crisis, in which borrowing costs spiked and raised concerns the euro currency could break up.

There is a “good deal of PTSD in the EU around messing with the EU sovereign bond market” because of that, said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

Some experts argue that seizure would be an appropriate “countermeasure.” That's a specific legal term referring to an action that would normally be illegal but which is justified as a means to push Russia to stop its own violations of international law.

“There is no dilemma between using an aggressor's assets to protect its victim and maintaining a commitment to the rules-based order,” wrote Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Britain's former ambassador to Belarus, in a legal analysis.

Other scholars say confiscation would not be a legitimate countermeasure.

One reason: justifying a countermeasure as compensation for damages — instead of merely as pressure to behave — would be “a very significant expansion of the way we have used countermeasures in the past,” said Ingrid Brunk, professor of international law at Vanderbilt University Law School. ”I would term it as a violation of international law on countermeasures.”

Additionally, Brunk said international law grants strong protection to central bank reserves against seizure — a principle that has been “absolutely sacrosanct for a century.”

“At a time when countries agree on almost nothing, this is a widely, universally accepted rule,” Brunk said, cautioning against ”destabilizing one of the few ironclad bases for the international financial system.”

Keatinge said the legal question is a “50-50 call.” It boils down to a question of “political will.”

Frozen state assets were used to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Iran's 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Those actions were legally justified because they were part of post-conflict peace deals: a U.N. resolution in the case of Iraq, and by diplomatic accords in the case of Iran, noted Brunk.

The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that the seizure of Russian assets would be illegitimate and erode investors' confidence. “We view those intentions as unlawful, and any attempt to fulfill them would entail very serious legal consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this month.

Russia could, in theory, seize the assets of the estimated 1,800 Western companies that continue to do business in Russia. Recent legislation would enable state seizure of companies based in countries designated as “unfriendly,” Russian news media report.

However, there's less to seize on Russia's end. Foreign companies have suffered more than $170 billion in losses since 2022, often as they decided to leave Russia or scale back there, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Tuesday's airstrikes in Gaza are “only the beginning” and that all ceasefire negotiations will take place “under fire.”



In a recorded statement broadcast on national television, Netanyahu said Israel would press ahead until it realizes all of its war goals -- destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.

“The previous releases proved that military pressure is a necessary condition for freeing hostages,” he said.



THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.



DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing more than 400 Palestinians, local health officials said, and shattering a ceasefire in place since January with its deadliest bombardment in a 17-month war with Hamas.



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes, which killed mostly women and children, after Hamas refused Israeli demands to change the ceasefire agreement. Officials said the operation was open-ended and expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions.






The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians.



“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Netanyahu's office said.



The attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.



The renewal of the campaign against Hamas, which receives support from Iran, came as the U.S. and Israel stepped up attacks this week across the region. The U.S. launched deadly strikes against Iran-allied rebels in Yemen, while Israel has targeted Iran-backed militants in Lebanon and Syria.



A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu's decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.



Hamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday's strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas' civilian government, its justice minister and two security agency chiefs. There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.



But Yemen's Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel's southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country's territory, the military said.



The strikes came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial  was canceled after the strikes. 



The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.

The main group representing families of the hostages accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire. “We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.







Strikes across Gaza pounded homes, sparked fires in a tent camp outside the southern city of Khan Younis and hit at least one school-turned-shelter.



After two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.



“Nobody wants to fight,” Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months.”



A hit on a home in Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.



At Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group. 



She said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and “we don't know if her family survived,” Haj-Hassan said.



Gaza's Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry's records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.



The war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.



The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.

The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”



The ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.



An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.



The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.







Under the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.



But Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives. 



Instead, Israel demanded Hamas release half of the remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.

The deal had largely held, though Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas. Egypt, Qatar and  the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps.



Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas' governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible.



A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza. 



It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.



Released hostages have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining captives. Tens of thousands of Israelis have joined protests calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — An unusually large number of Chinese military ships, planes and drones entered airspace and waters surrounding Taiwan between Sunday and Monday, the self-governing island's Defense Ministry said.

China said the drills were a response to recent statements and actions by the United States and Taiwan. Beijing launches such missions on a daily basis, seeking to wear down Taiwanese defenses and morale, although the vast majority of the island's 23 million people reject its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. 

Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo told legislators the drills were further evidence China was a “troublemaker” endangering peace in the region. 

The ministry on Tuesday published on social media images of Chinese drones and ships. It said 43 out of 59 entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone but that no confrontations were reported. Taiwan monitored the situation and deployed aircraft, navy ships and coastal anti-ship missile defenses in response, the ministry said.

It's unclear what prompted the large Chinese deployment. Daily figures often vary widely based on statements by the Taiwanese authorities or their U.S. partners. 

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that the drills were “a resolute response to foreign connivance and support for Taiwan independence, and a serious warning to Taiwan separatist forces.”




China's military actions are “necessary, legal and justified measures to defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,” Mao said. 

“The United States deleted the literal expression that reflected the one-China principle and that did not support Taiwan independence on the website of the U.S. Department of State, which indicates wrong signals to Taiwan separatist forces,” Mao was quoted as saying. 

Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te also raised Beijing's hackles last week when he said that Taiwan law designates mainland China as a “foreign hostile force” and said tougher measures were being taken to prevent Chinese subversion through the media and civic exchanges. Lai also warned of the danger of influential figures and current and retired military members selling secrets to China.

The Taiwan Strait is an international body of water and one of the most important channels for global trade. While China does not interfere with civilian shipping in the Strait — or in the South China Sea to the south that it claims almost in its entirety — it routinely objects to actions by the U.S. and other foreign navies in the area. 

China on Saturday lashed out at accusations by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies who said Beijing is endangering maritime safety. 

The G7 in a joint statement condemned China's “illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclamations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose.” 

China said the statement was “filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions.”

Faced with the rising threat from China, Taiwan has ordered new missiles, aircraft and other armaments from the U.S., while revitalizing its own defense industry.

Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but Chinese leader Xi Jinping has continued to make bringing the island to heel a top priority of his administration even as it faces economic headwinds and a race for high technology with the West.

Israel launched new strikes against Hamas early on Tuesday and promised ‘increasing military force' after talks on on further hostage releases stalled.

The Israeli ambassador to the UN said the Security Council had to ensure that the hostages were brought back to Israel if it wants to stop the war in Gaza

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, saying it was striking dozens of Hamas targets in its heaviest assault in the territory since a ceasefire took effect in January. Palestinian officials reported at least 69 deaths.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered the strikes because of a lack of progress in talks to extend the ceasefire. Officials said the operation was open-ended and was expected to expand.

“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Netanyahu's office said.

The surprise attack shattered a period of relative calm during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and raised the prospect of a full return to fighting in a 17-month war that has killed over 48,000 Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised questions about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.

In a statement, Hamas condemned what it called Israel's “unprovoked escalation” and said it had put the fate of the hostages in jeopardy.

There was no immediate U.S. reaction. But over the weekend, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been leading mediation efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately “or pay a severe price.”

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect.




Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said the “gates of hell will open in Gaza” if the hostages aren't released. “We will not stop fighting until all of our hostages are home and we have achieved all of the war goals,” he said.

Explosions could be heard throughout Gaza, and at least 69 people were killed in the morning airstrikes, according to four hospitals that received the bodies. The territory's civil defense agency said its crews were having a difficult time carrying out rescue efforts because various areas were being targeted simultaneously.

The strikes came two months after a ceasefire was reached to pause the war. Over six weeks, Hamas released roughly three dozen hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in a first phase of the ceasefire.

But since that ceasefire ended two weeks ago, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward with a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. 

Hamas has demanded an end to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli troops in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages.

Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and early this month cut off the entry of all food and aid deliveries into the besieged territory to put pressure on Hamas.

“This comes after Hamas repeatedly refused to release our hostages and rejected all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff, and from the mediators,” Netanyahu's office said early Tuesday.

Taher Nunu, a Hamas official, criticized the Israeli attacks. “The international community faces a moral test: either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza,” he said. 

The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. 

Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.

The ceasefire had brought some relief to Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to resume to what remained of their homes. 

But the territory is coping with vast destruction, with no immediate plans to rebuild. A resumption of the war threatens to reverse any progress made in recent weeks toward halting Gaza's humanitarian crisis. 

A renewed Israeli ground offensive could also be especially deadly now that so many Palestinian civilians have returned home. Before the ceasefire, civilians were largely concentrated in tent camps meant to provide relative safety from the fighting. 

The return to fighting could also worsen deep internal fissures inside Israel over the fate of the remaining hostages. Many of the hostages released by Hamas returned emaciated and malnourished and described harsh conditions in captivity, putting heavy pressure on the government to extend the ceasefire. 

The released hostages have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining hostages, and tens of thousands of Israelis have taken part in mass demonstrations in recent weeks calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages.

Mass demonstrations are planned later Tuesday and Wednesday following Netanyahu's announcement this week that he wants to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency, the Shin Bet. Critics have lambasted the move, saying it is an attempt by Netanyahu to divert blame for his government's failures in the Oct. 7 attack and handling of the war. 

Since the ceasefire in Gaza began in mid-January, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas.

Still, the deal has tenuously held without an outbreak of wide violence. The ceasefire's first phase saw an exchange of some hostages held by Hamas in return for the freeing of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.

Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to follow the ceasefire deal reached by the two sides, which calls for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.

PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic (AP) — The search for a U.S. college student who went missing in the Dominican Republic intensified on Monday, one day after a man questioned by authorities visited the beach where she was last seen and spoke with officials.

Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old student at the University of Pittsburgh and an Indian citizen, vanished before dawn on March 6 in the resort town of Punta Cana. Authorities are scouring waters in case she drowned.

Minnesota student Joshua Riibe has not been named as a suspect but has been detained by Dominican police and is believed to be the last person to see Konanki. On Sunday, he and his attorney met with officials on the beach.

On Monday, Riibe's attorney officially requested his release. A judge is expected to issue a ruling on Tuesday, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information.

According to the transcript of an interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media as well as NBC and Telemundo, Riibe told police he was drinking with Konanki on the beach and they were kissing in waist-deep water when they were pulled out to sea by a strong tide. Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and swam her into shore.

He told investigators he vomited upon reaching the beach and that Konanki said she was going to fetch her things. When he looked up, she was gone. He said he was later surprised to hear of her disappearance.




Riibe's parents have accused Dominican officials of detaining him “under irregular conditions” without translators or legal counsel, saying he has been confined to a hotel room with police surveillance for more than a week.

They said Riibe, a senior at St. Cloud University, has been repeatedly taken to the police station and interrogated, adding that he has “fully cooperated” with police.

The statement on Friday by Albert and Tine Riibe provided no details about Konanki's disappearance or their son's connection to her. His parents said the family has retained a lawyer to ensure his rights are protected.

Dominican public prosecutors have not responded to the statement.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating Konanki's disappearance.

The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels -- and this is how they fit into the wider tensions in the Middle East.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday explicitly linked the actions of Yemen's Houthi rebels to the group's main benefactor, Iran, warning Tehran it would “suffer the consequences” for further attacks by the group. 

The comments by Trump on his Truth Social website escalate his administration's new campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people this weekend alone. U.S. officials said the strikes were carried out against more than 40 targets and more airstrikes were planned in the coming days. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of military operations.

Meanwhile, the Iranians continue to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent them last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. 

Houthi supporters rallied in several cities Monday after the strikes, vowing revenge against America and Israel over blocking aid to the Gaza Strip after its war on Hamas there. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel put young boys on air live, who chanted the group's slogan: “God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.”

“The Yemeni position is an irreversible position (regarding Gaza), so do whatever you (Americans) want, for we are men who fear no one but God,” said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi leader who spoke to the demonstration in Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa. 

The United Nations called for a halt to all military activities in Yemen and the Red Sea, urging “utmost restraint” and warning that “any additional escalation could exacerbate regional tensions,” U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday.

Describing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs,” Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there.” 

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim' of rogue terrorists from which they've lost control, but they haven't lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.'”

And in a marked departure from the previous administration, Trump has given U.S. Central Command the authority to launch offensive strikes against the Houthis when it deems it appropriate. 

The Biden administration had required White House approval to conduct offensive strikes like the ones over the weekend. It did allow U.S. forces to launch defensive attacks, including to take out weapons that appeared to be ready to fire.

Delegating the authority to the regional commander, said Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “allows us to achieve a tempo of operations where we can react to opportunities that we see on the battlefield in order to continue to put pressure on the Houthis.” He added that it also allows the U.S. to hit a broader array of targets.

The U.S. officials said Trump made the decision last week.

The weekend strikes targeted headquarters positions and drone sites where what the Pentagon identified as “key leaders” for the Houthis' drone program were located at the time, Grynkewich said.

The Pentagon said there was no evidence that any civilians were killed in the attacks. However, Houthi officials earlier said women and children had been killed in the strikes.

Iran's ambassador to the United Nations delivered a strong rebuke Monday to Trump's recent rhetoric about the Islamic Republic, saying Trump and U.S. officials are making “reckless and provocative statements” and threatened to retaliate if those words turn to actions.

In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said his country would “defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests under international law against any hostile action.”

It's unclear what sparked Trump's post on Truth Social. However, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sought to separate the Houthis' actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region. 

“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump added. 

The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year when a ceasefire began in Gaza. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.




The Houthis claimed there had been additional U.S. airstrikes overnight, though American officials did not immediately acknowledge them. 

In Saada province, the Houthis' stronghold, the rebels raided a warehouse run by the World Food Program. A member of Yemen's exiled government first reported the Houthis had been taking supplies from the facility without the WFP's permission in the aftermath of the U.S. airstrikes. The United Nations agency later acknowledged the Houthis' actions to The Associated Press. 

“WFP regrets the de facto authorities' decision to seize some of the commodities,” it said. “These commodities were intended for the most vulnerable food-insecure families. Only WFP and its partners have the authority to distribute them and ensure they reach the intended recipients.”

Yemen, at war since the Houthis seized Sanaa back in 2014, has been on the precipice of famine for years. But the U.N. in February suspended its operations in Saada over security concerns following the detentions of dozens of U.N. workers and others in recent months. A day later, the WFP announced one of its staffers died while imprisoned by the Houthis.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fired or forced out a string of top officials since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel in 2023 that triggered the war in Gaza. The country's domestic security chief is the newest target.

Netanyahu says he is motivated by a crisis of confidence and a need to get rid of officials who failed to prevent the Oct. 7, 2023, disaster.

But Netanyahu's many critics say the dismissals are part of a broader campaign aimed at undermining independent government institutions. They say he is doing that to boost his reputation and maintain power while on trial for alleged corruption and facing public pressure to accept his own responsibility for policy failures in the lead-up to Oct. 7. 

The announcement by Netanyahu on Sunday that he would seek to fire the director of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, came as the security service investigates ties between Netanyahu advisers and the Gulf state of Qatar. 

Israel's attorney general said Sunday that Netanyahu needed to clarify the legal basis for his decision before taking any action, noting that “the role of the Shin Bet is not to serve the personal trust of the prime minister.”

On Monday, Netanyahu shot back with a warning letter to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, saying she has no authority to intervene in the matter. The dispute adds to growing concerns about the balance of powers in Israel's government. 




Tensions between Netanyahu and Bar had been building for months.

Bar, who was appointed to lead the Shin Bet in 2021 by a previous prime minister, accepted responsibility for his agency's failure to halt the Oct. 7 attack ahead of time. He already has said he planned to step down before the end of his term in late 2026.

But the Shin Bet investigation into its Oct. 7 failures also pointed blame at Netanyahu for formulating a policy that focused on containing Hamas, while ignoring a growing threat.

Bar had been a key player in negotiations to free Israeli hostages held by Hamas. But he and Netanyahu differed on how to proceed. That led Netanyahu to replace him with Cabinet minister Ron Dermer, a Netanyahu confidant. Critics of Netanyahu said the move highlighted a growing tendency by Netanyahu to surround himself with loyalists.

A pair of Shin Bet investigations recently launched against advisers of Netanyahu appeared to be a tipping point.

One is examining a Netanyahu spokesperson who allegedly leaked to a German news outlet classified documents that appeared to give the prime minister political cover in ceasefire negotiations. The other is looking into claims that Qatar reportedly hired close Netanyahu aides to launch a public relations campaign in Israel.

Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, was also the source of millions of dollars in cash sent to Gaza, with Netanyahu's approval. The money, ostensibly meant for poor families, is seen as having helped Hamas bolster its military capabilities ahead of Oct. 7.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good governance group, said Bar's dismissal while the probes are ongoing raises concerns that the move was made out of “political considerations.”

If Bar's dismissal is approved by the government, he will become the first Shin Bet chief in Israeli history to be fired. But he will also be just the latest in a series of defense officials to exit under pressure from Netanyahu during the war.

In November, Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, saying he had lost trust in him. Gallant had repeatedly prodded Netanyahu to set out a postwar plan for Gaza.

Gallant, a former top general, was replaced by Israel Katz, a longtime Netanyahu backer with little military experience who then pressured the military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, to step down earlier this month. Halevi's replacement then sacked the military's spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a popular figure with the public who was rebuked by Israeli leaders for commenting on the leaked documents case.

With many top defense officials linked to the Oct. 7 failures out of office, the blame game over the deadliest attack in Israel's history begins in earnest.

Netanyahu has repeatedly tried to pin responsibility on his security chiefs, saying he was never warned about Hamas' intentions and was guided by their advice that Hamas was deterred.

Netanyahu has resisted growing calls for a state commission of inquiry that would examine the government policies that led to Hamas' attacks. Such a commission could directly implicate Netanyahu.

Commentator Nadav Eyal wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily that Netanyahu is “firing the witnesses to his failures leading up to Oct. 7 and, by so doing, is creating for himself a perfect alibi. Anything they say from now on will be because they were fired.”

Bar's dismissal comes against the backdrop of a yearslong fight by Netanyahu against Israel's state institutions, which he believes are out to get him.

Since he was indicted for corruption charges in 2019, Netanyahu has lashed out against the police, the judiciary and the media, denying any wrongdoing and accusing them of conspiring in a politically motivated witch hunt.

He took that battle a step further in early 2023. That's when Netanyahu launched a sweeping overhaul of Israel's justice system that he said was meant to weaken the courts and restore power to elected officials. The overhaul sparked mass protests, strikes and threats by military reservists not to serve a country whose democratic fundamentals were being eroded.

Israeli media have reported that many top security officials, including Bar, warned that the internal strife sent a message of weakness to Israel's enemies. Many critics believe it was a factor in the timing of the Hamas attack.

Another Netanyahu target is Baharav-Miara, the country's attorney general. The dispute over her objections to Netanyahu's effort to fire Bar is likely to end up in the Supreme Court. With the stage set for a showdown between the judiciary and Netanyahu, his allies have already begun planning for Baharav-Miara's removal.

In his letter to the attorney general on Monday, Netanyahu accused Baharav-Miara of abusing her authority by approving the investigations into members of his staff.

The next election is scheduled for late 2026, but Netanyahu's coalition, propped up by ultranationalist and ultra-religious parties, could collapse prematurely. They face a raft of hurdles -- including over the future of the war in Gaza, the court-mandated draft of ultra-Orthodox men and the state budget.

With his political fortunes stagnating and many Israelis saying he should resign, the longtime Israeli leader — similar to his ally U.S. President Donald Trump — is looking to place loyalists in key positions.

That might make implementing his wishes easier, but it will likely deepen opposition to him and complicate his legacy.

Bar, in his response to being dismissed, said his loyalty was to the people of Israel.

“The prime minister's expectation of a duty of personal loyalty,” he wrote, “is a fundamentally wrong expectation.”

LONDON (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met the leaders of Britain and France on Monday during his first official overseas trip, seeking support from two of Ottawa's oldest allies as U.S. President Donald Trump targets Canada's sovereignty and economy.

Canadians have criticized the leaders of the two countries that founded Canada for their muted response to Trump's attacks. The president has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and repeatedly commented on turning Canada into the 51st state.

Carney and French President Emmanuel Macron did not take journalists' questions, and a joint news conference was not scheduled with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, either. An official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the Canadians proposed a press conference in Paris but the French declined.

Starmer has called Canada a friend and ally of the U.K. but has declined to directly call out Trump's talk of annexation — though he went further than he has before by stressing Canada's sovereignty.

“The relationship between our two countries has always been strong,” Starmer told Carney inside the British leader's 10 Downing St. residence. “Two sovereign allies, so much in common — a shared history, shared values, shared king.”

Carney dismissed the notion that he is seeking the support of other countries to affirm Canada as a nation. “We don't need another country to validate our sovereignty, we are sovereign,” he said. “We can stand up for ourselves. The disrespect is not helpful and needs to stop before we sit down about a broader partnership.”




Macron did not address Trump's attacks on Canada ahead of their talks but noted that tariffs only bring inflation and damage to supply chains.

“In the current international context, we want to be able to develop our most strategic projects with our closest, more loyal partners,” Macron said.

In London, Carney was received at Buckingham Palace by King Charles III, Canada's head of state, before his talks with Starmer. The monarch, wearing a red tie and an Order of Canada lapel pin, congratulated Carney on his recent victory. He was sworn in on Friday.

“Canada is fortunate to have a steadfast defender in our sovereign,” Carney posted on X. 

On Tuesday, Carney will travel to the edge of Canada's Arctic to reaffirm the country's security and sovereignty.

Carney has chosen the two European capitals that shaped Canada's early existence. During his swearing-in, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples, French, English and Indigenous.

He added that Canada is fundamentally different from America and will “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States.”

“I want to ensure that France, and the whole of Europe, works enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries,” Carney said, but vowed to “maintain the most positive relations possible with the United States.”

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said other leaders are “playing it safe” and making sure to avoid gaffes at a time of international tension around Trump's actions and rhetoric.

Carney's choice of itinerary emphasizes Canada's strong connection with the two former colonial powers, Béland said, and noted that “the fact that Canada never broke away from the U.K. in a violent fashion is a key historical and institutional difference between the United States and Canada.”

The trip to London was a kind of homecoming. Carney became the first non-British governor in the Bank of England's 319-year history when he took the job in July 2013. He served until March 2020.

Carney said he won't sit down with Trump until the U.S. is ready to have a more comprehensive discussion on trade and security. “When the U.S. is ready to have that conversation we're ready to sit down,” he said.

The prime minister also said Canada is not trying to organize a coordinated retaliation response among countries. He also said there is a limit to what Canada is prepared to do in retaliation given that the U.S. economy is 10 times the size of Canada's.

Carney also noted the United States, France, the U.K. and Canada and other countries are members of NATO and it would be “unthinkable” for the U.S. to annex Canada through military means.

Carney has said previously that he doesn't plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon.

His government is also reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump's trade war. Carney said the potential for having more production in Canada is a factor. 

Meanwhile, Macron has been increasing efforts to persuade France's allies to move away from purchases of American military hardware. That coincides with mounting concerns in Europe that European defenses are overly dependent on U.S. weaponry, technical support and goodwill.

Macron also touched on the French-British plan for securing any ceasefire in Ukraine, and said that “Canada and France are powers of peace, reliable allies, which will take part together in this effort.” He did not give details.

Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer that Canada is hosting.

Carney is expected to call a parliamentary election by the end of the week, to take place in late April or early May. Canada's governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now, the party and its new leader could come out on top.

KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — As families gathered at a hospital for updates, Tomco Stojanov already knew his son's devastating fate: 25-year-old Andrej died trying to save others in a nightclub fire that left dozens dead in North Macedonia, including many trampled during a desperate bid to escape. 

“Thank you for your condolences, but my pain is incurable. The wound is incurable,” Stojanov said, holding up a photograph of his son, clean-shaven and wearing a suit jacket. 

“He died while returning and entering to save other people. And he was pushed, run over, that's how my son died.” 

North Macedonia is grappling with the loss of dozens of young lives in Sunday's nightclub inferno in the eastern town of Kocani, and trying to hold those responsible to account and prevent another calamity.

Authorities were investigating allegations of bribery surrounding the fire in the nightclub, which was crammed with young revelers and at double capacity. Kocani's mayor resigned Monday over the emerging scandal.

Fire tore through the overcrowded Club Pulse during a live concert, leaving 59 people dead and more than 150 injured from burns, smoke inhalation and being trampled in the panicked rush toward the building's single exit.

Videos showed sparkling pyrotechnics on the stage hitting the club's ceiling and igniting the blaze as a band played.

Bribes to authorities to skip licensing requirements and skirt safety regulations are commonplace in North Macedonia, practices that have caught the attention of Western governments.




The European Union has repeatedly expressed concerns over pervasive corruption in the country, identifying it as a major obstacle to the country's accession to the bloc. 

Silent protests against corruption were held Monday in Kocani, joined by thousands of residents and separately by university students in Skopje.

“Justice is expected, that is what we all expect so that there are no such similar situations in the future,” Stavre Janev said at the Kocani protest.

The protesters' anger boiled over, with some toppling a van and smashing windows of a storefront — both belonging to one of the club owners. 

The latest in a string of deadly nightclub fires around the world, Sunday's tragedy shook this nation of 2 million, where close-knit extended family bonds made the disaster personal to many. Clubgoers as young as 16 were among the casualties, and the nation declared seven days of mourning.

“We are all in shock, and I am shocked myself: as a mother, as a person, as a president,” North Macedonian President Gordana Davkova Siljanovska said in an address to the nation Sunday night.

North Macedonia's government ordered a sweeping three-day inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country, starting Monday.

State prosecutor Ljupco Kocevski said a preliminary inspection of the Club Pulse nightclub had revealed numerous safety code violations, including a lack of emergency exits, an insufficient number of fire extinguishers and improper access for emergency vehicles. 

The fire caused the roof of the single-story building to partially collapse, revealing the charred remains of wooden beams and debris.

“The omissions are significant. I can confidently say that this is a failure of the system,” the prosecutor told reporters, also noting the lack of an overhead extinguisher system and fire alarms, and the use of flammable materials to line the inside walls. 

Speaking to reporters in Skopje, Interior Minister Panche Toshevski said it appeared the club's owners paid bribes to former officials to issue a forged license and turn a blind eye to the venue operating far beyond capacity and in violation of fire code. Former economy minister Khreshnik Beteshi was being questioned at a police station in Skopje, his lawyer Elenko Milanov told reporters.

The country was in mourning as people watched harrowing scenes in the town of 25,000 people, where rescuers for hours carried out the grim task of removing the charred bodies of clubgoers.

A state coroner said the bodies were being brought for identification in batches from morgues due to the high number of people killed. 

Flags around the country have been lowered to half-staff, and the death toll may rise further, with 20 of the injured in critical condition, Health Minister Arben Taravari said. 

Neighboring and nearby countries — Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey — along with a number of others have already accepted some 50 patients with the most serious injuries, while several countries are also sending medical teams to North Macedonia, officials said. 

“All patients who have been transferred abroad are currently in stable condition. We hope it stays that way and that we will receive positive news from abroad,” Taravari said. 

Officials said 10 people remain in police custody for questioning in Kocani, some 115 kilometers (72 miles) east of the capital, Skopje. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski added that a preliminary inspection revealed the club was operating without a proper license. He said the number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250.

Condolences poured in from leaders around Europe as well as from the office of the hospitalized Pope Francis.

Late Sunday, Kocani's residents held a candlelight vigil in support of mourning families, waiting in long lines to light church candles. 

Beti Delovska, an economist from Skopje, said North Macedonia has never experienced a tragedy like this, with dozens of young people vanishing in minutes. She noted that many young people with bright futures had already left the nation, in search of opportunities elsewhere.

North Macedonia “is on its death bed,” Delovska said. “We have no more credible institutions, the health system is completely dismantled, education is poor, judiciary is partisan and corrupt to the bone,” she said.

“I do believe now that only God can save (North) Macedonia.”

KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — Municipal workers in Kocani dug graves Tuesday for the dozens of young people killed in a nightclub fire as authorities braced for another round of protests in cities across North Macedonia. 

Authorities said the the nightclub blaze in Kocani early Sunday was caused by indoor use of pyrotechnics and numerous safety violations at the venue, killing 59 people during a live concert and injuring more than 150.

Officials in North Macedonia appealed for calm as student and other groups planned fresh protests later Tuesday. The horrific fire has sparked outrage over alleged bribery and corruption linked to safety violations at the nightclub. 

Crews used excavators to dig lines of graves in Kocani as the town awaits the burial of young residents whose remains were still being processed for identification. 

”It's very bad, very bad. I have been crying for three days,” resident Dragi Ignjatov said. “Children of our friends are gone. It can't be worse than this, for Macedonia and for our city.”

Demonstrations took place Monday in both Kocani and the capital, Skopje, with some turning violent — protesters in Kocani overturned a van, hurled rocks at a municipal building, and smashed a cafeteria believed to have shared ownership with the nightclub. 

“We must call once again for reason,” Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said in an interview with private Sitel television late Monday. “We must allow the prosecuting authorities to do their job so that in the end we can finally normalize the state.”




Investigations have so revealed that the club was operating at at least double its 250-person capacity without proper licensing. Official say there were numerous safety violations — no emergency exits, insufficient fire equipment, the use of flammable cladding and no sprinkler system. Many victims were trampled as panicked concertgoers rushed toward a single exit.

Neighboring Serbia and Bulgaria, which immediately offered assistance following the tragedy, are observing a day of national mourning Tuesday in solidarity with North Macedonia.

Medical specialists from the Czech Republic, Serbia and Israel have arrived to support treatment efforts for the injured, Health Ministry official said. And the European Union is helping transport burn victims to nearby countries.

Around 50 patients are being treated in mostly neighboring and nearby countries, the majority of them with serious burns.

The disaster has intensified scrutiny of corruption in North Macedonia, which the EU has previously identified as a major obstacle to the country's accession to the bloc. Authorities are investigating allegations that club owners bribed officials to bypass safety regulations.

The government has ordered nationwide inspections of all nightclubs and other entertainment venues.

In neighboring Greece, North Macedonia's ministers of foreign affairs and health visited a hospital where three burn victims, aged 19, 25 and 26, are being treated in intensive care. 

Foreign Minister Timco Mucunski described the fire as “the most tragic moment in the history of my nation.”

BERLIN (AP) — Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, won lawmakers' approval Tuesday for ambitious plans to loosen the nation's strict debt rules for higher defense spending as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to set up an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure.

Merz passed a major test as the outgoing parliament voted 513-207 in its final meeting to approve the plans.

The decision helps smooth the way for a governing coalition of Merz's center-right Union bloc and the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after he won last month's election. But he still faces plenty of work to seal a deal in ongoing talks.

The plans needed a two-thirds majority of at least 489 votes in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules — the so-called “debt brake,” which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens to get enough votes.

The package will exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, worth more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the stagnant economy — Europe's biggest — to growth.

At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.

The plans amounted to an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to the “debt brake.” The Social Democrats and Greens had argued for a reform of the borrowing rules — arguing that Germany, whose debt load is relatively low, has room to borrow more.

Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies. 

Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that “‘whatever it takes' must also go for our defense now.”

On Tuesday, he pointed to the danger from Russian President Vladimir “Putin's war of aggression against Europe — it is a war against Europe and not just a war against Ukraine's territorial integrity.” He pointed to suspected Russian sabotage and disinformation in Europe.

Merz said the prospective German government's move should be “the first step toward a new European defense community,” which could include countries outside the European Union such as Britain and Norway.

The Social Democrats' co-leader, Lars Klingbeil, said that “Europe stands today next to an aggressive Russia on one side and an unpredictable United States of America on the other side.” He said he favors doing everything to maintain “indispensable” trans-Atlantic cooperation, but “we must now do our homework in Europe — we must become stronger, we must take care of our own security.”

Merz acknowledged that many are struggling to digest the wider spending plans but argued that “they open prospects for our country that, in the times we are living in, are urgently needed.”

The package was brought to the old parliament — not the newly elected one, which will hold its first session March 25, in which parties that were unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats. The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the “debt brake,” while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.

“A politician's greatest asset is credibility and with this embarrassing action, dear Mr. Merz, you have already squandered yours completely,” Alternative for Germany co-leader Tino Chrupalla said. “Voters feel cheated by you, and rightly.”

Ahead of Tuesday's vote, Germany's highest court rejected several bids to block the meeting of the outgoing parliament.

The package faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.

A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday reacted to comments made by a French politician who made headlines in his country for suggesting the U.S. is no longer worthy of the Statue of Liberty, Leavitt shot back.

PARIS (AP) — Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France. 

So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the U.S. is no longer worthy of the monument, which was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.

Raphaël Glucksmann, as a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, can't claim to speak for all of his compatriots. 

But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans “have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants” reflects the broad shockwaves that U.S. President Donald Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe. 

“Give us back the Statue of Liberty,” Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party, who applauded and whistled, on Sunday.

“It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us,” Glucksmann said.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the fight over the Statue of Liberty after a French lawmaker demands its return.

The White House brushed back on the comments Monday, saying France instead should still be “grateful” for U.S. support during World War I and World War II. Glucksmann, in turn, then shot back that French gratitude for Americans' wartime sacrifices is “eternal,” but added: “If the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.” 

“No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty,” he wrote in X posts. “The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone.” 




Dream on. 

UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural arm that has the statue on its list of World Heritage treasures, notes that the iconic monument is U.S. government property.

It was initially envisaged as a monumental gesture of French-American friendship to mark the 100th anniversary of the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.

But a war that erupted in 1870 between France and German states led by Prussia diverted the energies of the monument's designer, French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi.

The gift also took time to be funded, with a decision made that the French would pay for the statue and Americans would cover the costs of its pedestal.

Transported in 350 pieces from France, the statue was officially unveiled on Oct. 28, 1886.

No. French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government.

For the moment, the French president is treading a fine line — trying to work with Trump and temper some of his policy shifts on the one hand, but also pushing back hard against some White House decisions, notably Trump's tariff hikes.

Macron has let his prime minister, François Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Bayrou tore into the “brutality” that was shown to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his White House visit and suggested that Trump's administration risked handing victory to Russia when it paused military aid to Ukraine. 

Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an “authoritarian” manner and is “preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter” to Russia.

In his speech, Glucksmann referenced New York poet Emma Lazarus' words about the statue, the “mighty woman with a torch” who promised a home for the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” 

“Today, this land is ceasing to be what it was,” Glucksmann said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Monday about Glucksmann's comments, and responded that the U.S. would “absolutely not” be parting with the landmark in New York Harbor.

“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,” Leavitt said, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with Allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation during World War II and alongside France during World War I. “They should be very grateful.”

During a news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says the U.S. will not heed a French lawmaker's call to hand back the Statue of Liberty.

But the debt of gratitude runs both ways. Leavitt skipped past France's key role in supporting the future United States during its war for independence from the United Kingdom.

In his subsequent follow-up, Glucksmann said that his call for Lady Liberty to travel back across the Atlantic to France had been intended as “a wake-up call.”

“We all in Europe love this nation to which we know we owe so much,” he posted. “It will rise again. You will rise again. We are counting on you.”

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya is hosting the Dutch king and queen as allegations of human rights abuses are mounting in the East African country, with Kenyans writing hundreds of emails and petitioning the royals to cancel their visit.

Kenya's government has been accused of arresting and detaining critics, especially after the June anti-government protests, during which demonstrators stormed parliament and torched a section of the building because they were angry over new taxes passed by legislators.

Along with cracking down on demonstrators and curbing free speech, the country also saw state-linked abductions of young men for social media posts deemed offensive to the president. In December, during protests against widespread kidnappings and abductions, dozens of peaceful protesters were arrested.

More than 20,000 Kenyans signed the petition on Change.org asking Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima to reconsider their visit. Last month, the government in the Netherlands said that it had received more than 300 emails asking for the cancellation, but that the state visit would proceed as scheduled.

The Dutch royals arrived on Monday night for a three-day visit. Willem-Alexander was honored with a 21-gun salute and inspected an honor guard, the office of President William Ruto said on Tuesday morning.

There was little excitement from Kenyans on the streets during the first day of the royal visit. Macharia Munene, a professor of international relations at the United States International University-Africa, attributed it to the “low morale that people in the country find themselves in.”




“There generally is low trust for the government and what it claims to stand for in part because such critical public institutions as health and education are not working,” Munene said. “The diplomatic clout that Kenya used to have has evaporated.”

Amnesty International on Saturday asked Kenya and the Netherlands to “place human rights at the heart of the visit, address human rights violations and commit to accountability for all victims following the recent brutal crackdown on human rights” in the East African country.

Kenya was among several African countries elected to the U.N Human Rights Council in October, and rights groups have been urging the government to prioritize civil liberties.

        The US president is set to speak to his Russian counterpart on Tuesday about a much-anticipated ceasefire proposal.
    

US President Donald Trump on Monday said that ""much remains"" to be agreed upon with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, ahead of a highly anticipated phone call centring on a ceasefire in Ukraine. 

""Many elements of a final agreement have been agreed to, but much remains,"" Trump said.

Trump confirmed on his Truth Social platform that he and Putin will speak on Tuesday morning about the proposal for a 30-day interim pause in fighting in the region. 

The Trump administration has been generally optimistic that it can secure Russian backing for the ceasefire agreement, which Ukraine has already agreed to. 

""We're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace. And I think we'll be able to do it,” Trump told reporters on Monday. 

Earlier on Monday, the US president said that Washington and Moscow had already discussed land, power plants, and ""dividing up certain assets"" between Russia and Ukraine as part of a deal. 

US special envoy Steve Witkoff and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that US and Russian officials have discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. 

""There's a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin tomorrow,"" Leavitt said on Monday. 

The power plant has been caught in the centre of the crossfire since Moscow invaded and seized the facility shortly afterwards — sparking alarm from international bodies that fighting around Europe's largest nuclear power plant could lead to a potential nuclear catastrophe. 

In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Putin of deliberately prolonging the war. 

""The implementation of this proposal could have begun long ago. Every day in wartime is a matter of human lives,"" Zelenskyy said. 

Putin so far said last week that although he agreed to the ""idea"" of a ceasefire, there were unanswered questions — such as the fate of Ukrainian soldiers in the region of Kursk — that needed to be discussed before Moscow could back the proposal.

He has also raised questions about how a potential ceasefire could be monitored, and ruled out the idea of placing NATO peacekeeping troops to ensure peace.  

It is unclear how far advanced discussions into the ceasefire deal are, with Witkoff — who travelled to Moscow to meet with Putin last week — declining to answer specifics on the agreement in an interview with CNN. 

""I am really hopeful we are going to see some progress here,"" Witkoff said, suggesting that ""the four regions"" were of critical importance to discussions. 

The UK and France have encouraged Putin to agree to a deal. French President Emmanuel Macron said that Zelenskyy demonstrated the ""courage"" to accept a deal, declaring it was ""up to Russia to prove that it truly wants peace.""

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday after a call with international leaders that Putin should agree to a ceasefire if he were ""serious"" about peace. 

""My feeling is that sooner or later Putin is going to have to come to the table and engage in serious discussions,"" Starmer said.

        Paul Flores was shot dead in Lima on Sunday morning amid a recent surge in violence.
    

Peru's President Dina Boluarte has declared a state of emergency in the capital Lima, shortly after a well-known singer was shot dead on a bus. 

The emergency decree, which was announced on Monday and which will last for 30 days, comes amid a surge in extortion attacks and killings. 

Under the measure, soldiers will be deployed to help police combat crime, and some rights, including the freedom of assembly, will be restricted. People can also be detained without a judicial order. 

Public outrage grew over the weekend following the killing of Paul Flores, the 39-year-old lead singer of the cumbia band Armonia 10. 

He was killed early on Sunday morning when assailants attacked the bus he and his bandmates were travelling on after a concert. 

It is understood that the band had been threatened by criminals who wanted to extort money from them. 

Peru's culture ministry praised Flores, saying that “with his talent and charisma, he won the hearts of thousands of Peruvians”. 

Flores' death was not the only violent attack in Lima over the weekend. An explosion at a restaurant on Saturday left at least 11 people injured. 

Later this week, politicians are expected to discuss a potential vote of no confidence against Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez. Opposition figures claim he does not have an adequate plan to tackle the growing violence. 

Boluarte has said she is ""seriously considering"" whether to reintroduce the death penalty.

In recent months, parts of the capital have had states of emergency in force. However, this is the first time since 2022 that all of Lima has been placed under one. 

In total, 459 people were killed from 1 January to 16 March, according to the police, who recorded 1,909 reports of extortion in January alone.

        Berlin is examining whether there has been a change in American immigration policy after three German nationals were detained at the US border.
    

Germany is probing the case of three of its citizens being denied entry and placed in detention as they tried to enter the US, the country's foreign ministry said on Monday. 

Tourists from several countries, including Germans, have reportedly been caught up in US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. 

""We have recently become aware of three cases in which German citizens were unable to enter the USA and were detained for deportation when they entered the country,"" government spokesperson Sebastian Fischer said. 

Two of the three cases had been resolved, Fischer confirmed, but Berlin is ""monitoring the situation"" and liaising with other EU countries to assess if these were isolated cases or representative of ""a change in American immigration policy"".

“Once we have a clear picture, we will then, if necessary, adjust our travel and security advice,” Fischer added. 

German and US media reported that two German tourists and one German green card holder had been arrested on re-entry to the US. 

Among them is Fabian Schmidt, 34, a legal permanent US resident. According to US outlet WGBH, he was detained at an airport in Boston before being transferred to a detention facility in Rhode Island. 

Schmidt's mother, Astrid Senior, told the broadcaster that her son was ""violently interrogated"" at the airport before being stripped naked and forced into a cold shower by two officials. 

The German foreign ministry said it was aware of the case and that its consulate in Boston was providing support. 

""It is clear that we expect from our partners, as well as from all other countries in the world, that prison conditions comply with international human rights standards and that detainees are treated accordingly,"" Fischer said. 

The two other nationals affected were Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Berlin, and Lucas Sielaff, 25, from Saxony-Anhalt. Both have been sent back to Germany after their cases were resolved.

Brösche had attempted to enter the US from Tijuana in Mexico while travelling with her friend, a US citizen. 

According to the online fundraiser set up to fund her return, authorities originally told her she would be detained for several days, but that what ensued instead was an ""alarming sequence of events"" with Brösche transferred and kept at the Otay Mesa Detention centre for more than six weeks.

Brösche's friends alleged she was put in solitary confinement for nine days during her ordeal. 

According to ABC 10News, San Diego CoreCivic, the company that owns the detention centre where Brösche was held, denied her claims that she had been placed in solitary confinement. 

Sielaff returned to Germany in early March after two weeks in detention his girlfriend, Lennon Tyler, told Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger. He had entered the US on a tourist visa and visited Mexico for a short trip. 

Tyler said Sielaff had incorrectly answered an immigration officer that he lived in Las Vegas due to his lack of English skills. His tourist visa was subsequently revoked at a border point in San Ysidro. 

“Don't come here,” Tyler warned in her interview. “Especially not if you're on a tourist visa, and especially not over the Mexican border.”

It is unclear why Brösche and Sielaff, who reportedly had valid tourist visas, were detained. 

Germans who have a valid tourist visa to the US are generally allowed to travel visa-free for up to 90 days, according to the US embassy website in Germany. 

Green card holders are generally allowed to travel abroad and re-enter the US after stays lasting less than six consecutive months, according to the US government.

        A spokesperson said the militant group had pulled out from Tuesday's peace talks in Angola in response to sanctions on several of its leaders.
    

The Rwanda-backed M23 rebels announced on Monday that they are withdrawing from peace talks with the Congolese government, citing international sanctions against their members as an obstacle to dialogue.

The talks, set to take place in Luanda, Angola, on Tuesday, “have become impracticable” following the EU's decision to impose sanctions on several M23 leaders, the group's spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement.

Additionally, ongoing military operations by the Congolese army in the conflict-hit region further undermine the possibility of peace discussions, Kanyuka claimed.

“Consequently, our organisation can no longer continue to participate in the discussions,” he added.

Despite previously rejecting direct negotiations, the Congolese government confirmed its participation in the peace talks. Delegations from both groups had arrived in Luanda for the talks, where Angola would serve as mediator. 

The conflict has resulted in one of the worst humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced. 

The EU imposed sanctions on five Rwandan nationals on Monday, including the commander of Rwandan special forces deployed in eastern DR Congo.

Additionally, the EU sanctioned four Congolese nationals, including M23's political leader Bertrand Bisimwa and three senior rebel commanders. 

Rwanda's Gasabo Gold Refinery was also blacklisted, with the EU accusing it of facilitating the “illegal extraction and trafficking of natural resources” from eastern DR Congo.

Gold and other strategic minerals from the region are key components in smartphones and computer production. Last year, the UN reported that M23 was generating an estimated $300,000 (€275,000) per month from its control of a mining area in eastern DR Congo.

Furthermore, amid rising international pressure, Rwanda severed diplomatic ties with Belgium on Monday, ordering all Belgian diplomats to leave the country.

The move comes a month after Brussels suspended development aid to Rwanda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused Belgium of attempting to destroy his country.

        A newly opened exhibition in Turin is highlighting the work of 13 artists with intellectual disabilities from the Eisenberg Collection.
    

Last week, the Italian city of Turin hosted the 2025 Special Olympics World Winter Games, welcoming athletes with intellectual disabilities from over 100 different countries to compete on a global stage. 

But the spirit of inclusion didn't stop at just sports. Running alongside the Games, a celebration of creativity, inclusion and self-expression launched at the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, a non-profit contemporary art museum founded by collector Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in 1995. 

Titled When Attitudes Take Form, the exhibition shines a spotlight on the extraordinary talents of thirteen different artists with intellectual disabilities from the Martin and Rebecca Eisenberg Collection. 

The Eisenbergs, long-time champions of artists with disabilities, have dedicated their collection to amplifying voices that are often overlooked in the art world. In collaboration with renowned New York curator Matthew Higgs, they have assembled a selection of works that challenge perceptions and celebrate individuality. 

“For many years, the Eisenbergs have been collectors of incredible contemporary paintings in New York City. They have a daughter, Jesse, who has learning difficulties, and they've been deeply involved with curators who, about twenty years ago, began profiling artists with similar challenges,” Higgs told Euronews Culture at the opening night of the exhibition. 

He added: “Over time, they built an exceptional collection of this work. Not only have they collected these pieces, but they've also actively promoted them and donated them to major institutions. The artists featured here are also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and many other renowned institutions.”

The artists in the show have a wide range of intellectual and developmental disabilities, including nonverbal autism, schizophrenia, and cognitive impairments, each shaping their artistic output. 

“One of the key aspects of the neuro-divergent community is its diversity, much like any other community. Each artist has their own techniques, subject matter, approach to art, preferred scale, and choice of materials. Often, they refine a technique and a creative process that evolves over time,"" Higgs explained. 

Dan Miller, an artist on the autism spectrum and who experiences communication challenges, embraces the power of repetition. His work features a dizzying array of words, letters, names, and numbers, layered into a chaotic yet mesmerising abstraction reminiscent of Jackson Pollock's style. When Attitudes Take Form showcases three of his brilliant works. 

Similarly, Nnena Kalu's practice is also rooted in repetition and layering. She has been a part of ActionSpace, a London-based organisation supporting artists with learning disabilities, since 1999, and her large-scale installations have gained international recognition. Many of the artists featured in the show have benefited from the rise of dedicated art spaces like ActionSpace that nurture and support neuro-divergent and intellectually disabled artists. 

Kalu's drawings and paintings are often produced in pairs, echoing and complimenting one another. One of the exhibition's highlights is her diptych piece Drawing 26, which exemplifies her signature approach to mark-making through movement and repetition. The work features two hypnotic, swirling, vortex-like forms, created in layered lines of black, blue, and purple against a bold yellow background. 

For some artists in the show, art is a means to challenge and redefine societal narratives. The late Derrick Alexis Coard, who lived with schizoaffective disorder, used his work to explore themes of Black masculinity, spirituality and faith. A piece spotlighted in the show titled The Vision of Healing features a divine, bearded figure gazing forwards, as a piercing beam of orange light erupts from his eye. Lush, vibrant greenery and blooming flowers surround his form, connecting the spiritual with the natural world. 

There's also the wonderfully vibrant work of William Scott, an Oakland-based artist with autism and schizophrenia, who works at Creative Growth, one of the oldest and largest art centres for people with disabilities in the world. Describing himself as an architect, his art is deeply rooted in his own life, with his paintings depicting family members and church congregants to actors, musicians, and civil rights leaders. In much of his work he envisions a utopian San Francisco, “Praise Frisco,” proposing new neighbourhoods, buildings, and community centres.

The exceptional talent of the artists in this exhibition is undeniable. But despite this, disabled people continue to be significantly underrepresented across the arts. A 2023 report commissioned by the British Council revealed that 48% of European arts organisations surveyed presented work by disabled artists less than once a year, while 23% never did so at all.

Higgs believes that exhibitions like When Attitudes Take Form play a vital role in breaking down these barriers in the art world. “The issue for neuro-divergent individuals is often prejudice and ignorance. One way to overcome this is by making their voices and perspectives more visible. Art is a powerful vehicle for this because of its universal appeal."" 

""One of the most important aspects of this exhibition is that it tells the story of champions. Not only the artists themselves but also the collectors who truly championed this work. These collectors worked tirelessly to navigate the art world, the museum world, and the gallery world, advocating for this art and saying, ""This work is absolutely worth seeing.""

The World Winter Olympics Games were held in Turin from 8 to 15 March 2025, marking the first time the country had hosted the competition. 

More than 1,500 athletes from 100 countries competed across 8 sports, including alpine skiing, cross country, dancesport and figure skating. 

When Attitudes Take Form runs until 27 April 2025 at Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin, Italy.

        Qatar's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday condemned “the resumption of the Israeli occupation's aggression against the Gaza Strip,” saying it threatens regional stability. Egypt, which also played a key role in brokering the ceasefire, has also condemned the wave of heavy strikes Israel launched.
    

Israelis gathered in protest outside government buildings in Jerusalem after the military killed over 400 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - its heaviest assault in the region since a tentative ceasefire took hold in January.  

Families of hostages held by Hamas called on supporters to protest with them outside the Israeli parliament, saying the resumption of fighting in Gaza puts their loved ones at risk. 

“I could not sit in the office today after the night we've been through, after the vicious step that Netanyahu and his government took,” said Efrat Ben Barak, protesting outside the parliament. “Netanyahu probably felt that the walls are closing in on him with the protests on the rise.” 

Another protester named Joni Sar said: “The only explanation one can see for the war restarting now is coalitional needs of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, that he needs to strengthen the staying power of the coalition to keep himself out of the investigations and out of jail.” 

An Israeli statement said they had carried out the deadly airstrikes after Hamas refused to release hostages held in the Gaza Strip – in an operation which they warned was open-ended and expected to expand. 

“Hamas rejected two concrete mediation proposals presented by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff,” said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein. “Israel agreed to those mediation proposals. Hamas refused them.” 

Netanyahu has faced heavy pressure from the families of Israeli hostages to get them freed since the start of the war. He also faces pressure from far-right coalition members to continue the war and end Hamas. 

UN Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al Kheetan said on Tuesday he was “horrified” by the Israeli airstrikes and called for the “unconditional release” of remaining Israeli hostages. 

He asked “all states with influence to do all in their power to achieve peace and avoid further suffering of civilians.” 

“Israel's resort to yet more military force will only heap further misery upon a Palestinian population already suffering catastrophic conditions. This nightmare must end immediately,” he said. 

The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions.

        Israel said it carried out the strikes after Hamas refused to release hostages held in Gaza and rejected a truce deal proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
    

More than 400 Palestinians were killed, including children and women, on Tuesday after Israel launched extensive airstrikes, Palestinian medics say. 

Early Tuesday morning, Israel's Prime Minister's office said it instructed the army to target Hamas across the Gaza Strip. 

The strikes were reported to have hit targets in northern Gaza, Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah. 

An Israeli statement said it carried out the strikes after Hamas refused to release hostages held in the Gaza Strip, and rejected a truce deal proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. Israel promised to use ""increasing military force.""

The scale of the horror is ""unimaginable"", according to one volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians based at Nasser Hospital. Dr. Tanya Haj Hassan said she had personally treated at least five patients who died in the emergency room.

“The ER was just chaos, patients everywhere, on the floor,” she said. “There were probably three men, and the rest were all children, women, and the elderly—everybody caught in their sleep, still wrapped in blankets. Terrifying.” 

The surprise attack broke a period of relative quiet during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and increased fears that the 17-month conflict, which has claimed tens of thousands of Palestinian lives and left Gaza in ruins, would resume in full.

When the Israeli planes struck, Palestinians at a school in Gaza City that was providing shelter to displaced families reported being forcibly shaken out of their sleep. 

More than two dozen people died, according to hospital officials.

“People are sleeping peacefully; they set the alarm to wake up for suhoor, and they wake up to death,” said Fedaa Heriz, a displaced woman, referring to the early morning meal during the fasting month of Ramadan.

“I heard screaming, my mother and sister screaming, calling for help. I came and entered the room and found the children under the rubble, under the stones,” said Majd Naser, a displaced Palestinian.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the school strike, which was part of a renewed offensive in Gaza.

The strikes come as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel remains in limbo. The first stage of the three-phase deal brokered by the US, Qatar, and Egypt started mid-January and ended on the first of March. 

Negotiations on the second phase have not yet been hammered out. 

Hamas condemned the latest raids and said it holds Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for the ""unprovoked escalation"" against Palestinians. 

""We hold the criminal Netanyahu fully responsible for the consequences of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, the defenceless civilians and our Palestinian people,"" the militant group said on Telegram.  

Hamas warned the strikes breached the ceasefire and put the fate of the hostages in jeopardy. 

""Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to violate the ceasefire agreement and expose the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,"" the statement said. 

Meanwhile, the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza said at least four of its senior officials, including two top police officers, were killed in the Israeli strikes.

They named the officials as Issam al-Daalis, head of the government administrative committee; Maj. Gen. Mohamed Abu Watfa, undersecretary of the Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Bahgat Abu Sultan, director of the domestic security agency and Ahmed al-Hetta, undersecretary of the Justice Ministry.

Earlier on Monday, Israel launched attacks towards Gaza, southern Lebanon, and southern Syria, killing at least ten people, according to local authorities. 

The airstrikes were the latest in what have been frequent and often deadly attacks by Israeli forces during the fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.

        Attending a banned event will carry fines up to about €500, and authorities will be able to use facial recognition tools to identify attendees.
    

Hungary's parliament passed a law on Tuesday banning Pride events and allowing police to use facial recognition software to identify attendees, continuing a crackdown by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's right-wing populist party on the country's LBGTQ+ community.

The legislation, supported by Orbán's Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, passed in a 136-27 vote. It was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted only a day earlier.

It amends Hungary's law on assembly to make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate the country's contentious ""child protection"" legislation, which prohibits the ""depiction or promotion"" of homosexuality to anyone aged under 18.

Attending a banned event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (€503), which the state must forward to ""child protection,"" according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify people attending a prohibited event, it says.

As the vote was being held, opposition lawmakers from the Momentum party ignited smoke bombs in the chamber, filling it with thick plumes of colourful smoke.

In a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organisers said the aim of the law was to ""scapegoat"" the LGBTQ+ community in order to silence voices critical of Orbán's government.

""This is not child protection, it is fascism,"" said Máté Hegedűs, press officer for the event. ""Pride is a movement that cannot be banned.""

The new legislation is the latest measure against LGBTQ+ individuals taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.

Hungary's government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilisation from what it calls ""gender madness,"" and argues that its policies are designed to protect children from ""sexual propaganda"".

In a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban the Budapest Pride event, which attracts thousands and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement. 

Hadja Lahbib, the European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, said the decision to ban Budapest Pride was a ""ban on fundamental rights"".

""(The ban is) a trampling of freedom, dignity and human rights that should not be up for debate,"" she told Euronews. 

""Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fundamental European values that must be preserved and guaranteed for everyone, everywhere,"" Lahbib added. ""We stand with the LGBTQ+ community in Hungary and beyond. Equality is not up for debate.""

Amnesty International said the law was ""a full-frontal attack"" on the LGBTQ+ community.

""On the eve of the 30th anniversary of Budapest Pride in June, this harmful ban turns the clock back three decades, further undermining the hard-won rights of LGBTI people in Hungary,"" Dávid Vig, director of Amnesty International Hungary, said in a statement.

        The defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have recommended leaving the 1997 Ottawa Treaty due to Russia's aggression.
    

Poland and the Baltic states said on Tuesday that they want to withdraw from an international treaty banning anti-personnel mines, citing Russia's growing military threat. 

In a joint statement, the defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said they ""unanimously recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention"". 

The 1997 treaty — which prohibits the use, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines — has been ratified or acceded to by more than 160 countries. 

Russia has not joined the agreement, and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has turned the war-torn country into the most mine-laden nation in the world, according to reports. 

""Military threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased,"" the statement said.

""We believe that in the current security environment it is paramount to provide our defence forces flexibility and freedom of choice to potentially use new weapons systems and solutions to bolster the defence of the alliance's vulnerable eastern flank,"" it added.

Despite the intention to leave the treaty, the statement said the countries would remain committed to humanitarian law, including protecting civilians during armed conflict.

The four countries have all increased or vowed to boost their defence spending following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Estonia, Lithuania and Poland have pledged to spend 5% of their GDP on defence, a goal that was put forward by US President Donald Trump. The current spending target for NATO members is 2%. 

In a separate statement on Tuesday, Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said the country's military saw no need to adopt previously banned landmines. 

""Decisions regarding the Ottawa Convention should be made in solidarity and coordination within the region,"" Pevkur said. ""At the same time, we currently have no plans to develop, stockpile, or use previously banned anti-personnel landmines.""

Meanwhile, Lithuanian Defence Minister Dovile Sakaliene said the recommended withdrawal sent a ""clear message"" about protecting the region's borders.

""The states having a border with Russia are ready to take all possible measures to ensure the safety of their citizens,"" she said in a statement posted on Facebook.

Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk told parliament earlier this month that he supported the country's withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention and possibly from the 2008 Dublin Convention, which bans the use of cluster munitions.

Finland, which is not a signatory of the joint statement, said in December that it was also considering leaving the treaty due to Russia's use of anti-personnel mines in Ukraine.

The US is the only NATO member state not party to the treaty. Other major nations that have not joined the pact include China, India, Pakistan and South Korea.

According to NATO, nearly 70 countries and territories are still affected by the presence of some 110 million land mines, which can remain dormant, concealed beneath the earth, for many years before being triggered. 

At least 5,757 people — mostly civilians — were killed or wounded by landmines and unexploded ordnance in 2023, found an annual tally by the NGO Landmine Monitor.

        The warrant means that any police officer who encounters the president of the country's Serb-majority entity of the Republika Srpska must arrest him immediately.
    

The state-level Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has issued a nationwide arrest warrant for Milorad Dodik and two others, after the President of Bosnia's Serb-majority entity of the Republika Srpska ignored a state-level one last week.

The other two are the entity's Prime Minister Radovan Višković and National Assembly Speaker Nenad Stevandić.  The warrant means that any police officer in the country who encounters them must arrest them immediately.

They are all accused of anti-constitutional conduct. Bosnian media reports that Stevandić has left the country for Serbia over the weekend and remains abroad at this time.

Bosnia's state-level prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the trio last week, which have not been carried out. The country-wide warrant goes out automatically if those sought by the state-level prosecutor's office fail to come in for questioning, as is the case with the three Bosnian Serb officials.

Dodik has not commented yet on the new warrant but has posted on X that the Republika Srpska is taking steps to form its own border police. It is unclear whether this new border police — which would act in addition to the state-level border control agency — would be placed along the administrative line between the entities.

The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, parts of which act as the country's constitution, have divided Bosnia into two main administrative units or entities — the Serb-majority Republika Srpska or RS and the Bosniak-Croat Federation of BiH (FBiH) with a state-level umbrella government in the capital Sarajevo.

Dodik, who previously said he does not recognise the country's state-level prosecutor's office, has rejected last week's warrant's validity and any attempts at his arrest and said he will not go to Sarajevo for questioning.

Bosnia's state-level court convicted Dodik in late February of going against the decisions of the country's international peace envoy, Christian Schmidt, which constitutes a criminal act. The verdict is not final, and Dodik can appeal it.

Shortly after, Dodik introduced new laws meant to ban the operation of state-level security and judicial institutions in what comprises about half of the Western Balkan country's territory. 

The decisions have been temporarily suspended by the state-level Constitutional Court.

The European-led international peacekeeping force in Bosnia, EUFOR, has said it was stepping up the number of its troops in response to the tensions.

An unexplained microalgal bloom has caused fish deaths and toxic foam on South Australian beaches, leading to closures as authorities investigate health and environmental risks.

Two beaches in South Australia have been closed after unusual off-white foam and dead fish washed ashore, and surfers reported feeling unwell. Since the weekend surfers in Waitpinga have reported getting sore eyes, sore throats and coughing after contact with the water.

Officials suspect a microalgal bloom, likely triggered by recent hot and dry weather, has affected both marine life and humans. 

Scientists are analysing water samples, but identifying the organism may take several days. The foam, a byproduct of decaying toxic organisms, has covered hundreds of metres of coastline. Authorities will reopen the beaches once conditions improve and the risks are assessed.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        On Italy's day of remembrance for COVID-19 victims, survivors expressed gratitude to the doctors who saved their lives.
    

Italy marked remembrance day to commemorate its victims of the COVID-19 pandemic on Tuesday.** 

On the same day, five years ago, military trucks carried the coffins of some of the first victims of the pandemic from the cemetery in Bergamo to other cities for cremation. 

The image spread worldwide, conveying the gravity of what was happening in the region. Italy recorded over 196,000 deaths, becoming the first Western country to be hit by the pandemic, which caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide. 

Today, those who survived the pandemic feel blessed as they recall their darkest memories. Sergio Monticelli is among them. He is more thankful than ever to the doctors who saved his life at San Camillo Hospital in Rome five years ago.

""I feel so emotional, as you can tell from my voice. Seeing Dr Magliacani and the whole team, knowing that I stayed here and then returned home. Others weren't as fortunate,"" he told Euronews right after entering the hospital.

Monticelli has vivid memories of the day that changed everything for him. ""As I was receiving treatment, one of the doctors told me I looked swollen,"" he recalled. ""It was a sign that I had less oxygen, and by acting quickly, they saved my life.""

Dr Vinicio Magliacani, who was part of the team that cared for Monticelli, compared the pandemic to a monster. ""The most difficult part was seeing patients in pain,"" he told Euronews. ""We saw people dying, begging for their hands to be held.""

But not everyone has shown gratitude for their work, Dr.Magliacani noted. Unlike cancer survivors, he explained, many former COVID-19 patients prefer to put the experience behind them.

""Many, including some doctors, are in denial about the reality we faced,"" he said. ""Society and institutions seem to have forgotten how crucial our role was.""

        The French interior minister has promised a ""graduated response"" after Algeria refused to cooperate on a list of around 60 Algerians whom France intends to expel.
    

For several months now, Algiers has been systematically turning back Algerian nationals who have committed criminal acts or become radicalised in the European Union. And the standoff with Paris is not about to end.

In a ""moment of truth"" the French government had been waiting for, Algeria has now decided not to follow up on a list of around 60 Algerian nationals considered to be threats to public order in France, and whose expulsion back to Algeria had been requested ""as a priority"" by the French Interior Ministry.

A press release issued by the Algerian diplomatic service on Monday evening insisted that ""Algeria reaffirms its categorical rejection of threats and attempts at intimidation, as well as injunctions, ultimatums and any kind of threatening language"".

The message accused Paris of ""calling into question the traditional channel for handling expulsion cases"" and applying a ""selective approach (...) to bilateral and international agreements"".

The statement also insisted that ""Algeria is motivated only by the desire to fulfil its duty of consular protection towards its nationals"", and invited the French chargé d'affaires to ""follow the usual channel, in this case that established between the French Prefectures and the Algerian Consulates"" and to ""proceed on a case-by-case basis"".

French Minister of the Interior Bruno Retailleau was quick to respond.

""I regret that Algeria refuses to apply international law,"" he declared on his X account. ""As decided by the interministerial committee chaired by the Prime Minister, a graduated response will be implemented.""

Rima Hassan, an MEP for the radical left-wing party La France Insoumise who holds the French government responsible for the deterioration in Franco-Algerian relations, immediately called for Retailleau's resignation.

On the other side of the political spectrum, the far right has accused France's top cop of impotence and called on the authorities to get tougher on their North African counterparts.

""The French people would not understand if the government did not react firmly to the many provocations by the Algerian regime, which is violating its treaty obligations"", declared Marine Le Pen, parliamentary leader of the National Rally (RN) party, on X.

Jordan Bardella, the young president of the party, said Retailleau has ""his back to the wall"", and urged him to take action.

The retaliatory measures to which Retailleau alluded could range from individual sanctions to calling into question all France's agreements with Algeria.

The French government has already announced it is ""suspending"" the 2007 agreement that allows holders of Algerian diplomatic passports to make short stays in France without a visa.

And according to an internal Interior Ministry memo leaked to the press, the government might even consider ""slowing down compensation"" for victims of French nuclear tests in the Algerian Sahara between 1960 and 1966.

While the 1968 migration agreements that facilitate the settlement and family reunification of Algerians are already in the government's sights, they currently have very little effect on the movement and residence of Algerians in France.

This arrangement has been progressively unravelled over the decades, particularly given the knock-on effects of the Algerian civil war in the 1990s and the implementation of the Schengen area.

What's more, the 1968 agreements penalised Algerian students who, unlike other students, were not entitled to a multi-annual residence permit and had to renew their visa every year.

On the other hand, the 1980 agreement, which was supplemented by a 2016 protocol, has proven less contentious. It grants social benefits to certain Algerians living in France, including pensions, family allowances and healthcare.

Relations between Paris and Algiers are complicated because of the country's colonial past, but they have deteriorated particularly since last July, when Emmanuel Macron angered Algeria by recognising an autonomy plan for the Western Sahara region, under Moroccan sovereignty.

Although diplomatic ties have not been severed, French officials claim that Algiers is adopting a policy aimed at erasing France's economic presence in the country, with trade falling by 30% since the summer, according to Reuters.

Another bone of contention is the arrest of French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, 75, who has been in prison in Algeria since mid-November last year.

The intellectual and friend of Retailleau is being prosecuted for statements considered to undermine Algeria's ""territorial integrity, stability and the normal functioning of its institutions"".

According to French officials, some 10% of France's 68 million inhabitants have links with Algeria.

        As the three countries prepare to spend billions beefing up their defence capabilities, they will continue to rely on the US for nuclear deterrence, experts tell Euronews.
    

Worried by global instability, countries from Europe to Asia are drastically increasing their military spending in an attempt to become more self-reliant. 

At a time when US involvement overseas appears to be waning under President Donald Trump, some countries worry that Washington's “America First” approach could embolden the actions of nations like Russia and China elsewhere in the world. 

Given such uncertainty, Germany, Italy and Japan are among those trying to bolster their defence capabilities. 

However, these three countries, who formed the Axis alliance in World War II, are hindered by their pasts, said Raffaele Marchetti, professor of international relations at LUISS University of Rome.

“The goal of the post-war peace treaties was to get rid of hegemonism, militarism and aggressive adventurism in the culture of these three countries.” 

“Germany, Italy and Japan have become so-called civilian powers. Nowadays, it is really difficult for these countries to adopt a combat-ready mentality,” he added. 

Experts told Euronews that these G7 countries, which are all non-nuclear states, will continue to depend on the US for nuclear deterrence against their adversaries. 

Last week, Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) and Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to set aside a constitutional debt brake, allowing the country to unlock hundreds of billions of euros for defence and infrastructure projects. 

This came as German defence spending hit 2% of the country's GDP, three years after outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised to boost the army through 100 billion euros of investment. 

The gaps in the country's defence capabilities are significant, according to a recent German parliamentary report. It suggested that the Bundeswehr — the German army — would need to recruit tens of thousands of military personnel by 2031.

Germany also needs to modernise its weaponry, as much of its equipment has deteriorated since the end of the Cold War. 

The parliament's budget committee has doubled its planned purchases of cutting-edge air defence systems and battle tanks. 

Despite its plans to grow its army, Germany is still bound, at least rhetorically, by decades of anti-militarism, according to Jaques-Pierre Gougeon, the director of the German Observatory at the Paris-based IFRI think tank. 

Following the end of World War II, Germany, which was divided into East and West, had to comply with strict military limitations. 

When Friedrich Merz, the centre-right politician who is expected to succeed Scholz as chancellor, recently announced his massive military investment plan, he spoke about “teilnahme” (participation) with his country's allies. 

“It is a deliberately chosen wording to cope with a culture built on the anti-militarism of the Germans”, said Gougeon, who saw Merz's speech as aimed more at an internal than foreign audience. 

“The Bundeswehr (German army) can grow only in a strict European political context. Its rearmament is more about a common EU financial effort,” he added.  

French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken about the possibility of extending his country's nuclear deterrence to Germany and other EU partners, who would help financially with its enlargement.

However, some Europeans believe the current approach is better, despite the Trump administration's threat to reduce the role it plays in European security.

“One nuclear umbrella is better than two, because then there's no ambiguity about which nuclear umbrella is protecting you,” said Tobias Cremer, a German Social Democrat who is part of the European Parliament's recently created Security and Defence Committee. 

“We have a plan A, this plan has worked for 80 years, and it is both in our interest and in the American interest that this plan A, which is the NATO nuclear deterrent, remains in place,” he said. 

According to Cremer, “the EU is not to replace the European pillar of NATO, but the two need to work very, very closely together”.

Italy shares the same concerns as Germany about the US decreasing its military role in Europe.

There are currently around 120 US and NATO installations in Italy. 

Rome's defence spending sits below Germany's as a percentage of its economy. Currently, Italy puts 1.59% of its GDP towards its military, well below the level Trump wishes NATO members to spend. 

As part of its planned improvements, the Italian weapons producer Leonardo has struck a deal with its German counterpart Rheinmetall to produce a common heavy tank.

Italy, Japan and the UK are also planning the production of a sixth generation war plane. The joint venture will be run between the UK's BAE system, Italy's Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement Co. 

As for nuclear deterrence, Italy, like Germany, must rely on US nuclear protection, said Marchetti, of the LUISS University of Rome. 

“(For the Italians), having more European strategic autonomy doesn't mean getting rid of the US nuclear shelter,” he explained. 

Japan's government has recently said it will increase military spending from 1.6% to 2% of GDP by 2027. 

One area that Tokyo, which has China, Russia and North Korea as neighbours, plans to improve on is its air defence systems. 

US military presence in Japan remains crucial, with more than 50,000 American troops based there, including on the island of Okinawa. 

The American nuclear deterrence is the backbone of Japan's security system, as its population is strongly anti-nuclear due to the past traumas of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Japan does not benefit from collective defence like in Europe, as the Indo-Pacific region is more fragile politically and militarily, despite intense economic interdependence, according to Silvia Menegazzi, the founder of the Study Centre on Contemporary China. 

""For its security, Japan badly needs US protection and this is why NATO has been increasing its partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region,” she said.

The new Gaza operation seemed to come as a surprise across the world, but was it?

The benefits of such coordinated timing are obvious. The Houthis, with their ballistic missiles, are the last Iranian proxy that could most viably threaten Israel immediately in retaliation for a return to war such as seems to be happening.

During the first few hours following the October 7 Hamas infiltration and attack on cities, moshavim, and kibbutzim along the southern Gaza border, Israel as a country reacted with shock as the full impact of the day's events became evident.While the IDF and government agencies worked on gaining a clear understanding of the situation, those who survived and fled the embattled areas desperately looked for assistance and someone to lead the way. This was when the nation's great civilian outpouring of assistance and support sprang into action.   A time when the political space is frequently divided, and at times even toxic and dysfunctional, is exactly when the role of non-governmental organizations (nonprofits) becomes even more integral to a functioning society.This is also exactly when these organizations should step up and shoulder the critical load, as they play an important role in preserving the balance of daily life by providing the missing essentials to those who need them most, when they need them most.

Entrance to the Kfar Maccabiah.  (credit: FELICE FRIEDSON/THE MEDIA LINE)Starting on October 8, we opened our movement's campus, Kfar Maccabiah, providing hotel rooms free-of-charge to close to 1,000 evacuees from Sderot, Ashkelon, and Moshavim in the South. We built a self-sufficient “city,” with a store where we distributed donated essentials such as clothing, books, and diapers, as well as a dog garden for those with pets and a barbershop.  In cooperation with Israel's health maintenance organizations, we opened an on-site clinic where the evacuees had healthcare access. With the assistance of several organizations focused on mental health, we also opened a welcoming glamping site where we hosted some 700 survivors of the Supernova music festival, soldiers, reservists, and families from the Gaza border communities for overnight retreats.

Kennedy said in his 1961 inaugural address: we live in a time in which man holds in his “mortal hands” great power, and it is time to use this power to give back – to “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” Nonprofits should be at the front line of making this happen.

We built a self-sufficient “city,” with a store where we distributed donated essentials such as clothing, books, and diapers, as well as a dog garden for those with pets and a barbershop.  In cooperation with Israel's health maintenance organizations, we opened an on-site clinic where the evacuees had healthcare access. With the assistance of several organizations focused on mental health, we also opened a welcoming glamping site where we hosted some 700 survivors of the Supernova music festival, soldiers, reservists, and families from the Gaza border communities for overnight retreats.

This is also exactly when these organizations should step up and shoulder the critical load, as they play an important role in preserving the balance of daily life by providing the missing essentials to those who need them most, when they need them most.

For the first time, the UK's foreign secretary, David Lammy, accused Israel of ""breaching international law"" during a House of Commons debate on Monday afternoon.His comments came before Israel began renewed strikes on targets in Gaza later on Monday night.  Lammy condemned Israel's halting of aid into the Strip - as a means of pressuring Hamas to return the remaining hostages - calling it ""appalling and unacceptable"" and adding that aid should never be used as a political tool.Responding to a question from MP Rupa Huq about the aid blockage during Ramadan, Lammy said, ""This is a breach of international law.""

We would urge Israel to get back to the amount of trucks from before so that Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support that they need at this time.""Lammy addressed the room with details of the recent G7 meeting, in which members discussed conflict in Ukraine, Israel, the DRC, and others. He said the ""G7 united in support for the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and unhindered humanitarian aid into Gaza.""He also reiterated prior statements that Hamas can have no role in Gaza's future.

What happens when Israel's political priorities clash with those of Jewish communities abroad? The backlash over the International Conference on Combating Antisemitism is a case study of this growing divide. While Israel is focused on securing international allies – sometimes from unexpected corners – many Jewish leaders, particularly in Europe, remain deeply uncomfortable with the inclusion of far Right politicians.The result? A controversy that has led to high-profile withdrawals and heated debates. Also, a stark reminder that the Jewish world is far from unified in its approach to combating antisemitism.  At the center of this divide is a growing divergence in priorities. Israel needs as much global support as possible, especially as antisemitism surges worldwide.This has led some Israeli officials to embrace leaders long considered off-limits by Jewish communities abroad, such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, an outspoken supporter of Israel who has yet to be deemed “kosher” in the eyes of many European Jews. Argentina's President Javier Milei is another far Right leader who has been warmly welcomed by Israel due to his strong pro-Israel stance.

(credit: HAIM ZACH/GPO)Jewish communities in Europe, however, see things differently. Many still associate far Right politicians with the specter of Holocaust denial, xenophobia, and antisemitism – even when some of these officials claim to have reformed.The former head of France's far Right National Rally Marine Le Pen, for instance, expelled her father from the party he founded and acknowledged its troubling past, yet remains deeply controversial among French Jews. However, following October 7, she and current National Rally leader Jordan Bardella personally participated in a Paris march against antisemitism, marking a significant shift in the far Right's stance on Jewish issues in France (BBC, November 12, 2023). Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron did not attend.The tension between Jews in Israel and Jews abroad has come to a head over the conference organized by Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. It has drawn criticism from Jewish leaders worldwide due to the inclusion of far Right European politicians such as Bardella and European Parliament members Marion Maréchal and Hermann Tertsch. The backlash has been swift, with UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein, British antisemitism adviser Lord John Mann, and French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy all withdrawing their participation.

AdvertisementThe age-old divide between Israel and the DiasporaSuch discord is not new. The tension between Jewish leadership in Israel and in the Diaspora has existed since ancient times. During the period of the Talmud, there was constant friction between Eretz Yisrael sages and those in Babylon – the great Jewish center of learning in exile.The Jerusalem Talmud (Sanhedrin 3:5) records an exchange where Babylonian scholars send halachic questions to Israel's sages but then refuse to follow their rulings.“They (the Babylonians) send us questions, and we answer them, but they do not abide by our rulings.”This sounds familiar. Israel asks Diaspora Jews what they think about meeting with far Right political figures but doesn't listen to their answers. The Jewish state decides based on its own immediate needs, while Jewish communities abroad feel alienated or disregarded when they disagree.  The Talmud (Kiddushin 49b) goes even further, describing how Israelis mocked Babylonians as “foolish” for their different customs and way of thinking.“Those from Eretz Yisrael call the Babylonians ‘foolish Babylonians,' for they sit in darkness.”There was always a cultural and ideological gap between the Jews in the Land of Israel and those in the Diaspora. Back then, it was about Torah interpretation and halachic authority. Today, it's about who defines the Jewish political agenda – and with whom Israel should engage to ensure its survival.Why are far-right figures dominating the conference?Sources close to the Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Ministry told me on Monday that it had invited several leaders from left-wing political parties, as well as left-wing thought leaders, but few accepted the invitation. Now, with increasing pressure on Center and Center-Left figures to also withdraw, the conference lineup is overwhelmingly right-wing or Center-Right.At the same time, I have learned that members of far-right parties across Europe approached the ministry seeking to participate. According to Israeli officials, the ministry only allowed the participation of figures approved by the Israeli Foreign Ministry and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar. This means that these invitations were not random but aligned with Israel's broader foreign policy interests.The deeper problem is that antisemitism has become a political tool – used by both the Right and the Left to serve their own agendas. MK Gilad Kariv (Democrats), who has urged the government to rescind invitations to far-Right politicians, wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sa'ar that this move represents a “deviation from longstanding Israeli policy” and contradicts the positions of prominent Jewish organizations worldwide.“The invitation of these representatives is particularly jarring given that this concerns an international conference on combating antisemitism, which is supposed to be conducted under the auspices of the president of the state and the prime minister,” Kariv stated.However, while these objections are understandable, Israel faces a different political reality. Many of its traditional allies on the European Left have distanced themselves from the Jewish state, leaving Israel to seek support elsewhere. The question remains: If the Left refuses to stand with Israel, should Israel ignore the Right?Boycotts and cancellations do not advance dialogueThis situation reflects a broader trend in global politics – the rise of ideological purity tests that leave no room for dialogue. The idea that some voices must be completely excluded from conversation – rather than engaged critically – has led to polarization and political stagnation.Israel is in a difficult position. It cannot afford to ignore any potential allies, yet it must also respect the concerns of Jewish communities abroad. In Jewish tradition, debate and argument are core values – as seen in the beit midrash (study hall), where conflicting views are explored and challenged. It is unfortunate that, rather than fostering dialogue, many have resorted to boycotts and cancellations.If the country is to navigate this complex global landscape, it must find a way to engage with political leaders, including those from difficult pasts, without compromising its moral clarity.This is a delicate balancing act, and only time will tell whether Chikli's approach was the right one. But what is already clear is that the conference is off to a bad start – one that exposes the deep rifts between Israel and the Jewish world and does not contribute to healing them.

During the period of the Talmud, there was constant friction between Eretz Yisrael sages and those in Babylon – the great Jewish center of learning in exile.The Jerusalem Talmud (Sanhedrin 3:5) records an exchange where Babylonian scholars send halachic questions to Israel's sages but then refuse to follow their rulings.“They (the Babylonians) send us questions, and we answer them, but they do not abide by our rulings.”This sounds familiar. Israel asks Diaspora Jews what they think about meeting with far Right political figures but doesn't listen to their answers. The Jewish state decides based on its own immediate needs, while Jewish communities abroad feel alienated or disregarded when they disagree.  The Talmud (Kiddushin 49b) goes even further, describing how Israelis mocked Babylonians as “foolish” for their different customs and way of thinking.“Those from Eretz Yisrael call the Babylonians ‘foolish Babylonians,' for they sit in darkness.”There was always a cultural and ideological gap between the Jews in the Land of Israel and those in the Diaspora. Back then, it was about Torah interpretation and halachic authority. Today, it's about who defines the Jewish political agenda – and with whom Israel should engage to ensure its survival.Why are far-right figures dominating the conference?Sources close to the Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Ministry told me on Monday that it had invited several leaders from left-wing political parties, as well as left-wing thought leaders, but few accepted the invitation. Now, with increasing pressure on Center and Center-Left figures to also withdraw, the conference lineup is overwhelmingly right-wing or Center-Right.At the same time, I have learned that members of far-right parties across Europe approached the ministry seeking to participate. According to Israeli officials, the ministry only allowed the participation of figures approved by the Israeli Foreign Ministry and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar. This means that these invitations were not random but aligned with Israel's broader foreign policy interests.The deeper problem is that antisemitism has become a political tool – used by both the Right and the Left to serve their own agendas. MK Gilad Kariv (Democrats), who has urged the government to rescind invitations to far-Right politicians, wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sa'ar that this move represents a “deviation from longstanding Israeli policy” and contradicts the positions of prominent Jewish organizations worldwide.“The invitation of these representatives is particularly jarring given that this concerns an international conference on combating antisemitism, which is supposed to be conducted under the auspices of the president of the state and the prime minister,” Kariv stated.However, while these objections are understandable, Israel faces a different political reality. Many of its traditional allies on the European Left have distanced themselves from the Jewish state, leaving Israel to seek support elsewhere. The question remains: If the Left refuses to stand with Israel, should Israel ignore the Right?Boycotts and cancellations do not advance dialogueThis situation reflects a broader trend in global politics – the rise of ideological purity tests that leave no room for dialogue. The idea that some voices must be completely excluded from conversation – rather than engaged critically – has led to polarization and political stagnation.Israel is in a difficult position. It cannot afford to ignore any potential allies, yet it must also respect the concerns of Jewish communities abroad. In Jewish tradition, debate and argument are core values – as seen in the beit midrash (study hall), where conflicting views are explored and challenged. It is unfortunate that, rather than fostering dialogue, many have resorted to boycotts and cancellations.If the country is to navigate this complex global landscape, it must find a way to engage with political leaders, including those from difficult pasts, without compromising its moral clarity.This is a delicate balancing act, and only time will tell whether Chikli's approach was the right one. But what is already clear is that the conference is off to a bad start – one that exposes the deep rifts between Israel and the Jewish world and does not contribute to healing them. 
            



The former head of France's far Right National Rally Marine Le Pen, for instance, expelled her father from the party he founded and acknowledged its troubling past, yet remains deeply controversial among French Jews. However, following October 7, she and current National Rally leader Jordan Bardella personally participated in a Paris march against antisemitism, marking a significant shift in the far Right's stance on Jewish issues in France (BBC, November 12, 2023). Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron did not attend.The tension between Jews in Israel and Jews abroad has come to a head over the conference organized by Combating Antisemitism and Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. It has drawn criticism from Jewish leaders worldwide due to the inclusion of far Right European politicians such as Bardella and European Parliament members Marion Maréchal and Hermann Tertsch. The backlash has been swift, with UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein, British antisemitism adviser Lord John Mann, and French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy all withdrawing their participation.

(JTA) — The University of Amsterdam has suspended a student exchange with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, saying the institution has failed to distance itself from human rights violations in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.The Dutch university announced last week that it was cutting the program following advice from an internal committee on projects with its partners in Israel, China and Hungary. The school's executive board requested the inquiry after pro-Palestinian demonstrations roiled the campus last year.  The university also decided not to enter collaborations with more than 20 Hungarian institutions that have been sanctioned by the European Union because they are seen as too tightly controlled by the Hungarian regime. And it determined that Chinese doctoral students who go to the Netherlands through the China Scholarship Council will be allowed to continue, but the university said it would enact new measures to protect their academic freedom from China's government.The guidelines all aim to prevent the University of Amsterdam from “contributing to violations of human rights, misuse of knowledge for undesirable military purposes or serious damage to the environment through educational or research collaborations,” said the administration.

(credit: OLIVIER FITOUSSI/FLASH90)Diverging from the USThe trend marks a sharp divergence from the United States, where schools have virtually universally rebuffed students' demands to sever ties with Israeli institutions, citing principles of academic freedom. The demands came during a wave of student activism last year for which the new Trump administration is now punishing both students and their schools. The exchange program — which had been in place since 1986 — usually sees about 10 students at the Hebrew University and 10 at the University of Amsterdam, the Dutch university told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Hebrew University did not reply to a request for comment.But Dutch students have not participated since Oct. 7, 2023, pursuant to a travel advisory from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Israeli students were allowed to complete their semester in Amsterdam last fall, but no new exchange students were accepted, according to the advisory report.   Stay updated with the latest news!

The school's executive board requested the inquiry after pro-Palestinian demonstrations roiled the campus last year.  The university also decided not to enter collaborations with more than 20 Hungarian institutions that have been sanctioned by the European Union because they are seen as too tightly controlled by the Hungarian regime.

US authorities on Monday said they deported Rasha Alawieh, a Rhode Island doctor who is an assistant professor at Brown University's medical school, to Lebanon last week after discovering “sympathetic photos and videos” of Hassan Nasrallah, a former longtime leader of Hezbollah, and militants in her cell phone's deleted items folder.

Re-sharing a post on X from the Department of Homeland Security on Monday, the White House, wrote ""Bye-bye Rasha"" and then added a photo of a waving Donald Trump from a drive-thru window, in response to the deportation of the Lebanese doctor.

Dr Rasha Alawieh had also told agents that while in Lebanon she attended the funeral last month of Hezbollah's slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, whom she supported from a “religious perspective” as a Shia Muslim, news agency Reuters reported.

The US Department of Justice provided those details as it sought to assure a federal judge in Boston that US Customs and Border Protection did not willfully disobey an order he issued on Friday that should have halted Alawieh's immediate removal.

In its first public explanation for her removal, the Justice Department said Alawieh was denied re-entry to the United States based on what CBP found on her phone and statements she made during an airport interview.

According to a transcript of that interview reviewed by Reuters, she told CBP she did not support Hezbollah but had high regard for Nasrallah because of her religion.

“I'm not a political person,” she said. ""I'm a physician. It's mainly about faith.""

Western governments, including the United States, designate Hezbollah a terrorist group. The Lebanese militant group is part of the ""Axis of Resistance"", an alliance of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that also includes the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which sparked the Gaza war by attacking Israel 17 months ago.

Based on those statements and the discovery of photos on her phone of Nasrallah and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, the Justice Department said CBP concluded ""her true intentions in the United States could not be determined.""

Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have begun a highly anticipated call as the US administration looks to persuade the Russian leader to sign-off on a 30-day ceasefire proposal as a possible pathway to end the war.

The call began at 1400 GMT and is going well, according to White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino. ""The call is going well, and still in progress,"" Scavino wrote on X.

The conversation comes amid growing pressure for an end to the three-year conflict, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions, and left parts of Ukraine in ruins.

Trump is seeking to convince Putin to formally accept the 30-day truce, which Ukrainian officials agreed to last week during US-led talks in Saudi Arabia, spearheaded by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains skeptical of Putin's intentions, arguing that the Kremlin is stalling for time while continuing its bombardment.

Ahead of the call, Trump signaled that territorial control and key infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, would be part of the discussion. The fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe's largest — is believed to be central to the negotiations. The plant has been under Russian control since 2022, raising fears of a nuclear disaster.

""We're going to see if we can work out a ceasefire and, ultimately, peace,"" Trump told reporters on Monday. ""I think we'll be able to do it.""

While Putin expressed support last week for the US ceasefire proposal ""in principle,"" he indicated that several conditions must be met before Russia agrees to halt its offensive. The Kremlin insists on maintaining control over the territories it has seized, including Crimea and large parts of eastern Ukraine.

In contrast, Zelensky has repeatedly asserted that Ukraine's sovereignty is non-negotiable. He warned on Monday that any deal allowing Russia to retain occupied land would be a ""betrayal"" of Ukraine's people.

""Now, almost a week later, it's clear to everyone in the world — even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years — that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,"" Zelensky said in his nightly address.

Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and controls most of four eastern Ukrainian regions following its invasion in February 2022. It controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.

Putin said he sent troops into Ukraine because NATO's creeping expansion threatened Russia's security. He has demanded Ukraine drop its ambition of joining the Western military alliance.

Putin has also said Russia must keep control of Ukrainian territory it has seized, that Western sanctions should be eased and Kyiv must stage a presidential election. Zelenskiy, elected in 2019, rules under martial law he imposed because of the war.

Trump has moved the United States closer to Moscow since coming into office while alienating allies with tariffs and suggestions of annexing Canada and taking over Greenland.

The family of missing 20-year-old Indian-origin US student Sudiksha Konanki has requested police in the Dominican Republic to officially declare her dead, NBC News reported.

Konanki, an Indian citizen and a US permanent resident, was last seen on March 6 at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana. She disappeared while on vacation, and US federal law enforcement agencies are assisting Dominican authorities in the investigation.

Despite extensive search efforts, her body has not been found.

Dominican Republic National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira confirmed that Konanki's family had sent a letter requesting a formal declaration of death, the NBC News report added. The family has not yet responded to media inquiries, news agency PTI reported.

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have confiscated the passport of Joshua Steven Riibe, the last known person to be with Sudiksha Konanki before her disappearance, CNN reported.

Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso questioned Riibe for over six hours over the weekend, and further questioning with a local prosecutor is expected. While Riibe has not been named a suspect or accused of any wrongdoing, he remains under police surveillance and has been interrogated multiple times.

Sudiksha Konanki's family sent a letter to authorities on Monday, acknowledging there is no suspected foul play in her presumed death and expressing trust in the investigation. They also stated their willingness to comply with legal procedures.

Sudiksha Konanki, an aspiring medical student, arrived in Punta Cana on March 3 with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh. Riibe, a 22-year-old from Iowa and a student at St. Cloud State University, said he met her at a hotel bar before the group decided to go to the beach. Surveillance footage from March 6 at 4:15 am captured Konanki and others entering the beach, but at 5 am, she was not seen leaving with the rest of the group.

Riibe later told investigators that they were pulled out to sea by strong waves while swimming, and although he managed to bring Konanki back to shore, she vanished shortly afterward. Dominican authorities maintain that no one is considered a suspect, while US officials are treating it as a missing persons case.

Riibe's lawyer has requested his release, and a judge is expected to rule on the matter soon. His parents have alleged that he has been detained under irregular conditions without access to translators or legal representation.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two NASA astronauts, are about to return to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS), where they have been living for nine months in a drawn-out mission fraught with technical challenges, schedule changes and politics.

Sunita Williams, 59, and Butch Wilmore, 62, had been stuck on the ISS after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a roughly week-long test mission.

The four-person crew, formally part of NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, is scheduled for a splashdown off Florida's coast later on Tuesday at 5:57 pm ET (Wednesday at 3:27am India time).

After Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore's landing on Earth, several key events would follow as part of her post-mission recovery and debriefing:

The absence of gravity has its effects on long-duration space travellers, who experience dizziness, nausea and an unstable gait when they return to Earth.

For Williams and Wilmore, test pilots for Boeing's new Starliner capsule, the eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months as a series of helium leaks and thruster failures deemed their spacecraft unsafe and had to return empty in September.

Astronauts who have travelled on space missions earlier have reported facing difficulty in walking, having bad eyesight, dizziness, and a condition called baby feet where space travellers lose the thick part of the skin on the soles that become soft like a baby's.

""Once the astronaut returns to Earth, they are immediately forced to readjust again, back to Earth's gravity, and can experience issues standing, stabilising their gaze, walking, and turning. For their safety, returning astronauts are often placed in a chair immediately upon return to Earth,"" news agency PTI reported, citing the Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine in a note on body changes in space.

It takes astronauts several weeks to re-calibrate themselves to life on Earth.

The vestibular organ deep inside the ear helps humans keep their bodies balanced while walking on Earth by sending information about gravity to the brain.

On Earth, gravity pulls blood and other body fluids into the lower part of the body, but for astronauts experiencing weightlessness in space, these fluids accumulate in the upper parts of the body, making them look bloated.

""Astronauts returning to earth often experience dizziness when standing up, known as orthostatic hypotension. This occurs because gravity on the earth is stronger than in space, and it is more difficult to deliver blood from the heart to the head,"" the JAXA said.

The lack of gravity causes significant and often irreparable bone density loss. According to NASA, for every month in space, astronauts' weight-bearing bones become roughly one per cent less dense if they don't take precautions to counter this loss.

Many Indians in the United States have been haunted by a question ever since Donald Trump took office – can the President take away their Green Card? A president cannot directly remove an individual's Green Card. However, the administration's policies and enforcement priorities can indeed create risks for permanent residents, especially those whose immigration histories are complex.

The expansion of the ""public charge"" rule was considered one of the most controversial moves during Trump's tenure. It evaluated whether immigrants were likely to rely on government assistance. It was mainly meant to limit new applicants and adjust statuses, but several Green Card holders were afraid it could be used against them. The rule led to concern and confusion, even though it technically did not apply to current Green Card holders.

Immigration enforcement has been ramped up by the Trump administration, with Green Card holders' past records coming under intense scrutiny. Permanent residents with old legal issues, as well as individuals with minor immigration violations, have been feeling threatened.

Executive orders and travel bans have been deepening the uncertainty. While these are mainly aimed at visa holders and new entrants, Green Card holders from certain countries wondered if they would be permitted to get back to the US if they travelled abroad.

A Green Card can be revoked under certain circumstances, such as criminal convictions, fraud in obtaining residency, or abandoning US residency through long absences. However, it is important to note that due process applies in such cases.

A president cannot strip an individual of their Green Card without a legal proceeding. These matters are handled by the Department of Homeland Security and immigration courts. Green Card holders can always defend themselves before an immigration judge, should such a need arise.

Green Card status is usually secure for people who have maintained their residency properly and complied with the law. However, anyone who is not sure about past issues or travel history can reach out to an immigration lawyer to properly understand their rights and risks.

A plane crashed into water shortly after taking off on Monday from Roatan Island, just off the coast of the South American nation of Honduras, killing at least seven people.

10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital, AFP quoted Major Wilmer Guerrero of the fire department as saying.

A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometer from the coast.

The visuals of the crash have been doing rounds on social media.

 

The island's police chief, Lisandro Muñoz, told another local broadcaster, Noticiero Hoy Mismo, that the plane crashed into the water shortly after takeoff. According to him, recovery and rescue efforts were proving difficult as the plane fell into the sea.

Honduran carrier Lanhsa operated the Jetstream aircraft and was carrying 17 passengers, including three crew members, the country's transport minister told local radio, but without detailing the number of fatalities.

The passengers on board the aircraft included a US national, a French national, as well as two minors. The plane was heading to the La Ceiba airport on the Honduran mainland.

In another aviation incident, this time from the United States, a Delta Airlines regional jet struck the runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport late on Sunday while executing a go-around.

No injuries were reported in the incident.

The left wing of Endeavor Air Flight 4814 made contact with the runway at around 10:10 p.m. EDT while the pilot was executing a go-around due to an unstable approach, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement.

The FAA statement promised that the federal agency would investigate the incident.

According to a statement from Delta Airlines, the flight had departed from Jacksonville, Florida for New York with 76 passengers and four crew.

The airline said the crew ""followed established procedures to safely enact a go-around at New York-LaGuardia. The aircraft landed safely and proceeded to its arrival gate.""

The Israeli military said it hit targets across Gaza early on Tuesday, ending a weeks-long deadlock over extending the ceasefire that paused fighting in January, with Palestinian health ministry officials reporting at least 413 dead, reported news agency AP.

A senior Hamas official cited by Reuters said Israel is “unilaterally ending the Gaza ceasefire” agreement after the series of Israeli strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians.

Senior Hamas security official Mahmoud Abu Watfa was killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, Reuters quoted Hamas media.

According to Palestinian health ministry head cited by news agency AP, at least 413, including several children, were killed, and dozens of others were wounded in Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip. The ministry says at least 660 people have been wounded in the strikes.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency said in a joint statement that they were conducting extensive strikes on targets belonging to Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

White House was consulted by Israel in Gaza strikes on Monday, Fox News reported.

Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing hostages in Gaza to an unknown fate, Reuters quoted a Hamas official.

Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed the military to take ""strong action"" against Hamas in Gaza in response to the Palestinian militant group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals.

""Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,"" prime minister's office statement said.

According to medics and witnesses, three houses were struck in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building was hit in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah were also attacked.

The Palestinian civil emergency service reported at least 35 airstrikes on Gaza.

The increase in violence comes amid ongoing disagreements between Israel and Hamas regarding the continuation of the three-phase ceasefire that started in January.

Arab mediators, supported by the United States, have been unable to resolve the differences between the two sides during the discussions held over the past two weeks. Over a six-week period, Hamas released around three dozen hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first leg of the ceasefire agreement.

However, since the first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago, the two sides have been unable to agree on a path forward for a second phase, which was intended to secure the release of nearly 60 remaining hostages and bring the war to an end. Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to resume military action and, earlier this month, halted all food and aid deliveries into the besieged territory in an attempt to pressure Hamas.

The war began with Hamas' cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, which killed approximately 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. In response, Israel launched a military offensive that has resulted in the deaths of over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced around 90 per cent of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and militants, but reports that more than half of the casualties have been women and children.

“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Netanyahu's office stated.

The ceasefire had provided some relief to Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to what was left of their homes.

Israel had notified the Donald Trump administration before launching “extensive strikes” in Gaza, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. At least 200 Palestinians, including many children, were killed, medics told news agency Reuters as Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early on Tuesday.

Israel said it was striking dozens of Hamas targets in its heaviest assault in the territory since a ceasefire took effect in January.

“The Trump administration and the White House were consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza tonight – and as President Trump has made it clear, Hamas, the Houthis, all those who seek to terrorise not just Israel but also the United States of America, will see a price to pay. All hell will break loose,” Leavitt told Fox News in an interview.

“All of the terrorists in the Middle East… Iranian-backed terror proxies and Iran themselves should take President Trump seriously when he says he's not afraid to stand for law-abiding people,” Leavitt added.

The sudden overnight attack shattered a period of relative calm and raised the prospect of a full return to fighting in a 17-month war that has killed over 48,000 Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised questions about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.

In a statement, Hamas condemned what it called Israel's “unprovoked escalation” and said it had put the fate of the hostages in jeopardy.

Over the weekend, US envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been leading mediation efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately “or pay a severe price.""

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks.

A senior Hamas official tells Reuters that Israel is unilaterally ending the Gaza ceasefire agreement.

The Palestine-based terror group issued a statement, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government's decision to resume Israel's “aggression” against Gaza exposes the hostages “to an unknown fate"".

Hamas called on the mediators — the US, Qatar and Egypt — to hold Netanyahu fully responsible for ending the ceasefire deal, The Times of Israel reported.

The terror group called on Arab and Muslim countries to back “Palestinian resistance” aimed at “breaking the unjust blockade imposed on Gaza.” Hamas also called on the UN Security Council to urgently convene to issue a resolution obligating Israel to halt its “aggression.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of “repeated refusal to release our hostages” and rejecting proposals from US President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.

""Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,"" it said in a statement.

In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the US administration before it carried out the strikes, which the military said targeted mid-level Hamas commanders and leadership officials as well as infrastructure belonging to the militant group.

Negotiating teams from Israel and Hamas had been in Doha as mediators from Egypt and Qatar sought to bridge the gap between the two sides following the end of an initial phase in the ceasefire, which saw 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

With the backing of the United States, Israel had been pressing for the return of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a longer-term truce that would have halted fighting until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday in April.

However, Hamas had been insisting on moving to negotiations for a permanent end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, in accordance with the terms of the original ceasefire agreement.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are beginning their journey back to Earth today after being stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) for nine months.

NASA's live coverage of the Earthbound journey showed Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore posing for their final photos aboard the station before they packed up and closed the hatches to begin a 17-hour trip back to Earth early on Tuesday.

After their autonomous undocking from the ISS, the astronaut crew is scheduled to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico at 5:57 PM ET Tuesday, with the exact location depending on local weather conditions. They will be flown to NASA's Johnson Space Center for a few days of routine post-mission medical checks.

Their ride home is a Crew Dragon capsule from Elon Musk's SpaceX, part of a contingency plan devised by NASA last year after the failure of the Boeing Starliner capsule that took them to the station in June.

NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, the other two members of Crew-9, flew to the ISS in September on a Crew Dragon craft with two empty seats. They joined Wilmore and Williams on Tuesday's return trip.

NASA previously planned to return Crew-9 on Wednesday night, but unfavorable weather later in the week would have complicated the Crew Dragon capsule's return, leading the agency to move the return trip up to Tuesday.

The space station departure is the start of a highly anticipated end to the drawn-out saga of ""Butch and Suni"", who had been part of a key test mission with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. The mission was initially expected to last eight days. Wilmore and Williams were the first crew to fly the Starliner in a test flight for the capsule in June.

The failed test mission was another blow to Boeing's space unit, which has struggled for years to bring Starliner to market to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon, a dominant vehicle in the global human spaceflight domain.

After issues with the craft's propulsion system, NASA deemed it too risky to bring the astronaut duo back home and opted to fold them into the agency's Crew-9 mission instead. Starliner returned to Earth empty in September.

Wilmore and Williams' mission turned into a normal NASA rotation to the ISS and they have been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the station's other five astronauts.

The ISS, about 254 miles in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy mainly managed by the US and Russia.

Mirra Andreeva likes to carry a little notebook with her to court. It contains handwritten notes on the opponents the 17-year-old has faced, and she often flips through it during mid-match changeovers (TV cameras snooped in to capture a page headlined, “INDIAN WELLS Rybakina”).

 Over the years, as the annals of women's tennis turn chapters on generational prodigies, Andreeva's name will stand out in the current era. As the youngest champion of the prestigious Indian Wells tournament since Serena Williams in 1999. As the youngest woman to win back-to-back WTA 1000 events since Martina Hingis in 1997. And as one of only three women aged under 18 to have beaten the world No.1 and No.2 in the same tournament.   The other two? Serena Williams and Steffi Graf. That's some elite company to be in.  Andreeva was always looked at as a prodigious talent, and the Russian's sizzling run in the Californian desert could potentially light her path to making further inroads into such elusive clubs.  When the teen turned the tables on Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the final on Sunday, she capped off a terrific week in which she took down world No.2 Iga Swiatek, Australian Open quarterfinalist Elina Svitolina, and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina. Make that a terrific month, swinging back to Dubai where she also won and went past Swiatek and Rybakina to become the youngest WTA 1000 champion.  Sabalenka, Swiatek and Rybakina are currently the three most powerful pros on the women's tour flaunting Grand Slam-winning pedigree, and this baby-faced giant-killer has defeated them all over the past month — two of them twice. No woman has won more matches so far this year than Andreeva. No teen has created quite a stir in recent times — perhaps with the exception of Coco Gauff, now 21 — since another Russian teen sensation turned star, Maria Sharapova.  This rip-roaring Russian, now a world No 6, is on the fast lane. And she's loving it. “Maybe it's all happening a bit fast. But I like it,” Andreeva said after winning Indian Wells, often described as the fifth Grand Slam. “It's not bad to win two tournaments in a row. If it's happening fast, I take it.” It was always meant to happen for her; the question was when rather than if.  The rise and riseBorn in the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk, Andreeva started playing as a six-year-old along with her elder sister Erika (also a pro, currently ranked 95). Sensing the siblings' potential, the Andreeva family moved to the resort own of Sochi for better training facilities and then to Cannes, France, under coaches Jean-Rene Lisnard and Jean-Christophe Faurel. That's where Andreeva developed her craft which made her the top-ranked junior and the Australian Open girls' finalist in 2023. That season also gave the world the first signs of her potential, as she made the Round of 16 at WTA Madrid Open and then Wimbledon as a qualifier.  Those baby steps turned into giant strides with the arrival of Conchita Martinez as her coach last year. The Spanish 1994 Wimbledon champion had worked with former top 10 pros in Garbine Muguruza and Karolina Pliskova, and instantly saw a bright prospect and quick learner in Andreeva (the handwritten notes were Martinez's idea).  Blooming in this partnership, Andreeva reached the 2024 French Open semi-finals beating Sabalenka, captured her first WTA title at Iasi in July and the 2024 Paris Olympics doubles silver. Her victory over Sabalenka at Indian Wells was only her second in six meetings, but one that is now accompanied by the belief that she can beat any player on her day. “I would say that now I'm sure that I can try and win really big matches against big players. Before I would just come out on court and try to win as many games as possible, because I had nothing to lose,” Andreeva told WTA. There's also a Martinez mark on her game style, which features court movement and craft as her bigger strengths than raw power. It's a style that often elicits comparisons with another former teen sensation — Swiss great Hingis.  “I actually watched a lot of her matches,” Andreeva had said. “I really like the way she plays.” Trailblazer like no otherAndreeva is an anomaly at present, as the only teen ranked inside the top 100 of women's tennis which is increasingly getting physical. Andreeva has also had slightly divergent trajectory from the recent young breakout faces. While most have burst through almost overnight on one-Slam wonder moments (think Emma Raducanu or Bianca Andreescu) before losing their sheen to the rigours of the professional tour, Andreeva has been through a few deflating downs before this heady high.  She has spoken about the junior Australian Open final defeat as being among the biggest learning lessons of her career. She broke down inconsolably during the presentation ceremony after losing the Ningbo Open final late last year on the back of some early tournament exits. The presentation ceremony at Indian Wells would bring out Andreeva's infectious smile, as also her unfiltered personality that adds to the charm of this star in the making shining brighter than ever.  In the winners' on-court speech that often sees players deliver monotonous “thank you” sentences in a particular order (opponent, sponsors, crowd, and so on), Andreeva had a rather refreshing thank you reserved for the end.  “I would like to thank myself,” Andreeva said, smiling. “For fighting until the end and for always believing in me and for never quitting.” Fast lane or not, potential Grand Slam champion or not, this young talent is certainly a breath of fresh air. “I mean, it's nice to be me, I guess,” she said.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months, have begun their journey back to Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule, with the first leg of the trip - the undocking from ISS - taking place on Tuesday.

Follow Sunita Williams' return to Earth LIVE here.

Wilmore and Williams, seated inside a Crew Dragon capsule with two other crew members, Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov and NASA astronaut Nick Hague, undocked from the ISS at 1:05 am New York time on Tuesday.

NASA shared the video of the spacecraft's undocking from the space station as the 17-hour-long journey started.

The capsule is expected to travel through space, plunge through the atmosphere, and ultimately fall to Earth under parachutes before splashing down off the Florida coast at 5:57 pm local time.

Before leaving the station, Williams and Wilmore posed for a final photograph in space, which has been their home since June last year.

After undergoing standard medical checks at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, both will board a flight to Houston, where they will be reunited with their families.

NASA scheduled a post-return press conference at 7:30 p.m. New York time on March 18 with agency and SpaceX officials to discuss the mission.

For NASA astronauts, there's always the risk that a routine mission will last longer than planned. The agency has extended the stays of astronauts on the space station for months at a time to accommodate changes in traffic schedules or technical issues.

“We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human spaceflight,” Wilmore said during a press conference from space, Bloomberg reported.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore arrived at the ISS last June on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft with plans to spend eight days in space. But it turned into more than nine months when NASA decided in August the pair would come home on a rival SpaceX capsule instead, due to a snag in the propulsion system of the spacecraft.

The Starliner returned to Earth in September, without the crew on board.

Their saga became an international sensation, with some media outlets dubbing them the “stranded” astronauts — a nod to NASA's reluctance to have them fly home in their original spacecraft. The ordeal put an embarrassing spotlight on Boeing's struggling space business after the company was rocked by a series of crises that forced a change in senior leadership.

In parallel, their story has highlighted how dependent NASA has become on SpaceX to keep the agency's major human spaceflight programs up and running.

As NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are set to return to Earth on SpaceX's ‘Dragon' capsule, the belated journey brings back memories from three years ago, when a crew leaving the International Space Station had to use diapers due to a broken toilet on their capsule belonging to Elon Musk's company.

Four NASA astronauts had to spend 20 hours in the SpaceX capsule on their return journey, right from the time of undocking to that of their splashdown.

Megan McArthur, one of the four astronauts belonging to the American space agency, had back in 2021 described the situation as ""suboptimal"" but manageable, a report from The Associated Press had said.

She said that a spaceflight is full of little challenges, saying that the broken toilet was one such issue which the crew will take care of. ""So we are not too worried about it,"" she had said.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will return home after having been stuck in space for more than nine months. They had travelled to the space station in June last year on Boeing Starliner's maiden crewed flight. Owing to helium leak and propulsion issues, the spacecraft was deemed unfit for the duo's return, turning their days-long stay into a months-long one.

NASA earlier on Tuesday shared an update on their return and said that the SpaceX Crew-9 mission had successfully undocked from the International Space Station, undertaking its return journey to Earth.

Back in November 2021, present along with NASA's Megan McArthur was French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who told reporters that the past six months had been intense. All the four astronauts had conducted a series of spacewalks to upgrade the space station's power grid and experienced thruster firings by docked Russian vehicles that even sent the ISS on brief spins.

They also hosted a private Russian film crew, which was a first for the space station.

Standing out in the list of issues was the toilet leak, with astronauts having to pull up panels in their capsule only to find pools of urine.

The issue was noticed first during SpaceX's private flight in September 2021, when a tube separated and spilled urine under the floorboards. Reportedly, the space company had fixed the toilet on the capsule which was awaiting lift off. But, they said that the toilet in orbit was unusable.

However, engineers had said that the toilet leak had not structurally compromised the capsule, deeming it safe for the astronauts' return journey. NASA had said that the crew was going to have to depend on absorbent ""undergarments"".

The SpaceX capsule, carrying NASA astronauts Megan McArthur, Shane Kimbrough, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, had been launched to the space station on April 23, 2021. Their capsule was certified for a maximum of 210 days in space.

Additionally, the crew had grown the first chilli peppers in space, which McArthur had described as a ""nice moral boost"" amid the slew of challenges. She had said that the peppers had a ""nice spiciness to them, little bit of lingering burn"".

A series of explosions were heard across the Gaza Strip early on Tuesday as residents reported several Israeli airstrikes, witnesses told Reuters, in the largest strikes since the January 19 ceasefire began.

The Israeli military has said that it conducted extensive strikes on targets belonging to Hamas in Gaza. At least 330 Palestinians, including children, were killed in airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, AFP reported quoting Gaza's health ministry. Scores of others are reported to be wounded. Hamas media reported the death of senior security official Mahmoud Abu Watfa in the strikes.

“In accordance with the political echelon, the IDF and ISA are currently conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip,” the Israeli Defence Forces said in a statement on social media platform X.

Israel's Prime Minister's office said on Tuesday that it instructed the army to strike Hamas across Gaza.

The statement quoted by the Associated Press said it was because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.

In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ""Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate"".

Three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses quoted in the Reuters report.

The escalating violence comes amid disagreement between Israel and Hamas on how to sustain the three-phase ceasefire that came into effect on January 19.

Arab mediators, backed by the United States haven't been able to hammer out differences between the two warring parties in talks held over the past two weeks.

On Monday, Hamas accused Israel of failing to meet its commitments under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, citing in particular the withholding of temporary shelter items and Israel's decision to close crossing points to aid shipments at the beginning of the month.

The first phase of the agreement, which ended earlier this month, saw Hamas release more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.

As part of the phase, Israel withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a strategic route that divided Gaza into two parts, allowing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to what was left of their homes in the north.

Argentina great Lionel Messi shared a message after he was ruled out of the national team squad for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers against South American rivals Uruguay and Brazil. Messi has sustained a “low-grade” adductor injury confirmed by his club Inter Miami. The 37-year-old felt discomfort during Inter Miami's 2-1 win over Atalanta United, where he scored the opening goal for the team. Messi has had a shaky start to the season in the USA, as he has been dealing with fitness concerns. This month, Messi missed three games but returned on Thursday for the second leg of the round-of-16 CONCACAF Champions Cup tie against Cavalier SC. However, now his recent injury is a big blow to the Argentine team.

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner posted an Instagram story sharing an update on his unavailability for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers in the coming international break.

“It's sad to miss these two very special matches with the National Team against Uruguay and Brazil. As always, I wanted to be there, but at the last moment, a not-so-serious injury that forces me to stop for a while before returning to play left me out,” Messi explained on his Instagram account.

He further vowed to cheer his team as a fan for the two big clashes.

“From here, I will be cheering and supporting as just another fan. Vamos Argentina!” he concluded his message.

Argentina, the defending World Cup champions, can ensure qualification for next year's tournament in their next two games.

They lead the 10-team South American qualifying group by five points ahead of the game with Uruguay in Montevideo.

Argentina will also miss the services of injured Roma striker Paulo Dybala and River Plate full-back Paulo Montiel. Lionel Scaloni also dropped Alejandro Garnacho and Claudio Echeverri from the larger squad announced on March 2.

The parents of missing 20-year-old Indian student Sudiksha Konanki have asked the police in the Dominican Republic to declare her dead, PTI quoted US media reports.

Konanki went missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic. She was last seen on March 6 at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana town.

The US federal law enforcement agencies are working with authorities in the Dominican Republic in the probe into her disappearance. 

Diego Pesqueira, spokesperson of the Dominican Republic National Police, said that the Indian student's family sent the agency a letter requesting a declaration of death.

According to a New York Post report, Konanki's family in a letter said there is no foul play involved in her presumed death after she vanished froma Punta Cana beach in the early hours of March 6, ABC News reported.

The father and mother also wrote they trust the authorities' probe into the case and noted Joshua Riibe, the last person to see the young woman alive, has cooperated with investigators.

Konanki's parents in the same letter said that they understand that certain legal procedures must be followed for their request, but that they are prepared to comply with any necessary formalities or documentation, ABC News quoted the sources in a report.

Riibe is not considered a suspect in the case and has not been accused of wrongdoing.

It's unclear why Riibe's passport was confiscated. Since Konanki went missing in the early hours of March 6, Riibe, a 22-year-old from Rock Rapids, Iowa, and a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, has remained under police surveillance in the Dominican Republic. 

He has been taken to the police station for interrogation multiple times, his parents said in a statement.

Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke of President Donald Trump on Tuesday, criticizing the president's call for the impeachment of a federal judge over an immigration-related ruling.

Roberts emphasized the importance of respecting judicial independence, stating that impeachment is not a proper remedy for disagreement with a court's decision.

""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,"" Roberts said in a statement released by the Supreme Court. ""The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.""

Roberts' comments followed Trump's call for the impeachment of Washington-based District Judge James Boasberg. On Saturday, Boasberg ordered the administration to halt the removal of alleged Venezuelan gang members, ruling against the president's use of a rarely invoked 18th-century law.

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the judge, claiming he was undermining the will of the people.

""I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!"" Trump wrote.

At the center of the dispute is Trump's March 15 invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The president argued that the law authorized his administration to bypass standard immigration procedures and deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a criminal gang he claimed had ties to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The Alien Enemies Act grants presidents the authority to deport non-citizens whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power, but only in times of war. It has been invoked only three times in American history: during the War of 1812, World War One and World War Two, when it was used to justify the mass internment of people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent.

The controversy began when a group of Venezuelan men in US immigration custody filed a lawsuit on March 15, seeking to block the deportations. They argued that Trump's use of the 1798 law was unlawful because it applies only when the United States is at war or has been invaded by a ""foreign nation or government""—neither of which is the case.

US president Donald Trump on Monday said he was ending the Secret Service protection to his predecessor Joe Biden's children Hunter and Ashley “immediately.” The privilege was granted by the Democrat shortly before leaving office in January.

Trump alleged that 18 agents assigned to Hunter Biden's security while on a vacation in South Africa this week, calling it “ridiculous”, and 13 agents were in charge of Ashley Biden's protection, both of which “will be taken off the list.”

“Please be advised that, effective immediately, Hunter Biden will no longer receive Secret Service protection. Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list,” Trump wrote.

The US president was asked whether he would revoke the protection for the former president's son. during his tour of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

Trump said it was the first time he heard about the matter. “Well, we have done that with many. I would say if there are 18 with Hunter Biden, that will be something I'll look at this afternoon. I'm going to take a look at that,” he said.

A Secret Service spokesperson told AFP that the force was aware of Trump's decision. “We are aware of the President's decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden. The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible.”

Under US federal law former president's and their spouses receive life-long Secret Service protection. Protection granted to their immediate family members ends when they end their presidential term. Both Trump and Biden had extended the protection to their adult children for six months before leaving the White House.

Nearly three weeks after a disasterous meeting with Ukraine's President Zelensky at the White House intended to find a peaceful end to the years-long war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump today dialled his Russian counterpart in a fresh attempt to find an end to the conflict.

Donald Trump, who called Vladimir Putin at 10 am Eastern Time (US), spoke to the Russian leader for over two hours. The call went well, said the White House.

Happening Now—President Trump is currently in the Oval Office speaking with President Vladimir Putin of Russia since 10:00amEDT. The call is going well, and still in progress.

Both leaders negotiated on ways to secure a ceasefire in the eastern European conflict zone. Tens of thousands of live have been lost so far in the war that has been going on for more than three years.

Even before the phone call, President Trump had already made it clear that he was ready to discuss what parts of captured Ukraine Russia will be allowed to keep. Moscow and Washington are already talking about ""dividing up certain assets,"" the US President had said over the weekend.

European nations are worried that President Trump, who has not hidden his admiration for Russia's Putin, may agree to cede too much Ukrainian territory to Russia. They are also very concerned that Ukraine is not being consulted on decisions that may be agreed upon in today's phonecall.

Since Zelensky's Oval Office showdown with President Trump, Ukraine has agreed to temporarily stop the war for 30 days and engage in dailogue with Russia, but President Putin has set a string of conditions, which Moscow has said is non-negotiable. And only if these guarantees can be provided, will Moscow and Kyiv sit for talks.

Rejecting a barrage of conditions set by Moscow, Kyiv has said that it expects Moscow to ""unconditionally"" accept a ceasefire. ""It is time for Russia to show whether it really wants peace,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga had said.

Doubling down on Moscow's conditions for Kyiv and the rest of Europe, Vladimir Putin has said that any ceasefire that Russia accepts will only benefit Ukraine as his troops are ""steadily advancing"" through Ukrainian territory.

President Putin has, in no uncertain terms, made it clear that Moscow will never accept NATO troops deployed as peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. Russia has maintainted that it is because of NATO coming to Ukraine in the first place, that led to the war. Putin has also said that he expects the US to stop arming Ukraine for any peace deal to even be considered.

On Sunday, two days before the phonecall with Putin, Donald Trump said he would discuss issues of ""land"" and ""power plants"" with President Putin - a likely reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, that fell to Russia in the first days of war.

President Trump followed that up on Monday with a post on his social media platform Truth Social that ""many elements of a final agreement have been agreed to, but much still remains to be settled.""

Talks with Russia are ""getting down to a very critical stage,"" he added.

The United States has firmly rejected a suggestion by French politician Raphael Glucksmann that the Statue of Liberty should be returned to France, dismissing his remarks as unwarranted and politically motivated.

Glucksmann, a centre-left politician, recently stated that France should take back the iconic statue, arguing that the US no longer upholds the values that inspired France to gift the monument. His remarks were seen as a direct criticism of US President Donald Trump's policies, particularly regarding scientific freedom and international relations.

""Give us back the Statue of Liberty... We're going to tell the Americans, who have chosen to side with the tyrants and fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom -- 'Give us back the Statue of Liberty,'"" Glucksmann said.

""We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently, you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home.""

The statement sparked a sharp response from the White House, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying that France would be ""speaking German"" without US help in World War II.

""Absolutely not. And my advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now. So they should be very grateful to our great country,"" she said.

The Statue of Liberty was presented in New York Harbor on October 28, 1886, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence. Created by French artist Auguste Bartholdi, it was a present from the people of France to the United States, representing the common values of freedom and democracy.

While Paris does have a smaller replica of the statue on an island in the Seine, Glucksmann's remarks were largely seen as a symbolic political statement rather than a genuine demand for its return.

A vocal critic of Trump, Glucksmann has strongly opposed the US President's shift in foreign policy, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine.

He has also condemned far-right leaders in France, accusing them of being ""a fan club"" for Trump and billionaire Elon Musk.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who were stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months, are set to return to Earth and splash down off the coast of the American state of Florida early on Wednesday.

According to NASA, Williams and Wilmore undocked from the ISS at 10:35 am IST Tuesday and set on a 17-hour trip back to Earth. The spacecraft, Elon Musk-led SpaceX's Dragon, will splash down at around 3:27 am IST Wednesday.

The two astronauts flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight. The spaceship, however, developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back and later returned empty.

In a post on X, NASA said: ""#Crew9 will be difficult to spot in the daytime as it reenters Earth's atmosphere, but if you want to keep an eye out for @SpaceX's Dragon as it heads home today, we have the map for you.""

Eight years before the Boeing Starliner suffered glitches, ensuring an extended stay on the International Space Station for nine months, NDTV had spoken to Sunita Williams and asked whether she thought flying on a privately built spacecraft could be risky. The Indian-origin astronaut, who had already begun collaborating with Boeing at the time, had said that while there were bumps and even a few heated discussions, she was confident that the spacecraft would be safe when people flew in it.

Speaking exclusively to NDTV during a visit to India in 2016, Ms Williams also spoke about being the first astronaut to have samosas on the International Space Station (ISS) and how she intended to carry an idol of Lord Ganesh, whom she called her ""good-luck charm"", on her next spaceflight. Click here to read more.

Union Minister Jitendra Singh has called NASA astronaut Sunita Williams a ""daughter of India"", as the world awaits her return along with Butch Wilmore, both of whom have spent nearly nine months on the International Space Station.

Singh said the country is ""proud"" of her and praying for her safe return.

""...She (Sunita Williams), being a daughter of India, has made the entire world proud...She has successfully accomplished the task that she was assigned to. While all of us pray for a safe return, we also feel proud of her...A very pleasant coincidence is the fact that today itself, Prime Minister Modi made a statement on Maha Kumbh in the Parliament and incidentally, Sunita also expressed her best wishes for the Kumbh...,"" Singh told ANI.

The minister also referred to Sunita Williams' Indian roots in Gujarat and highlighted that Indian space scientists are making waves internationally.

""There is a very deep connection between her and India and of course Gujarat, the state that she belongs to. This is also an indication of the fact that most of the space agencies outside India, including NASA, are now having Indian boys and girls leading most of their important missions...,"" he said.



Kalpana Chawla, who would have turned 62 this year, was the first Indian woman to go to space.

Born in Karnal, Haryana, on March 17, 1962, Ms Chawla was fascinated by aeroplanes and space from a young age. Encouraged by her family, she pursued her passion by earning a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College. She then moved to the United States, obtaining a Master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas in 1984, followed by a PhD in the same subject from the University of Colorado in 1988.

Her academic excellence and determination took her to NASA in 1994. By 1997, she had achieved what no other Indian woman had before - she became an astronaut.

Kalpana Chawla went on two space missions that cemented her place in history.

Her first mission, STS-87 in 1997, was aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, where she served as a mission specialist and robotic arm operator. This journey made her the first woman of Indian origin in space. 

Captain Sunita Williams, the Indian-origin American astronaut is getting ready for her next space mission, but this time, on a commercial space flight.

Ms Williams, a NASA veteran and a world record holding woman astronaut with seven space walks, says India is never far away from her heart, on earth or in space. She has been touring India trying to convince ISRO to partner with NASA on its human journey to Mars.

She prides on probably being the world's only samosa eating astronaut and has also been holding classes for Indian students. In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Ms Willaims explains why she would like more Indian stuff in her space bunker.

""I love samosas and I had asked for some special things, this being one of them. My family was able to work with NASA to get clear packaging and they put samosas in there and it was a nice surprise,"" Ms Williams said.

Residents of Sunita Williams' ancestral village in Gujarat's Mehsana district are gearing up for Diwali-like festivities to celebrate her scheduled return to Earth.

Jhulasan village, known as the ancestral home of Williams' father, Deepak Pandya, is alive with excitement. Villagers have been praying for her safety, with many offering special prayers and lighting an Akhand Jyot (eternal flame) at the local temple of Goddess Dola Mata.

According to Williams' cousin, Navin Pandya, a grand procession will be held in her honour, accompanied by prayer chanting and fireworks to create a festive atmosphere similar to Diwali and Holi.

The villagers are keen to invite her to her paternal village in future.

""The atmosphere here is festive, with everyone eagerly anticipating her return. We will definitely invite her to visit Jhulasan in the future. It would be an honour to have her among us in her ancestral village,"" Pandya said.

Here are some of the experiments Crew 9 performed during their 9-month stay in space:

Micro-Algae For Generating Oxygen

Nick Hague worked on growing Arthrospira micro-algae on the ISS to help convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. These tiny algae perform photosynthesis, just like plants on Earth, helping keep the safe-to-breathe oxygen inside the spacecraft. It can also be treated as food when fresh food is not available during long-duration space missions. This experiment was led by the European Space Agency (ESA).

Improving Astronauts' Health

Butch Wilmore installed the compact workout machine called European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D) on ISS for testing. The modular device combines cycling, rowing, and resistance exercises to help astronauts stay fit during long space missions. Other than this, it is also designed to prevent bone and muscle loss and improve heart health on future missions.

Red Romaine Lettuce

As part of the Plant Habitat-07 experiment, astronauts on the ISS grew red romaine lettuce in the Advanced Plant Habitat. The study is about how different moisture levels affect the microbial communities in plants and water. The purpose of the study is to understand how less-than-ideal conditions affect plant growth. The findings will help scientists create more effective farming systems that would produce nutritious food for astronauts on upcoming space flights. Click here to read more.

As Sunita Williams is set to return home after nine months on the International Space Station, Dinesh Rawal, Sunita Williams cousin brother in Gujarat, expressed happiness and said she is the pride of the nation.

""Everyone in the family, including her mother, brother and sister, is happy that she is coming back home. Our entire family is delighted and eagerly awaits her return... We have started offering prayers and visited many temples for her safety... It is a huge day for us... She is the pride of the nation... We are doing a 'Yagna' for her return and will distribute sweets upon her return,"" Rawal told ANI.

According to retired NASA astronaut Cady Coleman, there is no special overtime salary for astronauts. Since they are federal employees, their time in space is treated just like any regular work trip on Earth. They continue to earn their regular pay, with NASA covering their food and living expenses on the ISS.

The only additional compensation they receive is a small daily stipend for incidentals - reportedly just $4 (Rs 347) per day, Ms Coleman told Washingtonian.

For reference, during her 159-day mission in 2010-11, Ms Coleman received a total of around $636 (over Rs 55,000) in extra pay. Using the same calculation, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore - after spending over 287 days in space - will likely receive just $1,148 (approximately Rs 1 lakh) each in additional compensation.NASA has maintained that the astronauts are not technically ""stranded"", as they have been actively working on the ISS.NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are classified under the GS-15 pay grade, the highest level for federal employees under the General Schedule (GS) system. GS-15 government employees receive an annual base salary ranging between $125,133 - $162,672 (approximately Rs 1.08 crore - Rs 1.41 crore).

For their extended 9-month stay on the ISS, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore will earn a prorated salary between $93,850 - $122,004 (approximately Rs 81 lakh - Rs 1.05 crore). 

Including the $1,148 (around Rs 1 lakh) in incidental pay, their total earnings for the mission is expected to be $94,998 - $123,152 (approximately Rs 82 lakh - Rs 1.06 crore).

The Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in Bangladesh has expressed ""deep concern"" over the remarks of Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence for the US, on the situation in Bangladesh. In an exclusive interview with NDTV, Gabbard said the ""longtime unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others has been a major area of concern"" for the Donald Trump administration.

Responding to her remarks, Bangladesh's interim government said in a social media post, ""We note with deep concern and distress the remarks made by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, in which she alleged 'persecution and killing' of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that 'the threat of Islamic terrorists' in the country is 'rooted' in the 'ideology and objective' to 'rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate'.

""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism.""

The interim government in Dhaka said Gabbard's comments are ""not based on any evidence or specific allegations"". ""They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts,"" it said.

The interim government said ""groundlessly linking Bangladesh to the idea of an 'Islamist caliphate' undermines the hard work of countless Bangladeshis and their friends and partners around the world who are committed to peace, stability, and progress"". ""Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate',"" it said.

""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions. In support of our shared global efforts to combat extremism and terrorism, the Interim Government of Bangladesh remains committed to engaging in constructive dialogue based on facts and on respect for the sovereignty and security of all nations,"" the interim government said.



In her remarks yesterday, Gabbard said, ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate."" ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they chose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""

The US, she said, is deeply concerned about the situation in Bangladesh and that the Trump administration is focused and committed to defeating ""Islamist terrorism"" globally.

The interim government in Bangladesh, with Yunus as Chief Advisor, took charge after the Awami League dispensation was overthrown in the aftermath of nationwide protests. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had to flee to India. Following the change of guard, there have been reports of religious minorities being targeted. India has earlier expressed concern over such reports and conveyed it to the Bangladesh leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) for over nine months, have finally begun their journey home. According to NASA, their SpaceX Dragon spacecraft undocked from the ISS at 10:35 am IST and is expected to splash down off the Florida coast around 3:27 am IST on Wednesday.

Reentering Earth's atmosphere is one of the most intense phases of space travel. NASA explains that as a spacecraft plunges into the atmosphere, it encounters extreme conditions, including temperatures reaching up to 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The spacecraft must be engineered to withstand hypersonic speeds and an enormous slowdown before landing. From the astronaut's perspective, the view from a window during reentry is nothing but a wall of fire. Follow Sunita Williams Homecoming Live Updates Here

How NASA Prepares For Reentry

NASA's Entry Systems & Technology Division plays a crucial role in designing materials and systems that ensure a safe return to Earth. The Ames Research Centre in California has been at the forefront of reentry technology since 1961. Using heat shields, parachutes, and advanced software, NASA engineers develop solutions that help spacecraft survive the fiery descent.

NASA has learned invaluable lessons from past missions, from the Apollo moon missions to the Mars Science Laboratory and Stardust comet sample return mission. Even the Space Shuttle programme, which featured reusable orbiters, provided valuable insights into reentry aerodynamics.

The Apollo, Challenger, Columbia Lessons Learned Programme (ACCLLP), established in 2016, ensures that insights from critical missions are shared across generations to prevent past failures from repeating.

The Apollo 13 mission, famously called a ""successful failure,"" demonstrated the importance of contingency planning and problem-solving when an oxygen tank explosion jeopardised the crew's survival. 

NASA's Lessons Learned Information System (LLIS) supports knowledge-sharing, allowing engineers to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in future missions.

NASA's Space Shuttle program, which ran from 1981 to 2011, was the first to use reusable spacecraft for human spaceflight. The fleet included Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour, designed to carry up to seven astronauts and various payloads into low Earth orbit. 

The Shuttle launched like a rocket, operated in space, and returned to Earth like a glider. It played a crucial role in deploying satellites, conducting scientific experiments, repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, and assembling the ISS. The program completed 135 missions but faced major tragedies - the Challenger disaster in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 - leading to critical safety improvements.

The Shuttle consisted of an orbiter vehicle, two solid rocket boosters, and an external fuel tank, with all components except the tank being reusable. After the programme ended in 2011, NASA shifted focus to new spaceflight technologies and partnerships, using lessons from the Shuttle era to develop future exploration missions, including Artemis and commercial crew programmes.

Joshua Riibe, the man who last saw missing Indian-American student Sudiksha Konanki in the Dominican Republic and the 'person of interest' in the case, has told the country's police that they must let him go home. Mr Riibe has been ""in custody"" over the past few days and is repeatedly being questioned by authorities in the Caribbean.

However, he has not been charged or named a suspect in the case yet.

Mr Riibe's lawyer Beatriz Santana in a motion filed on Monday said that the 22-year-old cannot be detained any longer without being charged, reported the New York Times.

Despite not being a suspect, officials have confiscated Mr Riibe's passport and have kept him holed up at a hotel.

""If he wants to leave the hotel, he cannot do that freely, but with police. His passport is seized despite not being officially charged,"" Ms Sanatana told a local media channel.

Ms Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student from Virginia, was last seen on a beach in Punta Cana on March 6. She had travelled with five friends for a vacation - spring break. Mr Riibe, who was not part of Ms Konanki's original travel group, met them at the resort town. On the night of her disappearance, Ms Konanki and her group partied at a resort disco until 3 am. They headed to the beach an hour later.

Surveillance footage captured the group arriving at the beach around 4:15 am.

By 5:50 am, most of her friends had left, leaving Ms Konanki alone with Mr Riibe. Hours later, Mr Riibe was seen alone, and Ms Konanki has not been found since.

A latest surveillance footage shows Ms Konanki and Mr Riibe at an outdoor bar before she vanished from the Dominican Republic beach. At one point, Ms Konanki can be seen vomiting before returning to the bar. In the same footage, a man, believed to be Mr Riibe, is seen outside the bar, seemingly drunk. Another young man appears to comfort him as Mr Riibe stumbles backward. Both Ms Konanki and Mr Riibe appear to be wearing the same outfits seen in previously released surveillance footage. However, the two did not interact in this video.

According to authorities, Mr Riibe has been giving conflicting statements.

In one version, he said that he left the water after feeling sick and last saw Ms Konanki in knee-deep water, while in another, he claimed he saw her walking along the shore before he passed out. In a third version, Mr Riibe said he vomited in the water and checked if Ms Konanki was okay. In a latest account, he told the cops he rescued Ms Konanki from rough waters.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

At least 413 people were killed in Gaza on Tuesday as the Israeli military conducted ""extensive strikes"" on Hamas targets amid stalled truce talks, the biggest attack in the war-torn territory since the ceasefire began on January 19.

Gaza's civil defence agency said the air strikes, which took place during the month of Ramadan, killed ""mostly children, women, and the elderly"" and injured about 150 people.

The explosions were heard in multiple locations, including northern Gaza, Gaza City and the Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah in central and southern Gaza Strip.

Mahmud Abu Watfa, who headed Hamas's police and internal security services in the Gaza Strip, was also reportedly killed in the strike on Gaza City.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), in a post on X this morning, said it was ""conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip"" in accordance with the ""political echelon"".

In accordance with the political echelon, the IDF and ISA are currently conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip. pic.twitter.com/mYZ1WBPVPG

Israel also ordered all schools close to the regions neighbouring Gaza shut.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office later said the strikes were ordered after ""Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators.""

""The IDF is, at this time, attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip in order to achieve the objectives of the war as they have been determined by the political echelon including the release of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased,"" it posted on X.

Israel would now act with ""increased military strength"" against Hamas, it said.

This follows Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators.

Hamas, however, said Mr Netanyahu had decided to ""sacrifice"" hostages by resuming war.

""Netanyahu's decision to resume war is a decision to sacrifice the occupation's prisoners and impose a death sentence on them,"" a Hamas official said in a statement, adding that the Israeli leader was using the fighting as a political ""lifeboat"" to distract from internal crises.

In a separate statement, Hamas held Mr Netanyahu ""fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement"" and said the ceasefire breach ""exposes the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate"".

A White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted President Donald Trump's administration before it carried out the strikes.

The truce talks stalled as Israel wanted to extend the first phase of the three-stage ceasefire agreement, while Hamas said it would resume freeing hostages only under the second phase that was due to begin on March 2.

Israel wanted to extend the first phase until mid-April, saying that any transition to the second phase must include ""the total demilitarisation"" of Gaza and the removal of Hamas, which has controlled the territory since 2007.

Last week, Hamas said it would release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and four bodies of the hostages if Israel agreed to begin talks immediately on implementing the second phase of the agreement. Israel, however, accused the group of waging ""psychological warfare"" on the families of hostages.

The initial phase of the Gaza ceasefire witnessed 33 Israeli hostages, including five bodies, and five Thais freed by Hamas in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners. The group has still held about 59 hostages.

The war's only previous truce took place in November 2023 for a week when Hamas released hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

The Gaza war began when Hamas led a cross-border raid into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They also captured 251 hostages.

Israel's retaliatory strikes since then have killed more than 48,000 Palestinians and injured over 1.12 lakh, according to reports.

The family of Indian student Sudiksha Konanki, who went missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic, has asked the police to declare her dead, according to US media reports.

20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki, a citizen of India and a permanent resident of the United States, was last seen on March 6 at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana town. US federal law enforcement agencies have been working with authorities in the Caribbean country while investigating her disappearance. Despite an extensive search, her body has not been found.

Dominican Republic National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said Ms Konanki's family has sent the agency a letter requesting a declaration of death, NBC News reported on Tuesday.

The Konanki family did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have confiscated the passport of the man who is the last person known to have been with Ms Konanki, according to a source close to the investigation, CNN News reported.

Dominican Republic Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso interviewed Joshua Steven Riibe over the weekend for more than six hours, and the questioning is expected to continue with a local prosecutor, the source said.

Mr Riibe is not considered a suspect in the case and has not been accused of wrongdoing.

It's unclear why Mr Riibe's passport was confiscated. Since Ms Konanki went missing in the early hours of March 6, Mr Riibe, a 22-year-old from Rock Rapids, Iowa, and a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, has remained under police surveillance in the Dominican Republic. He has been taken to the police station for interrogation multiple times, his parents said in a statement.

The Konanki family sent a formal letter to authorities Monday, acknowledging there is no suspected foul play involved in Ms Konanki's presumed death after she vanished from a Punta Cana beach in the early hours of March 6, New York Post reported.

The father and mother also wrote they trust the authorities' probe into the case and noted Mr Riibe, the last person to see the young woman alive, has cooperated with investigators, sources said.

Ms Konanki's parents said in the same letter that they understand that certain legal procedures must be followed for their request, but that they are prepared to comply with any necessary formalities or documentation, sources were quoted as saying by the ABC News.

Ms Konanki, described by her father as an ""ambitious"" student who planned to study medicine, arrived in Punta Cana on March 3. She travelled with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh, according to the Loudon County Sheriff's Office.

Mr Riibe said he first met Ms Konanki in the hotel when he and his friend introduced themselves to her group. The two friend groups went together to the bar, where they drank until ""someone suggested we go to the beach,"" Mr Riibe said in his interview.She was seen on surveillance footage drinking with five women and two men in the Riu Republica Hotel bar, in the early hours of March 6. In the video, Ms Konanki is seen wearing a white cover-up as she hugs and talks with her friends. Mr Riibe is seen several feet away, bent over and stumbling on the lawn outside the bar.

Then, at 4:15 am, a surveillance camera captured the group, including Ms Konanki, entering the beach, police said.

Just before 5 am, surveillance footage shows five women and one man leaving the beach, two sources close to the investigation told CNN. Ms Konanki was not among them.

During his fourth interview with prosecutors, on Wednesday, Mr Riibe described a harrowing attempt to save Ms Konanki after they were jostled by the wave and she got tired of swimming.

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have said no one is considered a suspect in Ms Konanki's disappearance.

US authorities have said it is a missing persons case and not a criminal matter.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams and her colleague, Butch Wilmore, today departed for Earth after being stuck on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months.

In a video shared by NASA on its social media platforms, the two astronauts were seen taking part in their final photo op before entering the Dragon, the SpaceX spacecraft that is bringing them back home.

Sunita Williams, 59, and Butch Wilmore, 62, undocked from the ISS at 10:35 am IST to begin a 17-hour trip back to Earth.



The spacecraft will splash down off the coast of the American state of Florida around 3:27 am IST Wednesday. Follow Sunita Williams Homecoming Live Updates Here

The two astronauts flew to the orbital lab on June 5 last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test out Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight.

However, the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back and instead returned uncrewed.

They were then reassigned to the NASA-SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which saw a Dragon spacecraft fly to the ISS in September last year with a team of two -- NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov -- rather than the usual four, to make room for the stranded astronauts.

On Sunday, a relief team -- Crew-10 -- docked with the space station to make the way for Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore's much-awaited homecoming, along with Mr Hague and Mr Gorbunov.

Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore's stay surpassed the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio holds the record at 371 days in 2023.

Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov holds the world record, who spent 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir station.

With Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore stuck in space, a political blame game erupted on Earth.

US President Donald Trump, who returned to power in January, and his close advisor, Elon Musk -- who leads SpaceX -- have repeatedly claimed that former president Joe Biden abandoned the astronauts and refused an earlier rescue plan.

""They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them,"" President Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.

Mr Musk had also suggested that he had offered Joe Biden a ""rescue"" mission outside of the routine crew rotations.

In a move reflecting rising anti-American sentiment, French entrepreneur Romain Roy rejected Tesla EVs, incurring a substantial extra cost of $164,000 to support European manufacturers, as a protest against US policies and Elon Musk, reported Fortune.

Mr Roy is growing increasingly frustrated with both Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statements and the US administration's environmental policies. In addition to leading Tesla and SpaceX, Musk also heads the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency and is a close ally of Donald Trump, actively supporting his policies.

Mr Roy's company, which specializes in photovoltaic panels, had integrated Tesla vehicles into its fleet for years. However, the shifting political climate in the U.S. has led him to reconsider his stance.

""Last November, we purchased around thirty electric vehicles, including 15 Teslas. In January, I decided to cancel the Tesla order,"" the French CEO told La Republica.

""They [Tesla] weren't pleased, but in life, you have to take a stand,"" he explained.

Mr Roy did not hold back in his criticism of Trump and Musk.

""They're harming the environment. They're reckless, and they won't get my money,"" he said. ""We have to push back against their hypocrisy regarding the environment and Europe. The US is pushing for a trade war, especially with increased tariffs. I won't contribute to that system through my purchases.""

""All they care about is money- they don't think about the environment,"" he added.

This sentiment reflects a growing European backlash against American products. In Denmark, a movement has gained traction to boycott U.S. goods, driven by Trump's aggressive foreign policies, including his threats to annex Greenland, the Panama Canal, and Gaza. Danish consumers are increasingly turning to local alternatives, leading to a significant decline in Tesla sales and a surge in demand for European brands.

In Germany and France, Tesla dealerships have been vandalized, and sales have dropped sharply. Meanwhile, in London, anti-Musk posters have appeared across the city, comparing the billionaire to a Nazi.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Israel resumed massive strikes on Gaza this morning, shattering a period of calm negotiated during a January truce, which has been branded as a ""death sentence"" for the hostages by a Hamas official.

""Netanyahu's decision to resume war is a decision to sacrifice the occupation's prisoners and impose a death sentence on them,"" said Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq, accusing the Prime Minister of using the conflict as a political ""lifeboat"" to distract from internal crises.

Israeli forces announced ""extensive attacks"" on Hamas targets this morning and ordered all schools to stay shut in Gaza. The White House later confirmed that the US was consulted before the attacks during the fasting month of Ramzan.

The strikes left at least 330 dead, including women, children, and the elderly, said Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Besides, dozens are in critical condition.

Prime Minister Netanyahu's office said the strikes followed ""Hamas's repeated refusal to release (Israeli) hostages as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators.""

""Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,"" it declared.

Hamas said the attacks reflected Netanyahu's decision to ""overturn the ceasefire agreement"", exposing the hostages in Gaza to an ""unknown fate."" It said it would hold the Prime Minister responsible for any repercussions of the attacks on Gaza.

The attacks cast aspersions on the ceasefire talks between the two sides to end the year-long conflict sparked by a Hamas attack on Israeli towns in October 2023. At least 59 hostages now remain in Hamas captivity after several were freed in exchange for political prisoners in the past two months.

The first phase of the Gaza ceasefire was mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the US. It was enforced in January and ended in early March, during which both sides refrained from escalating the violence.

A fresh swap offer has come from US's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, under which five Israeli hostages could be released in exchange for a ""substantial"" number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A South African Antarctic researcher has lodged serious allegations against a fellow team member, claiming both physical assault and a death threat, and is demanding urgent intervention, according to a report by the Sunday Times.

The claims were made in an email sent from the base, in which the sender expressed fear for their own and their colleagues' safety, urging immediate intervention. The email described a physical assault on the team leader and alleged that the attacker also issued a death threat, creating a climate of fear among the 10-person crew.

South Africa's Environment Minister, Dion George, confirmed that an assault had taken place and stated that the individual responsible had shown remorse and undergone psychological evaluation. The dispute reportedly stemmed from a disagreement over a weather-dependent task that required rescheduling.

With the base located more than 2,600 miles south of Cape Town and surrounded by harsh Antarctic conditions, the team is not expected to be relieved until December, when South Africa's SA Agulhas II ship returns. The nearest research facilities are Germany's Neumayer Station III, about 137 miles away, and Norway's Troll Base, approximately 118 miles inland.



The Department of Forestry, Fisheries, and the Environment has launched a full investigation into the incident, emphasizing that a wellness unit is in continuous contact with the team to ensure their well-being.

South Africa first established a research base in Antarctica in 1960 and also operates stations on Marion Island and Gough Island. This is not the first violent incident involving a South African research team; in 2017, a researcher on Marion Island reportedly attacked a colleague's laptop with an axe after a marriage proposal was rejected.

Taiwan detected 59 Chinese aircraft around the self-ruled island, the defence ministry said Tuesday, the highest tally since a record in October and days after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te called China a ""foreign hostile force"".

Along with the 59 aircraft, nine Chinese warships and two balloons were also detected in the 24 hours to 6:00 am (2200 GMT), the ministry said.

Among the aircraft, 54 had taken part in ""joint combat"" patrols on Monday, the ministry said in separate statements.

The Chinese foreign ministry said the actions were a ""stern warning to the Taiwan independence separatist forces"".

China insists democratic Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring the island under its control.

Beijing has increased the deployment of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty, which Taipei rejects.

Last Thursday, Lai branded China a ""foreign hostile force"", as he proposed measures to combat deepening Chinese infiltration in the island.

Harvard University announced Monday that students from families earning $200,000 or less annually will receive free tuition, expanding its financial aid program, CNBC reported. 

Harvard's leadership describes its latest financial aid expansion as part of a ""decades-long commitment"" to making education more accessible, particularly for middle-income families.

""Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals broadens the range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives our students encounter, fostering their intellectual and personal growth,"" said Harvard President Alan M. Garber in a news release. ""By bringing together people of exceptional promise to learn with and from one another, we truly unlock the University's vast potential.""

This enhanced financial aid package will take effect at the start of the 2025 academic year. With this expansion, approximately 86% of US families will now qualify for financial assistance at Harvard College.

Currently, the university fully covers tuition, housing, and food costs for students from families earning $85,000 or less annually.

""Harvard has long worked to open its doors to the most talented students, regardless of their financial background,"" said Hopi Hoekstra, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin spoke for over two hours during a phone-call, discussing ways to end the ongoing war in Ukraine and ways to establish ""lasting peace"".

The leaders continued a detailed and frank exchange of views on the situation around Ukraine. Vladimir Putin expressed gratitude to Donald Trump for his desire to help achieve the noble goal of ending hostilities and human losses.

Having confirmed his fundamental commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, the Russian President declared his readiness to work together with his American partners to thoroughly explore possible ways of resolving the conflict, which should be comprehensive, sustainable and long-term. And, of course, to take into account the absolute need to eliminate the root causes of the crisis, and Russia's legitimate interests in the area of security.

In the context of the US President's initiative to introduce a 30-day ceasefire, the Russian side outlined a number of significant points concerning ensuring effective control over a possible ceasefire along the entire line of combat contact, the need to stop forced mobilization in Ukraine and rearm the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Serious risks associated with the inability to negotiate of the Kyiv regime, which has repeatedly sabotaged and violated the agreements reached, were also noted. Attention was drawn to the barbaric terrorist crimes committed by Ukrainian militants against the civilian population of the Kursk region.

It was emphasized that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution through political and diplomatic means should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.

In connection with Donald Trump's recent appeal to spare the lives of Ukrainian servicemen surrounded in the Kursk region, Vladimir Putin confirmed that the Russian side is ready to be guided by humanitarian considerations and, in the event of their surrender, guarantees the lives and decent treatment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers in accordance with Russian laws and international law.

During the conversation, Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days. Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order.

The Russian President also responded constructively to Donald Trump's idea of implementing a well-known initiative concerning the safety of navigation in the Black Sea. It was agreed to begin negotiations to further elaborate specific details of such an agreement.

Vladimir Putin informed that on March 19, a prisoner exchange will be carried out between the Russian and Ukrainian sides - 175 for 175 people. In addition, as a gesture of goodwill, 23 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen who are being treated in Russian medical institutions will be transferred.

The leaders confirmed their intention to continue efforts to achieve a Ukrainian settlement in a bilateral mode, including taking into account the above-mentioned proposals of the US President. For this purpose, Russian and American expert groups are being created.

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump also touched upon other issues on the international agenda, including the situation in the Middle East and the Red Sea region. Joint efforts will be made to stabilize the situation in crisis areas, establish cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation and global security. This, in turn, will contribute to improving the overall atmosphere of Russian-American relations. One positive example is the joint vote in the UN on the resolution on the Ukrainian conflict.

Mutual interest was expressed in normalizing bilateral relations in light of the special responsibility of Russia and the United States for ensuring security and stability in the world. In this context, a wide range of areas in which our countries could establish interaction was considered. A number of ideas were discussed that are moving towards the development of mutually beneficial cooperation in the economy and energy sector.

Donald Trump supported Vladimir Putin's idea to organize hockey matches in the USA and Russia between Russian and American players playing in the NHL and KHL.

The presidents agreed to remain in contact on all issues raised.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Pope Francis called Tuesday for an end to war and urged reflection in a letter published by Italy's newspaper of record, as the 88-year-old pontiff recovers from pneumonia in hospital.

Emphasising the need for responsible journalism, he called in his letter dated March 14 for calm minds, noting that the media had a duty to ""feel the full importance of words"".

""They are never just words: they are facts that build human environments. They can connect or divide, serve the truth or use it,"" he wrote in the letter published on the front page of the newspaper.

""We must disarm words, to disarm minds and disarm the Earth. There is a great need for reflection, for calmness, for a sense of complexity.""

""While war only devastates communities and the environment, without offering solutions to conflicts, diplomacy and international organisations need new life and credibility,"" he wrote.

Thanking Corriere's director Luciano Fontana, to whom the letter was addressed, Francis noted that ""in this moment of illness... war appears even more absurd"".

""Human fragility, in fact, has the power to make us more clear about what lasts and what passes, what makes us live and what kills,"" he wrote.

Peace, he said, ""requires commitment, work, silence, words"".

The fourth and longest hospitalisation of Francis's 12-year papacy has seen him confined since February 14 to a suite on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital.

Doctors have said his condition is now stable, after a critical period marked by breathing crises that raised fears for his life.

On Monday evening, the Vatican said he was now spending short periods breathing on his own.

For at least two weeks, Francis has been alternating an oxygen mask at night with a cannula -- a plastic tube tucked into his nostrils that delivers high-flow oxygen -- during the day.

He is now shifting to a reduced flow for the first time, it said.

In hospital, Francis has continued to work when able, while alternating rest with prayer.

Air Canada has issued an apology after some of its planes did not display Israel as a state on the in-flight entertainment (IFE) systems. The Canadian airline's Boeing 737 MAX fleet replaced Israel with the name ""Palestinian Territories"" amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, according to a report in CNN.

The anomaly was first noticed by a passenger who reported it to the airline. As per the carrier, 40 of its planes had faulty maps which have since been disabled as they are updated. Thales had produced the IFE in question but the map itself had been procured from a third-party company, the French aerospace group said.

“It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,” read a joint statement by Air Canada and Thales.

“Air Canada's policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy.”

The airline has been working with Thales and the map provider to reprogram the planes and it is expected to be installed in the fleet soon.

“Thales is working closely with the airline and the involved third-party to remediate this regrettable issue as soon possible.""

This is not the first instance when an airline has been forced to issue an apology, owing to faulty maps. In 2024, JetBlue apologised after Israel was mistakenly labelled as the Palestinian Territories.

""We're sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region, and we were not previously aware of the issue.""

The airline added it was switching to another moving map provider, and had asked the old one to “adjust the map"".","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday searched the offices of George Soros' foundation, the Open Soros Foundation, and non-governmental organisations linked to the OSF, including Amnesty. Officials said the searches are linked to an ongoing FEMA, or Foreign Exchange Management Act, case.

Premised of former employees of Amnesty International (whose India operations shut down in December 2020, after the government froze its bank accounts alleging illegal foreign funding) were searched, as were those of current employees of Human Rights Watch, or HRW.

Amnesty's India office and HRW both reportedly received funds from the OSF in the past. The former has been charge-sheeted by the CBI and the ED has filed a complaint against the latter.

In 2022 Amnesty's India chief, Aakar Patel was fined Rs 10 crore (and the NGO itself Rs 51.72 crore) for contravening the foreign exchange law, or the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.

The OSF, which began its India ops in 1999, has not yet responded.

In 2016 the Union Home Ministry put the foundation on a 'watchlist' - meaning it now requires government approval to fund Indian NGOs - amid alleged violation of foreign exchange laws.

The move was later challenged in the Delhi High Court, where the plea is pending.

Organisations linked to, or funded, by George Soros - a Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist - have been accused by the ruling BJP of acting against India's interests.

The BJP has repeatedly claimed that foundations and think tanks that receive funding from the OSF, including the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP, produce ""anti-India"" reports and narratives. These, the party has declared, are then picked up and amplified by the Congress to criticise the union government and ""defame"" the country.

The allegations exploded in December after the BJP and Congress chiefs, JP Nadda and Mallikarjun Kharge, faced off over fresh accusations - this time over 'links' between Sonia Gandhi and the Soros-funded Forum of the Democratic Leaders in Asia Pacific Foundation.\

READ | JP Nadda vs M Kharge Over Soros-Sonia Gandhi Link Claims

Mrs Gandhi is the co-President of the forum.

The allegations came a week after the BJP called Rahul Gandhi a ""traitor"" and said Mr Soros, ""some American agencies"" (which also funded the OCCRP) and he were trying to destabilise India.

This sparked a furious political row, including unprecedented calls to charge Sonia Gandhi under anti-terror laws and also a failed move to impeach Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar.

The Congress rubbished all such claims, counter-accusing the BJP of trying to divert attention, particularly when Parliament was in session, from its 'failures', including the Hindenburg row.

Starbucks has been ordered to pay $50 million to a customer who was burned when hot tea spilled on his lap at a California drive-through.

Lawyers for Michael Garcia said the server who handed him three super-sized drinks in February 2020 did not push one of them into the cardboard cupholder properly.

When he took the tray, the drink tipped over, ""causing third degree burns to his penis, groin, and inner thighs,"" according to a statement from Trial Lawyers for Justice.

""After a hospitalization and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction, and psychological harm caused by the burns.""

The firm, which specializes in no-win-no-fee claims, said Starbucks had denied responsibility for Garcia's suffering, but before a jury trial had offered to settle for $30 million.

However, the coffee giant balked at the demand for a public apology and a change in policy that Garcia wanted, so the case went to trial.

A jury in Los Angeles on Friday awarded him $50 million, a figure his attorneys said would eventually cost Starbucks more than $60 million once pre-judgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees are added.

""Starbucks Corporation consistently denied responsibility for five years, all the way up to and through trial, and attempted to escape responsibility,"" the lawyers' statement said.

""The trial was a perfect example of frivolous defenses and victim-blaming.

""We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story.""

A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company would appeal the award.

""We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive,"" Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in a statement to AFP.

""We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks.""

The case is redolent of a 1994 landmark legal action against McDonald's in New Mexico, when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded over $2.8 million after spilling hot coffee on herself.

Although the award was reduced on appeal, the Liebeck case became a touchstone issue in US tort reform, and was often mocked as an example of how readily Americans resort to the law.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, whose eight-day mission turned into nine months on the International Space Station, are finally heading back to Earth aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. They have undocked from the ISS and are on their way.

They began their journey at 10:35 am on Tuesday and are expected to land around 3:35 am on Wednesday after a 17-hour trip. Follow Sunita Williams Homecoming Live Updates Here

During their time aboard the orbiting laboratory, Sunita Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Nick Hague conducted over 900 hours of study in addition to more than 150 unique scientific experiments and technological demonstrations.

Here are some of the experiments Crew 9 performed during their 9-month stay:

Micro-Algae For Generating Oxygen

Nick Hague worked on growing Arthrospira micro-algae on the ISS to help convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. These tiny algae perform photosynthesis, just like plants on Earth, helping keep the safe-to-breathe oxygen inside the spacecraft. It can also be treated as food when fresh food is not available during long-duration space missions. This experiment was led by the European Space Agency (ESA). 

Improving Astronauts' Health

Butch Wilmore installed the compact workout machine called European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D) on ISS for testing. The modular device combines cycling, rowing, and resistance exercises to help astronauts stay fit during long space missions. Other than this, it is also designed to prevent bone and muscle loss and improve heart health on future missions.

Red Romaine Lettuce

As part of the Plant Habitat-07 experiment, astronauts on the ISS grew red romaine lettuce in the Advanced Plant Habitat. The study is about how different moisture levels affect the microbial communities in plants and water. The purpose of the study is to understand how less-than-ideal conditions affect plant growth. The findings will help scientists create more effective farming systems that would produce nutritious food for astronauts on upcoming space flights.

Packed Bed Reactor Experiment: Water Recovery Series Investigation

Sunita Williams set up an experiment on the ISS to study how liquids and gases flow in space using small packed materials like beads or pellets. She installed hardware for the Packed Bed Reactor Experiment: Water Recovery Series (PBRE-WRS) investigation that would help scientists better understand water recycling, thermal management and fuel cells for future space missions.

Fire In Space

Astronauts also conducted an experiment called SOFIE-RTDFS to study how fire spreads in space. They burned the clear acrylic plastic sheet at higher oxygen levels but half the standard pressure of Earth's atmosphere. This was done to help scientists improve fire safety on future missions.

Monitoring Microbes In Space

As humans carry microorganisms along with them wherever they go, Butch Wilmore conducted an experiment to find out if tiny life forms escape from the ISS through vents and if they can survive in space. It will help scientists take steps to limit the spread of bacteria to places like the Moon or Mars during future missions.

Cardiovascular Function In Space

Nick Hague performed his workout while wearing the Bio-Monitor vest and headband on the ISS to check how space affects the human body, especially the heart and blood vessels. These clothes have tiny sensors that track body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. This experiment aligns with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) experiment called Vascular Aging.

Medical Equipment For Nerve Damage

Butch Wilmore tested a 3D printer on ISS that can make medical implants to help people recover from peripheral nerve damage, which can cause motor and sensory problems. This high-quality medical device might function better in microgravity and help scientists on upcoming long-duration missions. It will also improve medical treatment for patients.

Wooden Satellite

A tiny satellite named LignoSat was launched from the International Space Station by Japan's space agency JAXA to see if wood could be utilised in satellites in place of metal. Scientists had already evaluated several kinds of wood in space and found that magnolia was the best choice. It could lead to eco-friendly satellites in the future. 

Vitamins In Space 

Sunita Williams conducted research to help astronauts get essential nutrients during long-duration space missions using special microbes like yeast. Food that has been preserved for an extended period of time might lose vitamins and other nutrients. This technology could help astronauts make fresh supplements whenever needed.

Hold Gadgets In Space

Nick Hague tested the HUNCH Utility Bracket, a student-designed tool to hold and position cameras, tablets, and other equipment that astronauts use daily. Currently, astronauts on the ISS use Bogen Arms for daily tasks. But these older holders are wearing out due to frequent use. The new design is set to be more durable and efficient, helping astronauts work more easily in microgravity.

SpaceX Crew-9, the ninth operational crew rotation mission to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, was launched on September 28, 2024, from Florida. The crew consists of NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. Originally, the mission was planned to include four crew members, but adjustments were made to accommodate the extended stay of Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Jake Lang, charged with attacking police during riot and pardoned by Trump, seeks to fill seat Marco Rubio's old seat

A man accused of battling police with a baseball bat and shield during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol announced a run for the US Senate in Florida.

“WE ARE TAKING OVER THE CAPITOL AGAIN,” Jake Lang, a prominent January 6 defendant, wrote on X, announcing he is seeking the seat vacated by now secretary of state Marco Rubio in 2026.

Lang never stood trial for charges related to his role in the insurrection, seeking continual delays in his case until he was pardoned alongside about 1,600 others who participated in the Capitol attack when Donald Trump took office.

During his time in the DC jail, what he calls the “DC gulag”, Lang tried to organize a militia, which was initially called the North American Patriot and Liberty Militia, or Napalm. He created online fundraisers, collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars for January 6 defendants. He appeared in the media while in jail and since he was pardoned, talking about the Capitol charges and emerging as one of the most vocal members of the so-called J6 community.

Lang has not expressed regret for his actions on 6 January 2021 and has frequently referred to himself as a political prisoner. Photo and video footage of him on that day show him repeatedly fighting police and yelling things such as: “This is our house. We paid for this fucking building.” At one point in the riot, he wore a gas mask and beat police with a shield and bat, the justice department alleged, in an entrance to the Capitol that saw some of the most violence. He posted on social media afterward and wrote: “arrest me.”

Now he wants to go back to the Capitol as a US senator and he believes he can defeat the Republican who was appointed to the seat, former Florida attorney general Ashley Moody. He filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission in February.

“January 6 was a cry for change, and I am that change,” he said in his announcement video. “The tree of liberty is thirsty, America. We may have won the 2024 election, but the revolution has just begun. We're going back to the Capitol, and this time as your next elected officials and lawmakers.”

Lang did not respond to requests for comment. He previously told the Guardian he was “not ashamed” of his actions on January 6 and that he believes the day “ended up being the imagery that the American people and the world needed to see of a united America – Black, white, Asian, Spanish, gay, straight, Christian, Muslim – all standing united together against a tyrannical oppression, against a Marxist coup d'etat”.

On his campaign website, he notes that he will have a “100% TRUMP AMERICA AGENDA” and includes priorities such as mass deportation, sealing the border, “large tax cuts” and preventing a third world war.

Lang is from New York and previously told a local publication in his home town that he was considering a run for the US House in a district there. He also told the River Reporter that he hadn't voted for Trump until 2024, from inside the DC jail.

He told the Miami New Times he chose to run in Florida instead because, in his time there since being released from jail, he has found more acceptance. “They love the Jan Sixers,” he said. “As I've been going around these last 50 days here in Florida, making campaign videos and seeing business owners and friends of mine here and talking to strangers in the public, I've had dozens of people cry on my shoulder, come out and congratulate and hug and consider us to be patriot heroes and founding father-style leaders.”

Some Florida Republicans have said they don't see Lang as a serious contender. Jake Hoffman, the executive director of the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, told the Florida Phoenix: “Every cycle, both parties have insane candidates with a less than 0% chance of winning enter a race, but they do it anyway. This is one of those cases.”

Other J6ers have run for political office, but none successfully. Jacob Chansley, the rioter known as the “QAnon shaman” who dressed in horns and shirtless as he entered the Capitol, filed paperwork in 2023 for a congressional run as a libertarian. Ryan Zink talked about his January 6 charges during his unsuccessful run for Congress in Texas and called himself a “political prisoner”.

Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader who was convicted of seditious conspiracy related to the Capitol attack, also is reportedly considering a run for office in Florida. He told the Miami New Times in February that it was a “maybe thing” and that he's considering vying for the US House seat vacated by Matt Gaetz. “If I do run, I want to be in that building that they accused me of trying to storm,” he told the publication.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

US citizen girl deported with mixed-status family, who filed complaint over denied healthcare and poor conditions

A family that was recently removed from the United States to Mexico has filed a complaint seeking an investigation into what they describe as “serious abuses” they say they faced during their detention in the US prior to their removal.

The mixed-status family includes two undocumented parents and six children, five of whom are US citizens. On 4 February, five of the children, including four who are US citizens, and the two parents were removed from Texas and sent to Mexico after they were stopped at an immigration checkpoint.

One of the children, a 10-year-old girl, is recovering from brain cancer surgery, and the family says she has faced significant disruptions in her medical care since the family's removal.

The complaint, filed on Monday with the Department of Homeland Security's office for civil rights and civil liberties on behalf of the family by the Texas Civil Rights Project legal advocacy organization, alleges that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) committed “serious abuses” while the family was detained.

The complaint, first reported by NBC News, alleges that the 10-year-old girl was denied “urgent medical care”, the US citizen children were held in “deplorable conditions”, the family's due process rights were violated, and the family was subjected to “a course of abuse and humiliation” while in detention.

This comes as the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation efforts as part of its immigration crackdown. Tom Homan, Donald Trump's “border czar”, has previously stated that families with mixed immigration statuses “can be deported together”, leaving parents to decide whether they want to depart the country as a family, or leave their children in the US.

In this case, the parents opted to remain together with their children, rather than have their family be split up.

The Texas Civil Rights Project said that officials presented the parents with “an impossible choice” between either leaving their children in US government custody “and never see them again” or being deported together.

The complaint alleges that on the morning of 3 February 2025, the family was traveling from the Rio Grande valley to Houston to get emergency treatment at the Texas children's hospital for their daughter, as they had done several times before.

On the way there, the family passed through an immigration checkpoint, one that they had previously crossed several times without incident, the complaint states.

As they had done previous times, they presented officers with a letter from the hospital detailing their daughter's brain tumor treatment, the necessity of continuing her care at the Texas children's hospital, and a request that the parents be permitted to travel to oversee care for their daughter.

The parents also said that they showed officers the children's birth certificates, proving that they are US citizens, and a letter from their immigration attorney regarding their visa applications.

But this was insufficient. Instead of allowing them to proceed, the complaint states that the officers “detained the entire family” for over 24 hours and “eventually forced the entire family, including US citizens, to Mexico”, where the daughter “cannot receive appropriate treatment”.

The complaint adds that the family's 15-year-old son, who is also a US citizen, as well as their one child who is not a US citizen, both have a heart disorder known as long QT syndrome, which they claim was known to CBP's medical team.

“It was clear to CBP's medical team that they had custody of three children with complex medical needs, one of whom was complaining of urgent and serious symptoms, two of whom were US citizens,” the complaint reads.

And still, the family alleges that CBP didn't transfer any of the children, in particular the 10-year-old girl, to a hospital or medical care facility “to obtain pediatric medical review”.

“Instead of granting her that care, CBP forced a child who was still recovering from brain surgery to sleep in a hot, dirty, brightly lit cell,” the complaint alleges.

It also alleges that the children were inappropriately searched, including pat-downs of sensitive parts of their bodies, and that parents were denied adequate access to their attorney.

In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for CBP said that “the facts as reported are inaccurate.”

“When someone is given expedited removal orders and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences as outlined by the expedited removal process for individuals with removal orders,” the statement added. “For privacy reasons, we cannot comment on the specifics of this case.”

The Texas Civil Rights Project is urging homeland security's office for civil rights and civil liberties to “open an immediate investigation” and is also calling on the department to immediately grant humanitarian parole to the parents and the child who is not a US citizen so “that the family can be together” while the daughter receives the medical treatment she needs.

The complaint states that the family is currently in Mexico, fearing for their safety, and they cannot access the medical care they require.

The couple's oldest child, who is also a US citizen and was not traveling with the family on that day, currently remains in the US.

The complaint notes that the parents are “valued members of their community” in Texas, “dedicated members of their local church”, and people who “work hard” and have no criminal records.

The mother told NBC News that since the family was deported, the 10-year-old girl hasn't received the follow-up care she needs.

The girl still has swelling on her brain, the mother said, which is affecting her speech and mobility on one side.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Advocates warn firings and funding freezes already risk poisoning drinking water and decimating fish population

Donald Trump's and Elon Musk's attacks on federal agencies and funding freezes will be “cataclysmic” for the environment of the sensitive Great Lakes region if not reversed, industry and environmental advocates in the region warn.

Initial actions taken since Trump returned to the White House in January – and put Musk in charge of slashing the federal government – already risk poisoning drinking water, decimating fish populations, and risking the jobs and health of tens of millions of people who rely on the lake system, they add.

Trump and Musk's cost-cutting agency, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), promised to dramatically reduce federal spending and workforce levels, and it has already fired hundreds of federal workers while targeting hundreds of millions of dollars of funding dedicated to protecting the waters of the Great Lakes.

The administration and Doge's sledgehammer approach is particularly dangerous for the ecologically sensitive lake system that spans about 1,200 miles (1,900km) from Minnesota to central New York, said Christy McGillivray, political director for the Sierra Club's Michigan chapter.

The vital lakes provide drinking water to more than 40 million people in the US and Canada, hold about 90% of the US's freshwater, and are home to 3,500 species of plants and animals. They also directly support at least $750bn in annual commerce.

“Donald Trump and Elon Musk's ignorance is staggering, and they have no idea what the federal government does for this region,” McGillivray said.

Among the first Doge casualties was the US Fish and Wildlife Service's 12-person sea lamprey control unit. Lampreys, called “the vampires of the Great Lakes”, are a deadly invasive species that threatens to devastate the $7bn Great Lakes fishing industry that supports 75,000 jobs because they prey on and suck blood from native fish. The unit was already struggling to keep the lamprey population under control after Covid slowed its work.

Similarly, a multibillion-dollar project in Illinois aimed at repelling invasive silver Asian carp that destroy native fish populations because they deplete food sources has been shelved after federal funding was frozen.

Doge eliminated National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency (Noaa) staff for programs that monitor the lakes' ice cover and operate water-level gauges and weather buoys – functions “critical to navigation safety”, a spokesperson for the Lake Carriers' Association, which represents the US-based Great Lakes shipping industry, told Bridge Michigan. “A degradation of the services that we currently get for navigation safety would be detrimental,” he added.

Meanwhile, Trump reportedly wants to shred treaties with Canada that detail how the nations, states and provinces manage the Great Lakes, which could upend the shipping, fishing and tourism industries and damage the environment, advocates say.

Drinking water is also at risk. Musk's Doge cut Noaa staff that help protect it from toxic algal blooms that are difficult for wastewater treatment plants to address, and can cause vomiting, liver problems and kidney damage. Fertilizer runoff from farmland has driven algae problems in Lake Erie, and as recently as 2014 left 400,000 people around Toledo without water for several days. Federal efforts to rein in the fertilizer runoff will likely be targeted, advocates say.

Trump's Environmental Protection Agency has proposed cutting 675 out of 1,035 EPA staff members who work in Michigan, said Nic Cantello, a union president representing EPA workers in that state and the upper midwest. Already it has eliminated 18 enforcement staff dedicated to the Great Lakes, including six attorneys, which is grinding to a halt enforcement against the region's worst polluters.

David Ullrich, a former deputy administrator at the EPA's region 5 office in Chicago, fears agency employees that manage programs that work with local municipalities to prevent raw sewage from overflowing into the lakes may be next.

Ullrich started working at the EPA in the early 1970s, around when the agency was formed and the Clean Water Act was passed. Around the time, Lake Erie was declared “dead” and some waterways were so polluted that they burned. The government has been “chipping away and chipping away” at the pollution while restoring the lakes, in what Ullrich called a rare decades-long bipartisan effort.

The Great Lakes cuts are a “dramatic problem” in part because the progress can be undone much more quickly than the lakes can be restored, and rebooting the programs after they are scrapped is “tremendously inefficient”, Ullrich said. Taxpayers will spend much more than if the programs continued.

During his first term, Trump sought to scrap the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which, since its early inception under George W Bush, has coordinated federal agencies' actions in the region, and funneled $5bn in funding for more than 8,000 projects. Many of those efforts focused on cleaning up pollution hotspots in the lakes and on their shores.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers thwarted Trump's attempts to cut the program during his first term, but there is less Republican willingness to stand up to the president's whims so far, Democrats say.

Help isn't coming at the state level. Federal funding makes up about $750m of the $1bn budget for Michigan's state environmental agency. The administration is proposing to cut 40% of the $750m, including about $285m for clean drinking water and pollution prevention, Cantello said. Meanwhile, Republicans control the state house of representatives, and just proposed a budget that would fully defund the state's environmental agency.

The climate crisis is leading to swings in lake levels, increased heavy rainfall events, and flooding along the shores that threatens homes and wildlife, as well as economic activity. The administration is already targeting programs that protect the region from those effects, as well as greenhouse gas-reducing measures.

“The impact is going to be huge, and it's important to put this in context,” Ullrich said. “The Great Lakes is one of the wonders of the world, it's our Yellowstone or Grand Canyon here in the midwest, and the impact goes beyond what you can imagine – there's an incredible economic, social and environmental significance.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Pages about Native Americans who helped US send messages in world wars removed in Pentagon ‘DEI' purge

More pages honoring diversity in US military history have been removed from defense department websites as the Pentagon undergoes what appears to be a purge of content that it considered to be related to diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI.

Among those pages was one celebrating Ira Hayes, one of the marines memorably pictured raising the American flag at Iwo Jima in 1945, according to the Washington Post. Hayes, a Native American, was praised in the page as an example of the “contributions and sacrifices Native Americans have made to the United States, not just in the military, but in all walks of life”.

Likewise, articles about the Native American code talkers in the second world war appear to have been removed from military websites, with an error page being shown in place of the pages. Internet archive websites show some of the pages were still up in early March before being taken down. The removal of the pages was first reported by Axios.

Native Americans helped the US send messages in the first and second world wars in secret using their tribal language. The use of the Choctaw language in the first world war was so successful that Germany and Japan sent students to the US after the war to study Native American languages.

In the second world war, the military enlisted Navajo to communicate messages in their language, which is known to be one of the hardest languages to learn. To further encrypt messages, the Native American code talkers encoded the language with word substitutions. More than 400 Navajo were part of the code talkers program during the war.

In recent weeks, the Pentagon appears to have focused on removing any webpage that it deems to be “DEI”. The webpages that it has taken down mostly have to deal with women or decorated service members who were not white.

Often seen within the URLs of the removed webpages on the Native American code talkers are the letters “DEI”, suggesting that the department has been removing the webpages in accordance with Donald Trump's presidential orders banning all DEI initiatives within the federal government.

After an outcry from the families of veterans, the Department of Defense restored a webpage celebrating the 442nd regimental combat team, a unit of Japanese American soldiers who fought for the US in the second world war and became the most decorated unit from that war.

Upon restoring the page, the Pentagon said in a statement that it was following guidance from Trump's executive order and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense.

“The 442nd Regimental Combat team holds an honored place in Army History, and we are pleased to republish an article that highlights the brave soldiers,” the Pentagon said in a statement to Hawaii News Now.

A similar pattern of events ensued after the Pentagon removed the webpage of Maj Gen Charles Calvin Rogers, a Black Medal of Honor recipient who had served in Vietnam. The defense department restored the webpage but took on a more defiant tone regarding the website purging project.

The Pentagon has labeled the Iwo flag-raising photograph an “iconic image”. It was taken on 23 February 1945 by a photographer for the Associated Press, Joe Rosenthal.

Rosenthal's photograph went on to win the Pulitzer prize and was used as a model for a statue that serves as the centerpiece of the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.

In a statement to the Guardian, department spokesperson Sean Parnell said: “I think the president and secretary have been very clear on this – that anybody that says in the Department of Defense that diversity is our strength is, frankly, incorrect.”

The statement echoed a sentiment Hegseth voiced in February, when he said: “I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength'.”

Berlin checking if US immigration policy has changed after Fabian Schmidt becomes third German to be detained

Berlin is investigating whether US immigration policy has changed, after a German national who is a permanent US resident was detained and “violently interrogated” by US border officials.

Fabian Schmidt, 34, is being held at a detention centre in Rhode Island after attempting to return to his home in New Hampshire after a trip to Luxembourg.

His mother, Astrid Senior, told the Boston-headquartered public broadcaster WGBH news that her son had been “violently interrogated” at Boston's Logan airport for hours, stripped naked and put in a cold shower by two officials.

A German government spokesperson told Euronews it was aware of the case and those of two other German citizens who were detained when attempting to enter the US and who have subsequently returned to Germany.

“We have recently become aware of three cases in which German citizens were unable to enter the USA and were detained for deportation when they entered the country,” the spokesperson, Sebastian Fischer, said.

Two of the three cases had been resolved, Fischer said, adding that the German government was “monitoring the situation” and liaising with other EU countries to assess if these were isolated cases or representative of “a change in American immigration policy”.

Senior told the US broadcaster that immigration agents had put pressure on her son to give up his green card. He had been placed on a mat in a bright room at the airport with little food or water, and denied access to his medication for anxiety and depression.

Schmidt, an electrical engineer, had been returning to the US on 7 March. His mother did not hear from him until 11 March, when he was transferred to hospital after collapsing.

She told NBC news she had no idea why her son had been detained, saying: “I feel helpless, absolutely helpless.”

Schmidt and his mother moved to the US from Germany in 2007 and got permanent resident cards the following year. He renewed his legal permanent residence status last year and has no active legal issues, his mother said, although she added that he had faced misdemeanour charges about 10 years ago.

The US Customs and Border Protection service told US media the claims about his case were “blatantly false”, without saying which points it disputed. The Guardian has contacted the service for comment.

The German foreign ministry said its consulate in Boston was providing support.

“It is clear that we expect from our partners, as well as from all other countries in the world, that prison conditions comply with international human rights standards and that detainees are treated accordingly,” Fischer said.

The case is the latest of a foreign-born national being detained and allegedly held in brutal conditions by US border agents, after Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.

The two other German nationals affected were Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Berlin, and Lucas Sielaff, 25, from Saxony-Anhalt. Both had valid tourist visas for the US and have now returned to Germany.

According to Sielaff's fiancee, Lennon Tyler, he was detained for two weeks after incorrectly answering a question about where he lived owing to his poor grasp of English. Sielaff had said Las Vegas, where he was staying with Tyler, when he should have said Germany, where he permanently resides, she said.

Brösche – who was travelling with tattoo equipment – was detained for more than six weeks, including nine days in solitary confinement, her friends said – a claim the company that owns the detention centre denies.

Meanwhile, a Canadian actor said she was detained for nearly two weeks in “inhuman conditions” over an incomplete visa, after attempting to cross the border at Mexico-Arizona. Jasmine Mooney was held in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that were never turned off, with no blankets and limited bathroom facilities, her mother said.

And a British woman was detained in “horrendous conditions” for three weeks, her family said, after a visa mix-up.

Rebecca Burke is now reportedly home in the UK. She was arrested by US border officials after attempting to cross into Canada and being sent back to the US.

She had been planning to stay with a host family in Canada, where she would carry out domestic chores in exchange for accommodation, but was told by the Canadians she should have applied for a working visa instead of a tourist visa.

Burke had previously stayed with a host family in Portland, Oregon under a similar arrangement after spending time sightseeing in New York City, where she arrived from the UK at the start of the year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Billionaire denies conflict of interest as he heads Trump initiative to cut costs throughout federal government

Elon Musk's Starlink internet service is now available at the White House, the New York Times reported, exacerbating conflict of interest concerns that are growing with each day the world's richest person spends at the heart of government.

Karoline Leavitt, Donald Trump's White House press secretary, said the installation was done to “improve wifi connectivity on the complex”.

But it prompted a security alert when a Musk employee accessed the roof of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.

The Musk employee, Christopher Stanley, also works for the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, through which the world's richest person is overseeing aggressive cuts to federal staffing and budgets at Trump's behest.

According to the Times, Stanley's work was approved by the Secret Service but no time had been agreed upon. On the Eisenhower roof, Stanley tripped an alarm – prompting a uniformed officer to rush to the scene.

A Trump administration spokesperson said the White House “was aware of Doge's intentions to improve internet access on the campus” and “did not consider this matter a security incident or security breach”.

A Secret Service spokesperson said it “collaborates closely” with Musk and his team.

The Times also cited unnamed White House officials as saying the Starlink installation was a “donation” vetted by the White House counsel.

Nonetheless, that has done little to quell concern about Musk's close alliance with the president.

On Monday, prominent Democrats including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren demanded an investigation of possible criminal corruption involving Starlink, citing “the Federal Aviation Administration's decision to cancel a $2.4bn contract with Verizon to upgrade air traffic control communications, and to pay … Musk's Starlink to help manage US airspace”.

Starlink, the Times said, is typically used by the US government “to provide internet access in emergency situations and remote locations”. Jake Williams of Hunter Strategy, a cybersecurity company, told the paper it was “super rare” for Starlink to be used on existing government infrastructure.

The network has already been installed at the General Services Administration. A Secret Service spokesperson said: “Only apps that meet GSA's security and privacy standards are allowed.”

President attends board meeting of prestigious arts center, criticizes its buildings and says he never liked Hamilton

Touring the Kennedy Center in Washington for the first time since his controversial takeover in February, Donald Trump criticized its buildings, mused about hosting its annual honors ceremony since he was “the king of ratings, whether we like it or not”, and took a shot at a hit musical that canceled its run in protest of his actions.

“I never liked Hamilton very much,” the president said.

Two weeks earlier, the Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller said the Broadway hit musical could not “in good conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center”.

The Kennedy Center is a prestige cultural venue on the banks of the Potomac. Trump toured it on Monday with an entourage including Susie Wiles, his White House chief of staff; the country singer and Trump Bible salesman Lee Greenwood; and the Fox News hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said: “We're here to have our first board meeting.”

The New York Times obtained a recording of that meeting.

According to the Times, the former NBC reality TV star proposed hosting the annual Kennedy Honors ceremony himself, because he was “the king of ratings, whether we like or not, the king of ratings”.

“If you announced that, every network will start bidding on it, going crazy, for whatever reason, that's the way it is,” Trump said.

Trump reportedly mooted posthumous honors for two musical heroes, Elvis Presley and Luciano Pavarotti, and said: “We're going to get some very good shows. I guess we have Les Mis coming.”

Les Misérables will play the Kennedy in June and July, a booking made before Trump was elected last November.

Trump also complained that it had not been possible to arrange a performance of “a little song” by Greenwood – possibly his hit, God Bless the USA – because “they wanted $30,000 to move a piano”.

The Kennedy Center opened in 1971, in memory of John F Kennedy, the 35th president, who was assassinated in 1963. On Monday, the Times said, Trump complained about the state of the buildings, criticizing recent renovations.

“The Kennedy Center is in tremendous disrepair,” Trump said. The former New York real estate mogul also reportedly criticized exterior columns – “It's supposed to be covered by something, whether it's marble or whatever, granite” – and promised to “bring [the building] into more modern times”.

“I thought it was very important to make this good,” Trump said. “It's a very big part of the fabric of Washington DC.”

David Rubenstein, the billionaire philanthropist, was the longtime chairperson of the Kennedy Center before being ousted amid Trump's takeover.

Trump said: “I know the person who was in charge of it and he's a good man. I never realized this was in such bad shape.”

On Tuesday, Rubenstein did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment.

The Times reported that before the board meeting, Trump introduced a resolution giving him more oversight of the selection of art and artists. The paper quoted Trump as saying: “In the past … radical left lunatics … have been chosen. I didn't like it.”

Noting the recent appearance on Kennedy Center walls of portraits of Trump; his wife, Melania Trump; the vice-president, JD Vance; and his wife, Usha Vance, the Times noted that the Vances attended a classical music concert last weekend.

As the Guardian reported, the second couple were subjected to boos and jeers as they took their seats. Greeted by shouts of “You've ruined this place,” the vice-president responded with a wave.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

John Roberts issues rare public statement after US president escalates rightwing attacks on the judiciary

Chief justice of the supreme court John Roberts has issued a rare public statement after Donald Trump this morning suggested a federal judge who attempted to block his administration's deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members should be impeached.

Without referencing the president, Roberts said:

For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.

Roberts is considered part of the court's conservative bloc and has repeatedly joined rulings that Trump supports, perhaps most notably last year's decision granting presidents immunity for official acts. However, Roberts also has a record of defending the judiciary from Trump's attacks, such as this episode from his first term:

The Pentagon said that fewer than 21,000 employees have accepted voluntary resignations after they announced plans to cut up to 60,000 civilian jobs, the Associated Press reports.

The defense department announced last month that it would fire 5-8% of its civilian workforce, with layoffs of 5,400 probationary workers. The defense department is the largest government agency, with the Government Accountability Office finding in 2023 that it had more than 700,000 full-time civilian workers.

A man accused of battling police with a baseball bat and shield during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol has announced a run for the US Senate in Florida.

Jake Lang, a prominent January 6 defendant, has announced on social media that he is seeking the seat recently vacated by the current secretary of state Marco Rubio in 2026.

“WE ARE TAKING OVER THE CAPITOL AGAIN,” Lang wrote in a post on X.

Lang continued to be politically active during his time in the DC jail, reportedly attempting to organize a militia and creating fundraisers for the January 6 defendants.

Lang did not stand trial for charges related to his role in the insurrection due to continuous delays. He was pardoned alongside about 1,600 others who participated in the Capitol attack when Donald Trump took office.

Read more about it here:

The Trump administration has moved to reinstate at least 24,500 recently fired probationary workers following a pair of orders from federal judges last week.

The reinstatements were outlined in a filing by the Justice Department in federal court in Maryland on Monday.

US District Judge James Bredar, an appointee of former President Obama, previously ordered the mass reinstatement of fired probationary workers at 18 federal agencies. He determined that the government's claims that the terminations were because of performance issues “isn't true”.

The majority of the reinstated employees were placed on paid administrative leave, according to the Washington Post. According to the filings, some workers were fully reinstated with pay, and some were reinstated without pay if they had been on unpaid leave before their termination.

Voters in Wisconsin are casting the first ballots in a pivotal state supreme court race that will decide whether liberal or conservative justices control the highest court in the state.

The first day of early voting comes two weeks before the April 1 election between the Republican-supported Brad Schimel and Democratic-supported Susan Crawford.

The race, which is in an important presidential battleground state, can be seen as a barometer of public opinion early in Trump's presidency. The outcome will have far-reaching implications for a court that faces cases over abortion and reproductive rights, the strength of public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries.

The White House said in a statement that Trump and Putin “spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war” in a phone call that lasted over an hour.

“Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace,” reads the statement. “The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace.”

Putin and Trump also discussed the Middle East, the “need to stop” the proliferation of strategic weapons, and Iran, according to the statement.

The justice department told the judge considering the legality of deporting suspected Venezuelan gang members that they did not violate his order to stop the planes from departing, but refused to immediately offer more details of their itinerary.

The filings came after judge James Boasberg yesterday gave the administration a deadline of today at noon to share details of how the three planes were allowed to fly to El Salvador even though he ordered that they not depart, and turn back if they were in the air.

In response, Robert L. Cerna, an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) official based in Texas, said that two of the planes had already left US airspace by the time that Boasberg issued his order, while the third carried migrants who had been ordered deported through the typical legal process – not the Alien Enemies Act, which is at issue in the case Boasberg is considering.

From Cerna's filing:

On March 15, 2025, after the Proclamation was publicly posted and took effect, three planes carrying aliens departed the United States for El Salvador International Airport (SAL). Two of those planes departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 PM EDT. The third plane departed after that time, but all individuals on that third plane had Title 8 final removal orders and thus were not removed solely on the basis of the Proclamation at issue. To avoid any doubt, no one on any flight departing the United States after 7:25 PM EDT on March 15, 2025, was removed solely on the basis of the Proclamation at issue.

Separately, attorney general Pam Bondi and other top justice department officials signed a notice to Boasberg in response to his demand for details about the planes and their departure time, essentially refusing to provide him with what he wanted:

The Court also ordered the Government to address the form in which it can provide further details about flights that left the United States before 7:25 PM. The Government maintains that there is no justification to order the provision of additional information, and that doing so would be inappropriate, because even accepting Plaintiffs' account of the facts, there was no violation of the Court's written order (since the relevant flights left U.S. airspace, and so their occupants were “removed,” before the order issued), and the Court's earlier oral statements were not independently enforceable as injunctions. The Government stands on those arguments.

Here's more on the legal wrangling over the deportations, and Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act:

Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against the judicial branch, saying that a federal judge who attempted to block his deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members should be impeached. The comment prompted a rare public statement from John Roberts, the chief justice of the supreme court, who said impeachment “is not an appropriate response” and that appeals in the case should be allowed to play out. We expect to find out more today about the deportations of the undocumented immigrants to El Salvador, where the government released jarring video of them being manhandled off planes and having their heads shaved. The government continues to argue that the group belonged to Tren de Aragua, whose members Trump has designated for rapid deportation, but family members of some of the men told the Washington Post they had no association with the gang.

Here's what else has happened today so far:

Despite the rhetoric, impeaching and removing federal judges is exceedingly rare, and Republicans don't appear to have the votes in the Senate.

Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's president, asked the Trump administration not to deport their citizens to a third country, or detain them in Guantánamo Bay.

More documents related to the assassination of John F Kennedy Jr should be released today, Trump told reporters on Monday.

Impeachments of federal judges are rare, removals are even rarer, and political considerations make it unlikely that Congress would ever remove a federal judge during Donald Trump's term.

Impeaching and removing a federal judge follows largely the same procedure as it would for a president. In order to remove a judge, the House of Representatives would have to vote to impeach them by a simple majority. The Senate would then hold a trial, after which they would need a two-thirds majority of members to vote to convict the judge and remove them from the federal bench.

While the GOP controls the Senate, they hold only 53 seats, and would need significant Democratic support to reach the 67-vote threshold for convictions – something that is unlikely to happen at Trump's bidding.

Impeachments and convictions are exceedingly rare, in general. According to federal court data, only 15 judges have ever been impeached, and eight convicted.

Chief justice of the supreme court John Roberts has issued a rare public statement after Donald Trump this morning suggested a federal judge who attempted to block his administration's deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members should be impeached.

Without referencing the president, Roberts said:

For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.

Roberts is considered part of the court's conservative bloc and has repeatedly joined rulings that Trump supports, perhaps most notably last year's decision granting presidents immunity for official acts. However, Roberts also has a record of defending the judiciary from Trump's attacks, such as this episode from his first term:

Mexico's government has asked the Trump administration not to send any of its deported citizens to Guantánamo Bay, or any other country besides their own, Reuters reports.

President Claudia Sheinbaum made the request after the US government deported more than 200 suspected Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, which agreed to take them in exchange for $6m.

Donald Trump has said he wants to detain tens of thousands of migrants at Guantánamo Bay, which is best known as the site where foreigners arrested in the US “war on terror” were imprisoned:

Donald Trump said that his administration will release tens of thousands of records today related to the assassination of John F Kennedy Jr, which he does not expect to be redacted.

“You got a lot of reading. I don't believe we're going to redact anything,” the president told reporters as he visited the Kennedy Center performing arts venue in Washington DC.

He added that he expected about 80,000 pages to be released. “They've been waiting for that for decades, and I said during the campaign I'd release them and I'm a man of my word, so, tomorrow you have the JFK files.”

Trump is indeed a man of his word in this respect, as was Joe Biden:

Donald Trump has been on the phone with Russian president Vladimir Putin for the past hour, a senior White House official said.

“President Trump is currently in the Oval Office speaking with President Vladimir Putin of Russia since 10:00amEDT. The call is going well, and still in progress,” deputy White House chief of staff Dan Scavino wrote on X.

The call between the two leaders is seen as crucial to the peace agreement Trump is hoping to forge in Ukraine. Here's more about it:

Fans of one-hit wonders and 90s music will no doubt recognize Semisonic's 1998 hit, “Closing Time”.

You can still hear it on the radio, at baseball games and, most recently, in a video the White House released to advertise their zeal for deporting people.

The Minnesota-based band is not a fan, writing on X:

We did not authorize or condone the White House's use of our song “Closing Time” in any way. And no, they didn't ask. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely.

In a court filing submitted yesterday, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) acknowledged that not all the alleged Venezuelan gang members are suspected of committing crimes in the United States.

“While it is true that many of the [Tren de Aragua] members removed under the [Alien Enemies Act] do not have criminal records in the United States, that is because they have only been in the United States for a short period of time,” wrote Robert L Cerna, the acting field office director for Ice's enforcement and removal operations in part of Texas.

“The lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat. In fact, based upon their association with TdA, the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.”

Despite family members of some of the deported Venezuelans insisting their relatives were not in any gang, Cerna argued all of the deportees had specifically been identified as part of Tren de Aragua, members of which Donald Trump has said should be removed under the Alien Enemies Act.

“ICE did not simply rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures, or tattoos alone,” Cerna wrote.

The Trump administration says the more than 200 undocumented immigrants flown to El Salvador are “terrorists” who belong to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang.

But the Washington Post spoke to relatives of four of those arrested, who said they are Venezuelans who escaped their country's economic collapse and were living in Dallas, before being arrested just days ago. The relatives deny that they belong to the gang or any other violent group.

From the Post's story:

The four friends grew up within blocks of each other in Venezuela, playing soccer and bouncing between one another's homes. As the nation deteriorated, they journeyed to the United States and were eking out a new life in Dallas, where they worked long hours and shared a townhouse.

Then, on Thursday, armed officers showed up at their home, arrested them and took them to a Texas detention center, Mervin Yamarte, 29, told his mother by phone. The family members do not know their charges, and the men's names do not appear in federal, state or local criminal court records.

What happened next horrified their families. Yamarte said they were asked to sign deportation papers and agreed, thinking that they would soon be back with their children and loved ones in Venezuela. But a day later, his mother saw a jarring video released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele showing alleged gang members being violently pulled off planes from the United States and dragged to a mega-prison notorious for allegations of human rights abuses.

Mercedes Yamarte spotted her son.

He appears for only a second, but she has no doubt it is him. He is kneeling and wearing a ripped black shirt. His head has been shaved. An officer stands behind him. He appears to be wincing.

“I didn't have words,” Mercedes Yamarte said Monday, her voice strained. “I couldn't speak.”

…

“If there are people with criminal records, then look for them,” Mercedes Yamarte said. “But the innocent shouldn't have to pay for the rest.”

With the help of the Senate, Donald Trump has the opportunity to appoint judges he approves to the federal judiciary, potentially tilting it towards the right, the Guardian's David Smith reports:

Donald Trump is poised to reshape the US judiciary over the next four years through hundreds of potential appointments of rightwing judges, a progressive advocacy group has warned.

The analysis by Demand Justice comes with the courts already facing extraordinary pressure. The Trump administration has suffered several legal setbacks and was accused of violating a judge's order by deporting about 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador.

Trump, a Republican, appointed 226 judges to the federal courts during his first term as president. The total was narrowly eclipsed by his successor, Joe Biden, with 228 including record numbers of women and people of colour.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Aurelio Martínez believed killed after plane crashed while taking off from Roatán island in Caribbean

At least 12 people, including a prominent member of the Garifuna music scene have died after a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from a Caribbean island off Honduras, officials said.

The Lanhsa airlines plane departed at nightfall on Monday from Roatán, one of the Central American country's main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.

The aircraft “made a sharp turn to the right of the runway and fell into the water”, civil aviation official Carlos Padilla said.

“The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing,” a fisherman told HCH television.

The fire department said 12 people were killed in the crash. Five people were rescued and one is missing.

The Honduran musician Aurelio Martínez was among the dead, according to local media reports.

Martínez, who between 2006 and 2010 was the country's first Black congressman, recorded a string of records, and was described by the Guardian in 2017 as “the finest living exponent of the lilting, soulful music of the Garifuna people”.

Dramatic video uploaded to social media by the national police showed officers and other rescue workers carrying survivors on to a rocky coastline, some in stretchers, as a nearby boat shone a bright light amid the darkness.

The injured passengers included a 40-year-old French citizen, who will be transferred to hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland, said Maj Wilmer Guerrero of the fire department.

Fifteen passengers were onboard the plane, along with two pilots and a flight attendant, police said.

The crash, which happened about a kilometer from the coast, was caused by an “apparent mechanical failure” on the British-made Jetstream 41, the statement added.

The Honduran president, Xiomara Castro, said she had “immediately activated” an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters and others to assist the victims of the accident.

Alphabet's acquisition of Israeli startup for $32bn follows rejection of takeover bid last summer

Google's owner, Alphabet, has agreed to buy the cybersecurity group Wiz for $32bn (£24.7bn), the biggest acquisition it has ever made.

The search company's purchase of the Israeli startup comes as Google attempts to catch its competitors Microsoft and Amazon in the competitive cloud services market.

Wiz, which offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks, turned down a $23bn takeover bid from Alphabet last summer.

The talks failed in part because Wiz and some of its investors were concerned about gaining clearance from regulators.

Alphabet has agreed to pay a $3.2bn fee if the deal fails to complete, as the takeover marks a test of the Trump administration's appetite to follow the former president Joe Biden's lead in taking on Big Tech.

US justice department officials are trying to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser to dismantle its monopoly over the search market.

Wiz, which has offices in New York and Israel and opened its European headquarters in London last year, was founded in 2020 by alumni of the Israeli intelligence corps' unit 8200. It has the backing of investors including the venture capital firms Sequoia, Thrive and Advent International.

Following the acquisition, Wiz will retain its brand and operate independently of Google, mirroring the way Microsoft operates LinkedIn, according to sources familiar with the deal.

Wiz will also continue to work with, and be available across, all major cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said: “Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds. Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers.”

When Wiz rejected Alphabet's $23bn offer, Assaf Rappaport, the startup's chief executive, said he was “flattered” by the offer but wanted to focus on growth with an eye to floating on the stock market instead.

“This is an exciting moment for our company, but an even more important one for customers and partners,” Rappaport said on Tuesday.

Dan Ives, an analyst at the US broker and investment manager Wedbush, said: “Wiz has become a household name for chief information officers as the Israeli cybersecurity player has a strong cloud cybersecurity platform and customer base that is going after a $1trn market opportunity.

“For Google this [will] be a shot across the bow at other big tech stalwarts, especially Microsoft and Amazon, making a major bet on the cybersecurity space to complement its cloud offering.”

Wiz has said its revenues are $750m annually. Wedbush estimated that Google could drive it to a $1bn-plus business over the coming years “given the company's massive installed base and go-to-market strategy globally”.

Alphabet's previous biggest deal was its $12.5bn acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012, which it sold two years later for $2.9bn.

Three years ago Alphabet paid $5.4bn to acquire the cybersecurity company Mandiant, to bolster its Google Cloud product. Other deals include paying $1.65bn for YouTube in 2006, and buying the UK AI startup DeepMind for about £400m in 2014.

Alphabet is keen to diversify its business away from its dependence on search-related advertising. The company hopes that Wiz will help it to increase its global market share of the cloud market from 12%, a distant third behind Microsoft Azure at 21% and Amazon Web Services, which has almost a third.

Ives said: “While this deal is expected to see further regulatory scrutiny across the board, we view this as a strategic move by Google to further bolster its cloud security offering and value proposition to enterprises as the company doubles down on its cloud and AI initiatives moving forward.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Mark Carney-led ruling party projected to form majority months after political wipeout seemed inevitable

In January, Canadian pollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects of Justin Trudeau's Liberal party, musing whether it would be a wipeout of existential proportions, or merely a catastrophic blowout.

But fresh polling released by three companies this week shows a stunning reversal of fortunes for the party: newly minted prime minister Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to secure a majority government.

The outcome has little precedent in Canadian history, reflecting the outsized role played by an unpredictable US president, and it underscores the incentives for Carney to call a snap election in the coming days.

On Tuesday, the political analyst Philippe Fournier updated his closely watched website 338Canada, which tracks and aggregates national polls, converting those figures into projected election results.

For the first time, his projection showed the Liberals with a 55% chance of a majority government. In January, the odds stood at less than 1%.

For the last two years, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has used a controversial carbon levy and Trudeau, a deeply unpopular outgoing prime minister, to propel his Tories to what promised to be one of the most lopsided political wins in recent memory. Pollsters predicted his party would seize a commanding majority of seats. For more than a year and a half, the Conservatives' win probabilities stood at more than 99%.

As recently as January, for example, the most sympathetic polling firm had Trudeau's party trailing the Conservatives by 20 points. Others had the gap as high as 27 points.

But Justin Trudeau's resignation days later, and Donald Trump's threats to take over Canada, changed everything.

In a recent column for the Walrus magazine on the “stunning Conservative collapse”, Fournier warned the Tories, whose odds of winning stood at 15%, were “suddenly at risk of blowing one of the largest polling leads in modern Canadian history”.

Virtually all Canadian polling companies have shown a sharp trend towards the Liberals, at the expense of the Conservative party and the leftwing New Democratic party. If current polling predictions are reflected in the results of the upcoming federal election, the NDP would collapse and lose party status in the House of Commons.

“This shift would be among the biggest we've seen in such a short period of time in Canadian history,” said Éric Grenier, a political analyst at the Writ. Unlike other notable shifts in public sentiment, he says, the result is heavily skewed by threats from Donald Trump.

“It isn't just a question of a leadership honeymoon … But that adds a level of volatility to the public opinion environment that makes things unpredictable.”

For Poilievre, who had harnessed a populist current in the country and drawn comparisons with Trump, the avenues forward are less clear after losing the easy political targets of Trudeau and the carbon tax.

While the Conservative leader's combative politics have served him well as opposition leader, that same strategy appear to be faltering as nationalism supplants partisanship.

Poilievre this week held an event with an “Axe the Tax” sign – days after Carney had dismantled the consumer-facing carbon tax.

The political columnist Robyn Urback posted on social media that the Conservatives “are still waging the election campaign they never got to have”.

In more grim data points for the Tories, polling from the Angus Reid Institute released on Monday found Canadians preferred Carney over Poilievre on all questions relating to the ongoing trade war and the future of Canada's economy.

“More bluntly, 41% now view Carney as best suited to be prime minister compared to 29% for Poilievre,” the company said in its new release. “At least measurement, with Trudeau sitting in the PM chair, Poilievre led the Liberal leader by 19 points on this question.”

If the polling holds, “what was a tired, discardable brand just three months ago would be on its way to a fourth term, this time with a majority”.

The firm notes the profound effect Donald Trump has had on Canadian politics. After staring down a US-led trade war and giving impassioned speeches about the need to fight for Canada's independence, Trudeau left with the approval of 47% of Canadians – a 25-point jump compared with an all-time low of 22% just weeks before he announced his resignation.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Historic levels of spending on military and infrastructure secured in Bundestag with last-minute backing of Greens

Germany's parliament has voted in favour of unleashing historic levels of spending to boost the military of Europe's biggest economy and inject its infrastructure with investments worth hundreds of billions of euros.

Incoming conservative chancellor Friedrich Merz along with the Social Democrats (SPD), his likely coalition partners after last month's election, led the drive for the creation of a €500bn fund and relaxation of its constitutionally protected debt rules. The parties secured the last-minute backing of the Greens, which was needed to push the plans through the outgoing parliament.

The package received the backing on Tuesday of 513 MPs, with 207 voting against, and no abstentions. The minimum required was 489 votes. It has been hailed by some as a necessary measure to give Germany the fiscal heft it needs to ensure national and European security, but by others as a “highly risky bet” that will be a burden for generations to come.

Merz told MPs the package was mainly motivated by “Putin's war of aggression against Europe”, listing a range of suspected Russian sabotage “taking place every day” against Germany. He said these included attacks on critical infrastructure, arson attacks, spying and disinformation campaigns, as well as broader “attempts to divide and marginalise the European Union”.

Acknowledging that his funding plans were viewed with concern by many who feared the burden of debt, Merz said it was time to acknowledge the new era in which Germany found itself, not least having to be independent from the US.

“We understand the worries, we understand the criticism,” he said, but added: “We have, for at least a decade, felt a false sense of security.” Germany had now to face a “paradigm shift”, which Merz said required “us to rebuild our defence capabilities, in part from scratch”.

Markets rose on Tuesday even before the vote had taken place, in anticipation that the plans would boost growth across Germany and the wider eurozone. The euro reached its highest level in more than five months.

Investors have said the fiscal injection could help Europe's largest economy emerge from two consecutive years of negative growth. However, they have also warned the package needs to be accompanied by widespread reforms, including boosting productive capacity, reducing bureaucracy, encouraging Germans to work longer and tackling high energy bills, which are prompting companies to leave Germany. 

Having passed the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, the legislation will on Friday go to the Bundesrat, the upper house, which represents the governments of Germany's 16 federal states.

The conservatives and SPD believed they needed to act quickly to pass the legislation in the current parliament because it required changes to the constitution and therefore a majority of at least two-thirds of MPs to back it. In the new Bundestag, due to convene on 25 March, it would have been likely to face opposition from the far-right AfD and far-left Die Linke, who together have a “blocking minority”.

But the very fact that it was shoehorned through the outgoing parliament within a matter of days, sparked the ire of opposition parties.

Alice Weidel, co-leader of the anti-immigrant, Kremlin-friendly, Alternative für Deutschland, which had lodged a legal complaint with the country's highest court in the hope of stopping the legislation's passage through the existing parliament, struck a note of fury, calling the package “election fraud worse than anything I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany”.

Weidel, a former investment banker, predicted that Germany's resulting debt burden would cause a downgrading of its triple-A fiscal stability rating, which would send a ripple effect across the eurozone, adding that it would “blow up in the face” of young people and taxpayers who would face the consequences for years to come.

Britta Haßelmann, parliamentary co-leader of the Greens, who reluctantly backed the legislation after securing guarantees that €100bn (£84bn) of the funds destined for infrastructure would be allocated for climate and economic transformation investments, poured scorn on Merz for having “rejected every idea regarding reforming the ‘debt brake'” in the past, “with such arrogance and populism it made one sick”.

But, she said, her party recognised the necessity to free up funds at such a crucial time, and was therefore “glad we're making this decision”.

Robin Winkler, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, called the decision to reform the debt brake “a historic fiscal regime shift” comparing it to the transfers made over German reunification almost 35 years ago. But for it to be a success the next government, he urged, “will need to deliver structural reforms to turn this … into sustainable growth”. 

At the centre of the reforms is Germany's so-called debt brake, imposed under the government of Angela Merkel after the 2008 global financial crisis to ensure debt was controlled for future generations. The rules have long since been criticised by experts who say they are outdated and too rigid particularly in an era of fast-evolving geopolitical circumstances.

Merz faced fierce criticism before and during the four-hour debate. Opponents said he had voiced his strong commitment to the debt brake during the election campaign, only to have changed his mind within days of winning on 23 February. Merz has justified this by citing the “rapidly changing situation”, in particular, the clash between the US president, Donald Trump, and his Ukraine counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Maria Ressa says rules-based order ‘can perhaps still exist' but social media is being used to undermine democracy around the world

The arrest of Rodrigo Duterte is a welcome sign that the rules-based order continues to hold, the Nobel laureate Maria Ressa has said, even as the global order has been marred by the US “descending into hell” at the hands of the same forces that consumed the Philippines.

Ressa's remarks came after Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, made his first appearance before the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, accused of committing crimes against humanity during his brutal “war on drugs”.

His arrest and the trial suggest that the thousands of victims and their families – rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were killed during the years-long crackdown – may finally see justice, said Ressa. “There's a sense that impunity ends and that the idea of an international, rules-based order can perhaps still exist.”

The American-Filipina journalist, however, found it impossible to untangle the news from the bigger picture. In 2016 Duterte had become the “first president elected with social media”, she said, seizing on the ubiquity of Facebook in the Philippines to, as her reporting has documented, mobilise online mobs and spread disinformation. Now, she said, the same tactics were being used to undermine democracy around the world, particularly in the US.

“I joke all the time that the Philippines went from hell to purgatory … My only worry is that the west and America is at the stage we were at in 2016, when you're descending to hell,” she said. “To watch this deja vu twice, it's like a bad punishment for me.”

As a cofounder of the Rappler news site, Ressa was at the forefront of exposing the propaganda spread by online trolls during Duterte's time in power, alongside his government's alleged abuses of power and growing authoritarianism.

Ressa, who in 2021 was awarded the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her determination to uphold freedom of expression, spoke to the Guardian from Berlin, where she was participating in a “people's court” that has this week put social media on trial, examining how it interacts with polarisation, radicalisation and misinformation.

The week-long Social Media Tribunal, which has no legal powers, will hear testimonies from sources that range from a Facebook whistleblower to a Rohingya campaigner and victims of cyberstalking and sextortion before handing down its “judgment” on Friday.

Backed by the rights group Cinema for Peace and Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties, and created under the patronage of Benjamin Ferencz, who until his death in 2023 was the last surviving prosecutor from the Nuremberg trials, the initiative aims to ramp up pressure for international accountability. In 2023, the same campaigners were behind a similar “people's court” that put the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on trial for the crime of aggression after his invasion of Ukraine.

The tribunal in Berlin was opened on Monday by Ressa, who cited a whistleblower on how, more than a decade ago, the Philippines was alleged to have been used as a “petri dish” to test out the interplay between social media and tactics of mass manipulation. “If it worked in our country, they went to the west, specifically targeting America,” said Ressa.

As falsehoods, many of them laced with fear, hate and outrage, began hurtling across social media in the Philippines, Ressa travelled to Silicon Valley to sound the alarm. “I felt like Cassandra and Sisyphus combined,” she said. “And I think people just kind of thought, ‘oh that's interesting, that's never going to happen here.'”

Years later, the world watched as the 2024 US presidential elections played out against a similar backdrop, giving rise to an ecosystem that continues to prop up the Trump administration. Ressa, who last year described “tech bros” such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk as “the largest dictators” said the US was now staring down “the greatest challenge democracy will face”.

She said: “Because when you give the broligarchy state power – ie the most powerful country in the world at this moment in time – who knows what will happen?”

What she did know was that time was of the essence. “What we learned in the Philippines is that you are at your greatest power when the attacks begin. If you are silent, you give consent. If you are silent, you give up your rights,” she said. “This is that moment where you have to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice for the truth? Because if you don't, if you bury your head in the sand like an ostrich, you will lose your rights.”

She pointed to the Philippines to highlight what was at stake. As Rappler refused to back down from publishing stories about Duterte's administration, Ressa fended off a barrage of hate – at one point the messages soared to 98 an hour, she said – and faced 10 criminal charges. Two years after Duterte left office, she has won most of the cases but two charges remain, forcing her to request court permission each time she wants to leave the country.

Duterte's arrest last week laid bare a nation still divided: while supporters took to the streets in his strongholds, others continue to grapple with the painful fallout of a years-long anti-drug campaign that saw thousands of people – many of them men in poorer, urban areas – gunned down in the streets.

“In 2016, when the drug war began, I was like ‘Oh my god, this is going to affect a generation of Filipinos'. And it has,” she said. “So yes, he's arrested but there's so much damage that now needs to get rebuilt.”

She cast it as a sort of cautionary tale for the US and west, one that pointed to how the free rein of technology could pave the way for populism to be tipped into authoritarianism. “If you do not protect your rights today, what's destroyed takes a hell of a long time to rebuild.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Fired workers warn cuts including closing of two offices will undermine agency work and increase costs

The Trump administration's decision to shutter two offices at Nasa risks “dramatically” increasing the costs of space exploration, while handing Elon Musk more influence over the agency, fired workers have warned.

Nasa's office of technology, policy and strategy and office of the chief scientist provide independent analysis on key investments and strategies. Both are set to close, amid widespread cuts at the agency.

Workers inside the two offices told the Guardian these cuts would undermine the ongoing goals of manned missions to the moon and Mars – and raise questions over conflicts of interest for Musk, who remains CEO of SpaceX, the rocket and satellite giant, while leading the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has led the charge to cut back the federal government under Donald Trump.

The US president has nominated the billionaire Jared Isaacman, a SpaceX investor and close ally of Musk, to become Nasa's next administrator.

With a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the International Space Station early on Sunday, due to fly a pair of US astronauts stuck there for more than nine months home on Tuesday, the cuts have fueled fears that Musk's power over Nasa is on the rise.

“Musk wants to go to Mars. They need no detractors,” said one senior Nasa official. “The most independent and unbiased views on this come from these offices, not centers or directorates who don't care as long as there is money flowing in.”.

Nasa announced last week it was shutting down the two offices.

About 20 employees are affected by the cuts, with their last day scheduled for 10 April. Typically fired federal workers are provided 60 days' notice, but Nasa says this was cut to 30 due to the “urgent need” to comply with an executive order signed by Trump.

Nasa's acting administrator, Janet Petro, was appointed by Trump in January. Soon after, Petro named Michael Altenhofen, a longtime SpaceX employee, as senior adviser, further inciting concerns about the conflicts of interest between the agency and Musk as SpaceX receives lucrative federal contracts.

When Petro had dinner with Musk last year, she said the encounter was “one of the most fascinating conversations of my entire life”.

The two shuttered offices are “extremely critical”, according to the senior official, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Officials working for Trump and Musk are “hurting Nasa long term”, they said. “We're all pissed off because we really care about this agency, and have spent years working in various parts of the agencies, at centers and other directorates, to bring that knowledge to [leaders in] the A-suite.”

The “cruelty and callousness” of those executing the cuts “is just astounding”, the official added, claiming that fired employees had been blocked from consideration for realignment to different agencies and any associated awards and bonuses.

Another terminated employee, at Nasa's office of technology, policy and Strategy, argued that closing the offices was a shortsighted decision. “We're missing out on the longer-term vision for moon to Mars exploration by cutting these offices, and probably increasing the costs of these missions dramatically, without this analysis and more strategic tech development,” they said.

The cuts announced last week took the agency's rank and file by surprise, according to the employee. “These offices brought a lot in terms of efficiency,” they said. “They had very low overhead[s] because they weren't building anything. It was just the cost of a handful of employees that were making major impacts to cost savings by thinking about how to streamline tech investments, and from an overall strategic picture what science should be focusing on.”

SpaceX is Nasa's largest private contractor. The agency says it has spent more than $15bn on work undertaken by SpaceX over the years, and it keeps coming: In February, Nasa awarded the firm a contract of up to $300m for its Pandora mission launch, and a $100m contract to launch its Near Earth Object surveyor mission.

Critics have accused Nasa of preferential treatment towards Musk's business empire. “Simultaneously awarding his private companies with billions of dollars in federal contracts raises grave questions as to whether you and your agencies are enabling corrupt favoritism to benefit Mr Musk,” the US senators Adam Schiff and Tammy Duckworth wrote to Nasa last month.

Nasa has confirmed an employee affiliated with Doge has been embedded within the agency.

“Given Doge's destructive seizure of power throughout the federal government and the unique conflicts-of-interest that Elon Musk possesses with Nasa, Doge's presence at the agency creates an unprecedented threat from within Nasa's own house,” three members of Congress wrote to the agency in February.

A spokesperson for Nasa said: “To optimize our workforce, and in compliance with an executive order, Nasa is beginning its phased approach to a reduction in force, known as a RIF. A small number of individuals received notification March 10 they are a part of Nasa's RIF.”

Nasa is working on a “broader reorganization plan”, the spokesperson added, as part of Trump's blitz on the federal government.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Il Foglio says artificial intelligence used ‘for everything – the writing, the headlines, the quotes … even the irony' 

An Italian newspaper has said it is the first in the world to publish an edition entirely produced by artificial intelligence.

The initiative by Il Foglio, a conservative liberal daily, is part of a month-long journalistic experiment aimed at showing the impact AI technology has “on our way of working and our days”, the newspaper's editor, Claudio Cerasa, said.

The four-page Il Foglio AI has been wrapped into the newspaper's slim broadsheet edition, and is available on newsstands and online from Tuesday.

“It will be the first daily newspaper in the world on newsstands created entirely using artificial intelligence,” said Cerasa. “For everything. For the writing, the headlines, the quotes, the summaries. And, sometimes, even for the irony.” He added that journalists' roles would be limited to “asking questions [into an AI tool] and reading the answers”.

The experiment comes as news organisations around the world grapple with how AI should be deployed. Earlier this month, the Guardian reported that BBC News was to use AI to give the public more personalised content.

The front page of the first edition of Il Foglio AI carries a story referring to the US president, Donald Trump, describing the “paradox of Italian Trumpians” and how they rail against “cancel culture” yet either turn a blind eye, or worse, “celebrate” when “their idol in the US behaves like the despot of a banana republic”.

The front page also features a column headlined “Putin, the 10 betrayals”, with the article highlighting “20 years of broken promises, torn-up agreements and words betrayed” by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.

In a rare upbeat story about the Italian economy, another article points to the latest report from Istat, the national statistics agency, on the redistribution of income, which shows the country “is changing, and not for the worse” with salary increases for about 750,000 workers being among the positive effects of income tax reforms.

On page 2 is a story about “situationships” and how young Europeans are fleeing steady relationships.

The articles were structured, straightforward and clear, with no obvious grammatical errors.

However, none of the articles published in the news pages directly quote any human beings.

Cerasa said Il Foglio AI reflected “a real newspaper” and was the product of “news, debate and provocations”.

Call to come amid reports that Russia is demanding halt to western arms deliveries as condition for truce

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held high-stakes call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, amid reports that Russia is demanding a halt to all western arms deliveries to Ukraine as a condition for a truce.

The White House said that the call had wrapped up and that it would issue a readout from the conversation shortly.

Ahead of the call, Trump wrote on his Truth Social Platform: “I look very much forward to the call with President Putin.”

“Many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains,” he added.

The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that the two leaders would discuss “a large number of issues from the normalisation of our relations and the Ukrainian issue”.

“The leaders will speak for as long as they deem necessary,” Peskov said.

The highly anticipated call was the first known conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine agreed to support an immediate 30-day ceasefire last week.

Putin in effect rejected the plan, instead outlining a series of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine's rearmament and mobilisation, as well as a suspension of western military aid to Kyiv during the 30-day ceasefire.

Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Putin was expected to demand a suspension of all weapons deliveries to Ukraine – including US and European aid – during a ceasefire proposed by Trump.

Europe is likely to be uneasy about agreeing to this condition, as the UK and European Union are stepping up efforts to deliver fresh military aid packages to Kyiv as soon as possible.

The Russian leader has also renewed calls for broader negotiations on a long-term settlement to the war. His demands are likely to include the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato.

Before the talk, Trump said Russian and American negotiators had already talked about “dividing up certain assets”.

“We're doing pretty well, I think, with Russia,” Trump said on Sunday, adding that he thought there was a very good chance of reaching a ceasefire.

Kyiv will be alarmed by Trump's hints that the US may put pressure on Ukraine to cede significant territory.

“I think we'll be talking about land, it's a lot of land,” he said. “It's a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We'll be talking about land,” Trump said when asked about Ukrainian concessions.

“We'll be talking about power plants,” apparently referring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest nuclear site in Europe.

Trump's rhetoric on dividing territory has echoes of the 1945 Yalta conference, where Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt divided Europe between the American-aligned west and the Soviet-controlled east.

Hours before of the talk, Putin appeared to make a point out of looking relaxed and confident.

He attended a meeting with leading Russian businessman in Moscow at the time when the call with Trump was meant to start. Asked if he was going to be late, Putin waved off the question and laughed.

Peskov was quick to dismiss such comparisons on Tuesday, stating that global restructuring and a “new Yalta” were not on the agenda.

The US outlet Semafor reported on Monday that the White House was considering officially recognising Crimea – annexed by Moscow in 2014 – as Russian territory as part of a potential peace deal. Washington is also reportedly discussing the possibility of putting pressure on the UN to follow suit.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Finland on Tuesday, together with his wife. Zelenskyy was due to meet political leaders in the country, which borders Russia and became a member of Nato following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Zelenskyy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak laid out Kyiv's so-called “red lines” on Tuesday, prior to the Trump-Putin call. “Ukraine will not discuss neutral status or a reduction in numbers of our armed forces. We will never recognises any temporarily occupied territory as Russian,” he wrote on Telegram.

In Moscow, senior Russian officials appeared to be laying the groundwork for improved relations with Washington. Speaking at a business conference in the city, Kirill Dmitriev, a senior aide close to Putin, said he expected to hold talks with Elon Musk soon about potential Mars missions.

“I think there will undoubtedly be a discussion with Musk about Mars flights in the near future,” Dmitriev said at the forum. He proceeded to praise Musk – the billionaire Tesla founder and close Trump ally who has previously expressed sympathies toward the Kremlin.

Dmitriev said Moscow was eager to collaborate with the SpaceX CEO as part of broader efforts to strengthen Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, and state nuclear corporation, Rosatom.

Both Russian and US officials have expressed interest in restoring economic cooperation once peace is achieved in Ukraine.

Tuesday's call between Trump and Putin comes as Ukrainian troops have retreated from nearly all of Russia's Kursk region. The US leader on Monday claimed he intervened to save thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in the region, echoing Putin's unsubstantiated claim that thousands of Ukrainian troops were surrounded.

“They're surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be here any longer. I was able to get them [Russia] not to do anything at the moment,” Trump told journalists at the Kennedy Center in Washington.

Kyiv and independent military analysts have denied that Ukrainian forces in the Russian border region are or were encircled, stating instead that Ukraine has conducted an organised retreat over the past several weeks.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Vladimir Putin issues long list of conditions and demands that require ‘further consideration'

Russia has agreed to a limited energy and infrastructure ceasefire in Ukraine as part of the US-led initiative to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the White House has confirmed.

In a statement released after Donald Trump's call with Vladimir Putin, the White House said the two sides agreed to hold “technical negotiations” on a maritime ceasefire, and, further, full ceasefire and permanent peace.

“These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,” the White House said.

Trump and Putin also “agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the US and Russia has huge upside,” with “enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability.”

Today, President Trump and President Putin spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia.The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people.
    This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts. The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East. The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts. They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application. The two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel. The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.

We're starting to get reaction from European leaders to the very limited ceasefire agreed during the Trump-Putin call, maintaining that a total ceasefire must follow – and there must be no decisions made without Ukraine and over Ukraine's head.

At a news conference in Berlin with French president Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, the outgoing German chancellor, said that while the agreement to end Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure is “a good start”, “there cannot be an agreement without Ukraine”.

The next step must be a complete ceasefire for Ukraine and as quickly as possible. Of course it is clear that we both agree on this too.

Macron echoed this sentiment. He said:

We have been promoting peace since day one and that cannot be achieved without Ukraine taking part in talks.

As we've been reporting, some progress towards a ceasefire seems to have been made during the more than two-hour-long call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. But, as expected, Moscow has laid out stiff demands for a full truce.

As Bloomberg (paywall) reported this morning, Putin wants a halt to all arms shipments to Ukraine as a prerequisite to any agreement to fully pause the war. The Kremlin readout outlines that a priority for Russia remains “the need to stop forced mobilization in Ukraine and rearm the Ukrainian Armed Forces”, and a key condition for preventing escalation of the war is “complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv”.

As my colleague Pjotr Sauer reported earlier, Europe is likely to be uneasy about agreeing to this condition, as the UK and European Union are ramping up efforts to deliver fresh military aid packages to Kyiv as soon as possible. European leaders fear that any such agreement would produce a scenario in which Russia simply rearms to attack Ukraine again after the ceasefire ends, while Ukraine would be left unable to prepare a defence.

On that note, that's all from me Jakub Krupa, but I'm leaving you with Lucy Campbell to guide you through the evening as we expect to learn more about what was discussed between Trump and Putin.

Stay with our coverage on Europe Live.

Curiously, the Russian readout also includes an amusing line that the two leaders appeared to discuss Putin's idea to “organise hockey matches in the United States and Russia” between Russian and American players performing in the NHL and the Russian equivalent, the KHL (Kontinental Hockey League).

There is no mention of that in the US readout.

According to both parties, Trump and Putin agreed on a limited stop in attacks on energy infrastructure, but it seems that Trump was unable to push Putin into a broader ceasefire, which would include land and sea operations.

The agreed format – with focus on energy infrastructure and further talks on stopping hostilities at sea – appears to be closer to the much narrower original proposal made by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and first publicly floated by French president Emmanuel Macron.

On other issues, there doesn't appear to be much progress, with major differences remaining.

But we still need to hear more about the details of what was agreed.

The Kremlin readout, in Russian, is more extensive, and gives us a glimpse into Putin's arguments – and a long list of conditions and demands on his side.

It says the Russian side “outlined a number of significant points” requiring further consideration, including on “effective control” over any ceasefire along the line of conflict, and Russia's demand to stop mobilisation of Ukrainians and rearming of its armed forces alongside its broader request to “eliminate the root causes of the crisis.”

The statement also added Moscow's “key condition” to prevent further escalation of the conflict in a demand to “completely cease” foreign military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine.

But the readout confirms that Putin has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and says the Russian leader has already issued relevant orders.

The Kremlin's text also says that Putin “responded constructively” to proposal of a ceasefire at sea, with further negotiations expected on this issue.

The statement also says that Putin informed Trump of plans for a Russian-Ukrainian swap of 175 prisoners of war on each side, and “as a gesture of goodwill” a further release of 23 “seriously wounded” Ukrainian servicemen.

The readout also covered their discussions on the Middle East and the Red Sea, as well as broader push to “normalise bilateral relations.”

Strikes said to target Hamas killed hundreds within hours including women and children, undermining ceasefire

World governments and UN officials have expressed horror and dismay at Israel's resumption of strikes on Gaza that killed hundreds within a few hours, warning the assault could shatter a ceasefire that was intended to be permanent.

Jordan, a US ally that has a peace agreement with Israel, called the strikes “aggressive and barbaric”. Egypt, which also has a diplomatic relationship with Israel and helped mediate the truce, called the bombing a “flagrant violation” of the ceasefire that took effect in mid-January.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said Palestinians in Gaza were being subjected to an “intolerable level of suffering”, while Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said resuming the war would fuel “hell on Earth”.

The UN's human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “airstrikes and shelling, which killed hundreds, are horrifying. This nightmare must end immediately.”

Türk added that the strikes would “add tragedy on to tragedy”, while calling for an immediate end to the violence, the unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas militants and all those arbitrarily detained – a reference to Palestinian detainees held by Israel.

“The last 18 months of violence have made abundantly clear that there is no military path out of this crisis,” he said, calling for a political settlement in line with international law. “Israel's resort to yet more military force will only heap further misery upon a Palestinian population already suffering catastrophic conditions.”

Separately, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory, Muhannad Hadi, described Israel's renewed assault as “unconscionable”.

While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is fighting allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”. The Israeli government is separately disputing allegations of genocide.

The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Monday – before the strikes began – that Israel had committed “a breach of international law” by blocking aid into Gaza, in a significant hardening of the British position. “Israel quite rightly must defend its own security but we find the lack of aid … unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying,” he told parliament.

On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the reported civilian casualties from the overnight Israeli strikes were “appalling”. “We want to see this ceasefire agreement re-established as soon as possible,” they added.

The EU's aid commissioner, Hadja Lahbib, said the “renewed escalation in Gaza is devastating. Civilians have endured unimaginable suffering. This must stop.”

Reuters cited two security sources in Egypt as saying that Egyptian mediators were surprised by the overnight airstrikes as negotiations a day earlier had been calm and they had not been notified. Mediators were now engaged in intense contacts to salvage the ceasefire and return to talks, they said.

Qatar and Saudi Arabia – two powerful gulf monarchies in the region – both condemned Israel for the strikes.

Fearing ethnic cleansing under the Israeli-backed plan by Donald Trump, the US president, to forcibly expel the remaining Palestinians from the ruins of Gaza, Arab nations have proposed an alternative plan to rebuild it. However, they have no way to enforce such a scheme on the occupied territory without Israeli agreement.

Turkey, a staunch supporter of Palestine and Hamas, described Israel's attacks on Gaza as a “new phase in its policy of genocide” against Palestinians.

A spokesperson for the European Commission said the EU deplored the restart of hostilities in Gaza. “We want Hamas to release all its hostages and we ask Israel to show restraint and to re-establish free humanitarian access to Gaza,” said the spokesperson, adding that negotiations were the only way to find a solution.

The head of the European Council, António Costa, said he was shocked and saddened by the news from Gaza: “Violence must stop and the terms of the ceasefire agreement must be respected. All hostages and detainees must be released, and humanitarian aid must be resumed immediately,” he wrote on X.

France said it condemned the Israeli strikes, which it said were “jeopardising efforts to free the hostages and threatening the lives of the civilian population in Gaza”. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, also said on Tuesday that the deadly new series of Israeli airstrikes threatened a permanent end to hostility.

Germany, one of Israel's closest allies in Europe, said it felt a “great concern” after the strikes on Monday night. The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said: “The images of burning tents in refugee camps are shocking. Fleeing children and internally displaced persons must never be used as leverage in negotiations.”

Israel, which consulted the US in advance of the action, said the strikes were targeted at mid-level Hamas commanders, officials and infrastructure.

A former French ambassador to the US and Israel, Gérard Araud, said that what was happening in Gaza should incite “horror, indignation and condemnation”.

In posts on social media, the French diplomat said the operation launched by Israel did not respond to any identifiable military objective “other than to inflict suffering on the civilian population until Hamas capitulates, which it will not”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Administration claims it didn't stop flights despite judge's instructions because he did not write it in the formal order

The Trump administration claimed to a federal judge on Monday that it did not recall deportation flights of hundreds of suspected Venezuelan gang members over the weekend despite his specific instructions because that was not expressly included in the formal written order issued afterwards.

The administration also said that even if James Boasberg, the chief US district judge in Washington, had included that instruction in his formal order, his authority to compel the planes to return disappeared the moment the planes entered international airspace.

The extraordinary arguments suggested the White House took advantage of its own perceived uncertainty with a federal court order to do as it pleased, testing the limits of the judicial system to hold to account an administration set on circumventing adverse rulings.

An incredulous Boasberg at one stage asked the administration: “Isn't then the better course to return the planes to the United States and figure out what to do, than say: ‘We don't care; we'll do what we want'?”

The showdown between the administration and the judge reached a crescendo over the weekend after the US president secretly invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport, without normal due process, Venezuelans over age 14 who the government says belong to the Tren de Aragua gang.

The underlying basis for Trump to invoke the statute is unclear because it historically requires the president to identify a state adversary, and Boasberg on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking deportations of five Venezuelans who had filed suit against the government.

At an emergency hearing on Saturday evening, Boasberg extended his injunction to block the deportation of all Venezuelan migrants using Alien Enemies Act authority, and told the administration that any deportation flights already in the air needed to be recalled.

By the time of the hearing, two flights had already taken off and a third flight left after Boasberg issued his ruling. All three flights landed in El Salvador, where the deportees were taken to a special maximum security prison, after Boasberg issued his written order.

The Trump administration claimed at a hearing on Monday that it believed it had complied with the written order issued by Boasberg, which did not include his verbal instructions for any flights already departed to return to the US.

“Oral statements are not injunctions and the written orders always supersede whatever may have been stated in the record,” Abhishek Kambli, the deputy assistant attorney general for the justice department's civil division, argued for the administration.

The judge appeared unimpressed by that contention. “You felt that you could disregard it because it wasn't in the written order. That's your first argument? The idea that because my written order was pithier so it could be disregarded, that's one heck of a stretch,” Boasberg said.

The administration also suggested that even if Boasberg had included the directive in his written order, by the time he had granted the temporary restraining order, the deportation flights were outside of the judge's jurisdiction.

The judge expressed similar skepticism at the second argument, noting that federal judges still have authority over US government officials who make the decisions about the planes, even if the planes themselves were outside of US airspace.

“The problem is the equitable power of United States courts is not so limited,” Boasberg said. “It's not a question that the plane was or was not in US airspace.” Boasberg added. “My equitable powers are pretty clear that they do not lapse at the airspace's edge.”

At times, the Trump administration appeared to touch on a separate but related position that the judge's authority to block the deportations clashed with Trump's authority to direct US military forces and foreign relations without review by the courts.

Boasberg expressed doubt at the strength of that argument, as well as Kambli's separate claim that he could not provide more details about when the deportation flights took off and how many flights left the US on Saturday, before and possibly after his order.

Kambli said he was not authorized to provide those details on account of national security concerns, even in private, to the judge himself. Asked whether the information was classified, Kambli demurred. Boasberg ordered the government to provide him with more information by noon on Tuesday.

The statements offered by the administration in federal district court in Washington offered a more legally refined version of public statements from White House officials about the possibility that they had defied a court order.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted on Monday that the administration acted within “the bounds of immigration law in this country” and said the Trump team did not believe a verbal order carried the same legal weight as a written order.

But the White House's “border czar” Tom Homan offered greater defiance at the court order and told Fox News in an interview that the court order came too late for Boasberg to have jurisdiction over the matter, saying: “I don't care what the judges think.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Drake's attorneys accuse Universal of being ‘a greedy company' that is ‘finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation'.

Universal Music Group have moved to dismiss Drake's defamation suit, characterising it as “a misguided attempt” by the Canadian rapper to “salve his wounds” after he “lost a rap battle” with rival Kendrick Lamar.

In the motion, filed on Monday in the US district court for the southern district of New York, Universal Music Group (UMG), which represents both artists, claimed that Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated.

“Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds. Plaintiff's complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice”.

The long-term rivalry between Drake and Kendrick Lamar escalated in March 2024 with the rapid-fire, tit-for-tat release of diss tracks by both artists, culminating in the release of Not Like Us on 4 May, in which Lamar framed Drake as a “certified pedophile”. The track proved immensely popular, topping the Billboard Global 200 chart and winning Record and Song of the Year at the 2025 Grammys.

Drake filed a lawsuit in January accusing UMG of defamation and harassment, and alleging that UMG “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response”.

Drake's suit noted that the artwork for Not Like Us features a picture of his Toronto home with markers used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders; and referred to a shooting that occurred outside the residence days after the track's release in which a security guard was injured, and two attempted trespassings in the subsequent days.

“This lawsuit is not about the artist who created ‘Not Like Us,'” the filing by Drake's team read. “It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.”

In its motion to dismiss, Universal argue that Drake fails to make a claim for defamation, saying that Not Like Us “conveys nonactionable opinion and rhetorical hyperbole, not fact,” and noting that the rapper has relied on UMG to promote his own diss tracks against Lamar and others.

Drake's lawsuit, UMG says in its filing, “disregards the other Drake and Lamar diss tracks that surrounded ‘Not Like Us' as well as the conventions of the diss track genre … diss tracks are a popular and celebrated artform centered around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake's suit were permitted to proceed.”

“Less than three years ago, Drake himself signed a public petition criticizing ‘the trend of prosecutors using artists' creative expression against them' by treating rap lyrics as literal fact,” UMG's motion continues. “As Drake recognized, when it comes to rap, ‘[t]he final work is a product of the artist's vision and imagination'.

“Drake was right then and is wrong now.”

Universal also denies that its promotion of Not Like Us invited harassment of Drake, stating that the rapper is attempting “to contort violent metaphors in the lyrics into incitement”. “As with his defamation claim, Drake seeks to chill a form of artistic expression that he himself has embraced,” the motion reads.

In a statement provided to Variety, Drake's attorney Michael J. Gottlieb responded to Universal's motion to dismiss, saying: “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence.

“This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG's long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Global Times hails US president's order to strip back government funding to news organisations he deems ‘radical'

Chinese state media has reacted gleefully to the Trump administration's decision to slash government funding to media organisations such as Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Voice of America (VOA).

The Global Times, a daily English-language tabloid and Chinese Communist party mouthpiece, celebrated the cuts to the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees broadcasters such as VOA and RFA.

“When it comes to China-related reporting, VOA has an appalling track record,” the Global Times said in an editorial on Monday.

“From smearing human rights in China's Xinjiang … to hyping up disputes in the South China Sea … from fabricating the so-called China virus narrative to promoting the claim of China's ‘overcapacity', almost every malicious falsehood about China has VOA's fingerprints all over it,” the editorial said.

The Beijing Daily, a newspaper run by the Chinese Communist party (CCP), also published a column commending the cuts.

The schadenfreude comes after US president Donald Trump signed an order gutting USAGM and instructing it to reduce its operations to the bare minimum mandated by the law. He accused VOA of being “radical” and “anti-Trump”.

The order would “ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda” the White House said in a statement. USAGM employed roughly 3,500 people and had an $886m budget in 2024, according to the agency's latest report to Congress.

The attempt to close down RFA was “a reward to dictators and despots”, its president, Bay Fang, said, “including the Chinese Communist party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space.

“Today's notice not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense.”

RFA's union said in a statement that the move would “hand a victory to the Chinese Communist party, which harbors a particular disdain for free media and truth” and would “embolden Kim Jong-un's totalitarian regime in Pyongyang, where information control reaches unprecedented levels”.

The union said it intends to challenge the decision, adding that a termination of its service would “betray the very principles upon which America stands”.

At VOA, which was set up during the second world war to counter Nazi propaganda, Trump's decision has seen almost 1,300 staff placed on administrative leave, according to VOA director Mike Abramowitz.

Veteran VOA correspondent Brian Padden said it was “particularly galling” that Elon Musk had accused VOA of anti-American propaganda to justify the shutdown.

“In the course of my reporting, I have been shot at, roughed up, and even nearly decapitated by an exploding helicopter in eastern Ukraine. In 2014, I was harassed by pro-Russian activists or militants in Ukraine who accused me and my VOA TV crew of being agents of pro-American propaganda,” he said in a social media post.

“Both Musk and the Russian militants are wrong. VOA does not do propaganda. VOA reports the news, which includes the perspective of both proponents and critics of the president.”

Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House bureau chief, said in a statement on social media: “I do not know a single VOA journalist who is not fiercely protective of our charter and the editorial independence it provides, especially those of us born in countries where there is no such concept.”

South-east Asia is still reeling from cuts to USAid, which had provided funding to a range of media organisations, including local journalists covering atrocities in war-torn Myanmar.

Former Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen, an authoritarian who handed power to his son in 2023, also weighed in publicly to praise the Trump administration decision, describing the cuts as a “major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement, and chaos around the world”.

On the ground in Phnom Penh, not all Cambodian journalists agree.

Sun Narin, who has worked as a contractor for VOA in Cambodia for eight years, described the decision as “dark time for us and journalism in Cambodia”.

“I feel hopeless,” he said. “The situation of our press has been getting worse and worse since the shutdown of a few independent media outlets. VOA is now the only long-term outlet that dares to broadcast critical information to the public. So people have no more choices.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Lizards may have snacked on their raft of uprooted trees and plants on their months-long journey across the Pacific

Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas – thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.

They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed the Fijian islands so far away.

But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000km) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation – masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record – further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever travelled on the ocean.

Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galápagos Islands off Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31m years ago.

The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other data on where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.

“Given what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported,” said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study.

The research was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.

“If you had to pick a vertebrate to survive a long trip on a raft across an ocean, iguanas would be the one,” said study author Simon Scarpetta from the University of San Francisco, in an email.

Many Fijian iguana species are endangered, and an invasive green iguana roams the islands today, said study author Robert Fisher of the United States Geological Survey. Figuring out where these creatures came from can equip scientists with the tools to better protect them in the future.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

BYD unveils platform with charging power of 1,000 kW, which would be twice as fast as Tesla's supercharging

The Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has unveiled a new charging system that it said could make it possible for EVs to charge as quickly as it takes to refill with petrol.

BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares gained 4.1% on Tuesday to hit a record high of 408.80 Hong Kong dollars, as investors bet that the company could strengthen its already commanding position as one of the world's biggest electric carmakers.

Two new BYD models will be capable of receiving peak charging power of 1,000 kilowatts (kW), enabling them to travel 400km (249 miles) on a five-minute charge, the BYD founder, Wang Chuanfu, said at an event livestreamed from the company's Shenzhen headquarters on Monday.

BYD was the world's second-largest producer of battery electric vehicles in 2024, marginally behind Tesla, but the Chinese company also sells hundreds of thousands of plug-in hybrids that combine a battery with a petrol engine. Wang, who is often described as China's answer to the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, started the business as a battery maker in 1995, before starting car manufacturing in 2003.

Charging speeds of 1,000 kW – or 1 megawatt (MW) – would be twice as fast as Tesla's superchargers, which offer up to 500 kW. Fast-charging technology has been seen as key to increasing EV adoption.

The news underlines the intense competition for the already struggling Tesla, whose stock has plunged following Musk's championing of hard-right causes in Europe and the slashing of the US federal workforce as part of his work with the Trump administration.

Besides missing sales targets, Tesla faces heightened investor pressure to produce autonomous vehicles, which Musk has promised but failed to deliver for about a decade. It is also facing increased competition with more affordable EV models, including those produced by BYD and other Chinese companies.

Tesla's share price slumped by 5.5% on Tuesday, adding to a 4.8% decline on Monday. Its valuation has fallen by 44% during 2025 so far, with investors worried about declining sales, and the possible hit to Tesla's reputation from Musk's close alignment with Trump.

In a move aping Tesla, BYD also said it would install a network of 4,000 of its own “flash-charging stations” across China to allow for the fast charging. The company did not specify the timeframe, nor say how much it would invest in building such facilities. To date, BYD owners have largely relied on other automakers' charging facilities or public charging run by third-party operators.

“In order to completely solve our users' charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,” Wang said. “This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt has been achieved on charging power.”

The new charging architecture will be initially available in two new EVs, the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV, priced from 270,000 yuan ($37,330).

Tesla has offered its superchargers in China since 2014, and BYD's smaller Chinese peers, such as Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng and Zeekr, have also been investing extensively and building charging facilities for years.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Made up of blobby tissue and living deep in the ocean, the distinctive species beat the longfin eel and pygmy pipehorse in the annual contest

It was once crowned the “world's ugliest animal” and now the disgruntled-looking gelatinous blobfish has a new gong to its name: New Zealand's fish of the year.

The winning species of blobfish, Psychrolutes marcidus, lives in the highly pressurised depths off the coasts of New Zealand and Australia and has developed a unique anatomy to exist. Blobfish do not have a swim bladder, a full skeleton, muscles or scales. Instead, their bodies are made up of blobby tissue with a lower density than water that allows them to float above the seafloor.

The species is believed to be able to live to 130 years old, is slow growing and slow moving, says Konrad Kurta, a spokesperson from the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust that runs the annual competition.

“It sort of sits there and waits for prey to come very close and practically walk into its mouth before it eats them,” he says. It is also a “dedicated parent” with females laying up to 100,000 eggs in a single nest, which they protect until they hatch.

The fish found fame over a decade ago after a crew member on a New Zealand research vessel snapped a photograph of the rarely seen animal. Its distinctive appearance was quickly adopted into meme culture.

The pressure of the water forces their shape into that of a regular – albeit bulbous – fish but out of the depths they can resemble “a failed medical experiment”, Kurta said.

“Regrettably, when it is pulled up … that sudden decompression causes it to become all disfigured,” Kurta says.

Little is known about their conservation status due to a lack of research, but their populations and habitat are considered vulnerable to deep-sea trawling.

“Blobfish are fairly frequently pulled up from the bottom-trawling of orange roughy,” Kurta said.

The Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust launched the Fish of the Year competition in 2020, inspired by the highly popular Bird of the Year. This year saw the highest number of votes cast in its competition – 5,583 in 2025, compared with 1,021 last year.

The blobfish won on 1,286 votes, pipping the orange roughy by 300 votes, despite the latter having powerful backers including Greenpeace, Forest & Bird and the Environmental Law Initiative.

“We are very pleased for the blobfish,” said Aaron Packard, a spokesperson for Environmental Law Initiative. “From an ecosystem perspective, a win for blobfish is a win for orange roughy.”

New Zealand is responsible for about 80% of the global orange roughy catch. Environmental watchdogs regularly call for a halt on fishing the species due to the destructive effects of bottom trawling on ecosystems and vulnerabilities in fish populations.

Other contenders in the competition included the mysterious longfin eel – known as tuna in Māori language – a pygmy pipehorse, a critically endangered mud-fish, sharks and rays.

“We have a dizzying variety of native marine and freshwater fish,” Kurta says, adding roughly 85% are considered vulnerable.

“That [these fish] exist is often the first step to getting people invested and interested in what's happening below the waterline.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Likely next chancellor needs two-thirds majority to back €500bn infrastructure fund and relaxation of debt rules

Germany's likely next chancellor is to face a key vote on plans to unlock a record level of state borrowing, which he argues is necessary to boost the country's military spending and inject growth into its ailing economy.

Ahead of the crucial Bundestag vote on Tuesday, Friedrich Merz has faced a barrage of complaints from the opposition and from within his own ranks that he is not coupling the historic levels of spending planned – as much as €1tn (£840bn) – to demands for reform.

Merz intends to release a €500bn infrastructure fund and relax debt rules – currently protected by the constitution – via the outgoing parliament, where parties in favour of the proposals – his conservatives, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens – have the necessary two-thirds majority.

Merz, whose conservative CDU/CSU alliance won last month's federal election, managed to get the Greens onboard last week in a nailbiting race ahead of the new parliament convening on 25 March, when any such legislation could be barred by the so-called blocking minority of the far-left Die Linke and far-right AfD.

The parliamentary budgetary committee gave the green light to the plans on Sunday. Merz, however, needs the support of almost all the MPs who have signalled their willingness to back the scheme as he also reckons with some dissenters, including a former CDU general secretary who Merz sacked in 2023.

At current reckoning he has about 30 votes above the two-thirds majority in the current 736-member chamber needed to relax constitutionally enshrined German debt rules.

Stragglers or undecideds from both the conservatives and the SPD are being approached by party faithful in the final hours before the vote. The Greens – having been reluctant backers of the measures until Merz gave them reassurances last week that €100bn of the special fund would be dedicated to climate and economic transformation measures – have said there is unity in their ranks in favour of the legislation.

The conservatives and SPD have been hammering out their plans to form a new government, amid huge pressure domestically and internationally on Germany to quickly form a coalition. The new constellation is being referred to as a “baby grand”, due to the parties not having anything like the strength of previous partnerships between the two, which were referred to as grand coalitions.

Financial markets have followed the developments closely, reacting positively to the news last week that Merz had secured the Greens' support. Experts have said the fiscal injection has the power to lift Germany's economic fortunes after two years of negative growth, but some have warned that they must be accompanied by robust reform proposals.

The economic thinktank Ifo on Monday voiced its concerns that the plans could fuel inflation and urged the new government to make urgent improvements to help productive capacity, such as reducing high energy costs, which it said had forced some companies to move abroad, and persuading employees to work longer.

Ursula Münch, a professor of political science at the Academy for Political Education, described the scale of the package on which the Bundestag would vote as “gargantuan” and “radical”.

Many Germans, she told the Foreign Press Association on Monday, were ambivalent about it. “They have two hearts beating in one breast. They recognise on the one hand the need to relax the strict debt rules, but on the other, are irritated by the sheer scale of the monies which will be unleashed as a result.

“I can understand those for whom this is currently causing a stomach ache.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Officials claim attacks will bring release of more hostages, but some suggest political factors at play for Netanyahu

Israel has resumed large-scale attacks in Gaza with a wave of airstrikes and artillery fire against targets throughout the devastated territory. More than 300 have been killed and hundreds more injured, according to Palestinian authorities.

The casualties include some high-ranking Hamas officials and many civilians, including women and children. Hospitals and civil defence teams say they have been overwhelmed.

Israel has also issued evacuation orders for parts of northern and central Gaza close to the perimeter, suggesting that some kind of attack involving troops on the ground is imminent. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Palestinians in the territory who have only recently returned to their homes, often in ruins, are on the move again.

The Israeli government has been threatening to launch an offensive for weeks.

Israeli officials say targeting the Hamas leadership, which has re-emerged in recent weeks to again take control of Gaza, will bring about the release of more hostages. Many hostage families in Israel dispute this.

More practically, Israel now has capabilities it lacked six weeks ago. Ammunition stocks have been replenished – partly due to US deliveries – and new potential targets among Hamas' leaders identified. Planes and other equipment have been repaired. Troops have been rested.

The new offensive comes 16 days after the first of three phases of a ceasefire agreed in January ended. The three phases were supposed to lead to a definitive end to the war, a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of all remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas since its 7 October 2023 surprise attack into Israel, which triggered the conflict. That attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The ensuing Israeli offensive has killed more than 48,700 people, again mostly civilians.

Indirect talks to prevent a return to violence have stalled.

Hamas says Israel has broken the deal by reneging on its earlier commitment to move to the scheduled second phase, which was meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire and the return of all hostages. Instead Israel has proposed extending the first phase by 30 to 60 days, to allow for the release of more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has rejected this.

The Israeli government argues that Hamas has broken the ceasefire by refusing new hostage releases.

Critics of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, suggest other reasons for the new offensive – or its timing, at least.

One is that Netanyahu never had any intention of moving to the second phase of the ceasefire, which would have meant Israeli forces withdrawing from Gaza, in effect leaving Hamas as its de facto ruler. The militant Islamist organisation has reasserted its control in recent weeks, humanitarian officials there say, with civilian officials returning to previous posts and the battered military wing finding thousands of new recruits.

A second reason cited is that Israel had the full backing of the Trump administration for renewed attacks against Hamas.

Then there are the domestic political factors, cited extensively by the Israeli prime minister's critics. Netanyahu needs support from rightwing allies to win crucial votes in Israel's parliament in coming days and weeks, and to maintain his grip on power. These allies have fiercely opposed a permanent end to hostilities in Gaza, with one resigning from his ministerial post in protest at the January ceasefire. This vital support is now assured – at least in the short term.

Netanyahu is also on trial for corruption. If found guilty, he could face prison. On Tuesday, a court approved Netanyahu's request not to appear at a hearing on Tuesday “due to the renewal of the war”, Israeli media reported.

On Sunday, Netanyahu announced he would seek to dismiss the head of the Israeli's internal security service. This has been seen as a further attempt to override democratic checks in Israel and big protests are expected later this week. These can now be portrayed as unpatriotic by Netanyahu's supporters. Successive recent polls have shown Israelis overwhelmingly in favour of a ceasefire in Gaza to bring back the 59 hostages still there, though support for a war until “total victory” over Hamas remains strong.

The grim reality is that the fragile two-month pause in hostilities between Israel and Hamas is now over. It appears very unlikely that a deal that would end the new Israeli attacks can be achieved soon.

Israeli officials have made clear that the strikes are merely the beginning of a potentially much broader offensive that will continue until Hamas releases the 59 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, of whom more than half are presumed dead. This would inevitably mean considerable civilian casualties there, further mass displacement and even more destruction.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza was only partly eased by a massive influx of aid during the ceasefire, which came into effect in mid-January. Two weeks ago, Israel imposed a total blockade on the territory, claiming Hamas was exploiting aid for its own benefit and had violated the agreement. This was denied by Hamas. Aid agencies and shops in Gaza currently have stocks of essentials to last around three weeks, humanitarian officials say, but the new violence will make distribution much harder.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Crisis within British television is leading to an exodus of production talent, media executive says

The UK's television industry is being hit by a “perfect storm” that risks leading to British stories disappearing from the small screen, Elisabeth Murdoch has said.

Murdoch, co-founder of the production company Sister, said that a crisis within British television was leading to an exodus of production talent – as well as a danger that British stories were struggling to be told. It follows warnings that cash-strapped British broadcasters are targeting their resources at dramas with international appeal.

She said: “British producers are making excellent content for global platforms, with British talent, set in the UK – but those aren't the same stories that the BBC or Channel 4 seek out. Those stories, from all corners of the British Isles, are struggling to be made in today's economic reality. The BBC has projects that they have greenlit and provided foundational financing but the gap to budget remains unattainable.”

Murdoch said that in less than a decade, the UK's television industry had changed from “a relatively local market” to a global one. While it had created investment, she said it had brought “real threats to creativity, entrepreneurialism and British culture”.

Her comments come amid a lengthy work drought in the UK television industry, in which producers with decades of experience have either fallen out of the sector entirely or turned to entry-level jobs as they await a TV revival. The crisis is partly driven by a concentration on high-end dramas that can be sold overseas. Patrick Spence, executive producer of the huge ITV hit Mr Bates vs the Post Office told the Sunday Times: “If you ask me if we'd make Mr Bates vs The Post Office today, the answer is ‘absolutely not'.”

Murdoch, whose production company is responsible for programmes including Black Doves, This Is Going to Hurt and Chernobyl, said TV was “one of the great drivers of storytelling in our nation. We live in a complex and changing society, which needs to see itself reflected in culture. Content on [public service broadcaster] channels is 80% British; on streamers it is estimated to be 10%.”

She said that the current crisis was partly cyclical. Too much programming was commissioned after the start of the Covid pandemic. She added, however, that a “perfect storm” of factors had hit the industry. Audiences are now watching more on streaming services and digital platforms like YouTube, while the costs of making TV have spiralled. Advertising revenue for public service broadcasters (PSBs) has slumped, while the BBC's licence fee income has effectively fallen by about 30% since 2010.

Some have suggested that tax breaks could be used to help the industry. Peter Kosminsky, the Bafta-winning television director behind Wolf Hall, has suggested a levy on the streamers to help fund local content. Murdoch believes all options should be carefully considered.

She said: “When you see the stats about the numbers of people out of work or leaving the industry, or the challenges faced by the PSBs and producers to fund budgets for scripted or high-end entertainment, it highlights the scale of the challenge and explains the loss of business confidence. Low confidence means less appetite for risk and we have built the industry on taking creative risks. It has given us Happy Valley, Shameless, Fleabag, Skins, Life on Mars, to name just a few.

“The question is how much will be addressed by allowing market forces to work and where intervention could and should positively intervene to support all that is great and valuable in the UK TV industry.”

The Guardian revealed recently that some established TV figures were now working as high street shelf-stackers, car park attendants and in pubs, with others forced to sell their homes. Meanwhile, some of those remaining in work say they are having to do work that would previously have been carried out by several people.

A BBC spokesperson said: “While the competition of a global market is healthy, the BBC bangs the drum for British creativity and culturally relevant content in a way that the global streamers simply can't.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Russian oil refinery on fire after Ukrainian drone strike; Russia claims advances in southern Ukraine. What we know on day 1,119 

Dozens of military chiefs from allies of Ukraine are due to meet in the UK on Thursday – without the US – to plan how a “coalition of the willing” could send in troops to support the Ukrainians if a ceasefire is declared. More than 30 countries were expected to be involved in such a coalition, the office of Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said on Monday. “The contribution capabilities will vary, but this will be a significant force, with a significant number of countries providing troops,” said a spokesperson. It comes after Starmer held a teleconference with dozens of leaders from European countries and others including Canada and Australia. Starmer and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have been leading efforts to establish the coalition since Donald Trump opened direct negotiations with Russia without Ukraine or Europe at the table.

Russia has rejected the idea of soldiers from countries belonging to Nato being stationed in Ukraine, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, declared on Sunday that such a force would not be seeking Russia's permission. Asked about Russia's position, Keir Starmer's spokesperson said: “It is worth remembering that Russia didn't ask Ukraine when it deployed North Korean troops to the frontline last year.” With some partners potentially wary of committing troops, Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance. His spokesperson on Monday highlighted engineering, the use of airfields and the housing of crews.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign affairs chief, will meanwhile visit London on Tuesday to meet the British foreign and defence secretaries. The UK government hailed the talks as “part of a new era of UK-EU relations”, and said they would discuss cooperation on Ukraine; how to increase economic pressure on Moscow and ensure it pays for the damage it has caused; and ramping up action against cyber-attacks, election interference and Russian disinformation.

Ukrainian drones set on fire an oil refinery in Russia's southern Astrakhan region, local authorities said. The regional governor, Igor Babushkin, said on Monday that staff of a “fuel and energy” complex were evacuated before the attack, which started a large fire and wounded one person. Russia launched a barrage of 174 drones on Ukraine, with air defence units shooting down 90 of them and dozens more disabled by electronic jamming, said Ukraine's air force. About 500 people in the southern region of Odesa lost power and one person was wounded, said the local governor, Oleg Kiper. Back on Russian territory, the Belgorod oblast came under attack from Ukrainian drones on Monday night, local officials said

Russia claimed its forces were advancing in southern Ukraine and had breached part of the Ukrainian lines less than 50km (30 miles) south-east of the city of Zaporizhzhia. Russia's defence ministry said its forces had taken the village of Stepove in the Zaporizhzhia region. The claims could not be verified and Ukraine's military said it forces had repelled attacks near Stepove and the nearby village of Lobkove, and battles were still going on.

The US president, Donald Trump, has announced he will be speaking to Vladimir Putin on Tuesday after Ukraine and the US agreed to put forward a ceasefire proposal, which the Russian president has pushed back against, write Pjotr Sauer and Peter Walker. Trump said they would talk about “dividing up certain assets … We will be talking about land. We will be talking about power plants.” He did not elaborate, but the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to a “power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine”. If she and Trump meant the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, it is not located on the Russia-Ukraine border, but sits in sovereign, internationally recognised Ukrainian territory invaded by Russia.

Ukraine would not agree to territorial concessions, exclusion from Nato, or limits on its defence capabilities, the Ukrainian parliament's foreign policy committee head, Oleksandr Merezhko, has told the BBC in an interview setting out Kyiv's “red lines” for peace negotiations.

Germany's probable next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, faces a key vote in the Bundestag on Tuesday over plans to unlock record state borrowing he argues is needed partly to boost military spending. Germany has been Europe's biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine.

The Trump administration is withdrawing from an international body formed to investigate responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine and hold Vladimir Putin and others accountable, in the latest sign that the White House is adopting a posture favouring Russia's ruler, Robert Tait writes from Washington.

Ukraine posted a trade deficit of US$2.3bn in January, compared with a deficit of US$1.5bn in the same period a year ago, the statistics service said on Monday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Foreign secretary receives rare public rebuke as No 10 rows back by saying Israel ‘at risk' of breaching rules

Downing Street has rejected David Lammy's assessment that Israel has broken international law by blocking aid to Gaza, in a rare public censure for the foreign secretary.

A spokesperson for the prime minister said on Tuesday morning Israel was “at risk” of breaching humanitarian law, despite Lammy having told the Commons on Monday that the country had definitely done so.

The remarks, hours after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Gaza, mark a climbdown after Lammy appeared to have changed the government's position on one of the most sensitive foreign policy questions it faces.

Keir Starmer's spokesperson said: “Our position remains that Israel's actions in Gaza are at clear risk of breaching international humanitarian law, and we continue to call the government of Israel to abide by its international obligations.”

They added: “The government is not an international court, and, therefore, it is up to courts to make judgments.”

Asked whether the foreign secretary had mistakenly gone further than official government policy, the spokesperson said: “I'd refer to the Foreign Office on that, but there's no change in policy here.”

Asked whether Lammy should apologise, they added: “I'll leave that to the Foreign Office.”

The public rebuke came less than 24 hours after Lammy told the Commons he believed Israel's actions broke international law – a key test for whether the UK can continue to sell weapons to the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

The foreign secretary later said he “could have been clearer” in the chamber, when asked in an interview with Bloomberg if he regretted making the statement.

Netanyahu has stopped food, fuel and medicine from entering Gaza in an effort to put pressure on Hamas during peace talks. Doctors in Gaza say hospitals are struggling to treat people injured in Monday night's air attack as a result.

Gaza's health ministry says more than 400 people have died after overnight missile attacks, which ended the two-month-old ceasefire and targeted several parts of Gaza.

Asked about the aid blockade, Lammy said on Monday: “This is a breach of international law. Israel quite rightly must defend its own security. But we find the lack of aid – it's now been 15 days since aid got into Gaza – unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying.

“We would urge Israel to get back to the amount of trucks we were seeing – way beyond 600 – so Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support that they need at this time.”

Netanyahu is already facing the threat of arrest should he travel to the UK, with Lammy having previously said the British government would act on an arrest warrant issued last November by the international criminal court.

Despite that arrest warrant, the government continues to sell some weapons to Israel, including engine parts for F-35 jets.

Hunter Wildlife Rescue started receiving numerous reports of sick and dead birds on Monday, centred on the suburbs Hamilton and Carrington

New South Wales authorities are calling for the public's help as it investigates the suspected poisoning and mass deaths of more than 200 little corellas across multiple Newcastle suburbs.

The NSW Environment Protection Authority said it was interrogating pesticide misuse as the possible cause of the “serious incident”, based on its observations and advice from local veterinarians.

Jason Gordon, the EPA's executive director of regulatory operations, said it was a distressing situation with affected birds exhibiting symptoms such as bleeding, staggering, paralysis and an inability to fly.

“The misuse of pesticides, whether deliberate or unintentional, is completely unacceptable and carries heavy penalties,” he said. Penalties reach up to $500,000 for an individual and $2m for a corporation.

Kate Randolph, the acting president of Hunter Wildlife Rescue, described the incident as “extremely confronting” and said volunteers and local vets were doing everything they could to rescue surviving, severely sick birds.

“Everyone's working together. It's a heartbreaking situation.”

Randolph said affected birds involved large numbers of corellas, as well as a few sulphur-crested cockatoos.

Volunteer Kerry Walker said Hunter Wildlife Rescue started receiving numerous reports of sick and dead birds on Monday morning, centred on the suburbs of Hamilton and Carrington, which were continuing on Tuesday.

According to the EPA, bird deaths had now been reported across multiple Newcastle suburbs, including Hamilton, Carrington, Waratah, Broadmeadow, Lambton and near the University of Newcastle.

Usually a playful, social bird, corellas often flocked together in their hundreds in Carrington, the suburb where the highest density of reports were coming from, Walker said.

“They're usually feeding on the open grass. They're a very playful bird. They love to play around all the boats at the marina, and they'll perch on the masts and play with all the gear. They're very loud and raucous.”

Some birds were still alive, she said, but clearly unwell. “When you approach them they can't fly, they can barely move.

“They try to spread their wings, and they just literally topple forward.”

More severe cases were drooling or had bloody diarrhoea. It was distressing for volunteers, she said.

Dr Tania Bishop, a vet with wildlife rescue group Wires, said poisoning was a likely explanation, although whenever a group of animals died, authorities would also be checking for potential diseases and biosecurity risks such as avian influenza.

Such poisonings, whether malicious or caused by contamination, were usually sporadic. But Bishop said there had been a particularly high number of mass wildlife poisonings in the greater Sydney area during the past year.

Bishop said the results of toxicology studies identifying potential poisons or toxins could take weeks.

She said the incident was a reminder that feeding birds came with risks, encouraging the birds to trust humans, which made them more vulnerable to deliberate poisoning.

The EPA had already collected samples for testing and was seeking further assistance from the public.

“Anyone who thinks they may have information on how the birds have died or on potential pesticides misuse is strongly encouraged to call the EPA on 131 555,” Gordon said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Defence minister says ‘all threats' to south of Israel must also be removed, as airstrikes kill hundreds of Palestinians

Israel will continue its new offensive in Gaza until Hamas releases all hostages and “all threats to residents of the south [of Israel] are removed”, the country's defence minister said on Tuesday, raising the prospect of many weeks or even months of war in the devastated Palestinian territory.

“Hamas must understand that the rules of the game have changed,” Israel Katz told reporters during a visit to an airbase, adding that “the gates of hell will open and it will face the full might of the IDF in the air, at sea and on land” if remaining hostages were not freed.

The threat came after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes that killed more than 400 people, shattering the pause in hostilities since mid-January in Gaza in the bloodiest single day of violence since the first months of the war in 2023.

The Israeli army has also issued evacuation orders, which cover the northern town of Beit Hanoun and other communities in the east of Gaza, suggesting renewed ground attacks could be launched within hours.

Palestinian health authorities reported 404 deaths in the strikes, which Israeli military officials said targeted Hamas military commanders and political officials. More than 600 were reported injured. Air attacks and artillery fire were reported to be continuing across much of Gaza during the afternoon and into the evening.

Aid officials in Gaza said hundreds, possibly thousands, were already on the move to comply with the Israeli evacuation orders. “There is no resilience. People … are in a very weak state, physically and psychologically,” one aid official in Gaza told the Guardian.

In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the US administration before carrying out the strikes.

Attacks were reported in northern Gaza and in the central cities of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. One strike was reported to have killed 17 members of a family in Rafah. The dead included five children, their parents, and a man and his three children, medics at the hospital that received the bodies said.

Another, in Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, resulted in the deaths of 13 people.

There were also reports of other strikes on schools used as shelters for displaced people, individual apartments in tower blocks in Gaza City, and in tented encampments in the coastal zone of al-Mawasi.

Witnesses said patients lay on the floor of the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, some screaming, and a young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. At al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, survivors held rushed funeral rites for dozens of body bags lining the yard. Mothers sobbed over the bloodied bodies of children, as warplanes hummed in the sky. Doctors struggled to treat the flow of wounded.

Casualties included senior Hamas officials, including the most senior political leader in Gaza and ministers, as well as many women and children, Palestinian officials said.

Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said Israel had launched strikes after discovering Hamas was planning new raids to capture or kill Israeli civilians or soldiers and because Hamas had refused to release more of the 59 hostages held in Gaza, thus breaking the ceasefire agreement that came into effect in January.

“Hamas could have chosen a different path. It could have chosen to release all the hostages but instead chose refusal, terror, and war,” Shoshani said in a statement.

The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Hamas had rejected proposals from Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for an extension of the pause in hostilities. “Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” it said in a statement.

Hamas said hostage releases were due only during a scheduled second phase that Israel agreed in January but has since refused to discuss or implement.

The first phase of the ceasefire agreed in January involved 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead Israelis returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

Under the scheduled second phase of the ceasefire, there would have been a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the release of all hostages and a definitive end to hostilities. With the backing of the US, Israel has been pushing instead for the return of all remaining hostages in exchange for further prisoner releases and a 30- to 60-day truce, in line with Witkoff's proposal.

Earlier this month, Israel blocked deliveries of aid from entering Gaza and cut off remaining electricity supplies in an effort to pressure Hamas.

Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said the international community faced “a moral test”.

“Either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza,” Nunu said.

The strikes come at a tense moment in Israeli domestic politics. Netanyahu said on Sunday he would fire Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, a controversial move that immediately prompted accusations of authoritarianism and plans for protests on Wednesday.

In his statement about the latest strikes, Netanyahu said he had approved the attacks “over the weekend”, suggesting the decision preceded the announcement of his intention to fire Bar.

Critics accuse Netanyahu of using war to maintain his own grip on power.

Much of Gaza lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on 7 October 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages.

The Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people and reduced much of the territory to ruins. Ninety per cent of houses are damaged or destroyed, and much of the population is displaced. Roads, hospitals, schools, sanitation systems and much else have been reduced to rubble.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Superior numbers and attacks on supply lines slowly choked off the Ukrainian forces holding the town of Sudzha and forced their retreat.

KYIV — A fresh supply of North Korean troops, command of the air and a crushing superiority in numbers helped Russia last week retake the town of Sudzha, Ukraine's last stronghold in western Russia, according to interviews with Ukrainian soldiers and officials familiar with the battles of the last few weeks.

Russia's heavy use of North Korean troops and equipment to retake nearly all of the Kursk region after seven months of Ukrainian control demonstrated the Kremlin's desire to reclaim the land at any cost and prevent Kyiv from forcing a territorial exchange as part of future negotiations. Russia occupies around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.

By Monday, Ukrainian troops had almost entirely withdrawn from Kursk, said a soldier familiar with drone operations in the region — who like the others interviewed for this story wasn't authorized to speak publicly — describing the parts of Kursk still under Ukrainian control as “a tiny patch, practically nothing. Just some border zones.”

On a map from Deep State, a Ukrainian volunteer project that tracks changes on the front line, Ukrainian troops are now shown occupying about 10 percent of the more than 500 square miles that they once held.

“Without North Korean troops, Russia cannot even hold onto its own territories with its own army,” said Ruslan Mykula, the co-founder of Deep State. “These were massive waves of reinforcements, much larger than our group. And the harsh reality is, we simply didn't have enough ammunition and drones to eliminate them all.”

Though a combination of factors ultimately hastened Ukraine's retreat‚ including the loss of supply routes and control of the airspace, the reappearance of North Korean troops — who had withdrawn from the battlefield in January to regroup amid heavy losses — had a “painful effect,” said a lawmaker connected to the Ukrainian military and Korean affairs.

“We are talking about well-trained and well-motivated soldiers in one particular place,” said the lawmaker, who isn't authorized to speak publicly about the matter. “I cannot say that the Kursk current situation happened because of North Koreans, but the effect of their participation is quite substantial.”

Moscow and Pyongyang have both denied the deployment of troops from North Korea to the battlefield, despite evidence indicating otherwise, including Ukraine's capture of two soldiers who are now in detention in Kyiv. Last week, a spokesman for the Ukrainian army, Dmytro Likhovy, said that North Korean troops were “one of the main attacking forces of Russian troops in Kursk” and were operating with greater effectiveness than they had over the winter, when they incurred heavy losses.

The return of foreign troops to the front lines in Russia comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to argue against the deployment of foreign peacekeepers to Ukraine, describing it as a threat to Russia.

While the arrival of North Korean troops last fall prompted the United States to allow Ukraine the use of guided missile systems known as ATACMS, their reappearance has not prompted any new action among Ukraine's allies.

Military analysts said that Ukraine losing its foothold in Kursk resulted in a retreat that at times bordered on chaotic — but which was better organized than previous withdrawals, such as from Avdiivka last year.

“Kursk was always going to be difficult to hold,” said Michael Kofman, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It was simply a matter of time before Russia could take back the salient.”

The beginning of the end came when Ukraine lost the sky.

As December tipped into January, Russian drones peppered the skies above Kursk — piercing the calm that Vitalii Ovcharenko had previously experienced that fall on the front line. Ovcharenko, who had arrived with his unit in August, said that on New Year's Eve drones swarmed six Ukrainian military vehicles as they entered Sudzha, quickly destroying them.

The Russians “moved not just troops but their best UAV operators to this part of the front line,” he said. “We did not have enough artillery shells or missiles to hit their rear.”

Entering and leaving the region became more challenging — even at night — as massive numbers of Russian troops began flanking the rear of Ukraine's operation, further narrowing their territory and attempting to sever Ukrainian supply routes into Sudzha, cutting off the delivery of ammunition and reinforcements and the evacuation of the dead and wounded.

“Russia controlled Ukrainian logistic lines going into Kursk,” said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan defense consultancy. “So for the past couple of months, Russians were able to … [make] it incredibly difficult for Ukrainians to sustain their presence in the region.”

The soldier — familiar with drone operations in the Kursk region — described how Russian troops had “superiority in manpower and weaponry,” relying on powerful glide bombs and unjammable fiber-optic drones to disrupt logistics. But they never managed to completely encircle Ukrainian troops, as President Donald Trump falsely claimed in a post on TruthSocial last week, echoing claims made by Putin, according to battlefield maps and military analysts.

“We held on for as long as we could,” the soldier said, describing escape routes that fell under heavy fire. “Once the left flank started collapsing, all efforts should have been focused on holding it. … It's just heartbreaking to see so much effort wasted, so many lives lost, and now we're losing ground again.”

Once logistics were cut off, “it became clear that an army without supplies would suffocate. And that's exactly what happened,” Mykula of Deep State said. “Ukraine didn't lose the battle on the battlefield. Our forces weren't driven out. They were simply put in a position where remaining in that salient, with that number of troops and those conditions, became impossible.”

Then, early last month, the North Koreans returned.

While they'd initially operated as simple rifle units, these new brigades included the 91st and 92nd Special Forces and now had their own command structures and attack plans sharpened by previous missions.

Operating in small groups on either flank, they joined elite Russian forces and outnumbered the Ukrainians by a ratio of about 2 to 1 — helping seize the key stronghold of Sverdlikovo near Ukraine's main logistics routes.

“We've found their maps: hand-drawn, extremely detailed,” said Artem, a soldier in Sumy who is familiar with the Kursk operation. “Every movement was written down by hand, perfectly marked. Nobody does that anymore. It felt like something from a bygone era — like a Soviet-style, ultra-structured military approach. Each line was meticulously drawn, as if by someone who had spent their entire life training for this.”

The North Korean soldiers were well equipped with gear that made it difficult to spot them with night-vision goggles, said Oleksandr, 40, an officer who has overseen intelligence operations in the Kursk region since August.

They “made a difference,” he said. “Russians have strong and good allies. They came just in time. … Our infantry is not as fast as it was at the beginning of the war. … Both of our armies are tired.”

Now on the retreat, Oleksandr says he feels only relief.

While some have questioned whether the Kursk operation was worth it, at a meeting with journalists last week President Volodymyr Zelensky said that it had “fulfilled its task” by diverting Russian troops from other fronts, including Pokrovsk and Kharkiv. Still, he admitted that conditions in the region were “very difficult.”

The nearly complete Russian operation in Kursk comes at a very symbolic moment — just ahead of the 80th anniversary of Russia's Victory Day, marking the Soviet Union's triumph over Nazi Germany, celebrated on May 9.

A Ukrainian official expected a “major concentration of Russia's efforts” to finish the operation before the big day, which will see world leaders such as China's Xi Jinping and India's Narendra Modi attending the celebrations in Moscow. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov went as far as to invite North Korean troops to participate in the May 9 parade.

As Russian troops approach the Ukrainian border of its Sumy region, what happens next “will depend on how Russian leadership sets its priorities,” said Mykula of Deep State.

“They will have to choose: Either they focus on establishing a buffer zone, securing some kind of political victory, or they reinforce their existing offensive axes to increase the territory they control and use that as leverage in negotiations,” he said.

Though he didn't know what would happen next, Oleksandr said, Sumy had been well fortified with trenches and infantry. Plus, he added: “All the experienced guys in Kursk will be waiting for them on Ukrainian soil.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Syria's army attacked Lebanon after it said three soldiers were kidnapped, brought to Lebanon and killed by Hezbollah militants. Hezbollah denied involvement.

BEIRUT — Syria and Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire late Monday after Syrian forces loyal to the new government in Damascus clashed with the Lebanese military on the countries' shared border, as simmering tensions over key smuggling routes — long used by Hezbollah militants — erupted overnight, igniting a potential new flash point in a region roiled by war.

The agreement to halt the fighting was made in a phone call between Lebanese Defense Minister Michel Menassa and his Syrian counterpart, Murhaf Abu Qasra, Lebanon's Defense Ministry said in a statement. The two sides would continue to communicate through their military intelligence agencies to “prevent the deterioration of the situation” and “avoid innocent civilian casualties,” the statement said.

The violence first broke out on Sunday, in the area where northern Lebanon meets western Syria, after what Syrian authorities said was a deadly ambush by Hezbollah gunmen against three Syrian soldiers. Syria's new army, led by former rebels, launched rockets and artillery into Lebanon in response, sending residents fleeing and drawing fire from the Lebanese military and other armed groups.

Lebanese officials said Monday that the three people who were killed were smugglers, but it was not clear who killed them. Their bodies were returned to Syria through the Red Cross, Lebanese Information Minister Paul Morcos said.

“What is happening on the eastern and northeastern borders is unacceptable and cannot continue,” Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said Monday in a statement, before the ceasefire. “I have given instructions to the Lebanese army to respond to the sources of fire.”

Tensions across the countries' porous border have been brewing since Syria's new Islamist leaders ousted Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of both Hezbollah and its patron, Iran, in December. The frontier has long served as a critical smuggling and supply route for Hezbollah, a once powerful force whose influence has diminished since fighting a bruising war with Israel in the fall.

Syria's new government has promised to crack down on Iran using its soil as part of a network for smuggling arms and cash to its proxy forces. It is also working to show it can control areas of the country traditionally supportive of the previous regime, following a wave of deadly sectarian violence along Syria's coast earlier this month.

Syrian state media said that the three soldiers were ambushed near the Zeita Dam, west of Homs, and were killed on the spot after being taken to Lebanese territory. Hezbollah denied the accusations, saying in a statement it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.”

Lebanese media reported that three armed men entered Lebanon first, resulting in clashes with local tribespeople who believed they were under attack. Many of the tribes in northeastern Lebanon are loyal to Hezbollah and have sporadically clashed with Syrian forces trying to disrupt Hezbollah's supply lines.

The shelling from Syria on Monday centered on two border villages in Lebanon: al-Qasr, less than a mile from the Syrian border, and Hawsh al-Sayyid Ali, which straddles the frontier.

“They are bombing randomly against civilians in al-Qasr and other border villages,” resident Mohamad Jaffar, 55, said of Syrian forces, adding that the shelling had already caused significant damage. The Lebanese military, he said, was firing back from Ras Baalbek, about 18 miles south of al-Qasr.

“Military units responded to the sources of fire with appropriate weapons and are working to reinforce their defensive positions to stop attacks on Lebanese territory,” the Lebanese army said in a statement. It said that contacts between the Lebanese army command and Syrian authorities were being facilitated to restore calm. In Beirut, the cabinet said it would also raise its level of coordination with the Syrian government and form a committee to propose measures to tighten security on the border.

Haidamous reported from Corona, California. Mohamad El Chamaa in Beirut contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The humble iguana may have have pulled off an epic migration millions of years ago, traveling from the coast of today's Mexico to Fiji on rafts made of vegetation.

Millions of years ago, seafaring iguanas may have pulled off one of the greatest long-distance migrations the world has ever seen.

That's according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), which suggests iguanas traveled from North America to Fiji on rafts of vegetation during the late Paleogene period (about 34 million years ago). The epic voyage measures more than 8,000 km (5,000 miles) or one-fifth of the world's circumference and is the longest in the “history of terrestrial vertebrates,” researchers of the peer-reviewed study said.

“We found that the Fiji iguanas are most closely related to the North American desert iguanas, something that hadn't been figured out before,” lead author Simon Scarpetta, an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco, said in a news release, adding that they split from their “sister” lineage around 30 million years ago.

“You could imagine some kind of cyclone knocking over trees where there were a bunch of iguanas and maybe their eggs, and then they caught the ocean currents and rafted over,” he said.

The findings could shed new light on how species are dispersed across oceans in a process that has long captivated scientists and is regarded as critical in the establishment of new species of plants and animals. Other animals such as primates, rodents, geckos, skinks and frogs have all been able to cross oceans, with lizards particularly adept “overwater dispersers,” researchers said. However, nailing down the specifics of how such events occurred and the plausibility of animals traveling between continents on rafts has been “vigorously debated,” researchers said, with other theories, such as land bridges, thought to be more likely.

The study was carried out by biologists at the University of San Francisco, the University of California at Berkeley and Villanova University in Pennsylvania, as well as experts from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Fijian nongovernmental organization NatureFiji-MareqetiViti. The team used a phylogenomics dataset, which helps construct an evolutionary history of a species, to compare lineages of 14 types of iguana, as well as fossil data and geologic records, to determine the time frame of the iguanas' arrival.

The notion of iguanas traveling on rafts has precedent. They are believed to have traveled about 600 miles from Central America to establish a home in the Galápagos Islands, and have traveled around the Caribbean. In 1995, at least 15 green iguanas on a vegetation mat thought to have come from Guadeloupe were seen making landfall on Anguilla, about 170 miles away — resulting in the successful hybridization of a local species of iguana, researchers said.

However, while there are more than 2,100 species in the Iguania group that also includes chameleons, anoles, bearded dragons and horned lizards, these are mostly concentrated in North, Central and South America. The Fiji iguanas are regarded as an “enigmatic” outlier, and their origin had not been tested, the research team said. It has been previously thought the two types of iguana found on Fiji — Brachylophus and Lapitiguana iguanas, the latter of which is now extinct — had come either in a “single rafting event” across the Pacific or via “stepping stone dispersal” across paleocontinent Gondwanaland, yet strong support for either theory was lacking.

“Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America,” the researchers said. While the team could not entirely rule out that the Brachylophus iguana arrived in Fiji via island-hopping, it said a route from coastal Mexico to the South Pacific “is plausible” based on floating debris and ocean currents at the time.

“That they reached Fiji directly from North America seems crazy,” said co-author Jimmy McGuire, a UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology. “But alternative models involving colonization from adjacent land areas don't really work for the time frame, since we know that they arrived in Fiji within the last 34 million years or so. This suggests that as soon as land appeared where Fiji now resides, these iguanas may have colonized it. Regardless of the actual timing of dispersal, the event itself was spectacular.”

Iguanas are the ideal candidate for such a voyage as they are herbivores and can go months without food, according to the authors. They may also have been able to snack on the “floating vegetation mats” along the way. The Fijian iguanas were closely related to those found in the North American desert, which are used to searing heat, researchers said.

“Iguanas and desert iguanas in particular are resistant to starvation and dehydration, so my thought process is, if there had to be any group of vertebrate or any group of lizard that really could make an 8,000-kilometer journey across the Pacific on a mass of vegetation, a desert iguana-like ancestor would be the one,” Scarpetta said in the news release.

Denisse Dalgo, a PhD candidate researching the evolutionary biology of marine iguanas at the University of Leipzig, was not involved in the research but said the findings are “truly remarkable” given the distance and prove just how tough iguanas can be. “Their strong swimming ability allows them to stay afloat despite strong currents, while their high stress tolerance helps them survive extreme conditions. They can withstand prolonged periods of starvation by lowering their metabolism, and some — such as the Galápagos marine iguanas — can even shrink their bodies temporarily to conserve energy,” she said.

Dalgo said further research into how iguanas change their diet and behavior to adapt to a new environment could help provide even deeper insight into island biogeography and evolution.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Awashingtonpost.com","Videos offer a glimpse into Bukele's prisons and the fate of U.S. deportees","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/18/bukele-prison-system-human-rights-trump/","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:46:59 GMT","

Human rights organizations say the message presented by videos posted by Bukele is clear: This is what awaits those deported from the United States to El Salvador.

The video, posted on social media by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Sunday, is tightly edited and set to dramatic music. It begins with drone footage of three planes on the tarmac, surrounded by rows of soldiers and police in riot gear.

One by one, the men emerge, their heads pushed down, their wrists and ankles shackled. Officers grip their arms and force them into buses which transport them to Bukele's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. An ominous electronic beat plays in the background. Two guards grip each detainee, rushing them into prison cells, dressed in white uniforms.

The message, human rights organizations say, is clear: This is what awaits those deported from the United States to El Salvador.

The video has been viewed more than 21 million times on Bukele's X account in less than 48 hours, drawing attention to the harsh treatment of prisoners in El Salvador.

Bukele describes the migrants as “the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua,” and “23 MS-13 members wanted by Salvadoran justice, including two ringleaders.” He said the members of Tren de Aragua would be sent to CECOT for a year, but that the contract with the United States is renewable.

President Donald Trump's administration paid Bukele's government approximately $6 million for detaining the alleged gang members, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.

Human rights experts say Bukele shared the video to reinforce his strongman image and promote his prison system as a model for combating crime globally. But the footage itself, they argue, shows clear signs of human rights violations.

“We don't know how many of these men have been charged or convicted with crimes, if they have access to a lawyer, or if they have been or will be presented in front of a judge,” said Ana Maria Mendez Dardon, the director for Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America.

It was troubling, she added, that the video prominently displayed the migrants' faces without confirmation of their criminal record.

The Trump administration faces accusations of defying a federal judge's order to stop deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows migrants to be expelled without a hearing.

For Noah Bullock, the executive director of the Central American human rights organization Cristosal, the video was “reminiscent of penal colonies from the long ago time of empires where people were sent away as a way to suspend their rights and permanently remove them from society.”

Little is known about the inmates held at CECOT, an isolated mega prison in the town of Tecoluca. At least 60,000 alleged gang members were arrested in El Salvador during CECOT's rapid construction, the AP reported. Since prisoners are typically held incommunicado, it's hard to confirm how many have a connection to gangs, human rights experts said.

We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.The fee would be relatively low for… pic.twitter.com/HTNwtp35Aq

El Salvador, though, also opened its prisons to social media influencers and travel content creators. One YouTube video has over 71 million views; another has 55 million views.

Influencers are how “the regime propagates its propaganda,” Bullock said, adding that “They activate and pay a swarm of social media mercenaries to reproduce the image of themselves that they want to sell.”

Apart from the now familiar images of half-naked prisoners forced to sit in tightly packed rows, Bukele also has a second brand of prison videos. These videos portray his prison system as self-sustaining as the prisoners are shown to be growing their own food, building furniture and fixing vehicles.

Other experts said that Bukele's sophistication and savviness with social media is not just limited to security issues, but they are most often used to show his no tolerance policy on crime.

Many of the images featured in the videos are recurring, said Sonja Wolf, a professor of political science at Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE) in Mexico.

“The shaving of the head, removal of clothes, the gathering of a large amount of security guards around one prisoner are all images we have seen before,” said Wolf. “These are denigrating practices and dehumanizing practices that he uses to show the power of the state.”

Bukele also uses social media to defend his use of mass incarcerations. “Put them all in jail so they can't kill anymore,” he said in an X post in February 2024 while explaining how he made El Salvador the “safest country in the Western Hemisphere.”

Bukele, who won a second five-year term in 2024 by a landslide, has one of the highest approval ratings of any world leader, due in large part to his crackdown on gangs and cartels.

Bukele declared a state of emergency in 2022, followed by mass arrests of suspected gang members and the rapid construction of CECOT. In his time as president, Bukele has lowered the country's homicide rates, once the highest in the world, and has encouraged other Latin American countries to follow his lead.

But human rights experts, such as Bullock, are quick to point out that Bukele's prison system, especially CECOT, is “one of the most opaque prison systems in the hemisphere,” adding that “they only show images they want to share.”

According to the World Prison Brief, a United Kingdom-based database on prisons around the world, there are 25 prison facilities in El Salvador, with an official capacity of 67,289 inmates.

El Salvador's prison population has surged in the past 25 years, and even the rapid construction of CECOT hasn't been able to keep up with the level of imprisonment in the country. Inmates have increased from 7,754 in 2000 to 37,190 in 2020, to roughly 109,519 in 2024, according to the Brief. The prison occupancy rate is almost at 163 percent.

“There are prisons in the country where overcrowding is such that people have to take turns standing and sitting,” said Bullock. “Human rights organizations have documented systemic torture and lack of access to families and lawyers in these places.”

The move comes as Europe scrambles to strengthen its security amid concerns over U.S. commitments under President Donald Trump.

BERLIN — German lawmakers passed a mammoth spending plan Tuesday that could allow for up to a trillion dollars in debt-fueled investments in defense and infrastructure over the next decade, according to some estimates.

The package amends the country's constitution to relax strict limits on debt that have long set the parameters of German spending, as Europe scrambles to strengthen its security amid concerns over U.S. commitments under President Donald Trump.

A clash between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last month, followed by a temporary U.S. suspension of Ukraine aid, accelerated in Germany a rethink of the country's tightly drawn purse strings, just days after an early federal election.

The plan's passage shows that Germany is taking seriously the threat of an aggressive Russia and a retreating United States, said Claudia Major, a senior vice president of the German Marshall Fund, a U.S.-based think tank.

“If you consider the amount of money Germany is putting there — Germany, a country that is so addicted to a balanced budget — that shows how seriously the incoming coalition is taking the current challenges,” Major said. “It's about recognizing the existential threat Germany is facing. This is about survival.”

Under the new spending plan, defense spending above 1 percent of gross domestic product would be exempted from Germany's constitutionally enshrined debt brake. The financial tool, considered a fiscal straitjacket by critics, limits the structural budget deficit to 0.35 percent of GDP, except in emergencies, a policy praised by proponents as a pillar of Germany's signature fiscal responsibility.

A $533 billion infrastructure fund was also approved. Financed by borrowing, it is to be invested in Germany's crumbling infrastructure over the coming 12 years, in the hope of boosting the country's stagnant economy.

“The special fund for infrastructure and the defense package are linked because total defense obviously requires functioning infrastructure,” Major said. “If your tank, your rocket launcher or your soldier is not able to move to the eastern flank in Poland because a bridge or train is breaking down, then you have an issue, to put it mildly.”

A heated parliamentary debate preceded Tuesday's vote, with the loudest criticism coming from the far left and far right.

Members of the leftist populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) were reprimanded by Bundestag Vice President Petra Pau for holding up banners bearing the words: “1914 as in 2025: No to war loans.”

Addressing parliament, presumed next chancellor Friedrich Merz said such huge sums of debt can only be justified under “very extraordinary circumstances.”

“The circumstances are determined above all by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Europe. It is a war against Europe, not only a war against Ukraine's territorial integrity.”

“Our friends in the E.U. are looking to us just as much as our adversaries and the enemies of our democratic and rules-based order,” Merz said, adding that the package was the “first major step toward a European defense community.”

Merz's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), are holding coalition talks with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) following February's early federal election.

The likely government coalition partners were keen to push the changes through the outgoing parliament Tuesday, as attaining the required two-thirds majority was more feasible in the current constellation — with the help of the Greens. Once the newly elected parliament convenes — no later than March 25 — this majority will be lost, due to electoral gains by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Left party — both of which oppose the changes.

In a concession to the Greens, the conservatives and SPD agreed that just over $100 billion from the infrastructure investment fund would be earmarked for climate-related projects. The defense spending exemption was also expanded to cover funding for civil defense, intelligence agencies, cyberdefense and aid for Ukraine.

“This is about total defense,” Major said. “It's a larger understanding of security and defense — not only military — because the threats to Germany, the threats to Europe are not only military. They are also in the gray zone between war and peace: sabotage, disinformation, the cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberdefense. So, what we need is total defense where you have deterrence, defense and resilience.”

A survey published by Infratest dimap earlier this month suggests that public support for more defense spending is also high. According to the poll, 66 percent of those asked said they were in favor of more defense spending and 20 percent said it should stay the same, while 11 percent said Germany should spend less on defense.

The defense deal opens the way for Germany to release another $3.3 billion in support for Ukraine, bringing the total aid for 2025 to $7.3 billion. Germany is the second-largest provider of military and financial aid to Ukraine after the United States.

For years, Germany was lambasted by the United States — particularly the first Trump administration — for failing to spend 2 percent of its annual economic output on defense. Only last year, under outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz, did the country reach the NATO goal for the first time since the Cold War, mostly on the back of a special fund of 100 billion euros. The fund was announced days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago to boost the country's mothballed Bundeswehr. It is set to dry up by the end of 2027 — two years before German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said the country should be “fit for war.”

Leaders in the European Union are set to meet Thursday in Brussels to discuss the bloc's defense and security, as well as Ukraine. Earlier this month, they largely endorsed plans to unlock hundreds of billions of collars in extra defense spending in the coming years. The E.U. executive branch proposals include a $150 billion loan program for investments including air and missile defense, artillery, and drones. Decisions to increase military spending will ultimately be up to individual E.U. states.

Marcedes Myran's remains were discovered along with those of Morgan Harris; their families had long called on authorities to search the Prairie Green landfill.

Canadian authorities said Monday that human remains found in a landfill near Winnipeg, Manitoba, were identified as those of an Indigenous woman murdered by a serial killer three years ago.

The remains of Marcedes Myran were found at the Prairie Green landfill, officials said. Since last year, the Manitoba government has been conducting a search-and-recovery mission at the request of the families of Myran and Morgan Harris, another Indigenous woman murdered by the same man. Harris's remains were found at the site in February and identified earlier this month.

Myran, 26, and Harris, 39, were members of the Long Plain First Nation.

“On behalf of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), we extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and community of Marcedes Myran,” Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, the national chief of AFN, said in a statement. “The loss of Marcedes and the difficult fight for search and recovery has been incomprehensible.”

Myran and Harris are among four First Nations women killed in 2022 by Jeremy Skibicki, who was sentenced to four life terms last year and will be ineligible for parole for 25 years. Skibicki was also convicted of murdering Rebecca Contois, 24, and an unidentified woman who police say was Indigenous. Elders have named her Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.

Indigenous women represent 5 percent of Canadian women but accounted for 24 percent of all female homicide victims from 2015 to 2020, The Washington Post previously reported.

After the disappearances of Myran and Harris, investigators determined that the pair's remains had been dumped at the Prairie Green landfill in June 2022. Authorities initially determined that it was not feasible to conduct a search because of the sheer amount of waste and the presence of toxins such as methane and asbestos, The Post reported.

But after protests from the Indigenous community, who questioned whether authorities would have reached the same conclusion had the victims been White, officials reversed their decision, telling families of the victims that they would be putting up $40 million Canadian ($28 million) in March 2024 to dig up the waste at the landfill and to train and equip the workers to safely conduct the search. Officials then combed through tens of thousands of cubic meters of waste.

“Marcedes Myran and Morgan Harris are coming home,” Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew told reporters Monday.

“We went through a whole heck of a lot to get to this point,” he said. “But at the end of the day, we did the right thing. We did right by these families, and we are bringing their loved ones back home.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

French politician Raphaël Glucksmann called for the return of the Statue of Liberty — a gift from France — in a symbolic critique of the Trump administration.

The White House has dismissed a French politician's symbolic call for the return of the Statue of Liberty — a gift from France some 140 years ago — on the grounds that the United States no longer represents the values embodied by the monument.

President Donald Trump would “absolutely not” return the statue, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday when asked about the comments from Raphaël Glucksmann, a member of the European Parliament.

“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,” Leavitt said, referring to the U.S. role in helping France during World War II. “So they should be very grateful to our great country.”

The United States played a major role in freeing France from four years of occupation by Nazi Germany, but it did not act alone. On June 6, 1944, Allied forces — primarily American, British and Canadian troops — launched the pivotal D-Day invasion, which marked the beginning of France's liberation.

Glucksmann, from France's center-left Place Publique party, made the quip about the Statue of Liberty during a party convention Sunday.

“We are going to tell the Americans — those who have chosen to side with tyrants, those who fire researchers for exercising scientific freedom — we are going to tell them two things. First of all, give us back the Statue of Liberty!” he said.

“We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently, you despise it. So let it be here with us,” he added.

Glucksmann, a vocal advocate for Ukraine's defense in its war against Russia, has previously accused European leaders of not providing sufficient support to Kyiv.

In his comments Sunday, he was also critical of the Trump administration's gutting of federal assistance to U.S. research institutes. Earlier this month, France's minister for higher education and research urged institutions in the country to welcome researchers affected by Trump's cuts in the United States.

Julian Jackson, an emeritus professor of modern French history at Queen Mary University of London, called Glucksmann a respected and articulate leader. “And the Statue of Liberty is of course a reminder that America partly owes her independence to the French, as in the War of Independence,” he said in an email.

France provided arms, ammunition, troops and naval support to the American colonies during the Revolutionary War.

The Statue of Liberty, a prominent symbol of freedom and hope, draws millions of visitors every year. It was first imagined by Édouard de Laboulaye of France, an ardent admirer of the United States, as a gift to commemorate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence and the abolition of slavery.

Sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi designed the statue to capture those values: a crown representing light, an inscription noting the date of American independence and a broken shackle and chains to mark the end of slavery. The completed statue was disassembled and shipped to New York in 1885, while the plaque with the famous Emma Lazarus poem was added in 1903.

In a social media thread late Monday, Glucksmann responded to Leavitt by acknowledging the heroism of the “hundreds of thousands of young Americans” who landed on the beaches of Normandy while casting the Trump administration's stance on Ukraine as a betrayal of the war-battered country and the United States' European allies.

Europe has been alarmed by Trump's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin and struggled to adapt to Washington's wavering support for Ukraine. Trump and Putin will speak by phone Tuesday to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, according to the Kremlin.

“No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone,” Glucksmann wrote. “And if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.”

As ABC's “Nightline” hits its 45th anniversary this month, the show is bringing back an updated version of its old logo. Having gone with an all-lowercase “nightline” since 2017, a new take on the show's all-caps “NIGHTLINE” that had been in use between 1997 and 2017 will now be introduced. (That look itself was inspired by “Nightline's” original logo, which featured a city skyline embedded in its letters.) According to ABC News, the new logo “honors its iconic legacy, blending elements from its original look with an updated, modern design.”

The change happens as ABC News celebrates the “Nightline” 45th anniversary on March 24 (12:35 a.m. ET) with a special episode, featuring all-new interviews with original anchor Ted Koppel, as well as previous anchors Terry Moran, Dan Harris, Cynthia McFadden, Bill Weir and Dan Abrams. Current “Nightline” rotating anchors Juju Chang and Byron Pitts will anchor together on that episode in honor of the show's birthday. The episode will feature archival footage and recount “Nightline's” place in journalism.

“'Nightline' is an incredibly important part of ABC News' 70-year legacy, with a rich history of straightforward journalism that has become a hallmark of the show,” said ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic. “I was privileged to spend over a decade at ‘Nightline,' and am so proud of the team today, who continue to build on its exceptional reputation.”

“Nightline” actually had its start in November 1979 as “The Iran Crisis: America Held Hostage,” which looked at the hostage crisis in Iran. March 24 actually marks the 45th anniversary of when the show was relaunched as “Nightline” and broadened out to focus on other topics as well.

“'Nightline' is delivering some of the most compelling and in-depth journalism on television, tackling complex stories with nuance and integrity,” said ‘Nightline' exec producer Eman Varoqua. “As we move forward, we're focused on expanding our storytelling and reaching new audiences while staying true to the hard-hitting, thoughtful reporting that has defined the show for 45 years.”

George Washington law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss courts blocking President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE cuts as Democrats celebrate.

As the lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump have climbed well past the triple-digit mark less than three months into his presidency, some supporters are questioning what actions – if any – can either members of Congress or the White House take to check the power of the courts.

Trump's supporters have criticized so-called ""activist"" judges who have ruled against Trump. Notably, some have labeled U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, as such after she sided with Chief Justice John Roberts and left-leaning justices to uphold a lower court decision that forced the Trump administration to unfreeze USAID payments previously authorized by Congress. 

More recently, the White House contested a federal judge's order blocking the administration from using a 1798 wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua. When U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to turn around any plane carrying deported foreign nationals, the administration sent hundreds of deportees to El Salvador anyway, seemingly in defiance of the judge. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News later that the plane in question had already ""left U.S. airspace"" and later added that the administration should not need to comply with the judge's order. 

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

""The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,"" Leavitt said, adding, ""A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.""

Boasberg ordered the parties back to court Monday for a hearing over the matter and set a Tuesday deadline for the Justice Department to provide the court with more information about what happened. However, Trump's apparent defiance of the court demonstrates how the executive branch is looking to push back against judges whose opinions it does not respect, while supporters in Congress cheer on. 

""Judges targeting President Trump are political hacks and their decisions belong in my SHREDDER,"" Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., wrote on X last week, sharing a video that criticized another judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali. Ogles called Ali a ""Biden-appointed, woke judicial activist"" after the judge, following the Supreme Court's guidance, ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in ""unlawfully"" restricted USAID funds. 

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a frequent critic of the courts, shared Ogles' post and wrote, ""Judges aren't presidents."" Lee, in recent weeks, suggested that some judges handing down defeats for the Trump administration ""might warrant removal."" 

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO PAY ‘UNLAWFULLY' RESTRICTED USAID FUNDS

Congress indeed has the power to impeach and remove federal judges for misconduct, corruption or other offenses – Trump has called for Congress to do so – but two-thirds of the Senate would need to vote in favor of removal, and Democrats are unlikely to join Republicans in any such effort. 

Many judges, for their part, have taken umbrage at the sweeping nature of Trump's executive orders, which have called for the gutting of government personnel, halted billions in foreign aid – including funds approved by Congress – and attempted to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, among other actions. 

""An American President is not a king – not even an 'elected' one – and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute,"" U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell said earlier this month in a court order reinstating a member of the National Labor Relations Board.

Constitutional scholars say these separation of powers conflicts long predate Trump and are somewhat expected because of the recent lack of action from the United States Congress.

Article I empowers Congress to ""make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper"" for the executive branch to function. However, when lawmakers focus more on their re-election campaigns or partisan fighting than enacting law, there is a vacuum that is filled by executive action – which faces tough scrutiny from the courts. 

HERE'S WHY DOZENS OF LAWSUITS SEEKING TO QUASH TRUMP'S EARLY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT ARE FAILING

U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali is a Biden appointee on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. (United States District Court for the District of Columbia)

Congress passed slightly fewer than 150 bills during the 118th session, according to data compiled by the firm Quorum and reported by Axios – making that session, which ended in December, the most unproductive since at least the 1980s.

Recent presidents, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, have responded with a flurry of executive orders and actions to enact their agenda, analysts explained to Fox News Digital in an interview. 

According to the Code of Federal Regulations and the Federal Register, a president's executive order can be revoked or modified only by the president or via the legislative branch, if the president was acting on authority that had been granted by Congress. In the Trump era, lawsuits have alleged that Trump has acted without authorization from Congress. 

In the absence of clearly written laws, judges wield enormous power to interpret the lawfulness of the executive's action and have done so. Critics of the judiciary have advocated for Congress to curtail this power by either changing the size or structure of certain lower courts or taking similar action.

Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule opined in a social media post Thursday that Congress, with its Republican majorities in the House and Senate, could simply move to cut off funding for judicial law clerks and other essential legal personnel, making the legislative branch's ""power of the purse"" painfully clear. 

""If Congress simply refused to fund judicial law clerks, secretaries, or computers, one suspects that the TROs would come out more slowly - and perhaps even that the judiciary would gain a renewed appreciation for the limits of its role,"" Vermeule wrote on X.

However, given Congress's difficulty in passing legislation, including days of infighting that have delayed the passage of recent stopgap spending bills, it is unclear how effective lawmakers of either party would be at rallying behind a measure like the one he proposed.

Options available to the White House are more limited by the Constitution. The president can appoint federal judges, but he cannot fire them. The executive branch is also responsible for enforcing court rulings and may either slow-roll or de-prioritize decisions the president disagrees with. However, such an action would violate historical deference given to the courts, although Trump now seems to be willing to do so.

JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN FROM TARGETING DEMOCRATIC LAW FIRM AFTER ATTORNEYS WARN OF FIRM'S DEMISE

After the Supreme Court upheld a district court's decision this month ordering the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion in owed payments to USAID contractors for completed projects, Judge Ali said in his ruling that the Trump administration likely exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to block the payments.

""Here, the executive has unilaterally deemed that funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid will not be spent,"" Ali said.

""The executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress' exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place."" Ali added.

However, it is unclear what remedies the White House would have unilaterally to push back on the decision, short of appealing certain portions to the Supreme Court that were not ruled on directly – prompting criticism from some.

As president, Trump ""is exercising Article II power to take care that our federal laws are faithfully executed,"" Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

""That's his constitutional duty. And that includes weeding out waste, fraud and abuse. That's what he's doing with Elon Musk and with DOGE,"" said Davis, a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch. 

It is unclear whether the White House plans to appeal any part of Judge Ali's preliminary injunction ruling, and administration officials did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Wildfires fueled by high winds continued to sweep across the state of Oklahoma on Monday. As Oklahomans assessed the devastation to their homes and property, officials warned of an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.

Residents are surveying damage from unusually vicious weather in multiple U.S. states where violent twisters, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires decimated entire neighborhoods. As of Sunday afternoon, at least 37 people had been killed as a sprawling storm barreled across the nation's midsection toward the East Coast.

PLANTERSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — Kim Atchison was hunkered down in her grandmother's storm shelter with her 5-year-old grandson Saturday night in their tiny Alabama hometown of Plantersville when her husband and son raced in.

“Get down; get all the way down to the bottom of the cellar,” they told her, saying they could see a twister coming.

Atchison said she remembers first the “dead silence” and then hearing the wind that felt like a funnel and things outside hitting against each other. 

“All was quiet after that because it was that fast,” she said. “Like a snap of a finger and it was gone.”

Atchison and her family were among the fortunate ones to avoid being killed in the three-day outbreak of severe weather across eight states that kicked up a devastating combination of wildfires, dust storms and tornadoes — claiming at least 42 lives since Friday.

Two people were killed by a twister in Plantersville. One of the lives lost was that of 82-year-old Annie Free, who “just looked out for everyone,” Atchison's husband said. The tornado struck Free's home, leaving only the front patio behind.

Darren Atchison spent Monday delivering granola bars and sports drinks to the pummeled neighborhood, driving his all-terrain vehicle around downed trees. 

More than a half-dozen houses were destroyed while others were left in rough shape, some with walls peeled clean off. The tornado flipped a trailer onto its roof and toppled trees in every direction.




When Heidi Howland emerged from her home after hiding in her bedroom underneath a mattress with her husband, kids and grandkids as the twister approached, she found fallen trees and broken car windows.

Many of her neighbors whose houses were damaged came to her front porch to take refuge from the rain after the storm passed Saturday night. One was Free's daughter, who Howland said cried late into the night because the first responders couldn't find her mother.

Free's body wasn't found until the morning.

Also killed was Dunk Pickering, a fixture in the community who often hosted live music events and helped neighbors during tough times. Neighbor John Green found Pickering's body in the wreckage of a building just across the street from Green's home. 

“Whether he knew you or not, he would help anyone,” Green said. “I've known him for 20 years. He's been like that ever since the day I first met him.”

Green and other neighbors spent at least five hours Saturday night pulling people from the rubble and carrying them to paramedics who were unable to reach the area because roads were blocked by debris.

Wind-driven wildfires across the state destroyed more than 400 homes over the weekend and will continue to be a threat in the coming days because of high winds. 

Dozens of fires were still burning across the state on Monday, said Keith Merckx at Oklahoma Forestry Services, and much of the state including the Oklahoma City area remained under fire warnings.

While conditions over the weekend allowed crews to get a handle on most wildfires across Texas and Oklahoma, forecasters at the National Weather Service said extremely critical fire weather conditions were expected Tuesday over an area spanning from southeastern New Mexico through the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma.

“These fires, once they get started, become really hard to stop. They move more quickly than our resources can keep up with,” Merckx said.

Four deaths so far were blamed on the fires or high winds, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. More than 70 homes were destroyed by wildfire outbreaks Friday in and around Stillwater, home to Oklahoma State University. 

In Mississippi, six people died and more than 200 were displaced by a string of tornadoes across three counties, the governor said. 

Within about an hour of each other on Saturday, two big tornadoes tore through Walthall County, Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service. The strongest one packed winds of 170 mph (274 kph) when it swept a well-built home from its foundation, leaving a pile of debris behind, the agency said in an updated report late Monday. 

Three people died in the county, including 7-year-old Carter Young, who was in a mobile home, Walthall County Coroner Chris Blackwell said. The other two people killed — Gabrielle Pierre, 34, and Jeffery Irvin, 42 — were in a mobile home next door to the one where Young was found, Blackwell said.

Scattered twisters and storm damage led to the deaths of at least 13 people in Missouri, including a 30-year-old man who along with his dog was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning after he was using a generator indoors during the storm, authorities said. In Arkansas, officials confirmed three deaths.

As the storm headed east, two boys ages 11 and 13 were killed when a tree fell on their home in western North Carolina early Sunday, firefighters in Transylvania County said. Firefighters found them amid the uprooted 3-foot-wide tree after relatives said they had been trapped in their bedroom, officials said. 

A tornado touched down at about 3 a.m. Monday in a neighborhood in Perquimans County, North Carolina, destroying three mobile homes and damaging several others, according to the National Weather Service. Eight people were injured in the community, with no reported deaths, the weather service said. The community is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Norfolk, Virginia. 

High winds spurred dust storms that led to almost a dozen deaths in car crashes Friday. 

Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle.

The U.S. Institute of Peace is DOGE's next target as it continues slashing the federal workforce and government spending. But its ‘private and protected status' could insulate it.

What Is the U.S. Institute of Peace?

Anna Moneymaker|Getty Images

A view of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) building headquarters on Mar. 18, 2025 in Washington, DC.

The United States Institute of Peace is the latest congressionally funded institution in Washington to find itself in the legally dubious crosshairs of the Department of Government Efficiency after a bizarre confrontation between officials with the think tank and agents of the Trump administration that involved a police response.

George Moose, the acting president and CEO of the organization, announced late Monday night that DOGE had broken into its headquarters. Employees called the Metropolitan Police Department to report a break-in and police cars were seen outside the building, but members of the controversial agency were later escorted inside.

The social media account for the institute was taken down shortly after from the X platform owned by DOGE's effective leader Elon Musk, but its Instagram and Facebook pages remain active.

DOGE's entry – the team's agents eventually were assisted by law enforcement in forcing out staff members and occupying the building – comes after several unsuccessful attempts in the last week and just days after the administration gutted the organization's board.

Officials with the institute say it is exempt from a reorganization or an attempted shuttering, as occurred with the United States Agency for International Development, because it was created by Congress.

READ: 



Here's what to know about the organization's history, what it does and why DOGE is going after it.

The institute was founded as a nonpartisan and independent organization to help prevent violent conflicts and broker peace deals overseas. It operates programs in conflict areas, conducts research, operates a training academy and public education center, hosts events and conferences and more.

It also works with nongovernmental organizations, higher and secondary educational institutions, international and local organizations, and U.S. government agencies like the Defense Department.

Its headquarters is located in downtown Washington, D.C., just steps away from the Lincoln Memorial and across the street from the State Department.

Laura MannweilerMarch 17, 2025



The institute was created through the United States Institute of Peace Act. President Ronald Reagan signed the act in 1984.

U.S. Code 22 U.S.C. ch. 56 called for an institute to ""serve the people and the government through the widest possible range of education and training, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence.”

The idea of the organization began during a grassroots movement in the 1970s and 1980s and came to a head when former senators Mark Hatfield, Spark Matsunaga, Dan Glickman and Jennings Randolph launched an effort to form a national peace academy.

The 1984 act that created the organization came after a recommendation in 1981 from a commission created by President Jimmy Carter to examine the peace academy idea.

Monday night's late-night entry was not the first attempt by DOGE to breach the institute's building.

The newly formed agency has had its sights set on the organization for weeks as it continues to take an axe to the federal workforce and federal spending. Similar to USAID, the institute's work overseas has made it a prime target as DOGE continues to look for ways to reduce “waste, fraud and abuse.” But, unlike with USAID, the process has been anything but smooth.

Attempts to gain access to the building have been repeatedly rebuffed by lawyers who argue that the organization's “private and independent status” insulates it from any form of restructuring.

While the institute was created as an “independent non-profit corporation,” it doesn't meet the U.S. code definitions of “government corporation,” “government-controlled corporation” or “independent establishment.” This is not the same for past targets of the agency.



Moose said the organization had been speaking with DOGE since last month trying to explain its status. He noted that the headquarters is also not a federal building.

DOGE members arrived at the D.C. headquarters on Friday with two FBI agents but left after the institute's lawyer informed them of the organization's status, according to a statement from the institute.

The failed attempts came just days after the institute's board of directors was gutted by the Trump administration. The three remaining members – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin – said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting president. Jackson is among the members of DOGE who entered the building Monday.

The organization has said it does not view Jackson's appointment as legal given its status.

Over the last two years, the Big Four giants have been plagued by rumours of redundancies and now the situation has escalated to the senior partners. 

Over the weekend, The Sunday Times revealed that dozens of senior partners were at risk of being laid off at EY, the most significant redundancy plan in decades.

EY currently has 894 equity partners and 757 non-equity partners, but the paper revealed the firm is expected to axe 30 partners, mainly in its consulting division.

In addition to those facing the chopping block, it was reported that some equity partners will have their positions converted into non-equity partners.

The news about EY follows PwC which recently made a record number of cuts to its partner ranks while pausing its tech apprenticeship scheme to protect partner profits.

It is no secret that the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

EY reported last October that its UK net revenue grew by a single-digit percentage over 2024, but fee income remained flat due to a reduction in significant cross-border transactions.

Deloitte UK's revenue increased slightly by over two per cent, but its profit stalled. 

PwC UK reported single-digit growth in revenue, but this came against the backdrop of the group's profit and partner pay dropping again.

In January, KPMG UK revealed it recorded double-digit growth in profit before tax over 2024, but its revenue only increased by one per cent.

James O'Dowd, managing partner at Patrick Morgan, told City AM that “after years of aggressive post-pandemic hiring, [Big Four firms] are now cutting jobs to protect partner profits and rebalance bloated teams.”

He noted that the consulting boom that followed the pandemic has slowed, and these firms now need to correct that over-hiring strategy.

Fiona Czerniawska, CEO of Source Global Research, explained to City AM that the “relentless pace [of growth] slowed, partly due to the unfavourable macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop.”

She added that the “firms have since found themselves with too many and too expensive people”.

In addition, these firms have focused on considerable investments in technology, including AI. 

Czerniawska noted the aim is “firms will be able to grow and deliver more work, without recruiting evermore talent.”

Over 900 roles were made redundant at the UK Big Four firms in 2024, and some 1,800 jobs were cut in 2023.

The latest moves by EY and PwC have piqued a lot of interest as they focus on the senior partnership level.

Partners manage the firm together, but the equity partners are the ones that own and pull their shares out of the profit pool.

O'Dowd explained: “A major source of frustration for high-performing partners has been the burden of carrying dozens of underperforming colleagues who have contributed little revenue over the past years while still drawing from the profit pool.”

“Many top performers feel their compensation is being diluted by those who do not generate revenue or drive growth, making these redundancies a necessary and inevitable step,” he added.

The firms have been trying to fix their career ladders for some time. Senior PwC staff in the UK, who will never make a partner, were offered ‘managing director' roles last year.

The move behind the ‘managing director' role is to keep senior talent engaged without touching the profit pool.

“This is a turning point for the Big Four,” O'Dowd stated, adding, “The old promise—work your way up and become a partner—no longer holds in the same way.”

“With fewer equity seats, alternative career paths emerging, and AI-driven disruption accelerating, the traditional firm structure is under pressure,” he added.

Despite the losses at the Big Four, the consultancy sector is expected to expand this year. 

Tamzen Isacsson, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association (MCA) noted: “We're upbeat about growth prospects this year with forecast increases in revenue of 6.4 per cent in 2025 and 8.7 per cent in 2026, according to our latest independent research“.

“We're seeing much more activity and opportunity in the market than this time last year,” Isacsson added.

However, MCA's report in January 2024 said activity in the sector was predicted to return “to double digits growth in 2025 (11 per cent)”.

Global investors have fled US stocks at their fastest rate on record in favour of UK stocks, making their highest allocation to British equities since June 2021.

UK equities were the third most overweight sector from global investors this month, beaten out only by utilities and banking stocks, Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey revealed.

Just a month ago, the UK was rated as the least attractive market to invest in among fund managers, with an 18 per cent underweight to British equities.

Now, investors are four per cent overweight UK stocks, in only the second month since 2022 that investors have been overweight British equities.

Meanwhile, March saw the biggest drop in US equity allocation ever, amid fears that president Donald Trump's tariffs policy may kick off a global trade war.

69 per cent of investors agreed that the market theme of ‘US exceptionalism' has now peaked, compared to just 21 per cent who disagreed.

This was combined with the second largest drop in global growth expectations ever and the biggest jump in cash allocation since March 2020.

In total, 63 per cent of fund managers now expect a weaker global economy in the next year.

While the decline was sharp, sentiment is nowhere near the extreme lows reached during the pandemic or collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Instead, growth expectations and equity allocations have returned to a more neutral level, down from the “uber-bull level” following Trump's victory, BofA said.

“A majority now expect the Trump administration to have a negative impact on growth and a positive impact on inflation, effectively anticipating a stagflationary environment,” explained BofA investment strategists Andreas Bruckner and Sebastian Raedler.

Cash allocations among fund managers jumped from 3.5 per cent of their portfolios in February to 4.1 per cent.

The change in growth expectations came largely from fears of the recessionary trade war, though 13 per cent of fund managers cited Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency as the most likely cause of a US recession.

Along with the UK, Europe has also been a beneficiary of a shift in investment behaviour, with allocation to Eurozone stocks at the highest since July 2021.

Review platform Trustpilot has reported a double-digit increase in revenue and earnings as business adoption and brand awareness “fuel the flywheel”.

Its share price rose more than 13 per cent in early trades. 

The company told markets this morning that revenue rose 19 per cent in the year ended December 31, to $210m (£161m) from $176m (£135) last year.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 55 per cent to $24.1m (£18.6m), supported by operating leverage in general and administrative expenses. 

Trustpilot will continue its share buyback programme by up to £20m this year, adding to the £33m in buybacks in 2024. 

Bookings, which refer to the annual value of contracts signed or renewed with Trustpilot, rose 26 per cent year on year to $239m (£184m). 

Although it is free for users, Trustpilot operates a freemium model for businesses where firms can pay to show Trustpilot reviews on their website.

Trustpilot said the growth in business adoption and brand awareness is “fuelling the flywheel” and supporting bookings by businesses.

“The new product features such as market insights and review spotlight have been well received, and we are encouraged by the number of customers moving up onto higher plans,” the company said.

Consumer adoption continued to grow, with a 23 per cent increase in reviews on the platform to 301m.

Fiona Orford-Williams, Director of TMT at Edison Group, said: “Trustpilot's full year results were as signalled in its January update… in excess of what the market was then forecasting. 

“Trustpilot has continued to innovate to drive additional value for its customers through AI-driven insights.

“The outlook for the current year is… a further good step up in margins as the [business] reaps the benefits of scale.”

The company expects constant currency revenue growth in the high teens this year, with adjusted EBITDA slightly ahead of market expectations and a 2 percentage point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin.

“Our strategy is clear: we operate an open, trusted platform for consumers to help each other make the right choices, and for businesses to build trust, grow, and improve,” CEO Adrian Blair said, adding that he wanted to maximise the platform's “inherent network effects”. 

“We executed well against this in 2024, delivering record bookings, profitability and cash generation, returning $42.9m (£33m) of capital to shareholders through two share buybacks. 

“We refreshed our go-to-market approach by simplifying our packages and updating our pricing. Product innovation is at the heart of our offering and in April we introduced new features which provide unique insights into consumer behaviour and market dynamics.

“Looking forward, we will continue to deliver product innovation to embed trust across commerce, as trust becomes even more important in the age of AI.”

Marc Filippino, Nikou Asgari and Zijing Wu 

PublishedMarch 18 2025

This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Jack Ma's AI comeback'

Marc FilippinoGood morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, March 18th, and this is your FT News Briefing. Russia has reopened to the west a little bit, and Jack Ma is making a comeback. Plus, European companies may wanna think twice before adding a secondary listing in the US.

Nikou Asgari Executives say we're going to add a listing in New York, and all of these things are going to magically improve, and we found that that's not entirely the case.

Marc FilippinoI'm Marc Filippino and here's the news you need to start your day. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Marc FilippinoRussian President Vladimir Putin is allowing some western investors to offload Russian securities. Putin published the decree on Monday. In it, he said that Jane Street, GMO and Franklin Templeton will be allowed to sell shares in Russian companies to a US hedge fund. Putin banned international investors from dealing in shares or bonds of Russian banks and energy companies after the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now the timing of yesterday's decree is interesting. Putin is expected to talk with US President Donald Trump today about a potential ceasefire.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Marc FilippinoA lot of executives say that a New York stock market presence is a sure-fire route to a higher share price, and that's led many European companies to add a US listing in recent years. But it turns out that assumption may be wrong. Nikou Asgari is the FT's digital markets correspondent, and she joins me now. Hey, Nikou.

Nikou Asgari Hi.

Marc FilippinoAll right, so tell me a little bit about your research on this, Nikou. What companies did you analyse, and what did you find out?

Nikou Asgari We looked at 12 companies that all have European listings since 2016, and that since then have added a listing in New York. So they've kept the European listing and they've added one in New York to see what the impact of that New York listing has been, whether they saw an increase in their valuations, in their increase in their liquidity, and if there were more analysts covering the companies. These are all things that executives say, you know, we're going to add a listing in New York, we're gonna move to New York, and all of these things are going to magically improve. And we found that that's not entirely the case.

Marc FilippinoYeah, just give me some background about why these companies have been setting their sights on the US stock market in the first place.

Nikou Asgari Yeah, so for a number of years now, European executives, European investors have been looking at, you know, the rise of the US stock market, which hasn't really been mirrored in Europe or in the UK in the same way. And so companies have either just IPO'd in the US entirely or have added and moved their listings from Europe to New York to get a slice of that pie, essentially, to get more investors to look at them, to invest in them, to help boost their share price, their valuations. And so we thought to take a sort of empirical look at the ones that have done this and see how it's played out.

Marc FilippinoGot it. And your analysis is saying, hey, not so fast, maybe it's not that simple.

Nikou Asgari Yeah, absolutely. It's not for every company that if they move to the US, then all of their valuations, their number of analysts, their liquidity will immediately dramatically improve. It's not a sort of one-size-fits-all, if you like. There's a lot of nuance in this. 

Marc FilippinoBut are there any potential upsides to a new listing for European companies in the US? I mean, I have to imagine they were drawn here for a reason. 

Nikou Asgari Yeah, absolutely. I mean, for two-thirds of the companies that we looked at, their liquidity in their US listing improved compared to the liquidity in their European listing, which speaks to the point that the US stock market is deeper, is more liquid. Now there is nuance to mention here, which is the larger companies, which we defined as those with a market capitalisation of more than $10bn. They perform slightly better than smaller companies. And that, the analysts we spoke to, put down to the fact that US investors recognise bigger names. So you've got companies like CRH, like Flutter, like Ferguson, which did do better. They recognise those much more than the small European companies that they might never have heard of.

Marc FilippinoSo then, Nikou, what are the broader implications of these findings?

Nikou Asgari The issue of the UK and Europe's competitive capital markets has been on the agenda for policymakers, for politicians, for a good few years now. They're all trying quite desperately to revive the capital markets to make growing a company, listing a company and keeping your company in Europe or in the UK much more attractive. And so I guess this just sort of adds to the questions that they might have saying, hey if you're a European or UK company, the grass is not always greener in the US and, actually, you should stick around in Europe and the UK for longer, build your business here and contribute to the UK, to the European economy by doing so.

Marc FilippinoThat's the FT's Nikou Asgari. Thanks, Nikou.

Nikou Asgari Thank you.

Marc FilippinoThe UK's financial watchdog is set to ban Crispin Odey from the sector. He'll also get a fine of nearly £2mn for a, quote, ‘lack of integrity' for his conduct. The high-profile founder of the hedge fund Odey Asset Management fell from grace two years ago. That was after the FT detailed allegations of sexual harassment and assault. Odey has disputed them. Now, the Financial Conduct Authority's moves here aren't based on the accusations themselves, but actually on Odey's alleged attempts to hold up his hedge fund's efforts to address complaints about him. The regulator said Odey wasn't, quote, fit and proper person to perform any function related to regulated activities. Odey has said he will challenge the decision in court.

Marc FilippinoAn ecommerce giant in China looks to be making a comeback, this time on the coattails of artificial intelligence. I'm talking about Jack Ma and his company Alibaba. At one point, it was hard to escape them, as my colleague, Zijing Wu, explains . . . 

Zijing WuJack Ma was once seen as China's poster child for the tech wonder. Alibaba at its peak was valued at more than $700bn, and it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, not only in China.

Marc FilippinoBut a clampdown by Chinese regulators sent the company's shares spiralling, and Alibaba struggled for years.

Zijing WuMany people would point to the failed Ant financial IPO in 2020. So Ant financial was set to raise $34.5bn from the world's largest IPO around that time, and it was called off at the very last minute. Regulators later said it was because Alibaba had some shortcomings that they have discovered, but it was actually because Jack gave a speech a few days before the listing, and he was talking about China's banking system and how it was operating like pawn shops. So that really made Beijing angry and that caused a lot of political issues.

Marc FilippinoThe ecommerce giant had to pay a lot of hefty fines, and Jack Ma faded from view for a while, until recently. Now, there are signals that the tech wonder might be back on Beijing's good side.

Zijing WuWell, a key signal was earlier this year, when Jack Ma was at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. So he was sitting in the front row together with other businessmen like Tencent's Pony Ma, and a few other significant Chinese business people. So that was seen as a symbolic move from Beijing to show people that Jack is now politically safe. And also that's a sign seen by market as Jack coming out of his political exile. 

Marc FilippinoAnd it looks to be all thanks to Beijing's interest in artificial intelligence. 

Zijing WuAlibaba started investing into AI-related research as early as 2019, but their serious investment really started after Jack saw the potential of AI after ChatGPT was launched, which is also in line with Beijing's strategy to use AI to help the economy, which is slowing down.

Marc FilippinoIt's not just Jack Ma though, Alibaba is on the up and up again too.

Zijing WuSo Alibaba's Qwen model, which is as open source as DeepSeek's models, is actually seen as one of the most advanced models from China, especially the latest version. It's a very small model and it's basically performing almost as good as DeepSeek, but with even lower costs. It's more efficient. Investors have realised how advanced Alibaba has become in terms of its AI capability, which is why Alibaba stock rose almost 70 per cent this year. And this is after DeepSeek's release of its R1 reasoning model. And that's the moment when investors realise Chinese tech overall have been significantly undervalued.

Oops, something went wrong

Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) new attempt to buy Israeli cloud cybersecurity startup Wiz is a fresh test for how aggressively President Trump's antitrust watchdogs will respond to moves by Big Tech.

While there is no guarantee regulators will greenlight the $32 billion all-cash deal merging Wiz into Google Cloud, the transaction may be on more solid footing than it was when first contemplated during the Biden administration.

That optimism is fueled by signs that Trump's antitrust enforcers may be willing to bend in cases where companies can argue that a tie-up would give the US an edge in the global race to dominate artificial intelligence.

""This deal will get careful scrutiny,"" said Michael Carrier, an antitrust law professor at Rutgers Law School, ""but at the end of the day, I believe it is likely to be approved given an anticipated less aggressive blocking of mergers and the AI angle.""

The deal would be the largest-ever acquisition for Alphabet, Google's parent company. Wiz leverages AI to enhance its primary business providing cloud security for major tech players, including Google, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL).

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during a webcast on Tuesday that the acquisition would help Google manage the accelerating pace and impact of cloud security breaches, including those introduced by AI.

""AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities,"" Pichai said.

Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said during the same webcast that the merged company would continue to integrate AI-powered cybersecurity tools for prioritizing threats, analyzing cloud security configurations for risks, and automating AI-powered remediation workflows.

Alphabet stock was down nearly 3% Tuesday afternoon amid a broader sell-off of tech names.

The tie comes after signs that Trump's antitrust officials at the Justice Department may take a lighter approach to AI enforcement.

In a March 7 filing, Trump's DOJ argued to a judge that Google should be able to keep its AI investments in companies such as Anthropic even if other parts of its empire are broken up following a federal judge's ruling that Google illegally monopolized online search markets.

On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order issued by President Biden that directed AI developers to apply AI ""responsibly,"" including by disclosing their safety test results to the government.

The lighter-touch approach also has support from Congress.

JD Harriman noted that a congressional bipartisan task force on AI made it clear in its December report that lawmakers would take a ""wait and see"" attitude on AI regulation.

They expressed concern over China's AI advancements and the industry's potential impact on military strength, noting that the country had secured more AI patent applications, journal publications, and journal citations.

On his first day back in office, President Trump issued an executive order directing federal advisers in technology and national security to ""enhance America's global AI dominance.""

At the Paris AI Summit on Feb. 11, Vice President JD Vance then emphasized AI opportunity over safety concerns.

""I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago,"" Vance said. ""I'm here to talk about AI opportunity.""

""[T]o restrict its development now would not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations.""

But Trump's antitrust cops aren't ignoring AI altogether. The FTC, for example, has broadened a probe into Microsoft (MSFT) and its relationship with AI upstart OpenAI, according to a Bloomberg report.

The probe was first launched by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, a key architect of a new movement seeking to expand the legal theories that can give rise to antitrust claims.

Harry First, a law professor at New York University School of Law, said the DOJ will look into the case of Alphabet and Wiz to ""see whether Google has the incentive and ability to foreclose Amazon, let's say, or Microsoft, from the services that with supplies to them.""

First said that if officials conclude that the deal threatens competition, Google and Wiz may be asked for concessions. ""So this is where the switch of administrations may matter.""

As for arguing that an AI connection should allow the deal to sail through, ""I'm not sure how much weight, in the end, that's going to have,” he added.

“If they get to that point, they're sort of Hail Mary passing.""

Oops, something went wrong

Apple (AAPL) stock has fallen roughly 18% from its record close in December, shedding more than $700 billion off the iPhone maker's market cap as investors scrutinize the company's AI play and evaluate macroeconomic headwinds.

Apple shares closed at an all-time high of $259 on Dec. 26 — just two weeks after the tech giant added ChatGPT to its iPhones as part of its second rollout of Apple Intelligence AI features — and the company's market cap soared to a record $3.9 trillion.

Last week alone, Apple shares fell 11%, marking their biggest weekly loss since November 2022. And as of Tuesday midday, the iPhone maker's market cap stood at roughly $3.2 trillion.

Apple shares have suffered in the first months of 2025 as Big Tech stocks have led a broader stock market downturn, driven by investor fears that the artificial intelligence boom could disappoint. Apple has also faced its own particular setbacks.

For one, Apple's AI strategy is showing troubling cracks. On March 7, Apple delayed the release of an AI-upgraded Siri, saying the new Siri is taking longer than the company expected and should come out later this year. The move prompted Morgan Stanley analysts to lower their price target on the stock to $252 from $275 and cut iPhone sales forecasts. The analysts, led by Erik Woodring, expect Apple to ship 228 million iPhones in 2025 and 237.5 million in 2026, down from their prior estimates of 230 million and 255 million, respectively.

Woodring wrote in an analysis on March 12 that, according to Morgan Stanley's consumer surveys, “‘an upgraded Siri personal assistant' is the #1 AI feature prospective iPhone upgraders are interested in when upgrading.”

“Given our prior iPhone forecast assumed the iOS18.4 launch in April '25 would integrate a more advanced Siri alongside broader Apple Intelligence language support and accelerate upgrade rates this fall, we believe it is necessary to lower our [iPhone] upgrade rate assumption, and FY26 shipment forecast, as a more advanced Siri is unlikely to be available until after the iPhone 17 launch,” he wrote.

“That's not to say other factors cannot support iPhone growth in FY26 ... but without a ‘killer AI app' in market ahead of the iPhone 17 launch, we don't see AI features contributing to accelerating upgrade rates as meaningfully as we did previously,” he added.

Adding to the heat on Apple, Trump's tariffs on China threaten to add $2 billion to the company's costs of goods and services over the next 12 months, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis last week.

The Trump administration is also putting a massive chunk of Apple's annual revenue at risk. That's because the DOJ last week stood firm with the prior administration in asking a federal judge to block Google (GOOG) from paying companies like Apple to secure its search engine as a default on devices like smartphones — which generates $18 billion to $20 billion in revenue for Apple per year, Bernstein analysts estimate. And the administration's apparently tough-on-tech stance could be bad news for Apple's own antitrust fight with the DOJ.

Tesla (TSLA) was under pressure again on Tuesday, falling as much as 3.8% in midday trading as a slew of competitors in China announced updates that again signaled competition on the mainland ramping up for the EV giant.

Tuesday's loss follows a 5% drop for Tesla stock to start the week, and shares are now down over 52% from highs reached back in December.

BYD (BYDDY), China's top automaker, announced a huge milestone with its battery technology on Tuesday, sending shares listed in Hong Kong to a new record high.

BYD said its new battery and charging system — dubbed the Super e-Platform — can charge at peak speeds of 1,000 kW, providing around 250 miles of range in just five minutes, per BYD chair and founder Wang Chuanfu.

By contrast, Tesla's fastest superchargers max out at 250kW, or a quarter of BYD's claimed feat.

“To completely solve users' anxiety over charging, our pursuit is to make the charging time for EVs as short as the refueling time for fuel vehicles,” Wang added.

BYD, whose cars you still cannot buy in the US, said it will start selling EVs with the Super e-Platform next month — and plans to add 4,000 high-power charging stations in China.

Upstart EV maker Xiaomi (XIACY), best known for making smartphones, announced it would expand production capacity for its vehicles.

The maker of the SU7 sedan — which looks like a Porsche Taycan sedan crossed with a McLaren supercar— will up its production target to 350,000 EVs from its prior 300,000 target, CEO Lei Jun posted on Weibo, per Bloomberg.

The SU7, with its striking looks and tech-forward interior powered by a version of Android called HyperOS, has clearly been a hit with Chinese consumers who look to their cars as extensions of their digital devices.

Xiaomi's phones connect seamlessly to its vehicles and give users a unified experience across the products, a level Western automakers have not been able to achieve in China.

Tuesday's move to boost production comes as the company struggles to meet customer demand.

In December, Xiaomi announced it will expand its product offerings with the YU7 crossover SUV EV, which will have a similar footprint to Tesla's Model Y and will officially launch midyear.

Additionally, Chinese pure-play EV maker XPeng (XPEV) announced strong financial guidance for the first quarter.

XPeng expects first quarter revenue of 15 billion to 15.7 billion yuan ($2.07 billion to $2.17 billion) and expects to deliver between 91,000 and 93,000 vehicles in the first quarter — up over 300% compared to a year ago.

This comes as fourth quarter revenue hit 16.11 billion yuan ($2.21 billion), up 23% from a year ago, with deliveries of 91,507, up 52% in the same time span.

""In 2025, with the launch of more attractive new products, we are confident in maintaining our investment in R&D while continuing to enhance profitability and free cash flow,"" vice chair and co-president Brian Gu said in a statement.

XPeng's success has not gone unnoticed from legacy automakers, with Volkswagen investing $700 million in the automaker to help build VW-branded EVs for the Chinese market in 2026. Also: It recently inked a deal to build 20,000 chargers across 420 cities in China.

Finally, Zeekr (ZK), another Tesla rival, owned by China's Geely (0175.HK), hopped on the self-driving train with news of its own in the space.

Zeekr said it would roll out its autonomous software to customers for free in China, CEO Andy An told CNBC ahead of a launch event on Tuesday.

The company intends to roll out the software to a pilot group initially — and then release it to the broader public in April. The system allows Zeekr cars to pilot themselves autonomously from one point to another, but drivers must keep their hands on the wheel.

Zeekr's move to roll out its more advanced software for free follows Tesla's news on Monday to offer a free trial of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) autonomous software for a limited time (March 17-April 16).

Tesla's move with FSD in China comes as the company had struggled with data collection from its EVs in China because of the government's data privacy and national security laws. Those rules prevent Tesla from sending data collected in China to its servers in the US, and vice versa.

Big US banks wanted Michelle Bowman to be their new overseer at the Federal Reserve — and that's what they got.

President Trump on Monday named the Fed governor and former Kansas banking commissioner as his choice to be the next vice chair for supervision, which would make Bowman arguably the most powerful bank regulator in Washington, D.C.

Big Wall Street financial institutions are not hiding their approval for the pick.

""I'd be excited to see Miki Bowman appointed,"" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said in a Fox News interview last week, after her likely appointment had been reported by several media outlets.

""I think the industry would be excited.""

The reason is that Bowman is likely to take oversight of giant US banks in a new direction as the Trump administration makes it clear it wants to lift constraints on lenders and overhaul a regulatory framework put in place following the 2008 financial crisis.

Bowman's appointment is seen as ""a major, bank-friendly shift,"" Ian Katz, a managing director with Capital Alpha, said last week.

Katz, for example, expects Bowman to be instrumental in releasing giant lender Wells Fargo (WFC) from a 2018 Federal Reserve consent order that restricts it from growing any bigger.

Bowman is also expected to revisit a new set of controversial capital rules proposed by former vice chair for supervision Michael Barr that would have required lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses.

The requirements are based on an international set of capital requirements known as Basel III imposed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis.

Bowman in a statement Monday night said if she wins confirmation from the Senate, she will ""promote a safe and sound banking system through a pragmatic approach to supervision and regulation with a transparent and tailored bank regulatory framework that encourages innovation.""

She may still face some opposition from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

Warren said in her own statement on Monday night that she has ""deep concerns"" that Bowman's appointment ""will cause yet another cycle of Wall Street deregulation, bank crashes, and bailouts that put working families at risk while letting big bank executives off the hook.""

For the moment, though, Bowman's nomination is a clear signal from the Trump administration that the White House does want changes made to how lenders are regulated.

Hopes for deregulation of the banking industry helped propel bank stocks higher following Trump's November election victory, along with optimism about a rebound in mergers, acquisitions, initial public offerings, and plain-vanilla lending.

But so far in Trump's second term as president, things have gotten a lot more complicated for banks and their investors as Trump's new antitrust cops also signal they aren't going to give a free pass to big mergers and new uncertainties surrounding the president's tariff plans leave many businesses unsure about when to make big moves.

The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, a key index tracking the US banking sector (^BKX) climbed as much as 15% to its peak in February but has since erased its post-election gains over the past month and is now down 1% from election night.

Hopes for an M&A boom are also in question. Last week, Goldman Sachs trimmed its forecast for completed M&A deals in 2025, predicting that the increase in volume would now be 7% instead of 25%.

There are other ongoing complications for banks too.

Some are getting grilled over whether they ""debanked"" certain customers for holding conservative views or operating in the crypto industry.

The conflict began at Davos, Switzerland, in January when the president chided Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon. Both banks have denied the claim.

The president's family business has also filed a civil lawsuit against Capital One (COF), alleging that the major bank and credit card lender debanked hundreds of its business accounts in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the US Capitol.

A Capital One spokesman told Yahoo Finance that it ""has not and does not close customer accounts for political reasons.""

Citigroup (C) has been snared in the new administration's political fights for a different reason.

The New York-based bank was sued by climate-focused nonprofit Climate United after it froze billions in federal grant money at the direct order of the Trump administration on Feb. 18. Citigroup is contracted as an administrator for some of the government's grant funding.

The Trump administration's EPA has halted $20 billion in grants to undergo a comprehensive review based on its concerns of ""programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with agency's priorities,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said last week.

""Citibank has ... only done its best to serve its customers while following instructions from the government of the United States, to whom Citibank owes a duty of loyalty and at whose direction Citibank is contractually obligated to act,"" the bank's lawyer wrote in a case court filing published last week.

Oops, something went wrong

Investors' uber bullish sentiment for US stocks came to a screeching halt over the past month.

Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey of 171 participants conducted in March showed the biggest monthly drop in investors' allocation to US equities on record, with the allocation falling 40% month-over-month. As recently as December, investors' allocation to US stocks had been at an all-time high.

A team of Bank of America strategists led by Michael Hartnett described the move in the March survey as a ""bull crash,"" with investor appetite for US stocks tumbling amid the 10% drawdown in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) over the past month. The rotation went into cash, per Bank of America's survey, not bonds.

The swift nature of the correction in the S&P 500 could be seen as a buy sign. But as Hartnett's team points out, the recent market moves are more a flushing out of uber bullishness rather than an obvious catalyst for a contrarian trade. For instance, investors' portfolio allocation to cash rose from 3.5% to 4.1%, the largest one month rise since December 2021. But still cash levels remain well below the more than 6% level seen in October 2022 when Wall Street's consensus call projected an incoming recession.

Hartnett wrote the current sentiment levels are nowhere near ""close-your-eyes-and-buy levels.""

And as Wall Street strategists have pointed out recently, part of the reason right now might not be an obvious ""buy the dip"" moment comes back to what sent stocks down in the first place.

A chart in BofA's survey shows 55% of respondents believe the biggest risk to markets is that the ""trade war triggers global recession."" This marked the highest conviction in a risk since the pandemic topped the list in April 2020.

But despite a roughly 3% pop in stocks over the past two sessions, not much has changed in the trade war or growth scare story over the past week.

Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson told clients on Sunday that ""a tradable rally"" is possible in markets. But Wilson doesn't see a sustainable rally to new record highs ""until the numerous growth headwinds are reversed"" or the Fed resumes interest rate cuts.

The next major test for the markets is set for Wednesday with the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision. With markets widely expecting the central bank to hold interest rates steady, investors will focus on any clues about when the central bank could cut rates again. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference is slated for 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

As markets attempt to recover from recent sell-off action that's left the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) in correction territory, one major catalyst this week could make or break a comeback: Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy decision.

The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady in the face of tariff uncertainties and recent growth concerns.

But the simultaneous release of the Fed's quarterly forecasts, otherwise known as the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-decision press conference, will be at the center of investor unpacking.

""Powell post-FOMC will have to reassure markets growth remains healthy and inflation's trajectory still points to 2% as confidence is wavering amid stagflation worries, or outright recession fears,"" Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.

A bleak economic scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, stagflation has become the latest buzzword in financial markets as investors attempt to understand the administration's shifting trade narrative and other policy unknowns, including recent efforts to cut government jobs from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

In a global survey of 171 participants, Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey, released Tuesday, showed 71% of surveyed investors expect stagflation, the highest level since November 2023.

Amid stagflation fears, recent surveys and sentiment indicators — often referred to as ""soft"" economic data — have been at the center of concerns, marking the return of ""bad news for the economy is bad news for stocks.""

Powell recently argued that sentiment readings ""have not been a good predictor of consumption growth in recent years."" He has also consistently stressed a wait-and-see approach to assessing the economic impact of policy changes.

But that hasn't stopped Wall Street from turning more cautious. In recent weeks, a number of firms — including JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) — have reduced their respective growth targets, referencing the anticipated effects of restrictive trade and immigration policies.

That's been followed by a handful of downward revisions for year-end S&P 500 targets, with RBC Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs, and Yardeni Research all lowering their respective calls over the past week.

""With regards to growth (the 'stag' part of stagflation), Powell will need to reconfirm his recently articulated certainty that the 'hard' data remains supportive, even as the 'soft' data is weak,"" Emanuel wrote.

On Monday, February's retail sales, considered a ""hard"" data point by economists, rose less than expected, while January's reading was revised lower as Americans pull back on discretionary spending.

But there were some encouraging signs within the details of the report, such as the large rebound in control group sales, which feeds directly into GDP.

Meanwhile, ""on the 'flation' part of stagflation,"" Emanuel wrote, ""Powell must indicate inflation remains on its path to 2%, even amidst potential near-term hurdles.""

Both consumer and producer inflation showed a deceleration in price growth over the month of February. But details under the surface pointed to a potential stalling out in reaching the Fed's 2% target.

""FOMC participants will have to rethink their projections now that the first tariffs have taken effect and the White House looks set to eventually impose larger tariffs than initially seemed likely,"" Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a Sunday note.

In December, the Fed projected interest rates to fall to 3.9% this year, suggesting two 25-basis-point cuts to come. Officials also saw core PCE inflation slowing to 2.5%, with the unemployment rate ticking up slightly to 4.3%. The economy was previously projected to grow at an annualized pace of 2.1%.

Goldman Sachs expects the Fed's 2025 median economic projections to show a 0.3 percentage point upward revision to core PCE inflation to 2.8% and a 0.3 percentage point downgrade to GDP growth to 1.8%, ""mainly reflecting the tariff news.""

Goldman Sachs' own forecasts see a steeper estimate for inflation and a more substantial dip for economic growth — projecting core PCE of 3% and GDP growth of 1.6% — ""but FOMC participants are likely to adjust a bit more cautiously until tariff policy becomes clearer.""

JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli agreed, noting that lower growth and higher inflation expectations ""present a quandary for the Fed, though we expect the median participant will still look for two cuts this year."" Markets are currently pricing in three cuts, according to Bloomberg data.

On Wednesday, Feroli expects Powell to stay consistent in mostly avoiding strong views on trade, immigration, and fiscal policies, adding, ""While market pricing for a May cut has been moving up lately, we think he will continue to say that the Fed doesn't need to be in a hurry.""

Oops, something went wrong

Nvidia (NVDA) stock slid as much as 3% Tuesday ahead of the AI chipmaker's annual GTC conference in California starting Tuesday.

CEO Jensen Huang is set to kick off the event with a keynote previewing what's ahead for the company. His commentary will likely be closely watched by investors evaluating whether the AI trade still has room to run.

Nvidia stock has experienced significant volatility in 2025. Shares started the year with a bang, hitting a record close above $149 in early January. They tumbled when a new AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek reignited concerns over an AI bubble and shaved nearly $600 billion from the chipmaker's market cap in a single day. In its most recent rout, following its fourth quarter earnings and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, Nvidia saw its market cap losses from its record close reach $1 trillion.

But Nvidia bull and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Tuesday that he believes the company's GTC event in San Jose, Calif., this week will be ""a wake-up moment for the tech bulls.""

Huang is expected to debut the company's upcoming Blackwell Ultra GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip), a successor to Nvidia's current-generation Blackwell AI chip, which the company said achieved full-scale production in the most recent quarter. Huang is also expected to preview Nvidia's Vera Rubin superchip, the next-gen version of its latest Grace Blackwell superchips.

Overall, tech stocks have led the stock market's recent downturn. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory on March 6, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) followed suit a week later, as Trump's tariffs and DOGE-driven cuts to federal jobs fueled concerns over inflation.

""We clearly need stable Trump policy and investors need to know the rules of the game ... but that will all happen over the coming months and we do not believe this dramatically changes the trajectory of the AI Revolution,"" wrote Ives, later adding, ""We believe this week's Nvidia GTC Conference will be a turning point for tech stocks as the Street starts to refocus on the AI Revolution and the massive tech spending ahead for the coming years.""

Ives wrote that he expects Huang to highlight Nvidia's ""lingering worries about DeepSeek, and also focus on the physical AI future with autonomous and robotics,"" among other topics.

Truist analyst Will Stein also stayed bullish on Nvidia ahead of GTC, reiterating his Buy rating and $205 price target on the stock in a note to investors Tuesday.

Stein acknowledged bearish arguments against the AI trade: ""The biggest investor concern (that was magnified by DeepSeek (private)) is that NVDA's customers are deploying too much AI compute capacity today, and that customers will subsequently enter a period of digestion, causing a cyclical downturn. To us, this dynamic is a certainty; the only question is on timing.""

He continued: ""The way NVDA might counter this narrative is to borrow a page from AVGO's [Broadcom's (AVGO)] playbook by highlighting customer 'commitments' to build large GPU clusters several years in the future [in other words, commitments to buying Nvidia's AI chips for the next few years].""

Stein continued: “We continue to view NVDA as *the* AI company. Its leadership position is owing less to the architecture, speed, or performance of its chips, and more to the results of its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive ongoing investment in software, training models, and services.""

As Nvidia's (NVDA) stock goes, so goes the broader market.

""The near-term future of this market, for lack of a better term, is dictated by what's going on at Nvidia and really in semiconductors and technology writ large, just by virtue of their size and by virtue of their importance,"" Evercore technical strategist Rich Ross told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below).

Ross has been studying market technicals for more than 30 years. In 2024, Institutional Investor ranked Ross No. 1 in his field for the seventh straight year. He was named to Institutional Investor's All-America Research team for the 10th year in a row.

In his view, it's no small surprise that as Nvidia's stock struggled this year, the stock market has followed suit.

The AI trade — led by Nvidia and its surging sales and profit story — has powered the stock market over the past two years. As that trade has broken down this year (seen mostly through ""Magnificent Seven"" weakness), given concerns ranging from a trade war to overvaluation, investors have questioned the broad stock market's strength and valuation.

Watch: What Bill Gates thinks about Nvidia

Ross explained, ""What's been driving that key AI theme [for markets] for Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO), is that it really has its tentacles in so many different sectors and across power generation, what have you. So there are a lot of stocks that have been touched with the brush of AI and Nvidia.""

Shares of the AI chip darling haven't worked this year, much to the surprise of the bulls who have minted money off Nvidia over the past five years. The stock is off by 10% as investors fret over exposure to China in President Trump's trade war and the possible overbuilding of AI infrastructure. The company's cautious first quarter margin outlook did little to ease worries.

The stock is below its key 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving average, a major sign of lost momentum among traders.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) — which includes a more than 6% weighting to Nvidia — is down by 5% this year.

That makes Nvidia's annual ""Woodstock of AI"" a must-watch for the bulls.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has it within his power to get the year back on track for his stock and the market overall today at the company's GTC event and in a financial analyst meeting on Wednesday. The event is being held in San Jose, Calif.

Read more: How does Nvidia make money?

Huang will have to deliver on several fronts at the event, experts say.

First, he must provide intricate details on how much more powerful Nvidia's next-generation chip Rubin is than the current gold standard in Blackwell.

Second, an update on the total AI addressable market opportunity for Nvidia is important, as investors have worried about AI infrastructure overbuilding. This update could be crucial to jump-starting the AI trade.

And third, Huang would be wise to share offsets in the business for its China operations that are likely to be harmed by the Trump administration's trade war.

 

""Bottom line, the team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem (4M CUDA software developers) and the team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time,"" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote ahead of GTC.

Sur has an Overweight rating (Buy equivalent) on Nvidia shares and a $170 price target. The price target estimates 41% upside for Nvidia's stock from current levels. It's also relatively in line with the average sell-side analyst price target on Nvidia, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Investors are hearing a lot these days from Trump economic officials about trade and DOGE and the benefits of falling stock prices — but not as much about things that could stop the selling, such as the push for tax cuts.

That's in part because tariff talk is perhaps drowning out everything else for markets but also because the slow pace of Capitol Hill tax talks has offered Trump's team very little in the way of news to share.

A recent example of the dynamic came over the weekend when Trump's top tax evangelist, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, appeared on NBC's Meet the Press but only directly brought up tax cuts once in the 11-minute conversation.

""Corrections are healthy,"" he offered instead, referring to recent market losses.

Bessent only mentioned tax cuts briefly to say that tax changes would be felt by markets ""over the long term"" alongside other more market-friendly ideas like increased energy production and deregulation.

It's a dynamic likely to continue in the foreseeable future, with lawmakers currently out of Washington for recess as tariff speculation mounts ahead of a key April 2 deadline and Elon Musk's DOGE effort as prominent as ever.

That left Bessent, for this weekend at least, spending time focused not on tax cuts but on trying to convince taxpayers that Elon Musk's DOGE cuts at the IRS wouldn't hurt the coming tax filing season.

The president's louder message about tariffs when compared with taxes was also touched on by Evercore ISI's Sarah Bianchi in a recent research note.

She wrote that Trump has put forth an array of troubling policies for markets to kick off his administration but ""perhaps more troubling is the erratic nature of policy implementation, making risk assessment and pricing exceedingly difficult.""

As for the question of whether Trump will soon pivot to taxes to calm markets, she said ""even this isn't a clean story,"" adding that ""some of these efforts will simply take time, and the outcomes will be uneven across sectors.""

The slow pace of talks on Capitol Hill has also contributed to a larger downplaying of tax cuts for now.

Some have sought to cast last week's shutdown drama as a sign that Republicans may be able to unite behind a tax bill after House Speaker Mike Johnson corralled his caucus to unify and force Democrats' hand even as much more complicated tax issues loom.

That debate ground on last week — with the House Ways and Means Committee gathering to try and move closer to a deal — but headlines were of course dominated by Trump tariffs and threats that often changed by the hour.

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

Henrietta Treyz, the director of economic policy at Veda Partners, also said in a recent Yahoo Finance appearance that markets have been downplaying the fact that ""there are no tax cuts, there is an extension of the status quo.""

She is pointing out that the main tax change under debate is to extend the current rates that were implemented in the Trump-signed 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but are set to expire at the end of this year.

And even that change is expected to be a heavy lift.

Trump and House Republicans have promised an array of additional tax provisions and are increasingly considering an accounting maneuver that could make the cuts look like zero. But Treyz said the embrace of that maneuver — known as a so-called current policy baseline — represents a double-edged sword, as it ""is de facto an admission that the bill they're working on is not a tax cut.""

The uncertainty on the tax front also comes as the Trump team has offered a scattered message on many fronts, with even Trump's market-friendly aides such as Bessent offering a full embrace of tariffs.

The contrast between Bessent's interview this weekend and earlier moments like his confirmation hearing is stark. During that hearing, Bessent called tax cuts the most important issue before him and described getting them done as ""pass-fail.""

Instead, markets are much more likely to hear things like rhetoric used by Trump ally Chris Lacivita, who recently called those worried about stock losses ""bed wetters.""

In a recent podcast appearance, Trump's former co-campaign manager pointed out that the president just got through a campaign that featured assassination attempts and criminal prosecutions, saying, ""Anybody with the stomach to endure all that ... shouldn't be underestimated in his capacity to handle some ups and downs in the stock market.""

Something went wrong

The FTSE 100 and European stocks ticked upwards on Tuesday, while US stocks retreated, as tensions flare again in the Middle East and traders look to central bank meetings later in the week.

On Tuesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said that more than 400 people were killed overnight in air strikes by Israeli forces.

The strikes end a ceasefire which came into effect on 19 January and after talks to extend the ceasefire failed to reach an agreement.

Commodity-related stocks, oil prices and gold rallied in response.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.2% by the closing bell in London. Among top gainers were miners Antofagasta (ANTO.L) as well as oil major BP (BP.L).

Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.8%, as the country's ZEW economic survey beat expectations.

The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris ticked up 0.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) rose 0.5%.

US stocks fell, as traders look to the two-day Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting, which commences today. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee also meets this week, with announcements on the rate path due on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.7% and 1%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 1.6% lower.

Uncertainty still dogs markets as investors debate whether the sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 into correction territory is over. Many on Wall Street don't think the recent bump in stocks signals a clear bottom, amid concerns that president Donald Trump's trade war will hit already weakening economic growth.

Shares in chipmaker Intel rose 2.2% on Monday, after a near-7% bump on Monday, as Lip-Bu Tan prepares to take on the role of CEO.

The stock surged last week after it was announced that chip industry veteran Tan, who has previous served on Intel's board, was taking the helm. Tan is taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. The duo succeeded former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by Intel's board in late 2024.

Reuters reported on Monday that Tan has considered major changes to Intel's chip manufacturing methods and its AI strategy in a bid to turnaround the struggling technology giant.

At a town hall last week, Tan reportedly told employees that Intel would need to make some ""tough decisions"".

Last year, Intel posted an annual loss of $19bn, which marked its first since 1986, according to Reuters.

Here's Reuters with the info:

Shares in electric vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) fell 4.8% on Monday, with the stock now down 41% since the start of the year.

Shares have halved in value, as of Monday's closing price of $238, since hitting an all-time high closing price of $479.86 in December on the back of US president Donald Trump's election win.

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has faced increasing backlash over his involvement with the Trump administration, heading up the the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His cost-cutting initiative across federal agencies, seeing mass layoffs, has sparked protests at Tesla dealerships across the US.

Meanwhile, data released last month has shown falling sales in Tesla (TSLA) in Europe, where Musk has also made high-profile inventions in politics.

The Financial Times reported on Tuesday, that short sellers had made $16bn in profit from betting against Tesla (TSLA) shares.

Tesla shares were down nearly 1% in pre-market trading on Monday, which came as Chinese EV maker BYD (002594.SZ) unveiled a new ultra-fast five-minute charging system.

The pound is higher against the dollar in early European trading, touching $1.30, a level it had not breached since November.

The uptick is largely attributed to a weaker dollar, which has come under pressure in recent weeks. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is down almost 6% from a two-year peak set in mid-January amid worries that Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries could push the US economy into a recession.

Volatility around sterling is expected this week, particularly with the Bank of England's upcoming policy meeting on Thursday. Investors will be keenly watching for any indications on interest rates, with expectations that the central bank will keep rates unchanged at 4.5%.

Meanwhile, sterling was lower against the euro (GBPEUR=X) on Tuesday morning, at €1.1870.

Trustpilot is rallying in early trade in London, up around 1% as of the time of writing.

Pedro Goncalves writes:

The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.5% on Thursday, as it navigates the fallout from US president Donald Trump's trade war and mixed signals from the UK economy.

Since August last year, the BoE has been gradually reducing borrowing costs, offering some relief to mortgage holders. At its February meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 in favour of a rate cut to 4.5%.

However, governor Andrew Bailey has stressed the importance of a “gradual and careful approach” to further rate cuts.

Markets indicate a 95% chance of a rate hold this month, with a 77% probability of a cut at the MPC's May meeting and a 55.6% likelihood of a reduction in August. This marks a significant shift from January, when traders only expected one rate cut for the year, in February, according to Morningstar.

In a yearly update to the basket of items the Office for National Statistics (ONS) uses to calculate UK price rises, pulled pork, virtual reality headsets and yoga mats have been added to the calculation, while local newspaper adverts and DVD rental prices have been taken out.

The virtual basket contains over 700 carefully selected items representative of the goods and services that consumers typically spend their money on.

The inflation basket is updated once a year by the ONS to take account of the changing tastes and habits of UK consumers and to ensure the official yardstick of the cost of living is as accurate as possible. This year, VR headsets make their way into the basket for the first time.

""As a rapidly emerging technology, we have seen growing expenditure on this item, which is expected to continue,"" the ONS said.

China announced a plan to ""boost consumption"" over the weekend. Neil Wilson, analyst at TipRanks, breaks it down:

Nvidia stock futures are currently up around 0.7% ahead of the GTC.

Our US team writes:

Nvidia (NVDA) kicks off its annual GTC conference on March 18 with a keynote by CEO Jensen Huang from the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. The event, which runs through March 21, will feature workshops and training for developers and engineers, panels and discussions related to AI and robotics, and exhibits from companies showing off how they're using Nvidia's products in the real world.

Huang is expected to debut the company's latest flagship AI chip: the Blackwell Ultra. A souped-up version of Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip, Blackwell Ultra should get a performance boost over last year's chip to further speed up training and running AI models.

We should also learn more about Nvidia's next-generation GPU platform, dubbed Rubin, and the successor to its Grace line of CPUs, Vera. The combined superchip will be called Vera Rubin, named for the American astronomer, and will take the place of the current Grace Blackwell superchip at the top of Nvidia's hierarchy of AI processors.

During Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call, Huang teased that he'd also discuss the follow-up to Rubin. Nvidia, like most chip companies, is known for providing a broad look at its roadmap to help customers and developers prepare for their upcoming products.

Digital assets have tumbled over the past month as investors fret about President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Donald Trump's ties to the crypto world might get even deeper if reported talks with Binance lead to a working relationship with the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Cryptocurrency experienced significant volatility recently, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) rising past $100,000 in December, only to fall back to $76,000, and now trading around $83,000. Tyrone Ross, principal and founder of 401 Financial, joins Catalysts host Madison Mills to discuss the importance of long-term investing and the role of regulation in shaping the future of the crypto market.

Donald Trump and Elon Musk haven't always gotten along, but now the two powerful men are close political allies and frequently spend time together.

Not every financial institution is ready to go full bore into crypto.

 Bitcoin price is in a tug-o-war between the bulls and bears ahead of the FOMC, with big overhead resistance at $85,000 in place and several key support levels below. 

Bitcoin's (BTC) price failed another attempt at breaking above resistance at $85,000 on March 17. Since March 12, BTC price formed daily candle highs between $84,000 and $85,200, but has been unable to close above $84,600.

Bitcoin remains in “no man's land” on the lower time frame (LTF) of the 1-hour chart. This term in trading markets is defined as a price range where movements are characterized by uncertainty, significant risk, and dynamic tension due to external events and conflicting market sentiment.

With the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting set to take place on March 18-19, markets could see volatile price swings toward key BTC price levels over the next few days. The critical announcement on the interest rate will be made on March 19 at 2 pm ET.

According to CME's FedWatch tool, there is a 99% chance that the current interest rates will remain between 4.25% and 4.50%, leaving just a 1% probability of a 0.25% rate cut.

However, a common market belief is that any bearish price action from unchanged interest rates is already priced in.

Therefore, the market is focused on Jerome Powell, the US Fed chair's speech during the FOMC speech. With respect to the recent data, Powell's stance is likely to be hawkish. The assessment is based on the following points:

Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains at 2.8%, which is still above the Fed's 2% primary target and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index stood at 2.5%-2.6%. While CPI came in lower than expected last week, it does not encourage immediate rate cuts.

Unemployment data remains low at 4.1%, with an annual GDP growth of 2.3% in Q4 2024, indicating the economy does not need immediate stimulus.

Meanwhile, Polymarket now says there's a 100% chance that the US Federal Reserve will conclude quantitative tightening (QT) by April 30, which would boost the odds of a rate cut as early as this summer. 

Bitcoin must flip the $85,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs at $90,000. 

For this to happen, BTC/USD must first regain its position above the 200-day exponential moving average (orange line) on the 1-day chart. BTC price dropped below the 200-day EMA on March 9 for the first time since August 2024.

One positive catalyst for the bulls could be renewed demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs. On March 17, Bitcoin ETFs registered $274 million in inflows, the largest since Feb. 4.

The bears, meanwhile, will attempt to keep $85,000 resistance in place, increasing the likelihood of new lows under $78,000. The immediate target below previous range lows lies at $74,000, i.e., the previous all-time high from early 2024.

Below $74,000, the next key area of interest remains between $70,530 and $66,810, with a daily order block. Reaching $69,272 would be a retest of the US election day price, erasing all of the “Trump pump” gains. 

SuperBitcoinBro, an anonymous BTC analyst, highlights that the “worst case” scenario for Bitcoin lies at $71,300 and $73,800, which can be a potential support in every timeframe from daily to quarterly.

Similarly, Nebraskangooner, another popular Bitcoin analyst, says that the FOMC is a wildcard, explaining that BTC must reclaim $86,250 to confirm the bullish scenario on the lower time frame.

 Microsoft's Incident Response Team says bad actors could use StilachiRAT to steal credentials stored in the Google Chrome browser. 

Tech giant Microsoft has discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT) that targets crypto held in 20 cryptocurrency wallet extensions for the Google Chrome browser. 

Microsoft's Incident Response Team said in a March 17 blog post that it first discovered the malware StilachiRAT last November and found it can steal information such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information and data stored in the clipboard. 

After deployment, the bad actors can use StilachiRAT to siphon crypto wallet data by scanning device settings to see if any of the 20 crypto wallet extensions are installed, including Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, MetaMask and OKX Wallet.

“Analysis of the StilachiRAT's WWStartupCtrl64.dll module that contains the RAT capabilities revealed the use of various methods to steal information from the target system,” Microsoft said. 

Among its other capabilities, the malware can extract credentials saved in the Google Chrome local state file and monitor clipboard activity for sensitive information like passwords and crypto keys. 

It can also use detection evasion and anti-forensics features, like the ability to clear event logs and check for signs it's running in a sandbox to block analysis attempts, according to Microsoft.

At the moment, the tech giant says it can't pinpoint who is behind the malware but hopes that publicly sharing information will lower the number of people who might be snared.

“Based on Microsoft's current visibility, the malware does not exhibit widespread distribution at this time,” Microsoft said. 

Microsoft suggests to avoid falling prey to malware; users should have antivirus software, cloud-based anti-phishing and anti-malware components on their devices. 

Losses to crypto scams, exploits and hacks totaled nearly $1.53 billion in February, with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack accounting for the lion's share of losses, according to blockchain security firm CertiK.

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its 2025 Crypto Crime Report that crypto crime has entered a professionalized era dominated by AI-driven scams, stablecoin laundering, and efficient cyber syndicates, with the past year witnessing $51 billion in illicit transaction volume.

 Coinbase stock may see an an over 64% rally from the current $188 mark, if Bernstein's prediction plays out. 

Coinbase exchange's stock price has received an optimistic price prediction from a Bernstein analyst, citing improving crypto regulatory clarity in the world's largest economy.

Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at global asset management firm Bernstein, initiated coverage of Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) stock with an outperform rating and a price target of over $310.

The analyst expects improving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, driven by US President Donald Trump's administration, which intends to make crypto policy a national priority and make the US a global hub for blockchain innovation, according to a Bernstein research note seen by Tipranks.

Coinbase is set to benefit from crypto's “ascendancy to the US financial mainstream” amid improving regulations, mainly due to the firm offering a one-stop platform for numerous crypto activities, wrote the research note, adding:

“COIN offers an exchange, broker/dealer, institutional prime desk, stablecoin banking, crypto payments, custodian bank, software and blockchain ecosystem services, all combined into a full stack ‘Amazon' of crypto financial services,” added the report.

Crypto regulation is heading in a positive direction, with some analysts seeing the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin's integration into the global financial system.

“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

While Trump has previously highlighted his intentions to bolster crypto innovation in the US, issuing regulatory frameworks takes time and setting the “right regulatory tone” will be crucial for the administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum — a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

 Strategy said it would use the net proceeds for its working capital and acquisition of Bitcoin. 

Business intelligence firm and Bitcoin investor Strategy plans to offer 5 million shares of the company's Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock and use the proceeds to purchase more Bitcoin. 

In an announcement, the company said it intends to use the proceeds for general purposes. This includes its working capital and “acquisition of Bitcoin.” However, the company said this is still subject to market and other conditions. 

According to Strategy, the stock will accumulate cumulative dividends at 10% annually. The company also noted that stockholders would receive dividends on the stock quarterly, starting on June 30, 2025. 

Strategy said it could buy back all of this stock for cash if the total number of shares left in the market drops below 25% of the issued amount. 

The announcement follows the company's smallest known Bitcoin purchase. On March 17, the company announced that it purchased 130 Bitcoin (BTC) for $10.7 million in cash, at an average price of about $82,981 per BTC.

The most recent BTC buy is the company's smallest amount since its first Bitcoin investment in August 2020. Before the latest purchase, the least amount of BTC bought by Strategy was a 169-Bitcoin purchase made in August 2024. 

Strategy's smallest BTC purchase comes amid sentiments that the Bitcoin bull cycle is over. On March 18, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju said the bull cycle is over and that he's expecting 6 to 12 months of bearish or sideways price action.

Since its first Bitcoin investment, the company and its subsidiaries have accumulated 499,226 BTC at an aggregate purchase price of $33.1 billion. The coins were bought at an average price of $66,360 per BTC, including fees and expenses.

If the company buys 774 BTC (about $64 million), its total holdings will reach 500,000. This would be 2.38% of the entire Bitcoin supply.

 DOGE's extremely oversold conditions hint at price reversals akin to its 400% price boom in 2024. 

Dogecoin (DOGE) price has crashed by over 70% after hitting $0.48 in December 2024. Interestingly, the memecoin's richest holders have accumulated during the price declines, indicating their confidence in a potential rebound in the coming weeks.

Onchain data from Santiment shows that wallets holding at least 1 million DOGE have increased by 1.24% since early February, despite declining prices. Meanwhile, active addresses have surged to a four-month high, suggesting rising network activity.

Typically, when large holders accumulate an asset while prices decline, it signals that they see undervaluation and are positioning for a future rebound. 

An increase in active addresses indicates higher engagement on the network—possibly reflecting growing retail interest.

If this surge in user activity stems from real adoption rather than speculative trading or panic selling, it could provide the onchain foundation needed for a price recovery. A similar pattern was observed during the DOGE's 200%-plus price rally in November.

Dogecoin is currently testing a support confluence comprising a multi-year ascending trendline support, a level that has historically triggered strong bullish reversals and the 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA) at around $0.13.

DOGE/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView

Additionally, the Stochastic RSI, an indicator measuring momentum and overbought/oversold conditions, shows a bullish cross in the oversold region (below the 0.30 reading).

This signal typically indicates that selling pressure is weakening. In DOGE's case, this crossover at low levels has preceded strong price recoveries, notably a 400% price rally in 2024 and 88% gains in 2023.

However, if DOGE fails to hold the support confluence, the bullish setup could be invalidated, leading to a deeper correction toward $0.12, which served as support in the March-May 2024 period.

 Cointelegraph Research explores how Elastos leverages Bitcoin's security to support decentralized finance through trustless crosschain solutions. 



The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape continues to evolve, and Bitcoin-centric solutions are gaining momentum. BTCFi is an emerging sector that transforms Bitcoin (BTC) from a passive store of value into an actively utilized asset in DeFi. 

A new report by Cointelegraph Research and Elastos delves into how Bitcoin's security helps to create trustless, scalable financial ecosystems.

DeFi has traditionally been dominated by Ethereum, which accounts for over 50% of the sector's total $175 billion total value locked (TVL). However, Bitcoin's strong security and liquidity make it an attractive foundation for DeFi innovation.



Despite its strengths, Bitcoin's lack of native smart contract functionality has historically limited its role in decentralized finance. The emergence of Bitcoin-centric DeFi solutions aims to bridge this gap and enable Bitcoin holders to participate in lending, stablecoin issuance and crosschain interoperability without custodial risks.

Elastos stands out as one of the leading players in this evolution by incorporating merged mining, a method that allows secondary blockchains to inherit Bitcoin's security. 

Because approximately 50% of Bitcoin's total 800 EH/s hashrate secures Elastos, the platform is positioned as one of the most computationally robust Bitcoin-linked networks. This ensures that financial applications built on Elastos maintain a level of security akin to that of Bitcoin itself.

At the core of Elastos' infrastructure is its Elastic Consensus model, a hybrid mechanism that integrates auxiliary proof-of-work, bonded proof-of-stake, and proof-of-integrity. 

This multi-layered approach enables Elastos to provide secure, scalable financial services and enhances its appeal for DeFi applications. The Elastos Smart Chain, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible sidechain, facilitates the development of decentralized applications (DApps) to ensure seamless integration with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

A major highlight of the report is the BeL2 Arbiter Network, designed to bring trustless Bitcoin transactions into DeFi. BeL2 leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify Bitcoin transactions on the Elastos and Ethereum networks without relying on centralized custodians. 

This mechanism allows Bitcoin to be used in DeFi protocols without synthetic assets or intermediaries and addresses a long-standing challenge in BTCFi.

This model has already attracted institutional interest. An initiative led by students and alumni of Harvard University is developing a BTC-backed stablecoin using BeL2. The platform also supports decentralized lending that allows Bitcoin holders to collateralize loans in stablecoins while retaining exposure to BTC's price appreciation.

Elastos' BTCFi approach competes with established Bitcoin DeFi solutions such as Stacks and Rootstock. Stacks primarily benefits from Bitcoin finality, and Rootstock focuses on EVM compatibility, while Elastos distinguishes itself by combining high security (via merged mining) and crosschain interoperability. This positions Elastos as a formidable player in the BTCFi landscape.



However, the report also identifies some challenges, such as regulatory uncertainties, ecosystem awareness and some technical complexities. Despite these hurdles, Elastos' combination of Bitcoin security, trustless smart contract execution and institutional backing positions it for potential growth in the evolving BTCFi sector.

As the blockchain industry shifts toward crosschain interoperability and decentralized governance, Bitcoin-secured assets are expected to play an important role in reshaping both traditional and decentralized finance.

Elastos' innovations, particularly through BeL2 and its decentralized identity (DID) framework, aim to enhance the security, scalability and institutional adoption of Bitcoin in DeFi. 

With Bitcoin-secured finance projected to expand significantly, Elastos' infrastructure provides a robust foundation for the next wave of decentralized financial applications.

 Metaplanet has issued around 44 million common shares to fund its BTC purchases, a strategy that has attracted investor interest. 

Metaplanet, a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company, has purchased an additional 150 Bitcoin (BTC), bringing it one step closer to its plan of acquiring 21,000 BTC by 2026. The March 18 purchase cost an aggregate 1.88 billion yen ($12.6 million) or $83,671 per Bitcoin.

The purchase brings Metaplanet's total holdings to 3,200 BTC worth $261.8 million at this time of writing. Despite this latest buy, Metaplanet's stock price has fallen 0.5% on the day. On March 5, the company's stock price jumped 19% after it announced its latest Bitcoin buy of 497 coins.

To date, Metaplanet has issued a little over 44 million common shares of company stock to fund its Bitcoin purchases. The use of stocks to raise money to buy Bitcoin has given the company the nickname “Asia's MicroStrategy,” as the formula follows similar actions from Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy).

Metaplanet's BTC yield, a key performance indicator that shows the percentage change of total BTC holdings compared to fully diluted shares outstanding, is 60.8% for the ongoing quarter from Jan. 1, 2025, to March 18, 2025. That is a smaller change than the previous quarter, which saw a yield of 310%.

Metaplanet's March 18 Bitcoin purchase makes it the 11th-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the largest in Asia, according to data from Bitgo.

After Metaplanet announced its plan to become a Bitcoin treasury company, its stock price rose 4,800% as of Feb. 10. Although its stock price has fallen 34% to 4,030 yen ($26.9) since Feb. 19, it is still well above the 150 yen ($1) that it registered on March 19, 2024.

According to a company presentation, Metaplanet's shareholder base grew 500% in 2024, with 50,000 people or entities investing in the company. Its market capitalization has increased 9,652% in one year, according to data from Stock Analysis.

Metaplanet's rise comes as Japan has shown a softening stance toward digital assets. On March 6, the country's ruling party moved to reduce crypto capital gains taxes by 20%. In November 2024, the government passed a stimulus package, committing to crypto tax reform.

Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada has asked the government to consider creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and convert part of its foreign exchange reserve into BTC. 

However, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later responded, saying the Japanese government didn't know enough about other countries' plans, which made it difficult for the government to express its views on the subject.

 Canary Capital has filed for an ETF tracking Sui after registering a trust in Delaware for the fund earlier this month. 

Canary Capital has filed its sixth proposed crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) with US regulators, this time for one tracking the spot price of the crypto token Sui.

In a March 17 Form S-1 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto investment firm requested to list the Canary SUI ETF, which didn't include information on what exchange it would trade on or the proposed ticker symbol.

The ETF would directly hold Sui (SUI), the native token of the layer-1 blockchain used for fees and staking, which is the 23rd largest cryptocurrency with a market value of around $7.36 billion, per CoinGekco.

Sui is trading up 1.3% over the last day to $2.31 and has gained 7.3% over the week. It has, however, fallen 56.5% from its Jan. 5 all-time peak of $5.35.

Canary had registered a trust in Delaware on March 6 for the fund, and it must also file a Form 19b-4 with the SEC before the agency can consider whether to list it for trading.

Canary's Sui filing is its sixth crypto ETF bid with the SEC. In the past few months, it filed for ETFs tracking Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), XRP (XRP), Hedera (HBAR) and Axelar (AXL).

The filing comes after Sui said on March 6 that it partnered with World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by US President Donald Trump.

Part of the partnership saw World Liberty include the Sui token in its so-called “Macro Strategy” token reserve and explore further product opportunities together.

Trump has promised to relax regulatory enforcement against crypto, which has sparked a flurry of crypto ETF filings amid optimism that the SEC under his administration will move to greenlight them.

The SEC has delayed making decisions on multiple crypto ETF filings, but Commissioner Hester Peirce said last month that the agency would wait until the Senate confirms Trump's pick to chair the SEC, Paul Atkins, before deciding on an agenda for crypto.

A Senate confirmation hearing for Atkins is reportedly slated for March 27, having been delayed due to issues with financial disclosures.

 Available to pre-approved customers, Xapo Bank's Bitcoin USD loans target long-term hodlers who can now access loans of up to $1 million. 

Xapo Bank, a global cryptocurrency-friendly bank headquartered in Gibraltar, is betting on crypto lending revival by launching Bitcoin-backed US dollar loans.

Qualifying Xapo Bank clients can now access Bitcoin (BTC) loans of up to $1 million, the firm said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on March 18.

The new lending product is designed for long-term Bitcoin hodlers who want to access cash while keeping their BTC, Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca told Cointelegraph.

“Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin is an ideal form of collateral — it is borderless, highly liquid, available 24/7, and easily divisible, making it uniquely suited for lending,” Rocca said.

A key distinction of Xapo's Bitcoin loan product is that the bank does not rehypothecate the loan collateral by users, meaning that its lending mechanism does not involve the re-usage of BTC assets by clients.

Instead, the Bitcoin collateral is stored in Xapo's BTC vault using institutional multiparty computation (MPC) custody.

Working of a crypto lending platform.

Eligible Xapo clients can choose repayment schedules of 30, 90, 180 or 365 days, with no penalties for early repayment, the firm said.

Xapo's new Bitcoin lending offering will be available to pre-approved members based on several criteria.

The key criteria for eligibility are the amount of Bitcoin holdings and the period of holdings, as Xapo specifically targets long-term BTC holders with a long-term investment strategy.

According to the bank, the offering will be available to global investors in regions like Europe and Asia, excluding residents of the United States.

Xapo Bank is regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission under the Financial Services Act 2019. In 2024, the bank successfully passported its banking license in the United Kingdom, granting its Xapo Bank App full access to the country.

While Xapo's lending is offered across the European Union, crypto lending is not covered by local regulations like the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework.

Xapo Bank's new BTC loan launch comes a few years after the crypto lending industry suffered a major crisis in 2022.

The crisis came amid the historic Terra crash and a subsequent bear market that triggered the collapses of major lending providers like Celsius and BlockFi.

“The collapse of Celsius, BlockFi, and other centralized lenders significantly eroded trust in the crypto lending space,” Xapo Bank CEO told Cointelegraph.

“Borrowers today exercise greater caution, prioritizing platforms with a proven track record in Bitcoin custody and those that offer secure, transparent solutions — especially ones that do not engage in rehypothecation,” Rocca said, adding:

In addition to removing asset rehypothecation and MPC security, Xapo offers risk management tools and proactive protection to prevent automatic liquidations.

“In the event of a Bitcoin price drop, customers receive instant notifications, allowing them to either top up their collateral or make partial repayments to maintain their loan status,” Rocca noted.

Xapo is not the only firm that has been working to introduce lending products in 2025. In early March, Bitcoin developer Blockstream secured a multibillion-dollar investment to launch three new institutional funds, with two of them offering BTC lending.

 Despite recent volatility in crypto and traditional markets, “long-term innovation wins,” Wood said as she doubled down on ARK's long-term bets. 

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes the White House is underestimating the recession risk facing the US economy stemming from US President Donald Trump's tariff policies — an oversight that will eventually force the president and Federal Reserve to enact pro-growth policies.

Speaking virtually at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 18, Wood said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent isn't worried about a recession. 

However, Wood said, “We are worried about a recession,” adding, “We think the velocity of money is slowing down dramatically.”

A slowdown in the velocity of money means capital is changing hands less frequently, which is typically associated with a recession, as consumers and businesses spend and invest less money. 

“I think what's happening, though, is that if we do have a recession, declining GDP, that this is going to give the president and the Fed many more degrees of freedom to do what they want in terms of tax cuts and monetary policy,” said Wood. 

Investors believe the first domino could fall in the coming months when the Fed puts an end to its quantitative tightening program — something bettors on Polymarket believe is 100% certain to happen before May.

Meanwhile, expectations for multiple rate cuts by the Fed in the second half of the year are growing, according to CME Group's Fed Fund futures prices.

The probability of rates being lower than they are now by the Fed's June 18 meeting is nearly 65%. Source: CME Group

ARK and Cathie Wood have been active cryptocurrency investors for many years. ARK and 21Shares' spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) was approved on Jan. 11, 2024, and currently has more than $3.9 billion in net assets, according to Yahoo Finance data.

ARK also offers crypto portfolio solutions to wealth managers through its partnership with Eaglebrook Advisors. 

Wood told the New York Digital Asset Summit that “long-term innovation wins as we go through these trials and tribulations,” referring to the recent market correction. 

When asked if crypto assets remain an “investable arc” over the long term, Wood said this strategy was the cornerstone of ARK's investment approach. 

“[W]e've built out positions in more than just the big three,” she said, referring to Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).

This long-term arc is being supported by favorable regulations, which have improved the investment landscape dramatically. 

Pro-crypto policy changes are “giving institutions the green light, and if you look at our studies as long ago as 2016, we wrote a paper called ‘Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class,' and, yet many institutions just dismissed it out of hand,” said Wood.

Now, institutions are looking at ARK's studies and saying they “have a fiduciary responsibility to expose [their] clients to a new asset class.”

 US President Donald Trump's SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins, is inching closer toward becoming the SEC's new leader, with a Senate hearing reportedly planned for March 27. 

Paul Atkins may be one step closer to becoming the new crypto-friendly chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with a Senate committee hearing reportedly set for March 27.

President Donald Trump nominated Atkins to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, but his marriage into a billionaire family has reportedly caused headaches with financial disclosures — delaying his potential start date.

While it isn't clear whether the White House has produced those papers to the Senate, Senate Banking, House and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott is reportedly eyeing a March 27 hearing to review Atkins' standing, Semafor's Eleanor Mueller said in a March 17 X post.

Atkins would, however, need to be voted in by the Senate at a later date. Mueller also said the Senate banking committee is also planning to hold a bipartisan meeting on Atkins' nomination on March 21.

It follows an earlier March 3 Semafor report, where Mueller said financial disclosures had held Atkins back from scheduling a Senate hearing to review his standing.

He married Sarah Humphreys Atkins in 1990 — whose family is tied to TAMKO Building Products LLC — a manufacturer of residential roofing shingles that reportedly turned over $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023, Forbes said on Dec. 14, 2024.

“It's a lot to go through,” one former Senate Banking Committee staffer reportedly told Mueller on March 3.

Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008 and worked as a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP in New York before that. He is expected to regulate the crypto arena with a more collaborative approach than former SEC Chair Gary Gensler.It's been almost four months since Atkins was chosen by Trump to lead the SEC on Dec. 4, and over two months since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20.

A late start for an SEC chair wouldn't be too unusual, however.

The two most recent SEC chairs, Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, started on April 17, 2021, and May 4, 2017 — months after presidential transitions occurred in those years.

Meanwhile, Mark Uyeda has been serving as the SEC's acting chair since Gensler left on Jan. 20.

Since then, the Uyeda-led SEC has established a Crypto Task Force led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets.

The SEC has dropped several investigations and lawsuits that the Gensler-led commission filed against the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap and OpenSea over the last month.The SEC is also looking to abandon a rule requiring crypto firms to register as exchanges and may even axe the Biden administration's proposed crypto custody rules, Uyeda said on March 17.

 A crypto analyst says that the massive Bitcoin open interest reset may present good opportunities in the near term if history repeats itself. 

Bitcoin's nearly $12 billion open interest shakeout earlier this month might be just the catalyst needed for the asset to regain its upward momentum, according to a crypto analyst.

“This can be considered as a natural market reset, an essential phase for sustaining a bullish continuation,” CryptoQuant contributor DarkFost said in a March 17 markets report.

“Looking at historical trends, each past deleveraging like this has provided good opportunities for the short to medium term,” the analyst said.

CoinGlass data shows that on Feb. 20, Bitcoin's (BTC) open interest (OI) — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled Bitcoin derivative contracts such as options and futures — stood at $61.42 billion before dropping 19% to $49.71 billion by March 4.

It came amid volatile price swings due to uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's imposed tariffs and the future of US interest rates.

“Following the recent panic triggered by political instability linked to Trump's decisions, we witnessed a massive liquidation of leveraged positions on Bitcoin,” DarkFost said.

Bitcoin's price fell below two crucial price levels during the two-week period, bringing it closer to the levels seen in the days after Trump's election win in November. 

Feb. 25 saw Bitcoin's price retrace below $90,000, and just two days later, on Feb. 27, Bitcoin dropped below $80,000 for the first time since November. It's now trading at $83,400, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee recently told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin hovering in the low $80,000s, its price and OI could see more volatility if the March 19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting delivers any surprises.

“The market largely expects the Fed to hold rates steady, but any unexpected hawkish signals could put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets,” he added.

Markets are currently pricing in a 99% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin OI is sitting at $49.02 billion, representing an approximate 6.5% increase over the past five days.

 ARK Invest participated in Apptronik's $403 million Series A round, joining Mercedes-Benz, Google, and Japan Post Capital to fund humanoid robotics innovation. 

Cryptocurrency-friendly investment firm ARK Invest has joined a massive Series A funding round for Apptronik, a Texas-based firm building humanoid robots.

Apptronik, on March 18, announced the successful close of an oversubscribed $403M Series A funding round, adding another $53 million to the $350 million round disclosed in February.

After investing in Apptronik's Series A round, ARK has enabled investors to access the company through its ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX), which focuses on “disruptive innovation.”

“After investing in their Series A round, the ARK Venture Fund is proud to offer investors access to Apptronik! Download SoFi and gain access today,” ARK wrote in an X post on Tuesday.

Led by California-based B Capital and Texas-based Capital Factory, the original $350 million Series A raise also featured participation from tech mogul Google.

The latest raise included new investors such as the German automotive giant Mercedes-Benz, early-stage tech investor Japan Post Capital and RyderVentures, a corporate venture capital arm of Ryder System, as well as a syndicate led by Korea Investment Partners.

Apptronik's oversubscribed raise reflects strong market demand and investor confidence in the transformative power of embodied artificial intelligence, or integration of AI into physical systems.

Founded in 2016, Apptronik is a robotics company that spun out of the University of Texas at Austin's Human-Centered Robotics Lab with the goal of bringing forth the next generation of robots.

The company says it has developed 15 robotic systems, including the humanoid robot NASA Valkyrie, before unveiling Apollo — an AI-powered humanoid designed for industrial work.

“We believe that it is not Man versus Machine, but Man plus Machine that will take humanity into the next stage of evolution,” Apptronik's website reads.

According to TechCrunch, Apptronik's humanoid work dates back to 2013, when the Human Centered Robotics Lab at the University of Austin competed in the NASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, focusing on a humanoid robot called Valkyrie.

Google's AI division, DeepMind, has also partnered with Apptronik to deliver embodied AI for its bipedal robots.

ARK Invest's investment in Apptronik further strengthens the company's commitment to innovation and technology, as the company's name acronym itself refers to “Active Research Knowledge.”

Apart from Apptronik, ARK has supported a wide number of AI platforms, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq and many others.

In October 2024, ARK reportedly agreed to invest at least $250 million in OpenAI's funding round, with the AI firm becoming its third-largest holding in the Ark Venture Fund, accounting for 5% of its total assets.

Bitcoin managed to outperform the other major global assets, such as the stock market, equities, treasuries and precious metals, despite the recent crypto market correction coinciding with the two-month debt suspension period in the United States.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price is currently down 23% from its all-time high of over $109,000 recorded on Jan. 20, on the day of US President Donald Trump's inauguration, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

Despite the recent decline, Bitcoin still outperformed all major global market segments, including the stock market, equities, US treasuries, real estate and precious metals, according to Bloomberg data shared by Thomas Fahrer, the co-founder of Apollo Sats.

“Even with the pullback, Bitcoin still outperforming every other asset post election,” wrote Fahrer in a March 18 X post.

Despite concerns over the premature arrival of the bear market cycle, Bitcoin's retracement to $76,000 remains part of an organic “correction within a bull market,” according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at the Nansen crypto intelligence platform.

“We are still in a correction within a bull market: Stocks and crypto have realized and are pricing in a period of tariff uncertainty and fiscal cuts, no Fed put. Recession fears are popping up,” the analyst told Cointelegraph.

 Swyftx CEO Jason Titman says he expects to see many new opportunities emerging for the industry in the wake of positive crypto policy changes in the United States. 

Australian crypto broker Swyftx is set to acquire New Zealand crypto exchange Easy Crypto, with one of the CEOs nodding at positive crypto policy changes in the United States. 

Swyftx CEO Jason Titman said in a March 19 statement that they see “Trump's policy messaging around crypto as a tailwind” for this deal. 

He told Cointelegraph that Swyftx's deal with Easy Crypto was underway before Trump was elected, but now we are on “the cusp of sensible regulation in the US” that will bring liquidity and put pressure on other governments to legislate.

“Everyone is so focused on tariffs that they're skipping the argument that good things are on the horizon for crypto,” Titman said.

Following Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, some changes in the crypto industry have included several pro-crypto executives in top regulatory roles and a shift in crypto stance by the country's securities regulator.

Titman says the crypto industry has endured a lean few years for mergers and acquisitions activity, partly because crypto CEOs were unwilling to “take the regulatory risk” they saw during the Biden administration.

“This hesitation has extended to other markets where regulators have sat on the fence and shown a lack of commitment to introducing clear legislation that supports blockchain and digital assets,” he said.

“We expect dealmaking to increase over the next few quarters and then stay elevated after that. Political administrations come and go, but rules tend to have a longer shelf life and that gives businesses the certainty they need to invest.”

Swyftx and Easy Crypto will continue to operate as separate platforms following the March 31 acquisition while the teams plan for their integration.

The new business will have a combined workforce of just under 200 employees and operate out of Brisbane, Australia, according to Swyftx and Easy Crypto.

Janine Grainger, co-founder and CEO of Easy Crypto, told Cointelegraph that the acquisition is a “natural fit” and would create a new oceanic heavyweight to rival crypto incumbents.

“The crypto market has changed rapidly in the last four years. As the market has matured, there has been a trend of the market consolidating and strong regional and global players emerging,” she said.

An August 2024 Swyftx survey estimates there are 3.9 million Australians who own crypto out of a population of 26 million. 

Meanwhile, research by Web3 consumer research firm Protocol Theory, in partnership with Easy Crypto, estimates almost 50% of New Zealand's 5.2 million population are either current crypto investors or are considering investing in the future.

An estimated 3.9 million Australians currently own cryptocurrency, compared to 4.5 million in 2023. Source: Swyftx

In comparison, the US Fed estimates roughly 18 million people in America own or use crypto.

Grainger says there “is increasing interest in leveraging our industry” to help drive economic growth amid strong support for the industry in New Zealand.   

“There is strong support for crypto locally — close to 50% of New Zealanders own, have owned or are considering future investment into crypto,” she said.

“The region is undergoing increasing levels of regulation, which will help to drive trust, much like other regions.”

 Stablecoins break down key barriers in cross-border payments, empowering small businesses and enabling financial inclusion. 

Opinion by: Simon McLoughlin, CEO at Uphold

2021 witnessed a fintech investment boom, with startups raising approximately $229 billion globally. Higher interest rates and tighter economic circumstances have since tempered that exuberance, but funds continue to pile into the sector. Indeed, the global fintech sector is expected to see a rebound in investment activity throughout 2025.

Why are investors continuing to bet big on this sector? The answer is simple. The current international finance system is in urgent need of modernization. Built for a pre-internet age, it relies on outdated processes, chains of intermediaries and a patchwork of non-standard regulations. 

Take SWIFT as a case in point. Founded in 1973, SWIFT remains the backbone of cross-border payments. SWIFT is nothing more than a messaging system that enables banks to communicate around transactions. It was never designed to manage funds or process transactions. As a result, a “make do and mend” approach has grown around international payments, characterized by a proliferation of intermediaries and local payment rails.

This antiquated, fragmented system creates significant friction in cross-border transactions, leading to delays, high costs and limited choice for individuals and businesses outside major economic blocs. Fees for international payments currently average 1.5% for businesses and all the way up to 6.3% for remittances. Payments can take up to several days to reach recipients.

This system hinders global commerce and exacerbates financial exclusion, particularly in the global south, where volatile local currencies and limited access to traditional banking services are common.

Many of these friction points could be resolved by stablecoins, making transferring money across borders as easy as sending an email. Indeed, the blockchain-based currency has the potential to revolutionize global finance. 

For people in countries with volatile economies or unstable governments, stablecoins offer a safe haven for savings. Stablecoins pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency such as the US dollar provide consumers in these regions with a way to escape their national financial system with a trustworthy and transparent alternative that protects them from inflation and currency devaluation. This is particularly important in the global south, where economic instability can erode the value of hard-earned income and savings. 

According to UBS, consumers in developing countries are also attracted to stablecoins due to the lower risk of government interference with the currency. The wealth management firm believes stablecoins are increasingly seen as “digital dollars” and used for everything from savings to transactions to remittances in these regions. 

Stablecoins can significantly reduce the costs and complexities associated with international payments, enabling small businesses and freelancers to participate in the global marketplace on a more level playing field. This opens up new opportunities for entrepreneurship and economic growth in developing countries.

In our current payment system, physical money does not cross borders — only information does. A payroll company looking to pay a freelancer in a third country cannot do so directly and must use systems like Stripe, which uses virtual bank accounts to get around the problem.

With stablecoins, payroll companies can pay in any currency to any currency, using crypto on- and off-ramps to facilitate the payment. The business pays in dollars, for example, which is on-ramped to Tether's USDt (USDT) and sent to the freelancer's digital wallet, where they can either keep it or off-ramp it to their local currency. Stablecoins will prove to be, and are, a vital tool in helping businesses access global talent and fill their skills gaps. 

Through offering an alternative to traditional banking systems, stablecoins also provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations. This can be particularly transformative in regions with limited access to traditional financial infrastructure or in countries like Argentina, where there is low confidence in the national monetary system. 

According to the Bank for International Settlements, stablecoins can enable a wide range of payments and provide a gateway to other financial services, replicating the role of transaction accounts as a stepping stone to broader financial inclusion. 

Given their ability to provide access to financial services anywhere with an internet connection, stablecoins are seeing explosive growth in emerging markets. Use cases are expanding rapidly across Africa, Latin America, and parts of developing Asia, where they are being used to hedge against inflation, for remittances and cross-border payments, and as a simpler alternative to US dollar banking. This growth trajectory can be expected to continue in the years ahead. 

Stablecoins are rapidly rising in popularity and already total more than $233 billion in market capitalization, while transaction volumes in 2024 reached $15.6 trillion, surpassing those of Visa. In an increasingly uncertain world, they offer a stable, low-cost and rapid means of transferring money across borders, helping to increase financial inclusion and smooth access to global talent for employers. Stablecoins are a digital-first financial tool for a digital-first world and are ideally suited to replacing the current archaic international payments system.

 Onchain Labs will assist in the expansion of the Arbitrum application layer and counter the trend of zero-sum crypto launches. 

Offchain Labs, the developers of Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, have announced a partnership with the Arbitrum Foundation to launch a new incubator-style program called Onchain Labs.

According to a March 17 post by Offchain Labs, the new incubator is aimed at rapidly adding to Arbitrum's existing decentralized application (DApp) offerings with a particular focus on supporting “innovative and experimental” projects. 

Offchain Labs said this support will primarily come in the form of product and go-to-market advice and won't provide engineering or other operational resources. 

It also added that while it's possible — there's no guarantee that its venture capital arm, Tandem, will purchase any of these project tokens in public markets.

Offchain Labs said the continued development of Arbitrum over the past few years has seen it grow to become one of the “most performant ecosystems in the space.” But now, with the launch of Onchain Labs, the focus will shift to building out the network's application landscape.

“Through Onchain Labs, we're dedicating resources to support developers looking to rapidly expand the application layer by ideating with them from the ground floor to bring the best user experiences to Arbitrum,” the company said. 

However, it's not just about building more applications.

The firm has also said it will only support projects that launch fairly. Offchain Labs claimed the industry's recent trend toward extractive zero-sum launches “stands in stark contrast to the core ethos of crypto,” adding that “as an industry, we can — and must — do better.”

It will seek to counter this trend by only working with teams that commit to equitable launches, which it said was “essential for fostering community alignment. There's no reason why all participants in an ecosystem can't succeed together.”

Arbitrum was one of the earliest layer 2s (L2s) on Ethereum, but there's been an explosion in new L2 networks since Ethereum's Dencun upgrade last year. 

According to L2Beat, there are now over 70 layer 2s and many more on the way. This has created some issues for Ethereum, according to some industry professionals. 

The first is the fracturing of the Ethereum ecosystem, as different DApps run on different layer 2s, which may or may not be interoperable.

“We currently have too many, the more L2s we build, the less interoperability we will have, creating other problems around infrastructure,” Vitali Dervoed, the co-founder and CEO of perpetual exchange Composability Labs, told Cointelegraph in August.

“Developers might have good intentions when building the next super-fast, low-gas-fee, easy-to-use blockchain, but in the long run, it's counterproductive as it creates a more fragmented ecosystem,” he added. 

Another issue is that lower-cost layer 2s like Base and Arbitrum are eating into Ethereum's revenue and impacting the layer 1's market cap. 

It comes on the same day Standard Chartered downgraded its 2025 price target for Ethereum by a whopping 60%, from US$10,000 to just US$4,000, with the bank's head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, saying, “We expect ETH to continue its structural decline.” 

Kendrick cited the impact of low-cost layer 2s like Base and Arbitrum as one of the key drivers of this decline.

With evolving techniques and increasing regulation, authorities continue working to track and mitigate the misuse of cryptocurrencies for money laundering.

Thanks to sophisticated technologies like cryptocurrencies, criminals find moving large amounts of money simpler. As cryptocurrency adoption has grown, so has illicit activity within the space. In 2023, crypto wallets linked to unlawful activities transferred $22.2 billion, while in 2022, this figure stood at $31.5 billion. 



 Crypto money laundering follows a structured process designed to hide the source of illicit funds. Criminals use sophisticated methods to bypass regulatory oversight and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures. The process unfolds in several stages: Step 1 — Gathering funds: The first step involves gathering funds obtained illegally, often from organized crime or fraudulent activities. These illicit earnings need to be moved discreetly to avoid detection by regulatory authorities. Step 2 — Moving funds into the crypto ecosystem: Criminals now move illicit funds into the financial system by purchasing cryptocurrencies. The modus operandi is to buy cryptocurrencies through multiple transactions across crypto exchanges, particularly those with weak AML compliance. To make tracking more complex, they may convert funds into different digital assets like Ether (ETH), Polkadot (DOT) or Tether's USDt (USDT). Step 3 — Juggling of funds: At this stage, the criminals hide the funds' ownership. For this purpose, they move their crypto assets through a series of transactions across different platforms, exchanging one cryptocurrency for another. Often, funds are transferred between offshore and onshore accounts to further complicate tracing. Step 4 — Reintroducing cleaned money into the system: The final step involves reintroducing the cleaned money into the economy, which they do through a network of brokers and dealers. They now invest the money in businesses, real estate or luxury assets without raising suspicion.Did you know?

 Criminals employ several methods to launder illicitly obtained digital assets. From non-compliant exchanges to online gambling platforms, they use various techniques to conceal the transaction trail. Below is some brief information about the methods criminals use.Non-compliant centralized exchangesCriminals use non-compliant centralized exchanges or peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms to convert cryptocurrency to cash. Before being converted into fiat, the cryptocurrency is processed through intermediary services like mixers, bridges or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to obscure its origins. Despite compliance measures, centralized exchanges (CEXs) handled almost half of these funds. In 2022, nearly $23.8 billion in illicit cryptocurrency was exchanged, a 68% surge from 2021. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)DEXs operate on a decentralized, peer-to-peer basis, meaning transactions occur directly between users using smart contracts rather than through a CEX. These exchanges are currently largely unregulated, which criminals use for swapping cryptocurrencies and making investigations harder.The absence of traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML procedures on many DEXs allows for anonymous transactions.Mixing servicesCryptocurrency mixers, also called tumblers, enhance anonymity by pooling digital assets from numerous sources and redistributing them to new addresses randomly. They obscure the funds' origins before they are sent to legitimate channels. A well-known example of criminals using crypto mixers is Tornado Cash, which was used to launder over $7 billion from 2019 until 2022. The developer of the mixer was arrested by Dutch authorities.Bridge protocolsCrosschain bridges, designed to transfer assets between blockchains, are exploited for money laundering. Criminals use these bridges to obscure the origin of illicit funds by moving them across multiple blockchains, making it harder for authorities to track transactions. By converting assets from transparent networks to privacy-enhanced blockchains, criminals evade scrutiny and reduce the risk of detection. The lack of uniform regulatory oversight across different chains facilitates illicit activity.Online gambling platformsCryptocurrency money launderers frequently exploit gambling platforms. They deposit funds from both traceable and anonymous sources, then either withdraw them directly or use collusive betting to obscure the funds' origin. This process effectively “legitimizes” the money. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), in its September 2020 report, identified gambling services as a money laundering risk, specifically highlighting suspicious fund flows to and from these platforms, especially when linked to known illicit sources.Nested servicesNested services encompass a wide range of services that function within one or more exchanges, using addresses provided by those exchanges. Some platforms have lenient compliance standards for nested services, creating opportunities for bad actors. On the blockchain ledger, transactions involving nested services appear as if they were conducted by the exchanges themselves rather than by the nested services or individual users behind them.

 The complex landscape of crypto money laundering involves a dual infrastructure. While CEXs remain primary conduits for illicit funds, shifts are evident. Crosschain bridges and gambling platforms are witnessing increased usage, reflecting evolving criminal tactics. Analysis of deposit address concentrations and crime-specific patterns highlights vulnerabilities. Crypto money laundering infrastructureBroadly, crypto money laundering infrastructure can be categorized into intermediary services and wallets. Intermediary services include mixers, bridge protocols, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other such services. On the other hand, fiat off-ramping services include any service that can help one convert crypto into fiat currency. While centralized exchanges are more commonly used for this purpose, criminals may also use P2P exchanges, gambling services and crypto ATMs. Crypto criminals use intermediary services to hide the origin of funds by concealing the onchain link between the source address and the current address.Key channels used for crypto money launderingDifferent financial services vary in their ability to combat money laundering. Centralized exchanges, for example, possess more control over transactions and have the authority to freeze assets linked to illicit or suspicious sources. However, DeFi protocols operate autonomously and do not hold user funds, making such interventions impractical. The transparency of blockchain technology enables analysts to track funds passing through DeFi platforms, which is often more difficult with centralized services. Centralized exchanges continue to be the primary destination for assets originating from illicit sources, with a relatively stable trend between 2019 and 2023. There was a significant uptick in ransomware proceeds being funneled to gambling platforms and an increase in ransomware wallets sending funds to bridges.Tracking illicit funds through deposit addressesDeposit addresses, which function similarly to bank accounts on centralized platforms, reveal how financial flows are concentrated. In 2023, a total of 109 exchange deposit addresses each received over $10 million in illicit crypto, collectively accounting for $3.4 billion. Comparatively, in 2022, only 40 addresses surpassed the $10 million mark, accumulating a combined total of just under $2 billion.The concentration of money laundering activity also varies by crime type. For instance, ransomware operators and vendors of illegal content exhibit a high degree of centralization. Seven key deposit addresses accounted for 51% of all funds from exchanges from illegal content vendors, while nine addresses handled 50.3% of ransomware proceeds. Criminals' shift to crosschain and mixing servicesSophisticated criminals are increasingly turning to crosschain bridges and mixing services to obfuscate their financial transactions. Illicit crypto transfers through bridge protocols surged to $743.8 million in 2023, more than doubling from the $312.2 million recorded in 2022. There has been a sharp rise in funds transferred to crosschain bridges from addresses linked to stolen assets. Cybercriminal organizations with advanced laundering techniques, such as North Korean hacking groups like Lazarus Group, leverage a diverse range of crypto services. Over time, they have adapted their strategies in response to enforcement actions. The shutdown of the Sinbad mixer in late 2023, for example, led these groups to shift toward other mixing services like YoMix, which operates on the darknet.

 Acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda said he's asked his staff to look at possibly withdrawing a proposed crypto custody rule for investment advisers. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission could change or scrap a rule proposed under the Biden administration that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisers, according to the agency's acting chair, Mark Uyeda.

In prepared remarks to an investment industry conference in San Diego on March 17, Uyeda said the rule proposed in February 2023 had seen commenters express “significant concern” over its “broad scope.”

“Given such concern, there may be significant challenges to proceeding with the original proposal. As such, I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal,” Uyeda said.

The rule was floated under the Biden administration during Gary Gensler's tenure leading the regulator. It aimed to expand custody rules for investment advisers to any and all assets held for a client, including crypto, and upped the requirements to protect them.

Source: SEC

This meant that investment advisers would have to custody their clients' crypto with a qualified custodian. Gensler said at the time that investment advisers “cannot rely on” crypto platforms as qualified custodians due to how they operate.

The proposal caused friction with Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce, along with industry advocacy bodies who claimed the rule was unlawful and dangerous.

“How could an adviser seeking to comply with this rule possibly invest client funds in crypto assets after reading this release?” Uyeda remarked at the time. He did, however, support the proposal despite disagreeing “with a number of provisions.” 

Peirce, who was the sole commissioner of the five to vote against the rule, said at the time that the proposed rule “would expand the reach of the custody requirements to crypto assets while likely shrinking the ranks of qualified crypto custodians.”

 Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol and Meteora have been sued in a New York court for their alleged role in the Libra token scandal, which saw around $107 million pooled from investors. 

Update March 18, 6:42am: This article has been updated to reflect that Cointelegraph reached out to KIP Protocol and Meteora.

The Libra token scandal is set to be reviewed by the Supreme Court of New York after a newly filed class-action lawsuit accused its creators of misleading investors and siphoning over $100 million from one-sided liquidity pools.

Burwick Law filed the suit on behalf of its clients against Kelsier Ventures, KIP Protocol and Meteora on March 17 for launching the Libra (LIBRA) token in a “deceptive, manipulative and fundamentally unfair” manner. The token was then promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei on X as an economic initiative to stimulate private-sector funding in the country.

The law firm slammed the two crypto infrastructure and launchpad firms behind LIBRA — KIP and Meteora — claiming that they used a “predatory” one-sided liquidity pool to artificially inflate the memecoin's price, allowing insiders to profit while “everyday buyers bore the losses.”

Within hours, the insiders “rapidly siphoned approximately $107 million from the liquidity pools,” causing a 94% crash in LIBRA's market value, Burwick Law said in a March 17 filing shared on X.

President Milei was mentioned in the lawsuit but wasn't named a defendant.

Burwick accused the defendants of leveraging Milei's influence to aggressively promote the token, deliberately creating a false sense of legitimacy and misleading investors about its economic potential.

Approximately 85% of LIBRA's tokens were withheld at launch and the “predatory infrastructure techniques” allegedly used by the defendants weren't disclosed to investors, Burwick said.

Burwick is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, the disgorgement of “unjustly obtained” profits and injunctive relief to prevent further fraudulent token offerings.Cointelegraph reached out to KIP Protocol and Meteora but didn't receive an immediate response.

Data from blockchain research firm Nansen found that of the 15,430 largest Libra wallets it examined, over 86% of those sold at a loss, combining for $251 million in losses.

Only 2,101 profitable wallets were able to take home a combined $180 million in profit, Nansen noted in a Feb. 19 report.

The venture capital firm behind the LIBRA token, Kelsier Ventures, and its CEO, Hayden Davis, were apparently two of the biggest winners from the token launch. They claim to have netted around $100 million.

Davis, who is now facing a potential Interpol red notice following an Argentine lawyer's request, said on Feb. 17 that he didn't directly own the tokens and wouldn't sell them.

Meanwhile, Milei has distanced himself from the memecoin, arguing he didn't “promote” the LIBRA token — as fraud lawsuits filed against him have alleged — and instead merely “spread the word” about it.

Argentina's opposition party called for Milei's impeachment but has had limited success thus far.

 Free speech advocates and crypto community members have voiced concern over what Durov's case means in a wider context. 

Telegram founder Pavel Durov has been allowed to leave France temporarily, but the preliminary charges against him raise significant questions for the crypto community. 

On March 13, a French court gave the founder and CEO of the encrypted messaging app Telegram permission to leave for Dubai, where he had previously resided. Durov had been in France since August 2024, when he was arrested at the Le Bourget airport in Paris. 

Durov was part of an investigation containing allegations of negligence and complicity in crimes like narcotics trafficking, money laundering, child sexual exploitation and terrorism. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

More broadly, Durov's case raises questions about developer responsibility for the cryptographic platforms and tools they create — a well-known issue in the cryptocurrency industry.

The preliminary charges against Durov claimed he was responsible, at least in part, for the illicit activities allegedly enabled by the platform's encryption and support for cryptocurrencies. 

The argument will sound familiar to crypto industry observers, who have been following the case of Alexey Pertsev, the developer of cryptocurrency mixer service Tornado Cash. As with Durov, prosecutors allege that Pertsev is responsible for the illicit activities that took place on the platform, namely money laundering. 

Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands in 2022 and is currently out on bail while he waits for his trial to begin.

In both cases, members of the crypto community have recognized the possible implications to free speech and privacy, and come to support the executives. 

Jose Fabrega, head of marketing at Ethereum-based blockchain Metis, called Durov's arrest the “Tornado Cash case all over again.”

Natalia Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, has previously told Cointelegraph that “Historically, software developers were seen as neutral creators of tools and platforms, responsible for their technical functionality but not for how those tools were used.”

However, she said this has been changing with the proliferation of decentralized tools that “challenge traditional regulatory frameworks.”

This puts decentralized platforms in a “tight spot,” crypto platform Onesafe wrote in a blog post on March 17. “This means knowing the legal frameworks governing their operations and engaging with regulatory bodies.”

It also called the Durov case a “pivotal moment” for the cryptocurrency industry and called on crypto firms to advocate for more “balanced regulations” and support advocacy groups. 

Durov himself wrote on March 17 that Telegram has “not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.” 

Observers and critics alike have raised concerns about Durov's arrest — discussing what it means for free speech and whether the arrest could have been politically motivated.  

Chris Pavlovski, the CEO of “alt-tech” video-sharing platform Rumble, said that it was the final straw for him and his company, which had previously clashed with French officials over censorship issues.

Gregory Alburov, an investigator for the Anti-Corruption Foundation of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, said the case “in addition to being unjust as hell (Durov obviously isn't engaged in terrorism or weapons trafficking), is also a huge blow to freedom of speech.”

Durov's previous clashes with regulators, particularly in 2018, when he refused to comply with an order from Russian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor, have led many to believe that the charges were politically motivated. 

While French President Mannuel Macron publicly stated that the case is not an attack on Durov, Dmitry Zair-Bek — a human rights lawyer and head of the human rights organization Department One — disagrees. 

Related: Free speech and online privacy: Pavel Durov's rise to the top

“Durov is essentially being targeted for his efforts to protect users' privacy and, of course, for his refusal to cooperate with intelligence agencies,” he said. 

Regardless of the motivations, the outcome of the case will have clear implications for future platforms. A conviction could intimidate platforms and executives into more intense moderation to the point of censorship, while a victory could embolden others to abandon obligations to regulators and public safety. 

Durov's leave in Dubai reportedly extends to April 7. The French prosecutor's office has not made any public statements regarding the status of the case.

	Introducing new koalas to mate with would help reduce inbreeding, but could also bring in the disease

Some koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) living in the Sydney metro area are isolated from other koalas, keeping them chlamydia-free. But the cost is being worryingly inbred.

Some of Sydney's koalas are facing an uncompromising dilemma.

The koalas living in one corner of Australia's largest city are perilously inbred, researchers report February 26 in Conservation Genetics. But the solution — interbreeding with neighboring koala populations — risks introducing the koalas to a deadly sexually transmitted disease. 

In 2021 and 2022, University of Sydney conservation biologist Carolyn Hogg and her colleagues determined that koalas in the southwestern Sydney metro area had the lowest genetic diversity anywhere in the state of New South Wales. To investigate further, the researchers caught 111 wild koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) from seven sites across the forested region south of Sydney and collected ear tissue before releasing them.

DNA analysis revealed that some neighborhoods — including Campbelltown, Heathcote and Liverpool — had koala populations with high genetic similarity, on average resembling that of half-siblings. Other nearby populations showed interrelatedness akin to first cousins or first cousins once removed.

The heavy inbreeding may stem from the isolation of these koalas, Hogg says, as their forested habitat is bound by urban areas to the north, east and west.

That same isolation may be why these sites are also among the few neighborhoods in New South Wales without reported infections of the bacteria Chlamydia. The sexually transmitted pathogen has decimated koala populations across Australia, leading to infertility, blindness and death. In at least one Queensland population, chlamydia accounted for 18 percent of koala deaths between 2013 and 2017, and some populations have a chlamydia prevalence of around 100 percent.

Southwestern Sydney is one of the few chlamydia-free areas in New South Wales. But its isolation also makes its koalas evolutionarily vulnerable, with less variation in their genetic tool kit for adapting to new threats, including bacteria like chlamydia. And the marsupials' resilience may be tested sooner rather than later. Hogg and her colleagues' analyses revealed substantial crossbreeding between koalas farther south and southwest in Wollondilly and the chlamydia-free site of Campbelltown.

“The likelihood that the disease will eventually arrive in the disease-free area is quite high,” Hogg says.

If the koalas are mating, they're swapping not only genes but also bacteria. Such crossbreeding might increase genetic diversity, but it could cause a potentially catastrophic outbreak of chlamydia. 

“Usually the quickest way to inject new diversity is by bringing in individuals from another population or structuring environments in a way to ensure that different populations are connected and don't become geographically isolated — like building corridors,” says Chloé Schmidt, an evolutionary ecologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. “But here, corridors wouldn't be a great idea!”

Rebecca Taylor, a conservation genomicist with Environment and Climate Change Canada in Ottawa, says an alternative solution would be selectively moving uninfected animals from other populations into the chlamydia-free areas to safely boost genetic diversity.

“However, this approach would be very intensive and costly and would need to be repeated every couple of years,” Taylor says. 

The study researchers see this as something of an intractable catch-22.

“The population is large, so introducing new genetic diversity and having it taken up into the population is complex and difficult to achieve,” says Hogg, adding that being pinched between urban isolation and disease threats is not unique to koalas. “This conundrum is found all over the world where urban areas are growing.”

The researchers suggest that the findings show how important it is to keep koala populations interconnected from the get-go. Habitat loss and human-made barriers can fragment populations into inbred enclaves that are far more susceptible to disease and other threats.

Hogg and her colleagues plan to continue monitoring the genetics of these and other koala populations to understand disease patterns and their relationship to koala immune system genes. 

“We need to understand the genetic drivers that make individuals susceptible to disease so we can manage the species in the long term and ensure they have enough genetic diversity to be able to adapt to a changing world.”

	Cosmic expansion rate questions persist, but the standard cosmology model holds

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (pictured) in Chile is designed to gather intel on the cosmic microwave background, the thermal afterglow of the Big Bang.

Princeton University

2 hours ago

The clearest pictures yet of the newborn cosmos strengthen the prevailing model of the universe but deepen a mystery about its expansion rate.

Measurements of this rate, known as the Hubble constant, have produced conflicting results. Cosmologists hoped that new data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile, which examines the oldest light in the universe, would clear things up and possibly reveal physics that diverges from the standard model of cosmology. But those results, announced March 18 in a webinar, only affirmed that model.

“If you'd asked me to put a bet beforehand, I would have maybe put even money on seeing something new,” says cosmologist Colin Hill of Columbia University, a member of the telescope team. “But the standard model appears to reign supreme.”

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope, or ACT, measured properties of the Big Bang's thermal afterglow, known as the cosmic microwave background, with unprecedented sensitivity — particularly in the orientation of that light's electromagnetic waves, or its polarization.

While previous telescopes mapped temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, indicating where matter was starting to clump together and foreshadowing the universe's present-day structure, polarization maps put those clumps in motion.

“The polarization tells you how the gas and other matter that's present in the early universe is actually moving around,” Hill says. That information allows cosmologists to project forward and see if it matches the current distribution of matter in the universe. “It gives us a much firmer prediction for what should happen in the next 13 billion years afterwards.”

The European Space Agency's Planck satellite also measured polarization, but the larger ACT has five times the resolution, Hill says.

The newborn universe aligns with the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter model, a relatively simple picture of the universe, the ACT team reports in three papers to appear on arXiv.org and a March 19 talk at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, Calif.

Combined with previous results, the new ACT measurements, gathered from 2017 to 2022, confirm and refine many of the universe's vital stats. It's 13.77 billion years old and comprises 5 percent ordinary matter, 25 percent dark matter — which exerts gravitational attraction but otherwise doesn't interact with regular matter — and 70 percent dark energy, a mysterious force pushing the universe to expand at an ever-accelerating rate. 

The current expansion rate is 68.22 kilometers per second for each megaparsec (about 3 million light-years) of space, the team reports. That number agrees with previous measurements of the cosmic microwave background, such as those from the Planck satellite. But it disagrees with estimates based on closer objects, such as supernovas and the bright hearts of galaxies known as quasars, which have suggested a rate around 73 km/s/Mpc.

The discrepancy between the two types of measurements has been tightening for over five years. The ACT measurement turns the screws tighter.

Looking for a solution, the researchers examined several possible deviations from the standard model such as new particles, new interactions between dark matter and regular matter or itself, variations in fundamental constants or extra dark energy in the early universe. Nothing turned up.

“It just blew me away that we didn't see even, like, a hint of one of these new physics extensions,” Hill says. “It indicates that we might need to go back really to some of the foundational assumptions of our understanding of cosmology.”

Other cosmologists may not have had such optimism about finding new physics, says physicist Daniel Scolnic of Duke University, who was not involved in the new work. “I think people expected that ACT wouldn't see anything. But I did have a hope, so I was pretty disappointed,” he says. “But it's okay. Nature will tell us the story.”

There's still room for hope. The Simons Observatory, an even more sensitive telescope in Chile, started taking data in late February, which might find hidden deviations from the standard model.

“It could be the case that in a few years we will get some detection of new physics,” Hill says. “If we don't keep looking, we won't give ourselves a chance.”

Progress could also come from relaxing some of the standard model's assumptions. Scientists have assumed, for example, that dark energy's density has remained constant. But a recent survey using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument suggested that dark energy changes over time.

“If they confirm that at high significance, then we would really need to revisit a lot of our investigations,” Hill says. “It could open up avenues in the early universe that previously the data would not have allowed.”

Where is it? Ok volcano, Iceland [64.60038686, -20.87986624]

What's in the photos? A comparison of Okjökull, a glacier atop Ok volcano, before and after it was declared dead

Which satellites took the photos? Landsat 5 and Landsat 8

When were they taken? Sept. 14, 1986, and Aug. 1, 2019

Two satellite photos taken 33 years apart show the disappearance of a glacier in Iceland that was the first ice mass to be declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change.

Okjökull was a dome-shaped glacier situated around the summit crater on Ok (pronounced Auk), a 3,940-foot-tall (1,200 meters) shield volcano located 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Reykjavík. (The name Okjökull translates to ""Ok glacier"" in Icelandic.)

In 1901, Okjökull's ice covered an area of around 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), but when the first of the two satellite photos was taken in 1986, there was less than 1 square mile (2.6 square km) of ice left. By the time the second image was captured in 2019, the ice covered less than 0.4 square miles (1 square km), according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

The glacier was declared dead in 2014, when Icelandic glaciologists revealed that the ice had become so thin that it was no longer being slowly pulled down the mountain by gravity, meaning it had stopped moving for the first time in tens of thousands of years, according to a 2024 paper summarizing Okjökull's demise.

The glacier's death was showcased and explored in a 2018 short film titled ""Not Ok,"" which was made by researchers from Rice University in Texas.

In August 2019, around 100 people, including researchers and politicians, attended a funeral for Okjökull near the summit of Ok, according to The Guardian. During this ceremony, a commemorative plaque, inscribed with a message titled ""A letter to the future,"" was placed near the summit.

It reads as follows: ""Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.""

The plaque also listed the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which was 415 parts per million at the time. As of March 2025, the concentration is over 428 ppm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In 2023, Iceland also created the world's first iceberg graveyard, where ice-like headstones were constructed for the 15 major glaciers listed on the Global Glacier Casualty List, all of which are either dead or critically endangered, according to the United Nations. This list includes the Anderson Glacier in Washington state, which, in 2015, became the first U.S. glacier to be declared dead.

Because of inconsistent monitoring and debates about the true sizes of glaciers, it is unclear exactly how many glaciers have been lost due to climate change, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. However, some researchers estimate that up to 10,000 glaciers of various sizes may have already been lost to climate change, The Washington Post reported in 2024.

A novel genetic model suggests that the ancestors of modern humans came from two distinct populations that split and reconnected during our evolutionary history.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago, a new genetic model suggests. The unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function.

""The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined,"" study co-author Aylwyn Scally, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement.

In a study published Tuesday (March 18) in the journal Nature Genetics, researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called ""cobraa,"" that has allowed them to trace the evolution of modern humans (Homo sapiens).

By applying their new method to modern human DNA data published in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project, the researchers discovered that there were two main ancestral groups that split around 1.5 million years ago, which they called Population A and Population B.

Just after that split, Population A experienced a bottleneck when the population plummeted and likely lost a significant amount of genetic diversity. But Population A grew over time, and Neanderthals and Denisovans branched off from it.

Then, around 300,000 years ago, Population A mixed with Population B, the researchers found. Their genetic analysis suggests that 80% of the genome of all present-day humans comes from Population A, while 20% of our genome comes from Population B.

Some of the genes from Population B, ""particularly those related to brain function and neural processing, may have played a crucial role in human evolution,"" study co-author Trevor Cousins, a postgraduate student in genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. In general, the genetic material from Population B reduced the ability of individuals to have children, Cousins told Live Science in an email, but ""the genome is a complicated place, and regions outside of genes can still do important things.""

The new model suggests that, around 300,000 years ago, Population A, which eventually gave rise to humans, had ""deep structure,"" Cousins said, meaning it was formed from ""two or more genetically distinct populations that mixed with each other.""

Who those populations were, however, is not clear. In the study, the researchers noted that ""various Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis populations that are potential candidates for lineages A and B existed both in Africa and elsewhere in the relevant period.""

But ""the genetic model cannot indicate which fossils should be assigned to Population A or B,"" Cousins said. ""We can only speculate.""

Some experts use the term ""ghost populations"" to talk about groups that branched off and then reconnected later through interbreeding resulting in gene flow, John Hawks, a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email.

""What is interesting about this paper is that the pattern in the model is a deep African structure that is shared by everyone living today,"" Hawks said. ""It is not 'ghost populations' contributing to one particular group, it is one big ghost that merged in with the African source population for all modern humans.""

—1.5 million-year-old bone tools crafted by human ancestors in Tanzania are oldest of their kind

—Neanderthal 'population bottleneck' around 110,000 years ago may have contributed to their extinction

But one of the drawbacks to the new model, according to Hawks, is that it is based on the 1000 Genomes Project, which has a low representation of African populations. ""So I see this as more a proof of principle than a real guide to what ancient humans were doing,"" Hawks said.

The origin of modern humans is a long-standing question in paleoanthropology, and improvements in DNA and genomic analysis in the past two decades have provided new insights and raised new questions.

""What's becoming clear is that the idea of species evolving in clean, distinct lineages is too simplistic,"" Cousins said in the statement. ""Interbreeding and genetic exchange have likely played a major role in the emergence of new species repeatedly across the animal kingdom.""

Mount Spurr near Anchorage has been showing signs of unrest for a year. Now scientists think it's creeping closer to an eruption.

A huge volcano in Alaska appears to be ""moving closer to an eruption,"" scientists monitoring it have said.

Mount Spurr, which sits 81 miles (130 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is now releasing unusual levels of volcanic gases near its summit and from a flank vent that last erupted in 1992.

The 11,000-foot (3,370-meter) volcano has been undergoing an uptick in earthquakes and snow and ice melt on its slopes in the past year, indicating magma movement under the surface. Now, according to scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), it's most likely that this unrest will end in an eruption.

That's an increase in risk from the observatory's last assessment in February, which gauged that Mount Spurr was equally likely to simmer down as it was to erupt. Now, observations of increased carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from the volcano have tipped the balance toward an eruption, said Matt Haney, the scientist-in-charge of the AVO at the U.S. Geological Survey.

""This time period of unrest will eventually most likely end in an explosive eruption like the ones that happened in 1953 and 1992,"" Haney told Live Science.

Those eruptions both took place at Crater Peak, a flank vent about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the stratovolcano's summit. The last time the mountain's peak erupted was likely more than 5,000 years ago, Haney said, so scientists don't expect an eruption there — most likely, the rock between the eruptible magma and the summit crater is well-solidified and would be hard for any magma to burst through.

Any eruption will probably occur at Crater Peak, which has been more recently active and which probably has easier pathways to the surface for magma to move.

Crater Peak exploded three times over several months in 1992 and once in 1953. In both cases, ash erupted at least 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) in the atmosphere, Haney said. One of the explosions in 1992 sent the cloud drifting over Anchorage, blanketing the city in an eighth an inch (3.1 millimeters) of dust. In 1953, Anchorage experienced a quarter-inch (6.4 mm) ashfall.

If the magma movement beneath the volcano doesn't settle down, the next sign of an eruption will likely be volcanic tremor, Haney said.

Unlike the brief, small earthquakes that have been shuddering the volcano over the last year, volcanic tremor is a long, ongoing shaking that can last for minutes, hours, or days. It indicates that magma is rising and that an eruption is likely imminent.

In 1992, volcanic tremor started about three weeks before Mount Spurr erupted. Another nearby volcano that erupted in 2009, Mount Readout, showed volcanic tremor for two months before it blew its top.

""If we see [tremor],"" Haney said, ""that will be the next sign that Spurr is further progressing toward an eruption.""

You can tell spring has officially begun in the Northern Hemisphere just by looking at the stars. Here's how to easily spot the Spring Triangle without a telescope.

Spring is coming to the Northern Hemisphere, but how can you tell when it will start? No need to Google the vernal equinox; to work out when the season officially begins, you only need to look at the stars.

The beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere is marked by the vernal equinox — the point when Earth's axis is side-on to the sun, spreading light and heat equally around the globe. This year it occurs on March 20.

This moment in Earth's annual journey around the sun marks the end of one season and the beginning of the next, and stargazers can spot the change because the springtime night sky, as seen from the Northern Hemisphere, is full of stars and constellations only ever seen at this time of the year.

The easiest way for stargazers to observe this seasonal transition on the equinox is to look southwest after sunset and bid farewell to the bright stars of winter. Find the three unmistakable stars in Orion's Belt — Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka — and begin to identify the bright stars around them.

Above the belt is Betelgeuse, one of the brightest stars in the night sky, which appears slightly reddish to the naked eye if you squint. Below the belt is Rigel, while to its left and slightly below is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Use these three stars to form an equilateral shape — the Winter Triangle.

For celestial confirmation of spring, gaze north, and you'll see the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper/Plough riding high in the sky — as in the memory aid, ""spring up, fall down."" As this asterism climbs higher in the sky, use its stars to find the Spring Triangle: an equilateral triangle made of the springtime stars Arcturus, Spica, and Denebola. All three stars are visible with the naked eye, but a good backyard telescope or pair of stargazing binoculars can enhance the view.

Trace the curve of the Big Dipper's handle to ""arc to Arcturus,"" identifying a bright reddish star above due east. Now ""spike to Spica,"" traveling a short distance to identify that bluish star rising in the east-southeast. Directly above it will be Denebola in Leo, a classic spring constellation. (Some skywatching guides may replace Denebola with Regulus, another star in Leo that appears slightly further east near the lion's front paw; Regulus is a brighter star, but using it as a waymarker stretches out the Spring Triangle considerably).

The Spring Triangle will remain visible in the night sky until August, when summer begins shifting into fall.

Environmentalist and author Paul Hawken speaks to Live Science about the worldview that has led to the mindless exploitation of the planet — and how we can shift perspectives for a better future.

The element carbon, in its oxidized form, is at the center of discussions about climate change. Carbon is often vilified and cast as the culprit for global warming, destruction and loss.

But what we tend to forget is that carbon is the main ingredient for life. And we are the only species on Earth that disrupts the natural flow of carbon, says environmentalist and author Paul Hawken.

Hawken's new book, ""Carbon: The Book of Life"" (Viking, 2025), shines a spotlight on the countless flows of carbon that power life, from individual cells to vast underground fungal networks and entire human societies. Through the lens of carbon, the author takes the reader on a journey through corporate retreats, the pharmaceutical sector, the food industry and the realms of plants, insects and fungi.

Live Science sat down with Hawken before the book's publication on March 18 to discuss the language we use to talk about the climate and the paradigm shift needed to start valuing, restoring and protecting the natural flow of carbon on Earth.

Q: ""Carbon"" is about showing that carbon is not just a problem we need to neutralize, but also a vital force that flows through every living being and Earth system. How does this encourage us to think differently about climate change?

Hawken: The narrative [around global warming] is really screwed up, frankly, because it has objectified carbon, the atmosphere, climate change, etcetera. It's the same mindset that caused the problem: We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends.

When people say we're going to ""fix"" the climate, or ""tackle"" or ""combat"" climate change, to me it's just so emblematic of this profound disconnection between self and other. We don't have a climate crisis; the climate cannot have a crisis. We are the crisis. That's what I want to explore. [I want] to go to a place that's not just insular and about self, but actually [gives rise to] a sense of being in the world that can create a sensibility that forms community. Because all of life as we know it exists in a community.



Q: I found the book very uplifting and hopeful. How do you find the drive to write about the climate when everything we hear from scientists is so bleak?

Hawken: What I'm trying to do in my own life, certainly, but also in communication, is to create the context in which people can see the world. Because what you see and receive really determines your mindset, your consciousness, your awareness and your sense of stress, anxiety and equanimity in the face of events that are troubling. Rather than going to the trouble and staying with that, I'm looking for a conversation that makes sense. That's where change needs to happen.

We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends.""

Q: Could you give an example of where the current conversation does not make sense to you? 

Hawken: People talk about ""net zero."" I'm not a physicist, but I can tell you that ""net zero"" does not exist in terms of carbon. ""Carbon neutrality"" does not exist.

If you look at the proposals to really shift away from fossil fuels, what we're talking about is renewable energies to energize an economy that's skyrocketing in consumption, which is destruction. Renewable energy doesn't really take a step back to ask: ""Energizing yes, but what?"" And if we don't look at that, then we're just in a gerbil wheel. We may have the illusion that the faster we go, the faster we're getting somewhere, but actually we're not — it's almost the opposite.

Q: A few chapters of the book focus on health and the food industry. How do those topics relate to carbon and why was it important to include them?

Hawken: The book is about life and about carbon as an element. The flow of carbon is, in a sense, the flow of life. I began to look at the food system and what was being sold, what was being promoted. One thing led to another in terms of looking at health and self and food and agriculture as a system that is inseparable from the rest. That goes back to carbon, because if you look at a healthy agricultural system, it's full of carbon. That whole systemic understanding of food and health and farming and soil and agricultural practices and chemistry is also a way of looking at the other systems we have and that we take for granted.

Q: This leads nicely into the ""spaceship Earth"" you mention in the book. Spaceship Earth is a concept that encourages us to think of the planet as a closed system with limited resources. Humanity is the crew, and every passenger should work toward the greater good of this crew. Why do you like this metaphor?

Hawken: Earth is so big, we don't even understand our own cities. It leads to ways of thinking where [we don't consider where] our trash and sewage go. The spaceship is an imaginative exercise, where you imagine that a group of you is going on a spaceship for 10, 50, 100 years and you ask yourselves what is allowed on board and what is not. There's no spatial limit — it's more about the system, its inputs and outputs. It's just to bring it down to a scale where people can understand what happens on Earth without being a scientist.

Q: The central message in ""Carbon"" is that we need to reconnect with the world around us to shape a better future than what we're currently headed for. One of your previous books is called ""Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation"" (Penguin, 2021) — and I was wondering what regeneration means to you. How do we end the climate crisis?

Hawken: Regeneration for me is pretty simple. It means that your life, your being, your presence here is about creating more life — not in the sense of making children, but in every sense of life. That means you start thinking about consumption, about what to buy and what you take, and the implications of that.

The purpose of ""Carbon"" is to suggest there is this beautiful flow of wonder and majesty that is inseparable from us. The purpose is to ask: What if we truly believed that Earth is our home? And what if we acted that way? Because we don't.

The Miami Marlins are unconcerned about facing a potential grievance on behalf of the Major League Baseball Players Association over their revenue-sharing money spending habits, according to the Miami Herald. Rather, the Marlins believe they are well positioned to defend themselves should that come to pass based on their read of the Collective Bargaining Agreement's text.

To be clear: the MLBPA cannot file a grievance until after the season. Even if the union does go that route, these matters take time to resolve and seldom result in anything of note. To wit, the MLBPA's grievances against the Marlins on similar grounds from both 2017 and 2018 remain pending.

The Marlins are projected to enter the season with a luxury tax payroll around $86 million (according to FanGraphs) despite receiving at least an estimated $70 million in revenue sharing funds. Teams are supposed to spend 150% of what they receive in revenue sharing, meaning the Marlins would be expected to field a luxury tax payroll of around $105 million. While failing to meet that mark doesn't mean the Marlins would lose a grievance, it does increase the chances of MLBPA submitting a grievance -- if only to keep revenue-sharing recipients honest about their spending.

And yet, the Marlins contend they've met the spirit of the law (the CBA states the money should be spent ""in an effort to improve performance on the field"") by fortifying other parts of the organization, even if they fall short on payroll, according to the Herald.

""We made a significant investment, not only in the front office staff in technology, but we've also done a tremendous amount to improve the ability of the players to perform,"" owner Bruce Sherman told the Herald last month. ""We're putting a tremendous amount of resources in loanDepot. You haven't seen any of this, but we're going to have the second-biggest weight training facility in all of baseball for our players. Our training doesn't stop at the major league level. We've added levels into the organization that we've never had before.""

As it stands, the Marlins are expected to enter the season with just one player making more than $5 million this season: Sandy Alcantara, a deadline trade candidate.

As the football world awaits Aaron Rodgers' decision regarding his future, many are getting impatient. It's not just fans who are tired of waiting on what the future Hall of Famer will do, players are also getting antsy.

There are a few teams in the conversation when it comes to the four-time league-MVP quarterback, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had Justin Fields and Russell Wilson leading the offense last year. 

On the latest episode of his Not Just Football podcast, Steelers defensive end Cameron Heyward shared his thoughts on Rodgers' decision-making process, saying he is ""tired of talking about the quarterback situation."" The former first-rounder said he just wants to play football and is ""ready to move on from free agency,"" into what else the offseason has to offer. 

""I ain't doing that darkness retreat. I don't need any of that crap,"" Heyward said, referencing what Rodgers did to help make his decision ahead of joining the New York Jets. ""Either you want to be a Pittsburgh Steeler or you don't. That's simple, that's the pitch. If you want me to recruit, that's the recruiting pitch. Pittsburgh Steelers -- if you want to be part of it, so be it. If you don't, no skin off my back.""

Rodgers is reportedly waiting to hear from the Minnesota Vikings before making a decision. Another team linked to the 41-year-old is the New York Giants.

Rodgers' decision will have a domino effect and the teams that don't land him will be left still needing an answer at the most important position in today's NFL. 

This offseason, the Steelers signed Mason Rudolph, but no other major moves have been made at QB. Fields signed with the Jets and free agent Wilson has visited the Cleveland Browns and New York Giants.

After not playing in 2023 due to an Achilles injury suffered four offensive snaps into the season, Rodgers finished last year with 3,897 yards passing, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

The first week of free agency is officially in the books, so where do things stand in the NFL today? We saw Milton Williams sign the biggest deal in free agency with a $104 million contract from the New England Patriots, the quarterback carousel took an aggressive spin with Geno Smith being traded to the Las Vegas Raiders while Sam Darnold took his spot with the Seattle Seahawks and DeAndre Hopkins teamed up with Lamar Jackson in Baltimore.

How would you rank the AFC if the 2025 season began today? Are the Kansas City Chiefs still the top dog, or did another contender like the Buffalo Bills overtake them? Let's rank the AFC from 16-1 after the first wave of free agency.

Key additions: DT Maliek Collins, QB Kenny PickettKey losses: DT Dalvin Tomlinson

The Browns went 3-14 last year and may be without Deshaun Watson for the 2025 season. Watson clearly has struggled since leaving H-Town, but Pickett probably isn't the long-term answer in Cleveland, either. The Browns finding a way to keep Myles Garrett was the headline of their offseason thus far, but he doesn't make the Browns a Super Bowl contender by himself. The big question for Cleveland is who will play quarterback this year? Is it Russell Wilson, or Shedeur Sanders? Kirk Cousins?!

Key additions: LT Dan Moore Jr., LB Cody Barton, S Xavier Woods, OG Kevin ZeitlerKey losses: EDGE Harold Landry, WR Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, LB Kenneth Murray

The Titans weren't expected to be active in free agency after their 2024 spending spree landed them the No. 1 overall pick in this upcoming draft. Tennessee made the interesting decision to sign Moore away from Pittsburgh, and push former No. 7 overall pick JC Latham over to right tackle. Even if you hate the Moore contract, landing veteran Zeitler should make Titans fans feel better about the offensive line as a whole. Tennessee also lost Westbrook-Ikhine to the Miami Dolphins, who caught nine touchdowns last season, and released veteran cornerback Chidobe Awuzie. The Titans still have plenty of needs to address, starting with quarterback. Maybe that comes in the form of Cam Ward, which is why I'll put Tennessee above Cleveland ... for now.  

Key additions: OL Patrick Mekari, CB Jourdan Lewis, WR Dyami Brown, S Eric MurrayKey losses: TE Evan Engram, S Andre Cisco, WR Christian Kirk

The Jaguars have made some nice moves in free agency, landing Mekari to boost Trevor Lawrence's protection, while Lewis and Murray will be immediate contributors in the secondary. The Brown contract was pretty surprising to me, but Jacksonville had to do something to help that wide receiving corps. The Jags aren't expected to be contenders in Year 1 of the James Gladstone era, but what I want to see in 2025 is Liam Coen establish a rapport with Lawrence, and get him back to playing at a high level.

Key additions: QB Justin Fields, CB Brandon Stephens, S Andre CiscoKey losses: CB D.J. Reed, DT Javon Kinlaw, WR Davante Adams, RT Morgan Moses, EDGE Haason Reddick

It probably goes without saying, but the Jets' 2025 season may hinge on if Justin Fields is a good quarterback or not. He was an intriguing signal-caller on the market given his dual-threat ability and the fact that he would come much cheaper than someone like Darnold. Fields played the most efficient football of his career last season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, but is he a full-time starter? Maybe with Garrett Wilson he is. Or maybe Jaxson Dart comes in and finds success. Defensively, New York scored an interesting young player in Andre Cisco, who is just 25 years old, but losing D.J. Reed is tough for new head coach Aaron Glenn.

Key additions: DT Milton Williams, CB Carlton Davis, EDGE Harold Landry, LB Robert Spillane, RT Morgan MosesKey losses: DT Davon Godchaux, DB Jonathan Jones

The Patriots are already going to be one of the most interesting teams to follow this upcoming season, for three reasons: how much they really improved in free agency, the impact Mike Vrabel will have in Year 1 and what Drake Maye is capable of with a better support system -- which is still a work in progress. Moses was a good signing, but the Patriots need more than just him when it comes to the offensive line. New England also needs a legitimate wide receiver, because signing Mack Hollins isn't enough. Williams signed the biggest contract in free agency thus far, as Vrabel targeted his ""Jeffery Simmons"" to captain the middle, if you will.

Key additions: S Camryn Bynum, CB Charvarius Ward, QB Daniel JonesKey losses: OG Will Fries, EDGE Dayo Odeyingbo, C Ryan Kelly

The Colts have been one of the most intriguing teams in free agency to me. Addressing the secondary was an important item on the to-do list, and Camryn Bynum at safety plus Charvarius Ward at corner are great adds. The Colts also want to host a quarterback competition, so they added Daniel Jones to battle Anthony Richardson. After seeing Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield find success after leaving bad situations, I'm reserving judgement on Jones. While Indy made some notable adds, it also lost some big names -- especially on the offensive line with Will Fries and Ryan Kelly. The offensive line is something to watch for in the draft, but at least the Colts defense should be better.

Key additions: S Jeremy Chinn, OG Alex Cappa, QB Geno Smith, RB Raheem MostertKey losses: S Trevon Moehrig, CB Nate Hobbs, LB Robert Spillane, LB Divine Deablo

The Raiders got better at the quarterback position, but how much better? Smith knows head coach Pete Carroll, but how will this soon-to-be 35-year-old fit in Chip Kelly's scheme when he doesn't have DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett or Jaxon Smith-Njigba to throw to? Maybe Lockett is on the way to Vegas, but the Raiders will need to add more than just him at wide receiver. I do trust coach Carroll, though.

Key additions: OG James Daniels, DB Ifeatu Melifonwu, QB Zach Wilson, WR Nick Westbrook-IkhineKey losses: S Jevon Holland, OG Robert Jones

Miami hasn't been very active in free agency, but the headline thus far is losing safety Jevon Holland to the New York Giants. Melifonwu is certainly an intriguing replacement if he can stay healthy. Adding Daniels was good for the offensive line, but Miami shouldn't be done adding talent in the trenches. Ultimately, the Dolphins haven't done anything yet to move themselves off the line of ""borderline playoff team,"" but I still don't view them as a ""bad team."" We'll see what GM Chris Grier does in the draft.

Key additions: CB Darius Slay, WR DK MetcalfKey losses: LT Dan Moore Jr., QB Justin Fields, OL James Daniels, CB Donte Jackson, RB Najee Harris

It's difficult to judge the Steelers since we don't know who will be playing quarterback. Could it be Aaron Rodgers? Or maybe Russell Wilson comes back. Regardless, Metcalf is the best wide receiver Pittsburgh has had since Antonio Brown. This rushing attack is going to look different with the loss of Harris, and then the offensive line will need some extra help without Daniels and Moore on roster. Even if those two players weren't high-level starters, Pittsburgh needs depth in the trenches given what happened last year with all of the injuries.

Key additions: OG Mekhi Becton, CB Donte Jackson, WR Mike Williams, RB Najee HarrisKey losses: WR Josh Palmer, DT Poona Ford, CB Kristian Fulton, EDGE Joey Bosa

Re-signing Khalil Mack was important, and signing former Steelers running back Najee Harris intrigues me. However, losing Ford and Bosa makes you a worse team. L.A. can still be a playoff squad, but it won't go very far without a physical outside wide receiver. Ladd McConkey can't do everything by himself, and I wonder how effective Mike Williams will be in his return to the Chargers.

Key additions: WR Christian Kirk, OG Laken Tomlinson, S C.J. Gardner-Johnson, DT Sheldon Rankins, OG Ed IngramKey losses: LT Laremy Tunsil, S Eric Murray, OG Kenyon Green

The Texans made one of the most shocking moves of free agency when they traded star left tackle Laremy Tunsil to the Washington Commanders for a package of picks. Houston's offensive line struggled mightily last season, so Nick Caserio is opting for a rebuild at that position -- which included trading Kenyon Green to the Philadelphia Eagles for CJGJ. While no one in Houston is crying foul over losing Green, Gardner-Johnson is an addition worth getting excited about. The Texans still look like the best team in the AFC South, but as for if they are legitimate contenders, we'll see. Apart from the offensive line, maybe OC Nick Caley is key for Houston getting over the hump.

Key additions: DT Tedarrell Slaton, LB Oren BurksKey losses: OG Alex Cappa, LB Akeem Davis-Gaither

Maybe the vibes are high in Cincinnati because the Bengals found a way to keep both Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins long term, but the future of reigning sack leader Trey Hendrickson remains up in the air, and the Bengals still have to upgrade the defense that kept this team out of the playoffs last year. 

Key additions: S Talanoa Hufanga, LB Dre Greenlaw, TE Evan EngramKey losses: LB Cody Barton, RB Javonte Williams

Did Sean Payton finally find his ""joker"" in Engram? Adding more weaponry for Bo Nix was a key goal this offseason, and Denver isn't done either. Defensively, Hufanga and Greenlaw make the Broncos better. Remember, this unit was incredibly aggressive last year, ranking top five in sacks (63), pressure percentage (40%) and blitz percentage (37%). Plenty of reason to be excited about Denver moving forward.

Key additions: WR DeAndre HopkinsKey losses: OL Patrick Mekari, CB Brandon Stephens

The Ravens haven't had a very exciting free agency. Keeping Ronnie Stanley is huge, but losing Mekari is notable, too. Surely there are people out there that think the Hopkins addition is something that will get Baltimore over the hump, but I don't know. Hopkins turns 33 in June, and is probably more of a move-the-chains possession guy than someone who averages 70-80 receiving yards per game. 

The Ravens will once again be one of the best teams in the NFL, but will have to prove they are better than the Bills or Chiefs.

Key additions: WR Josh Palmer, EDGE Michael Hoecht, EDGE Joey Bosa, DT Larry OgunjobiKey losses: CB Kaiir Elam, EDGE Von Miller

The Bills have had a pretty decent free agency so far, adding a young receiver in Palmer and several defensive linemen in Hoecht, Bosa and Ogunjobi. However, Hoecht and Ogunjobi will unfortunately have to miss six games due to PED suspensions. So I do wonder if there will be some early season struggles defensively. The draft will be important for Buffalo, but this is still a legitimate contender led by the very well-paid reigning NFL MVP. 

Key additions: LT Jaylon Moore, CB Kristian Fulton, RB Elijah Mitchell Key losses: DT Tershawn Wharton, S Justin Reid, WR DeAndre Hopkins, OLB Josh Uche, OG Joe Thuney

Brett Veach quickly targeted Moore to serve as Patrick Mahomes' new left tackle, then Fulton and Mitchell could be important, underrated contributors if they can stay healthy. The Chiefs have had a solid offseason since they found a way to keep Trey Smith and Nick Bolton. There's still some work to be done, but the Chiefs have made the Super Bowl three years in a row, and I'm not ready to take them off the No. 1 spot in the AFC.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

I'd like to direct you to the NBA's stats page for the month of March, at least as of 11:18 p.m. on March 17. When you sort all players by the number of points they're scoring on average this month, you see the league's holy trinity scrunched together in the teens with one unusual name sandwiched between them. Coming in at No. 14, with 26.6 points per game, is Stephen Curry. At No. 16, with 26 points per game, is LeBron James. At No. 17, with 25.9 points per game, is Kevin Durant. Par for the course, right? Three legends all topping 25 points per game this month. Wait, who was that guy you mentioned before, the outlier in that group?

It's Quentin Grimes, folks, nestled just between Curry and James at 26.4 points per game this month, and if you've watched much of the Philadelphia 76ers over the past few weeks you likely consider the comparison to three all-time greats appropriate. For most of the first five years of his career, Grimes was a perfectly serviceable player. He's been the starting shooting guard on a playoff team and a consistently useful role player for several franchises. Someone you'd be happy to have on your team, but not someone you'd ever expect to build your team around.

But ever since he landed in Philadelphia, he's been a superstar. Mirages like this can happen. Remember when T.J. Warren turned into Michael Jordan in the bubble? It's similarly plausible that we're witnessing the beginning of something, a breakout that could translate into something much bigger for Grimes. Goran Dragić didn't become a full-time starter until his fifth season, and then became an All-NBA player in his sixth. Kyle Lowry didn't make his first All-Star team until his ninth season. Chauncey Billups was a journeyman before he was a Finals MVP. Player development isn't always linear.

So, for lack of a better way of putting this, what's the deal? What is happening here? What does it mean for Grimes? For the 76ers? And for the teams that don't currently employ him? Let's try to figure that out here, starting with Grimes and then working our way outward.

Well, it might be too early to call him a star, but this isn't just a hot shooting streak. Not only is Grimes shooting ""only"" 37.7% on 3-pointers, but he is currently sporting by far the lowest 3-point attempt rate of his career. Entering Monday's action, only 46.2% of his shots as a 76er have come from deep. Everywhere else he's played, more than half of his shots were triples, and for his career, nearly 65% of his shots have been 3s. He's already made twice as many 2s as a 76er (85) as he did all of last season.

These aren't easy looks, either. Let's go back to his best full season before this one, the 2022-23 campaign for the Knicks. A staggering 89.7% of his field goals were assisted. He was, almost exclusively, a catch-and-shoot player. But in Philadelphia? More than half of his shots (50.4) have been unassisted. Now, that's not quite a superstar level. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is unassisted on 75.3% of his field goals, the high-water mark in the superstar class. But Grimes is still in pretty good company here. Players like Desmond Bane, Tyler Herro and Coby White are all in his ballpark. All very good scorers Grimes would do well to emulate.

Most of this growth as a self-creator is coming as a driver. Since arriving in Philadelphia, Grimes is averaging 9.3 drives per game and shooting 60.9% on those drives. That field goal percentage isn't sustainable. Gilgeous-Alexander, the NBA's drive king, is at 57.9% and even that figure at meaningful volume for a guard is historic. 

Grimes is shooting over 70% in the restricted area. That's MVP territory, and if Grimes keeps it up, well, we're going to be having a different, more involved conversation a year or two from now. For now, he's driving at roughly the rate that players like Zach LaVine and Anfernee Simons do. These are players who mix driving and jump-shooting well, and again, players Grimes would be lucky to consider contemporaries. If he keeps scoring in the 97th percentile in terms of isolation efficiency, he easily could.

There's a reasonable amount of March skepticism going around here. It's valid. Weird things happen in March. Teams are resting up for the playoffs. Other teams are tanking. It's not the highest quality basketball even by regular-season standards. But ask the Houston Rockets how much respect they had for Grimes on Tuesday as he torched them for 46 points. In a game that Houston badly needed for seeding purposes, they trapped and face-guarded him on critical possessions.

Now, to be fair, Houston felt comfortable guarding him like this because he's playing on a tanking roster, but consider the alternative. If Grimes can score 46 with all of the attention that comes with being a No. 1 option, what would he look like with a better team around him? The truth there is complicated. Grimes is never getting relegated to ""camp out in the corner"" duties again, but it's unclear just how many shots are available on a roster that includes Joel Embiid, Paul George, Tyrese Maxey, Jared McCain and, potentially, a top-six pick next season. That reality helps create one of the most fascinating divides between player and team in recent NBA history. Right now, Grimes and the 76ers want entirely different things.

By now, you're likely all aware of what's happening in Philadelphia. If the ping pong balls on lottery night grant the 76ers a pick anywhere between No. 1 and No. 6, they keep it. If their pick comes in at No. 7 or later, it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder. For a multitude of reasons, they badly need to keep that pick. Grimes, right now, is their biggest impediment to doing so. He is winning them games that they would rather lose.

There's an irony to this, because as badly as the 76ers need to keep that pick, Grimes is probably better off in a world in which they don't. Think about the offseason that's awaiting him. He's a restricted free agent. It tends to be very difficult for restricted free agents to get paid fair value on the open market because teams with cap space know that their former employer can just match the deal. Therefore, Grimes' best chance at getting paid is with the 76ers.

That's where this gets tricky. Philly is already paying max money to Embiid, George and Maxey. The books are already tight. Lottery picks aren't expensive in the grand scheme of the NBA, but they are when you're working to avoid one of the aprons. Whether or not Philadelphia has a firm budget set for next season is unclear. Perhaps the 76ers are comfortable going into the second apron. But they likely will have some hard line in the sand, and the longer Grimes keeps this up, the more he's worth. He should prefer Philadelphia's books remain as clear as possible so that all of the extra money goes to him rather than a rookie.

It has never been more important to the 76ers to play poorly than it is right now. It has also never been more important to Grimes to play well than it is right now. Their incentives are directly contradicting. Are there steps the 76ers could take against this? Potentially, but none are especially clean. The NBA is keeping a close eye on the team as it relates to the player participation policy at the moment, so pulling him out of the lineup entirely without a legitimate injury isn't exactly plausible. They could, however, pull him out of games late, just as the Raptors have been doing with some of their key players recently.

The danger in doing so, of course, is that it risks angering Grimes, his agents and the NBPA. He's trying to set himself up for free agency and limiting his minutes when he's playing the best basketball of his career would actively make it more difficult to do so. That's a headache the 76ers probably don't want. They could work to quietly agree to a new contract unofficially behind the scenes that comes with certain caveats that pertain to the rest of the season, but aside from the fact that any agreement would be unenforceable at this point, the 76ers don't exactly have a great reputation when it comes to these sorts of backdoor dealings. Ask James Harden what he thinks of Daryl Morey nowadays. While we'll never know for certain, there have certainly been rumors about broken financial promises there.

So for now, Grimes will probably just continue to play a significant role for the 76ers. If he keeps playing this well, Nick Nurse won't be able to keep him off of the floor. Philadelphia will probably win a few more games than it wants to. But at least when the dust settles, the Sixers will have the ability to keep this improved version of Grimes on their team long-term. The same can't be said for his previous employers. So the question here becomes... how badly did they mess up?

The Luka Dončić trade was and remains one of the most inexplicable decisions any team has ever made. Grimes' ascent has led some to lump the two moves together as examples of Nico Harrison's incompetence. The story isn't quite that simple, though no version of it paints the Mavericks in a favorable light.

Now, the brazenly financial motivations behind Harrison's decision to trade Grimes do warrant some derision. Grimes is, as we've covered, an impending restricted free agent. Caleb Martin, with an ostensibly similar skill set, is locked into a reasonably affordable long-term deal. The single biggest reason the Mavericks swapped Grimes for Martin was cost certainty. There just isn't another obvious explanation for the decision. Grimes is five years younger than Martin. Neither stood out statistically. Martin has the stronger playoff track record. Grimes had flashed more upside on tape. It was a bad trade, but not for the same reasons that the Dončić deal was.

Nobody knew Grimes was this good. Should the Mavericks have known? Well, maybe, but by that logic, the New York Knicks surely should have known, right? They had him in the building for more than two years. They traded him to Detroit for peanuts at the 2024 deadline. The Pistons had him for a few months and then inexplicably handed him to Dallas on a silver platter in the middle of a necessary Tim Hardaway Jr. cap dump. The Mavericks might be incompetent, but the Knicks and Pistons aren't. Three teams dumped this guy within a single year.

The decision for the Knicks made some degree of sense. Grimes was quite good as a second-year starter in 2023, but visibly lost confidence when free-agent addition Donte DiVincenzo emerged as New York's starting shooting guard a year ago. The Knicks had time to rehabilitate his value, but ultimately would have struggled to pay him long-term if he had returned to form. Instead, they turned him into players they thought could help right away. They didn't, but Bojan Bogdanovic's contract at least proved useful as a money-matching tool for Mikal Bridges. Ultimately, it's just hard to imagine Grimes surviving the Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns trades even if the Knicks had kept him at the 2024 deadline. There was never a starting role there for him once DiVincenzo took his job, and Deuce McBride was clearly ready to become the top bench guard.

Injuries limited him to just six games as a Piston. They were not good ones, as Grimes shot a laughable 9 of 42 from the field. If there were glimpses of his potential in there somewhere, they weren't evident. The Pistons could have used Grimes this season, but he didn't exactly fill a need. They knew Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey would be their starting backcourt. They took on Hardaway in that Dallas trade, planned to sign Malik Beasley and had Marcus Sasser waiting in the wings. Guard minutes were at a premium. If Grimes had remained with the Pistons, it likely would have been in a smaller role at least to start the season.

So that explains the situation for Detroit and New York. For Dallas, fingers should be pointed at Jason Kidd as much as Harrison. For whatever reason, the coach of the Mavericks just never developed the trust for Grimes that his performance suggests he should have earned. Grimes was having the best shooting season of his career in Dallas. His defense isn't quite as good as it was at its peak in New York, but he has good tools and at least works hard on that end of the floor. Yet Grimes played inconsistently, averaging 22.8 minutes as a Maverick, but with pretty wild swings depending on team health and game-to-game performance. The Mavericks badly needed someone to step into a bigger scoring role earlier in the season when Dončić and Kyrie Irving were injured. Grimes was sitting right there and Kidd didn't notice him. That's a failure on his part as much as trading him is one on Harrison's.

By all means, consider the trade a disaster for Dallas. It's not as though the Mavericks are lacking in that department. But this notion that they should have known what he was going to become as a 76er feels a bit unfair. The Knicks and Pistons didn't know either, nor did the broader basketball-viewing public. There weren't obvious signs that this was coming, but now Grimes is here. The 76ers have, either through shrewd scouting or sheer, dumb luck landed on one of this season's breakout players. Clearly, that's making it harder for them to succeed at the current goal of failing, but down the line, it hopefully gives them another core player to build around moving forward.

Welcome to the Tuesday edition of the Pick Six newsletter! 

We are now in Day 8 of Aaron Rodgers watch and nothing has changed. Apparently, Rodgers has enjoyed being a free agent so much that he plans on being a free agent forever. 

Rodgers hasn't given any hints about where he might end up, two teams are definitely interested in signing him (Steelers and Giants) and one other team might be interested (Vikings). Aaron, if you're reading, Cam Heyward really wants to you to just MAKE A DECISION ALREADY. 

OK, that's your daily Rodgers update, and now, we will not be mentioning him for the rest of the newsletter. Actually, I just read the rest of the newsletter and it turns out that we will be mentioning him once more, but THAT'S it. 

Anyway, we've got some more free agency grades today, plus we'll be ranking every team in the AFC so we can see if any of the teams actually got better in free agency. 

As always, here's your daily reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter. To get them signed up, all you have to do is click here. 

During the start of free agency last week, we were handing out grades based on how teams did during each day of free agency. Today, we're handing out grades based on how each team did overall in free agency. 

Our team of graders included Tyler Sullivan, Jordan Dajani and Garrett Podell and they were ruthless: Only four teams in the NFL ended up getting a grade in the ""A"" range. 

Let's check four grades that they handed out: 

We have grades for every team and you can check those out here.  

Now that the first wave of free agency is out of the way, we thought it would be a good time to rank every team in the NFL, so that's exactly what we're going to do today. Actually, I take that back, we're only going to rank the AFC teams today. We'll get to the NFC teams later in the week. 

With that mind, here's our post-free agency rankings of each AFC team, courtesy of Jordan Dajani: 

1. Chiefs2. Bills3. Ravens4. Broncos5. Bengals6. Texans7. Chargers8. Steelers9. Dolphins10. Raiders

The one thing that instantly stands out to me about these rankings is that the AFC West could be stacked in 2025. Not only did the division send three teams to the playoffs last year, but it's the only division with all four of its teams ranked in Jordan's top 10. 

Anyway, we only listed the top 10 AFC teams here. If you want to see how Jordan ranked all 16 AFC teams, then you'll have to check out the rest of his rankings here. 

With Ja'Marr Chase getting a contract on Sunday that will pay him $40.25 million per year, that means he's now the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. 

If you're wondering who else is on that list, Jeff Kerr has the answer. Let's take a look at the nine highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the NFL based on average annual salary:

1. Ja'Marr Chase: $40.25 million2. Myles Garrett: $40 million3. Maxx Crosby: $35.5 million4. Justin Jefferson: $35 millionT-5. CeeDee Lamb: $34 millionT-5. Nick Bosa: $34 million7. A.J. Brown: $32 million8. Chris Jones: $31.75 million9. Amon-Ra St. Brown: $30.002 million

If you're wondering which positions NFL teams value the most, this list would seem to answer that question. There are nine names and they all play one of two positions: Receiver or pass rusher. 

The top spot on this list changed hands three times in an 11-day period. Crosby was at the top on March 5 after signing an extension from the Raiders. Garrett moved past Crosby on March 9 when he signed his new deal and Chase passed them both with his new contract on March 16. 

Although Chase holds the title now, he might not have it for very long. Micah Parsons will be getting an extension soon from the Cowboys and he could top the Bengals receiver. Also, Aidan Hutchinson is now eligible for an extension and it won't be surprising if he also gets to or passes Chase's number.

It's been almost a week since free agency officially started and although most of the top players have already been signed, there are still plenty of solid players on the market. 

So who's still out there? Glad you asked. Jeff Kerr decided to take a look at the top available player at each position. Let's check out who's still on the market on the offensive side of the ball. 

QB: Aaron RodgersRB: J.K. DobbinsWR: Stefon DiggsTE: Tyler ConklinOT: Joe Noteboom C: David AndrewsOG: Teven Jenkins

NFL teams are always trying to get younger, so you probably won't be surprised to learn that five of the seven players on this list are already 30 or will be 30 by the time the 2025 season starts. If you want to check out the best remaining defensive free agents, you can do there here. On Friday, we'll be closing out the week by taking a look at the top 10 free agents who are still available. 

Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot spent the offseason saying that his team would NOT be releasing Kirk Cousins, and he wasn't kidding. Although there was some speculation that Cousins might be released, the Falcons ended up holding on to him even though he had a $10 million roster bonus for 2026 that became fully guaranteed as of 4 p.m. ET on Saturday (Cousins was going to be entitled to the bonus if he was still on the roster, and of course, he's still on the roster). 

So why did the Falcons end up holding on to Cousins? It make sense for two seasons:

Quarterbacks are a valuable commodity in the NFL, so it wouldn't have made sense for the Falcons to just let Cousins walk away. It will certainly be awkward if he's still on the roster come Week 1, so it won't be surprising at all if he ends up getting traded, but for now, he's still on Atlanta's roster sitting right behind Michael Penix Jr. on the depth chart. 

The Browns are apparently ready to pounce on Cousins if he ever gets released, but it's unclear if they'd be willing to make a trade for him. 

It's been a busy 24 hours the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you.

Welcome to Marcello's Mailbag, where college football is always at the top of the pile. This is a safe space to share opinions and ask questions without fear or ridicule. No question is dumb, though you may believe there are dumb answers. Luckily, I'm willing to look like a jester, but more often than not, I'll fill your mind with the information you need to understand the most magical sport in the world.

We're quickly approaching the opening of the 2025 NCAA Tournament, the most exciting week in college sports, but that doesn't mean college football is on the backburner. Most schools have started spring drills as they introduce new players, a few superstar transfers and attempt to make sense of their depth charts before the transfer portal opens again in April.

We already have coaches openly campaigning for future players in the portal while also facing the reality of cutting players to meet new 105-man roster guidelines tied to the House v. NCAA settlement.

What does that mean for the upcoming portal cycle? It might not be as crazy as past years, but plenty of fringe players -- scholarship-worthy walk-ons and backups -- will enter the portal in April looking for new homes that may no longer exist because of roster limits. Coaches have been dealing with this new reality behind the scenes since January, but now that the spring semester has hit the midpoint, decisions need to be made as coaches cut 20-plus players from their locker rooms this summer.

The madness never ends for college football coaches.

Meanwhile, March Madness is in full swing, whetting our whistles and feeding our appetites for controversy. West Virginia was inexplicably left out of the Big Dance in favor of North Carolina, which was only 1-12 in Quad 1 games. (Who knew Rich Rodriguez banning TikTok dances would lead to the NCAA Tournament not inviting the Mountaineers to the Big Dance?)

The week provides us with an opportunity to reexamine how the College Football Playoff's Selection Committee makes its decisions and how its process is unnecessarily clandestine compared to the NCAA Tournament's Selection Committee, which utilizes data that is readily available to the public.

I'll explain that and much more in this week's mailbag … just as soon as I finish editing my latest TikTok dance.

Ed Helinski (X): Who might have the best CFB head coaching gig? And, on the flip side, who has the worst?

Context is king. What do you value as a head coach? Job security? Living situation? Ease of winning championships? I'm not sure you can label a blue blood job the best gig in the sport when you can be out of a job after two seasons. Sure, the highs are incredibly fulfilling and success usually leads to bigger paydays and a more substantial legacy, but does that potentially make it the best job in America?

Ryan Day is now one of the highest-paid coaches in the sport. He solidified himself as a legend at Ohio State after winning the national title in January, but just one month earlier, fans were booing him out of The Horseshoe, and extremists made death threats, prompting Day to hire security to protect his family around the clock. Anything less than a national title would have elicited calls for his job. Yes, the same coach who has the highest win percentage (70-10, .875) in the FBS since Knute Rockne (.881) led Notre Dame in the 1920s.

Day gets paid handsomely to deal with the pressure -- and so do the coaches at top-20 schools like Alabama, Tennessee and Michigan, but is it worth it in the long run? Yes, but only if you're winning.

So, regarding living conditions, job security, salary and a navigable path to a championship, the best job in college football is at Air Force. The head coach there deals with well-disciplined men on a strict schedule, and more importantly, he doesn't have to worry about NIL or the transfer portal. The three service academies in the FBS forbid players from accepting payments, which means no late-night contract negotiations with players or overzealous agents demanding more money. In Colorado Springs, Troy Calhoun has built a contender in the Mountain West where he's won two divisional titles and recorded five double-digit win seasons in 18 years leading the Falcons. His name comes up for jobs at more prominent programs every other year, and he hasn't taken the bait. He's got a good thing going there.

Job security? You've got it at Air Force. Fisher DeBerry served 23 years as the head coach before he retired, paving the way for Calhoun to lead the program for the better part of the last three decades. 

In the era of roster fluidity, Air Force maintains consistency in the locker room, allowing coaches to develop players in a winning system. Most coaches jump into the profession to make an impact on young men and create hallmark memories and long-lasting relationships. That disappears as players move from team to team through the portal.

The worst job in America? ULM. Its lack of resources, tradition and location gives it an unwanted title. Terry Bowden was fired a little over a year ago after he served as more of a fundraiser than a head coach. Bryant Vincent somehow won five games in his first year leading the program last season, a tremendous achievement considering the circumstances he inherited. Indeed, the Warhawks have had one winning season in the previous 32 years.

Ben Weinberg (X): Any chance the committee/CFP operation becomes more transparent with the metrics they use for strength of schedule/record, etc to be more like the basketball selection committee?

I don't see it. Whenever I've asked whether the committee would consider sharing the metrics they utilize with the public, I get non-answers from the CFP. I participated in a mock selection exercise three years ago in Dallas, and we used the same database of statistics and sabermetrics as the real committee that picks the 12 teams. SportSource Analytics provides the data, but it is not readily available to the public. More troublesome to me is that fans believe the metrics they see on ESPN's CFP TV shows -- the strength of schedule, quality wins, etc. -- with what the committee uses. Those are ESPN's in-house numbers pulled from their own formulas, not necessarily what the committee utilizes behind the scenes. It makes for a muddied presentation.

I also wrote about this in December. CFP selection chairman Warde Manuel told me he would ""leave that up to the commissioners to determine"" whether the CFP should be more transparent with data.

You know, it's funny. We eliminated the BCS because it relied on computer ratings. Now that we're allowing humans to make selections, there's a renewed push to insert more formulas to guide the system. I'm all for it, to be honest. SEC commissioner Greg Sankey echoed those sentiments last week.

""It came fully human-driven, and there are some background metrics, but perhaps there's a balance that we could explore,"" he told The Post and Courier.

Why not get the smartest analytics people in a room together and have them develop a computer ratings system that is weighed into the CFP's weekly top 25? The well-respected Bill Connelly at ESPN would be a good start.

In the end, I'm not sure that happens, either. The Big Ten and SEC are pushing for multiple automatic qualifiers, and even in a 14-team playoff, we could be on course for a system that needs only one at-large selection starting in 2026. The selection committee's power may soon diminish considerably.

John (X): Considering Northern Illinois' move to split football (Mountain West) from the other sports (Horizon), will the G5 lead the way in college realignment before the big TV deals are done in 2030?

Yes, but realignment probably won't be substantial. The Pac-12 still needs one more football member, but the conference is slow-playing expansion while seeking feedback on the value of its future media rights before pitching itself again to potential members. I know that half a dozen schools in the AAC and Mountain West have publicly remained committed to staying in their respective conferences after pursuits by the Pac-12 and MWC, but that could change with the right amount of money from the Pac-12. 

I believe the Pac-12's top target has been -- and still should be -- Memphis. The question is whether the Pac-12 has the money to pull the Tigers out West. Memphis administrators were unhappy with the figures presented in the fall, so they pulled out of discussions and remained in the AAC. After a year of studying how extensive travel schedules have affected teams like Cal and Stanford in the ACC, sinking resources into a move across the country might be a no-go.

At this point, the smaller conferences must prepare to backfill their leagues. There is no active effort to aggressively expand in the MAC, Conference USA or AAC. The only TV contracts that expire before the first major conference deal (Big Ten) are in the MAC (2027) and CUSA (2028). I don't see those two conferences making any big moves unless they are forced to do so by aggressive efforts out West, and it appears the Pac-12 is content to add just one more member. I'm not sure that's an AAC member. Texas State and UNLV make the most sense to me, but that's me talking out of the side of my mouth.

Welcome to Week 2 of Aaron Rodgers watch, as we await the 2025 decision from one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. Maybe Rodgers hasn't looked like a star quarterback since 2021, but there's still a market for him this offseason. Will he join the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Steelers or retire? Or maybe there's another option. 

According to The Athletic, Rodgers is waiting to hear back from the Minnesota Vikings concerning their potential interest in him. This was reported late last week, so it's anyone's guess when the Vikings will get back to Rodgers -- or when he will make his final decision. Then again, after we saw Rodgers walking the sand in his backward hat, donning a blanket with his headphones in, maybe retirement is very much in play. 

Rodgers is now 41 years old, and he's a very accomplished player. The Green Bay Packers legend is a Super Bowl champion (XLV), Super Bowl MVP, four-time NFL MVP, 10-time Pro Bowler, two-time NFL passing touchdowns leader and currently No. 7 on the all-time passing yards list with 62,952 yards. Rodgers has also made the most money in NFL history. Did you know that?

Some point to Kirk Cousins as the legendary money master since he's been franchise-tagged so many times. Others would imagine it's the GOAT, Tom Brady. Nope. It's actually Rodgers.

Check out the top 10 highest earners in NFL history, via Over The Cap.

QB Aaron Rodgers

2005‑present

$381,692,206

QB Matthew Stafford

2009‑present

$364,000,000

QB Tom Brady

2000‑2022

$317,619,794

QB Matt Ryan

2008‑2022

$306,205,882

QB Russell Wilson

2012‑present

$305,340,123

QB Kirk Cousins

2012‑present

$293,969,288

QB Drew Brees

2001‑2020

$273,933,000

QB Ben Roethlisberger

2004‑2021

$266,724,382

QB Peyton Manning

1998‑2015

$247,714,000

QB Dak Prescott 

2016-present

$247,687,392

So, Rodgers doesn't exactly need the money in 2025. He's done pretty well for himself! But money still could be something that drags this process out even more.

The Miami Heat lost again on Monday, this time a 116-95 defeat at the hands of the the New York Knicks, who outscored the Heat by 23 in the second half. With that result, the Heat have now dropped eight games in a row, which is their longest losing streak under long-time coach Erik Spoelstra. 

""We're all getting tested, including myself,"" said Spoelstra, who has been in charge in Miami since 2008. ""No one's absolved from this. I've not come up with enough answers for this team. I have to do a better job. Our group has to do a better job.

""We have to put our feet into the dirt and hold our ground at this point. You always have a choice. It doesn't mean you're going to win, necessarily. ... But [you at least have] to make some strides. And you could see that in some of the losses over the last three weeks, where it felt like we were making strides. The last two games haven't felt like that.""

The Heat have had some solid performances during this skid, including narrow defeats to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Minnesota Timberwolves. They even had a fourth-quarter lead on the Boston Celtics before the defending champions pulled away in the final minutes. 

But, as Spoelstra noted, the Heat have let go of the rope in their last two outings. Their 34-point loss the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday and their 21-point loss to the Knicks were two of their four largest margins of defeat this season. 

Everyone knew the Heat would be worse after trading Jimmy Butler to the Golden State Warriors in the culmination of a drawn-out saga, but no one expected it would be this bad. After all, Butler had only played 25 games with them this season and on the night of the deal they beat the Philadelphia 76ers to move to 25-24. Plus, they've always been able to find a way to cobble things together. 

But not this season. They're 4-15 since the Butler trade. Only the openly tanking Sixers and Utah Jazz have been worse in that stretch. 

All of this losing has put the Heat in an interesting spot. They've dropped to 10th place in the Eastern Conference, but are still 5.5 games up on the 11th-place Toronto Raptors, so they're going to make the Play-In Tournament. Their 2025 first-round pick belongs to the Oklahoma City Thunder, but is protected 1-14 this year before becoming unprotected in 2026. 

Tanking the rest of the way and getting bounced from the Play-In Tournament would ensure they keep their pick this year and can add another lottery talent to the roster. That would also mean the Thunder are getting their 2026 first no matter what. If Pat Riley is confident he can reshape the roster this summer and get the Heat back in the mix in the Eastern Conference next season, that would be no big deal. But if not, or if injuries arise, there's a very real path where the Heat have to hand over a top-10 or even a top-five pick to the Thunder.

The less risky path for the Heat, which is easier said than done, would be to make the playoffs this season via the Play-In Tournament. In that scenario, they'd give the Thunder their first rounder this year, which would be in the 15-18 range, but regain control over their 2026 first. The fact that they own the Warriors' 2025 first (protected 1-10) would help offset losing their own 2025 pick. 

This isn't a simple either/or where the Heat get to make a decision, because they're dependent on the outcome of games and the East Play-In field isn't exactly a murderer's row. But if it were, it would be interesting to know which choice the Heat's front office would make.

The Major League Baseball season officially starts with a two-game series between the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs, opening Tuesday in Tokyo. Among many other things, this series brings the biggest baseball star in the world, Shohei Ohtani, to his home country to start the season following his third MVP award. 

The two-way super-duper star did an exclusive, sit-down interview with CBS Evening News in anticipation of the series. 

""I'm not perfect, but I'm grateful for being here right now, including all the imperfections,"" Ohtani told CBS News correspondent Adam Yamaguchi. ""I'm also really thankful to the people in America who helped develop and bring baseball to Japan.""

While Ohtani continues to break records never imagined before, including becoming the first player to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a single season, the comparisons never stop. One of the easiest? Babe Ruth, one of the few players to both pitch and hit, as Ohtani does.

""Babe Ruth is definitely one of the players I respect, so being compared to or uses as an example alongside such a player is something I always feel is very special for me,"" Ohtani said.

But for today's baseball-playing youth, Ohtani is their hero, the man who can do what almost no one else can and do it better than almost everyone else. That spotlight comes with pressure, both on and off the field.

""It really means a lot to me when kids who play baseball say they want to be like Shohei Ohtani,"" he said. ""I feel a strong responsibility to make sure I don't let those kids down.""

Thus far, he sure hasn't let anyone down on the field.  

Ohtani, 30, hit .310/.390/.646 (190 OPS+) with 38 doubles, seven triples, 54 home runs, 130 RBI, 134 runs, 59 steals and 9.2 WAR last season, winning his first NL MVP after taking AL MVP in two of the previous three seasons. When he didn't win, in 2022, he was the runner-up. He was relegated to DH duty last season, staying off the mound as he rehabbed from major elbow surgery. He'll return to pitching later this season but will open the year as the Dodgers' DH as they chase down a repeat World Series trophy.

After a 26-10 season and second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance in 2021-22, Fran McCaffery appeared to be in a strong spot with Iowa basketball. The Hawkeyes, however, have fallen off since that point, failing to reach the 20-win plateau the past three years and missing the NCAA Tournament the past two. Iowa athletic director Beth Goetz fired McCaffery last Friday, opening up the Iowa basketball coaching search for the first time in more than 15 years. While Iowa isn't viewed as an easy place to win, the Hawkeyes play in an elite conference and have had pockets of success recently. If you love the Hawkeyes, or just want to know who will be calling the shots for Iowa in the future, be sure to see what the proven team of experts are saying at Hawkeye Insider, the 247Sports affiliate that covers Iowa.

Hawkeye Insider's Iowa experts are providing on-the-ground updates on every development surrounding McCaffery's firing and the future of the Iowa basketball program, including insights from Sean Bock and David Eickholt, both of whom have deep-rooted ties inside the Iowa program.

One name the staff has identified as a potential target on the Iowa basketball coaching hot board is Drake head coach Ben McCollum. He became the head coach at Northeast Missouri State at just 27 and it looked like he might be in over his head after back-to-back losing seasons to begin his tenure.

He got the program turned around in Year 3, however, going 22-7. From there, he made the NCAA Division II tournament every year but one and won four D-II national titles before leaving for Drake in 2024. He had no problem in his transition to Division I, going 30-3 this season and winning the Missouri Valley Conference.

He grew up in Iowa and now coaches just over 100 miles away from Iowa's campus, making him a logical Iowa basketball coaching candidate as this search progresses. See more candidates at Hawkeye Insider.

We're now more than a week into NFL free agency, which means we have more to look back on than we do to look forward to. Most of the most impactful signings happen during that first week, which is obviously in the rearview mirror at this point.

This season, it seems like most of the true impact players changing teams in free agency were on defense. Among the top 20 highest-paid non-quarterbacks who changed teams so far this offseason, 15 of them were defensive players, according to Spotrac.

With that in mind, we want to take a look at some of the most interesting signings that happened on the less glamorous side of the ball. The key word to keep in mind there is interesting, and that can be on a schematic level or some other level, but it doesn't necessarily mean it has to include the most expensive or noteworthy players. (Although the list below obviously does include some of those players.) In the space below, we're touching on 11 different signings, though a few of them come in pairs because there were several teams that double dipped in defensive free agency. 

Without further ado ...

Minnesota already had one of the NFL's best and most fascinating defenses in 2024, with Brian Flores scheming things up and a host of fast, athletic, versatile players stacking each level of the unit. But the weakness of that unit was on the defensive interior. 

On runs up the middle, according to Tru Media, the Vikings allowed 1.73 yards before contact per attempt -- a mark that ranked 26th in the NFL. Their interior defensive linemen combined for only 75 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. Neither Allen nor Hargrave was fully healthy in 2024, but when they were in 2023, Allen had 49 pressures on his own and Hargrave had 52. If these two can stay on the field, it will be a massive upgrade.

Do you know how much fun it's going to be to have Davis and Christian Gonzalez playing across from each other at cornerback? Whooooo boy. These are two big, physical corners who will beat you up and make sure you remember the next day that you played against them. That's already an interesting enough look for a defense these days, where a true elite cornerback duo is kind of a rarity.

But then you drop Williams into the middle of the defensive line and things get even more interesting. If Christian Barmore is able to return from his blood-clot issue, then the Pats will have a star duo on the defensive interior, as well. With those guys both pushing the pocket and knifing through blocks in the run game, guys like Robert Spillane, Harold Landry, Ja'Whaun Bentley and more should be put in position to succeed.

Sweat is reuniting with his former defensive coordinator in Philadelphia, as Jonathan Gannon is now entering his third year as the Cardinals head coach. Sweat had the best years of his career playing for Gannon, notching a combined 18.5 sacks, 36 quarterback hits and 22 tackles for loss across two seasons. His 89 combined pressures were 38th in the NFL during that span, but his 40 combined sacks, tackle for loss, forced fumbles, pass breakups and interceptions ranked 17th. Arizona desperately needed a high-level player coming off the edge, and we know Sweat can succeed in this system.

Lawrence has his health issues (he barely played last season due to another foot injury), but he is a dynamite two-way edge whenever he's on the field, and it's hard to think of a better fit for Mike Macdonald's defense. Lawrence is so, so good against the run and the way he wins as a pass rusher (with power and by pushing the pocket rather than always screaming around the end of the line) makes sense for what Macdonald wants to do with his defensive ends. If he can stay on the field, this is a terrific fit. 

As we wrote last week when naming him one of our best value signings, Ford is coming off a really solid year with the Chargers during which he picked up 21 run stops and 23 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. He's a really good run stopper and he's flashed some more pass-rush usefulness in recent seasons. Placing him on the defensive line with Jared Verse, Braden Fiske, Kobie Turner and Byron Young should make for a really fun, flexible group.

New defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo's defense in Cincinnati was at its best when he had a bunch of solid veterans in the secondary who simply knew what they were doing. Bynum and Ward fit that description, but they're also much more than that. Bynum is more than the guy who came up with the cool celebrations for the Vikings defense. He can play up high, in the box and in the slot. He can cover and he can blitz. Ward is a true No. 1 cornerback coming off a very trying season on a personal level, and clearly the hope is a fresh start in a new situation will allow him to get back to being the player he was in previous years.

Both of these guys have injury issues. Greenlaw returned last season after suffering an Achilles tear in the Super Bowl two seasons ago, while Hufanga missed a combined 17 games over the last two seasons due to various ailments. But if they can stay healthy ... Well, then the fit in Vance Joseph's defense is excellent. Denver needed some second-level help, especially up the middle, and got it with two of the top players on the market at their respective positions.

The New York Knicks and Miami Heat were playing a relatively competitive game for the better part of three quarters Monday night. The Heat led by 11 after a quarter, but the Knicks pulled within two at halftime and even took a slim lead early in the third quarter. Then, with the Knicks leading 64-58, the game was paused. For approximately 10 minutes, the Heat and Knicks waited on the sidelines as staffers dealt with a situation court side.

So what happened? A fan sitting in a courtside seat vomited, and the crew needed to clean it up before play could resume. That fan, it turns out, was comedian Tracy Morgan, who grew up in the Bronx and frequently attends Knicks games as one of their most well-known celebrity fans. Morgan was later wheeled out of his seat, also seemingly dealing with a nosebleed.

Fans often spill things on the court, but they're typically fairly manageable. Staffers already wipe sweat off of the floor, so a drink isn't especially difficult to deal with. Vomit, obviously, is another matter, and something players wouldn't be comfortable trying to avoid. It's rare that a fan gets sick sitting courtside, but as Monday showed, it does happen.

After the delay, the Knicks closed the quarter on a 24-6 run to help secure a 116-95 victory despite the absence of star point guard Jalen Brunson. Their main concern for now, of course, is Morgan, who is beloved among Knicks fans for both his fandom and his body of work as a comedian.

Morgan provided an update on social media Tuesday morning, saying doctors told him he was dealing with a bout of food poisoning. The former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star also joked about pulling a similar move in the playoffs after it sparked a Knicks rally.

""Thank you for all your concern! I'm doing OK now and doctors say it was food poisoning,"" Morgan wrote in his post. ""Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you! 

""More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I'll have to break it out again in the playoffs.""

A post shared by Tracy Morgan (@tracymorgan)

Morgan is a fixture at Madison Square Garden, and everyone in the building surely hopes he'll feel well enough to support the team in the Knicks' upcoming playoff run. The 56-year-old has dealt with multiple serious health issues throughout his life, including undergoing a kidney transplant in 2010 and spending two weeks in a coma after a 2014 car crash.

Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said he has not had any conversations with the NCAA about a potential postseason ban stemming from the NCAA's investigation into allegations of impermissible scouting, according to 247Sports. Michigan has received a notice of allegations covering the purported sign-stealing scheme orchestrated by former football staffer Connor Stalions and in January filed a formal response. 

""I have not had any conversation about postseason bans or penalties that are coming,"" Manuel told 247Sports. ""What I can point to is that Charlie Baker, when we won the championship, said they won it fair and square. That's something I can say that gives me some sense that they understand that this was a team who won that championship fair and square. I look at that, and as we move forward, we'll see how it goes."" 

The Big Ten suspended former Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh for three games late in the 2024 season as a result of its own investigation into the sign-stealing scandal. Harbaugh was able to return to the sidelines in the Big Ten Championship Game and eventually led the Wolverines to a win against Washington in the College Football Playoff National Championship. 

""At the end of the day, no one believes at this point that Michigan didn't win the national title fair and square,"" Baker said after Michigan's national title win, as alluded to by Manuel. 

Manuel also told 247Sports that he hopes the NCAA will issue its final report ""by the end of the summer."" 

In its January response, Michigan accused the NCAA of ""grossly overreaching"" and ""wildly overcharging"" the university despite a lack of evidence, according to documents obtained by Yahoo Sports. The school contends that out of 52 games involving Michigan opponents that Stalions allegedly scouted, only one was attended by Stalions himself. 

Eight others were attended by then-Michigan staff members, while others were attended by friends and family, which is not an NCAA violation. The university alleges much of Stalions' sign-stealing operation was achieved through legal avenues, and not in a way that would provide an unfair advantage.

Legendary San Antonio Spurs coach and president Gregg Popovich is still recovering from a stroke he suffered in November and will not return to the sidelines this season. He hopes to coach again in the future, however, and recently addressed the team for the first time since his stroke. 

Spurs forward Keldon Johnson revealed what happened during that late-February meeting in an interview with ESPN, and it's clear that Popovich is still locked in on what's happening on the court. 

""Everybody shut the f--- up when he walked in,"" Johnson said. ""That's just how it's always been with Pop. Obviously, he's still recovering. But he was still cussing. 'Y'all need to play defense. Y'all need to rebound.' Knowing that, shit, he really is watching the games because he's calling out specific situations, was huge.

""It was what we needed. I feel like he brought that life, that spark. That Pop that we all knew and loved. He came into that meeting and that's who he was. It was like he didn't skip a beat.""

Popovich, 76 and already a Hall of Famer, has made excellent progress since November. Ramona Shelburne and Michael C. Wright reported in their story that, ""another source said the coach has advanced in five months of rehab to the point where many who suffer strokes progress over nine months."" 

But being an NBA coach requires far more than just being able to walk and lead team meetings. Will Popovich be healthy and strong enough to resume the full-time grind? That's still to be determined. What is clear, though, is that the Spurs will give Popovich every chance to resume his role. 

""It's Pop's decision,"" one person close to the situation told ESPN. ""He's earned that.""

This has been a difficult season in San Antonio even beyond Popovich's health scare. Star big man Victor Wembanyama was ruled out for the remainder of the season in February after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his shoulder, and recently acquired point guard De'Aaron Fox underwent season-ending surgery on his finger this month. 

After playing .500 ball through the first 36 games, the team has understandably struggled over the last two months. Now 28-39 on the season, the Spurs are four games out of a Play-In Tournament spot and headed for a sixth straight lottery appearance.

After what turned into a five-day Players Championship with Rory McIlroy defeating JJ Spaun in a playoff on Monday, the PGA Tour season continues with the 2025 Valspar Championship teeing off from the Copperhead Course at Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Florida, on Thursday, March 20. Spaun would have been a significant longshot victor at golf's ""fifth major"" at 110-1 odds before the tournament, compared to McIlroy who had one of the shortest odds of the weekend. Is there another sizeable longshot who can make a run and possibly capture the 2025 Valspar Championship?

Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele and Tommy Fleetwood are the 14-1 co-favorites (risk $100 to win $1,400) in the latest 2025 Valspar Championship odds, but longshots have dominated this event in recent years. Peter Malnati won last year at 350-1 odds for his first PGA Tour victory since 2015 and his odds have nearly tripled at 1000-1 (risk $100 to win $100,000) this week. Taylor Moore, who won in 2023, has 50-1 odds, so which longshots should you consider for 2025 Valspar Championship bets? 

SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since June 2020. This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters.

Now that the 2025 Valspar Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and revealed its longshot betting picks:

The 28-year-old has made the cut in each of his first six PGA Tour events this year and although he's still seeking his first top-10 result this season, Zalatoris is gaining momentum. He closed last year strong with a top-15 finish in the FedEx St. Jude Championship and BMW Championship after a tough summer that included four missed cuts, a withdrawal, and a T-42 finish over six tournaments spanning from the U.S. Open until finishing T-12 at the FedEx St. Jude Championship. His six straight made cuts are signs of the young golfer returning to the form that once made him one of the best in the world.

Zalatoris isn't far removed from being ranked inside the top 10 in the world when he withdrew from the 2022 BMW Championship due to a herniated disk in his back. The injury was a significant setback, but recent results show it may be behind him. With a weaker field this week, Zalatoris is one to watch for. FanDuel Sportsbook has Zalatoris priced at 25-1 odds: 

Kim missed the cut at last week's Players Championship, but that one result isn't indicative of his season thus far. The 31-year-old finished no worse than T-13 in his previous five tournaments entering the Players Championship, including a T-2 at the WM Phoenix Open in February and a top-five finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March. Kim has only three rounds of 70 or higher over his last four tournaments, including the Players Championship when he rallied with a 69 on the second day but finished one stroke off the cut line.

He is ninth on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained this year and his scrambling ability has been integral to his success. Kim is fourth on the PGA Tour in scrambling, including 15th from the sand, and has the fifth-best sand save percentage on tour this season. He's 18th in scoring average and 12th on Par 4s. Hopefully, Kim doesn't need to work himself out of trouble, but he's proven capable of doing so if needed. 

The No. 1 ranked amateur in the world secured his PGA Tour card after finishing T-18 at the Cognizant Classic on March 2. It was his second top-20 result in four PGA Tour events this year as Clanton finished T-15 at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's still dominating at Florida State, coming off a tournament victory last weekend, to continue to cement himself as the world's top amateur. 

The 2025 Valspar Championship competition will certainly be a step up from his latest college tournament, but with many of the top golfers on the PGA Tour skipping this weekend, the model projects strong value in Clanton at 50-1. The 21-year-old projects to be a PGA Tour staple in the near future and he already has three top-five finishes in 12 career PGA Tour events. Clanton finished second at the John Deere Classic and RSM Classic last year and has the potential to be the latest longshot winner at the Copperhead Course.

The Copperhead Course at Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Florida, has hosted the Valspar Championship since 2000, and it will serve as the host again this year when the 2025 Valspar Championship begins on Thursday, March 20. Longshots have been thriving at this event in recent years, including Peter Malnati winning at 350-1 last year. Despite winning the title in 2024, Malnati is a massive 1000-1 (risk $100 to win $100,000) longshot, according to the latest 2025 Valspar Championship odds. Xander Schauffele, Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood are the 14-1 co-favorites on the PGA odds board. Schauffele has an impressive streak of 59 consecutive made cuts, the most on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods from 1998-2005. Schauffele is +150 (risk $100 to win $150) to finish inside the top 10. 

Some of the other 2025 Valspar Championship contenders include Sam Burns (22-1), Corey Conners (25-1), Sepp Straka (25-1), Shane Lowry (25-1) and Will Zalatoris (25-1). Cameron Young recorded a runner-up finish at this event last year and is +900 (risk $100 to win $900) to crack the top five this week. Which golfers should you target with your 2025 Valspar Championship bets? Before locking in your 2025 Valspar Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.

SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.

This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics. 

Now that the 2025 Valspar Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.

One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Valspar Championship: Sam Burns, a five-time PGA Tour champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and doesn't even crack the top 10. Burns has had tremendous success at this event in recent years. He finished on top of the Valspar Championship leaderboard in 2021 and 2022 before finishing sixth in 2023. 

However, Burns has battled with inconsistency in 2025 after securing a T-8 finish at The Sentry in January. He's coming off a missed cut at the Players Championship and has finished T-48 or worse in three of his past four starts on the PGA Tour. The 28-year-old has struggled with accuracy off the tee this season, ranking 113th in driving accuracy (57.35%). Burns also ranks 117th in one-putt percentage ((38.89%) and 154th in strokes gained: approach to green (-0.514). He's not a strong pick to win it all and there are far better values in the 2025 Valspar Championship field. See who else to fade here. 

Another surprise: Alex Smalley, a 45-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.

Smalley is still searching for his first win on the PGA Tour, but he has all the tools needed to be in the mix at Innisbrook this week. He's been competitive this season, finishing T-18 or better in five of his first seven starts on the PGA Tour. He's coming off a T-14 showing at the Players Championship and is ranked second in scoring average (68.36), third in strokes gained: total (1.805) and 11th in strokes gained: off the tee (0.572). Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make him a strong value pick for your 2025 Valspar Championship bets. See who else to pick here. 

The model is also targeting two other golfers with odds of 40-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.

Who will win the 2025 Valspar Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Check out the 2025 Valspar Championship odds below and then visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors in 2024.

Michigan infielder Mitch Voit apologized for his celebration that imitated snorting cocaine following a triple in Sunday's 11-0 win over USC, calling it ""an immature decision in the heat of the moment"" on social media.

A post shared by Mitch Voit (@mitchvoit)

""I would like to apologize for my actions on third base yesterday,"" the apology reads. ""I made an immature decision in the heat of the moment. The gesture I made does not reflect my character, the household I was raised in, or the block M that I represent in any kind of way. I take full responsibility for what I did, and I am truly sorry to all those who I have negatively impacted by doing this.""

With the Wolverines leading 2-0 in the second inning, Voit hit a bases-clearing triple and slid into third base headfirst. He then mocked snorting the chalk of the third base line in a manner similar to how one would snort cocaine.

Voit, a junior, is a converted pitcher whose position change has worked magnificently so far. He leads the team in every major offensive category, hitting .451 with five home runs and 28 RBI on the season. He went 3 for 3 with a walk, three runs and four RBI against the Trojans on Sunday and was named Big Ten Player of the Week.

Major League Baseball is back, and for the first time in six years, MLB games will be played in Japan this season. The Chicago Cubs and defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers will open the 2025 regular season with two games in Tokyo starting early Tuesday morning in the States. The games will be played at the iconic Tokyo Dome, home of Nippon Professional Baseball's Yomiuri Giants. 

""I think it's a great way to start a season in terms of team bonding. It's tough to think of a better way,"" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said about the Tokyo Series (via MLB.com). ""We  could go play laser tag or something like that. Or we could go to  Japan. I like the Japan idea a  little better. You could do trust falls or these team-building things.  Or we could go to Japan. I like Japan better. Let's go to Japan and  play the Dodgers. That seems like more fun.""

No MLB team has more Japanese talent than these two. The Dodgers are of course led by the singular Shohei Ohtani, who will return to the mound later this year and join righties Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki in the rotation. The Cubs feature lefty Shota Imanaga and slugger Seiya Suzuki. Imanaga, Ohtani, Sasaki, Suzuki, and Yamamoto are five of the 15 Japanese players currently under contract with MLB teams. 

""The stadium doesn't hold 100 million people, which is approximately how many Japanese  people would love to see Shohei and Yoshi and Roki,"" Dodgers president Stan Kasten told USA Today last week. ""Everyone  appreciates the historic significance unlike any other international  adventure we've ever undertaken in baseball ... This is going to be off the charts."" 

The Cubs and Dodgers traveled to Japan last week and have spent the last few days participating in promotional events and also playing exhibition games. The Dodgers played the Yomiuri Giants on Saturday and the Hanshin Tigers on Sunday. The Cubs played Hanshin on Saturday and Yomiuri on Sunday. Those games were promotional as much as spring tune-ups. 

Here is the schedule and broadcast information for the two-game Tokyo Series: 

Tuesday, March 18 				

6 a.m. ET 				

RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto vs. LHP Shota Imanaga 				

Fox 				

Wednesday, March 19 				

6 a.m. ET 				

RHP Roki Sasaki vs. LHP Justin Steele 

FS1 				

The Dodgers are bringing Ohtani along slowly as he wraps up his elbow surgery rehab. He has yet to face batters in spring training and will not pitch in the Tokyo Series, which may be disappointing to him, but is for the greater good. The Dodgers and MLB want to put on a great show in Japan, for sure, but the Dodgers' ultimate goal is another World Series title. They're prioritizing the big picture with Ohtani.

Both Tokyo Series games will begin at 7 p.m. local time in Japan. They are night games in Tokyo and early morning games in the United States. Perhaps we should consider them very late night games for Dodgers fans in California? Either way, the 2025 regular season will begin with two games in Tokyo at atypical hours in the United States.

Here now are five things to know heading into the Tokyo Series. 

The last time MLB visited Japan, the Seattle Mariners swept two games from the then-Oakland Athletics, and those games are most notable for being the final two games of Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki's career. Suzuki went 0 for 5 with a walk in the two games, but no one cared about the results. The two games morphed into a celebration of Ichiro's career. 

Here is Ichiro's farewell series: 

""For me, it doesn't get better than tonight,"" Ichiro said following his final game. ""Nothing can top what happened tonight for me.""

This year's Tokyo Series will be MLB's sixth trip to Japan overall. Like this year's visit, all five prior trips to Japan have been two-game series played at the Tokyo Dome. Here are the league's previous five regular-season series played in Japan: 

March 29-30, 2000 				

Cubs vs. New York Mets 

First MLB games outside North America 				

March 20-31, 2004 				

New York Yankees vs. Tampa Bay Rays 

Hideki Matsui returns to former home stadium 				

March 25-26, 2008 				

Athletics vs. Boston Red Sox 

Daisuke Matsuzaka, Hideki Okajima return to Japan 				

March 28-29, 2012 				

Athletics vs. Mariners 				

Ichiro returns to Japan 				

March 20-21, 2019 				

Athletics vs. Mariners 				

Ichiro's final series 				

Ohtani is baseball's main character right now and he will undoubtedly receive the grandest ovations during the two games in Tokyo. He is the most popular person in Japan. Not the most popular athlete, the most popular person period. Ohtani's popularity transcends sports. Imanaga, Sasaki, Suzuki, and Yamamoto will also get a hero's welcome, for sure. 

Over the last decade or so, Japanese-born starting pitchers matching up in a regular-season game has become commonplace thanks to Ohtani, Yu Darvish, Hiroki Kuroda, Masahiro Tanaka, and others who've had long MLB careers. What used to happen maybe once a season, and sometimes even less often than that, happens a few times a year now. It's great for the game overall. 

Even still, the Imanaga vs. Yamamoto matchup on Tuesday will be historic. It will also be the first time two Japanese-born pitchers start against each other in an MLB game at the Tokyo Dome, and it will be the first time two Japanese-born pitchers start against each other on MLB Opening Day at any venue. 

""Thanks to the Japanese players who have challenged the major leagues  in the past, the two of us pitching against each other is attracting  attention,"" Imanaga said after he and Yamamoto were named the Game 1 starters last month (via Kyodo News). ""So first of all, I want to express my  gratitude to the Japanese players of the past. I will be very happy if more children get to see baseball and it becomes an opportunity for them to start playing."" 

Yamamoto joined the Dodgers on a pitcher-record 12-year, $325 million contract last offseason. He missed much of the 2024 regular season with a shoulder issue, though he was arguably their top starter in the postseason. Imanaga signed a four-year, $54 million contract last winter and threw 173 ⅓ innings with a 2.91 ERA. That earned him a fourth-place finish in the NL Rookie of the Year voting and a fifth-place finish in the NL Cy Young voting. 

It should be noted Imanaga and Yamamoto (and Ohtani and Sasaki) were teammates on Team Japan in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Imanaga started the Championship Game against Team USA. Suzuki was on Japan's original WBC roster, but had to withdraw from the event with an oblique injury. 

Understandably, the Cubs and Dodgers were both allowed to bring extra players on the trip. Calling someone up in the event of an injury in Game 1 would have been a wee bit difficult, you know? Each team was allowed to bring five extra players to Tokyo, so that's the 26-man active roster and five backups. The 31 players the Cubs brought to Japan can be seen here.

Notably absence: Nico Hoerner, Chicago's Gold Glove second baseman. He is in the final stages of his rehab from last October's flexor surgery and will not be ready to play in Tokyo, but is expected to be ready for the traditional Opening Day on March 27. Hoerner stayed behind in Arizona and will continue his rehab work and preparation there. 

In terms of roster status, each team is given three ""inactive"" spots for the Tokyo Series, and Hoerner will occupy one of those. What that means is the Cubs do not have to put him on the injured list to keep him off their 26-man active roster for Japan, which would affect his availability when the domestic portion of Chicago's regular season begins next week. 

Here now are the 31 players the Dodgers brought to Japan: 

Here's your 31-man travel roster for the Tokyo Series. pic.twitter.com/FXOTRsDPhA

Fifth starter Dustin May did not make the trip. Like Hoerner, May remained in Arizona to continue working out there, and occupies one of the team's three ""inactive"" spots. May missed the 2024 season with elbow and esophageal surgery. Other notable Dodgers like Tony Gonsolin, Clayton Kershaw, and Gavin Stone are already on the injured list. 

The roster rules for the Tokyo Series are the same as the roster rules for last year's Seoul Series between the Dodgers and San Diego Padres. The Dodgers and Padres split two games in Korea from March 20-21. Neither team made a roster move during the two-game series, though they brought extra players on the trip, just in case. 

Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss the two-game Tokyo Series with an illness that surfaced before the team even traveled to Japan, manager Dave Roberts announced Monday. Betts, who Roberts said has lost close to 15 pounds while sick, did not play in the team's exhibition games against the Hanshin Tigers and Yomiuri Giants, and he felt fatigued during workouts. The team is considering sending him home early to rest and recover before the domestic home opener on March 27.

""The thing is when you lose a lot of weight, when you're dehydrated, that's what opens a person up to soft-tissue injuries,"" Roberts said. ""We're very mindful of that. So to take the next week, call it, to build him back up, his strength, do some baseball activities to get ready for the home opener.""

Miguel Rojas started both exhibition games at shortstop over the weekend. He is the odds-on favorite to man the position in Betts' place. Chris Taylor, who came off the bench to play a few innings at short on Saturday, would be the backup.

Regular-season games, anyway. The Red Sox will play a pair of exhibition games against Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican League in Monterrey, Mexico, on March 24-25. Otherwise MLB will not play any other international games this season. The league initially planned to play games in Paris, Mexico City, and San Juan this year, though those ideas all fell apart for various reasons. The collective bargaining agreement includes provisions for regular-season games in Mexico City, London, and San Juan in 2026, which is also a World Baseball Classic year. For 2025 though, the Tokyo Series will be the only regular-season games played internationally. 

After the Tokyo Series, the Cubs will return to Arizona and the Dodgers will head to Southern  California to wrap up their exhibition season. It's a long trip (12-hour flight) with a  big time change (16-hour time difference) and the two teams will have  several days to adjust back to normal after the two-game Tokyo Series. Here is each team's upcoming schedule: 

March 18-19

The Cubs head back to Arizona and stay there through the end of spring training and to play the D-backs when the traditional portion of the regular season begins on March 27. I would not anticipate seeing many Cubs regulars in those March 21 and 22 exhibition games. They players who go to Tokyo will get a few days off to recalibrate before getting back on the field.  

As for the Dodgers, they'll travel from Tokyo to Los Angeles, take a few days off, then play their annual three-game exhibition series with the Angels. Their regular season resumes when the Tigers come to Dodger Stadium for the traditional Opening Day. The Cubs and Dodgers will both take a few days off after the Tokyo Series, play a few more exhibition games, then resume their regular season. It's a bit wonky, but it's the only reasonable way to play games on the other side of the world.

Filed under:

An interview with Dylan Harper reflecting on his decision to go to Rutgers, what his dad told him about Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and much more.

Basketball runs through Dylan Harper's blood. His father Ron Harper was a five-time NBA champion who remade his game from takeover scorer to caretaker point guard while playing alongside the likes of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Scottie Pippen, and Shaquille O'Neal. Harper's mother Maria could hoop, too: she played college ball at the University of New Orleans and then severed on Dylan's coaching staffs from an early age through high school. His older brother Ron Harper Jr. is currently on two-way contract with the Detroit Pistons.

Dylan followed Ron Jr.'s footsteps when he committed to Rutgers. With his freshman season now over, the assumption is that Harper will now go off to the NBA, where he's been projected as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 draft for most of the year. 

SB Nation got the chance to interview Harper through his March Madness sponsorship with Kinder Bueno. Topics included reflecting on his decision to pick Rutgers over Duke and other power programs, what his father passed down from playing with Jordan and Kobe, the biggest misconceptions about his game, and his experience playing with fellow top pick Ace Bailey. The interview took place just before Rutgers began play in the Big Ten tournament.

For more March Madness coverage, check out SB Nation's list of the 50 best players in the 2025 men's NCAA tournament, plus our expert bracket predictions. 

SBN: Most people were shocked a five-star recruit would pick Rutgers over offers from Duke, Kansas, Auburn, and others. Why would you say you made that decision, and a year later, how do you think it worked out for you? 

I mean, first off, coming here was pretty easy for me, I think. I like to go family over everything. I've known the people here forever, Coach Pike, Coach B Knight, TJ Thompson the whole staff, just how much love they bring you in. They tell you they're always gonna do right by you no matter what, and they're gonna be by your side even when you leave Rutgers. Stuff like that really got me to come here. And in the basketball side of it, why not want to be different? Obviously, I could have went to the places you're talking about, great programs, all respect to them, but I kind of wanted to pave my own way and do something different. Just looking back at it now, I mean I wouldn't my decision at all. 

Obviously a lot of ups and downs, but that's life. Life isn't always gonna be perfect, you know, just little things that that's kept me pushing.

You've had the ball in your hands the entire season at Rutgers, posting one of the highest usage rates among the freshmen class. Maybe that wouldn't have happened a traditional power program. How do you think those reps have helped your game? 

It's definitely helped me a lot. Coach Pike did a great job believing in me from the beginning. Coach Pike called me the day after the season ended last year and said this is your program. I'm putting the ball in your hands.  You can follow my lead. We gonna do this together as a team.

So I'm just grateful to have a coach like that by my side that truly believes in me. He sees all the hard work I put in day in and day out, and he just knows that he feels comfortable with me, but it definitely has helped me, you know, get ready for the future that's coming ahead. It really just got me nice and ready just to go because, like you said, the NBA is a gauntlet, you know, whenever that time comes, that time is gonna come, but it's really gonna be great, you know, I mean, I think (Rutgers) prepared me for it just as much as anyone else could.

All players have to add something to their game when they jump up a level in competition. What do you think you've added to your game in this one year at Rutgers?

I think if you watched me in high school to right now, I can really say like everything improved, but one big thing is probably my shooting I think. A lot of people really slept on it in high school because like you said, I was able to get to the basket and go get a lay up whenever I wanted to. But in the Big Ten college basketball, you can't do that. So just a little stuff like that, getting to my spots, being sharper, more precise, and just overall, knowing the game better.

One thing I think you've been great at all year is splitting double teams. You have a special skill for getting downhill with a screen. In those situations, is that something where you're like, ‘hey, I'm getting to the rim' in this instance? Or is it more like you're reading what the defense is giving you and kind of trying to react to how they're defending you?

I mean, I think it really comes down to a little bit of both. First, like reading the defense, just seeing what they're gonna do, just watching a lot of film. I gotta give props to the coaching staff. They do a great job of sending us clips of what the other teams are gonna do, whether it's come out, double, or just stay back. We spend a lot of time on stuff like that, so it kind of prepares you for the game. It makes it easier for me, but also you got to know what you're about to do before you do it. I mean, if I feel like I can get to the rim, split the double team team, I think I'm gonna go do that. And if it's not open, I'm gonna go to something else because I just trust my instincts and trust all the work.

So I'd say your shooting has been good this year. You're around 35% on deep on pretty good volume. You probably think you can shoot better in the future. One thing I like about your game is I feel like your gathers and your step backs are really smooth. Your footwork has been great going into your shots. How have you developed your shot prep and how has that helped you?

I mean, definitely props to my mom, my family, obviously props to my trainer, Kenny Miller. Coming into the season, that was really the main emphasis. The things we got to work on is probably get your shot a little faster, a little smoother, like not as choppy. We worked at day, nights, whatever. I mean, we are still working it out today, it's not perfect, but I mean, it's it's getting there. It's definitely now becoming routine just getting to into my shot. (Miller) really did a great job of about having that belief in me when we're in the gym. You know, I'm shooting stepbacks and the ball ain't going in the rim and I'm getting mad and stuff like that, but my coaches and trainers always have a belief in me that, you know, the next shot can go in. 

I grew up watching your dad with the ‘90s Bulls with MJ. Obviously your dad played with Kobe too before the end of his career. So, what's one thing he's told you about MJ and Kobe that has stuck with you over the years as you've grown up?

Really just their mentality, how they go about not just basketball, but life. Like, you gotta be here at a certain time, you better be the hardest worker to win. There's little things like that, like, doing the things you don't want to do, but you know you're gonna do it because it's gonna make you better in the long run. That's the stuff he really just put in my head, just to show me if these greats did it like, if you, if you do, you got a chance to be up there with them one day.

So I love watching the U19 tournaments every year just to see the next crop of guys, and you were on that team in 2023. You guys lost to France. Team USA does not lose in those competitions, but you look at that France roster and it's the first two picks last year, Alex Sar, Risahay. They also had Noah Penda who's gonna be in your draft class. So how do you think that that experience helped you?

It was definitely great for me just seeing how hard you have to play. I mean, I think that's something that That's kind of lacked around here in the, in the US now, but when you go out there, you gotta play hard every possession, no plays off, just really, you gotta really know the game out there cause it's a completely different game FIBA basketball, and you know, and you watch the first couple of games that kind of caught me by surprise just because like, I didn't know how other teams played, or other countries play stuff like that. So just really go into in a mindset of I'm just keep my ears open, I'm just gonna listen to everything, just take everything in just day by day and so keep on working.

What do you think is the biggest misconception about your game?

I mean, there's a lot of things, I mean, I think a lot of people have a lot of I have a lot of opinions on my games, stuff like that, little things like, like this, I'm not athletic. Can't get to, like, can't jump like that, but I mean, if you see some highlights, I mean, I think it kind of shows you different, but I don't think, I don't base my game based off that. So I mean, I think that's probably why, but I mean, I can do it. I just don't do it often. So stuff like that, like, maybe like, I'm not as good as a passer, or I'm not, or I'm not as good as a shooter, but I mean, I think I got the stats, you know, if you just watch my game, if you watch a regular regular Rutgers game, I think I can back that up.

One of my, takes every year is that little brothers are usually better than big brothers because they got, you know, their big brother to like go after and to try to beat him, when I'm sure Ron Junior was whooping you when you were growing up for a long time.

So what have you learned from your bro and his experience, you know, in the NBA he's, you know, he's been grinding, man. So, you know, what have you just like taken from him growing up and even now seeing him in the league? 

I mean, growing up, he never let me win anything. I mean, it was more of like, ain't no one in this world gonna let you win, why I'm gonna let you win? And my mom would, would always get mad at him, but he stood on all tens and said he, he's not letting me win. I mean, that definitely helps me me now because Going up against him, he was always 6 years older than me. So when I go against the older guys, I kind of know what to expect from the physicality standpoint, stuff like that. But just really watching how he worked day in and day out, like when I was younger, going to the gym, watching him work out 2 or 3 times a day, little stuff like that. And like you just said, the gauntlet that he's going through right now in the league, it's crazy. I be fighting for your life every day, you know, every day is not guaranteed, but I mean, he does a great job just always keeping his, his head high and I really admire that.

People say a lot of things about Ace Bailey. Some people love his game. Some people do not love his game.

First off, I can say Ace Bailey is the best teammate that I've had. I mean, all my career, he's one of the best teammates. He's always the first guy in the gym, he's gonna work hard. And he's the funniest guy, you are always gonna get a laugh out around him. There's never a dull moment with him. 

On the court, I don't understand how people don't like his game. I mean, the shots he takes, yeah, everyone says they're tough shots, this, that and the third, but if you watch him work out, those are the shots he makes. That's why you will see us getting mad (at the criticism), because that's him. He does it every day in practice, so why can't do it in a game? Little stuff like that. And let's be honest, he takes tough shots, but he's 6'10, and when he jumps, he's 7-foot, and no one can contest it. 

Who wouldn't want to have a guy like that in your team where you can give him the ball and it could be an automatic bucket? That's really him. But I mean, he really does a lot more than that. I think he sees the game very well. He's a very good defender, very good rebounder. He just does everything well and he's 6'10. So like, I don't understand why people don't like his game. You could say shot selection or anything like that, but I mean, if you look at the shots and you look at workouts, I mean, he's a great player and a great teammate. Praise to him.

Your mom played college hoops at New Orleans. Everyone knows about your dad's career, but your mom had to be a hooper too, and I know she was your coach. So like, you know, what did you take from your mom that you think maybe you didn't get from your dad?

I mean, she's been coaching me all my life from Kindergarten, first grade all the way up to my senior year of high school, and she was always telling me you gotta be the hardest worker in the gym no matter what. I think that's something me and her used to argue about. I mean, she always told me like, ‘You got to be that same kid that you were 4 years ago when no one knew your name and you're out there just playing basketball just because you love the game' like that should never change. I really take that from her because like, obviously. I'm grateful to have everything that I got right now, but I mean, I still got a lot more work to do. She does a great job of humbling me every day, so I mean props to her. I wouldn't be here without her.

Point guard, shooting guard, combo guard, lots of different ways to describe you. What kind of situation do you want to see yourself positionally in the NBA? Do you want to go to a team where it's like, hey, Dylan's got the ball? Or like some of these teams are gonna have like pretty good players even if they don't have a great record to where maybe you're playing a little more off the ball, maybe you're playing a little more two guard. What do you see in your career?

Obviously, I'm blessed to even have that in the conversation of what I would do in that next level. I just try to stay in the moment right now, you know, just finish the season up strong of Rutgers, but obviously when I get there, I mean, I'm gonna do whatever I got to do to help the team win, whether it's like you say, play off the ball, play on the ball, this, that and third, I'm gonna do whatever the coach asked me to do and I'm just gonna go out there and try to win.

What's this partnership been like with Kinder Bueno been like and what are you doing for him?

A post shared by DylanHarper (@dylharpp)

I mean, it's kind of been great. My cousin introduced me to Kinder Bueno. I mean right when she gave me one, I liked it right away. It's kind of irresistible like after a game or practice when you need a little snack, you know, just grab my Kinder Bueno bits. It's just great company, great brand, you know, what they wanna do for March, I mean, just honestly blessed to be in that situation with them and just we're gonna have a lot of good things.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Probiotic drink kefir shows promise in preventing Alzheimer's","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250317/Probiotic-drink-kefir-shows-promise-in-preventing-Alzheimere28099s.aspx","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:27:00 GMT","

Could a simple probiotic drink help fight Alzheimer's? A new study explores how kefir reduces neuroinflammation and supports brain health, offering hope for future dietary interventions.

Image Credit: etorres / Shutterstock

In a recent review article published in the journal Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative, researchers examined studies on human participants and animal models to evaluate the effects of kefir, a fermented food rich in probiotics, on cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and oxidative stress. They concluded that kefir shows promise as a potential complementary treatment for Alzheimer's disease, offering neuroprotective benefits due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, standardized formulations and large-scale clinical studies are needed to validate its therapeutic potential for human patients.

Kefir's potential brain-boosting effects may extend beyond Alzheimer's disease, with emerging research suggesting that it could help regulate mood and stress by influencing the gut-brain axis. Some studies have linked probiotic-rich diets to reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Alzheimer's disease is a leading contributor to the global burden of dementia, accounting for approximately 60% of cases, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. By 2050, its prevalence is projected to rise to 150 million as populations continue to age. Symptoms of this disease include confusion, language difficulties, and memory loss, which eventually severely affect behavior and condition, leading to loss of independence.

There is currently no cure for this condition, and current treatments focus primarily on managing symptoms. However, emerging approaches aim to reduce the accumulation of tau proteins and beta-amyloid plaques, which researchers have shown contribute to the disease by facilitating the atrophy and damage of brain cells through chronic inflammation linked to microglial overactivation. Additionally, dysregulation in insulin signaling and oxidative stress has been implicated in the disease's progression, reinforcing the need for multi-targeted treatment strategies. Diagnostic advances have also allowed doctors to detect early risk factors by monitoring biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, shifting the focus to prevention.

While some cases are inherited, most Alzheimer's cases are sporadic and influenced by aging, lifestyle, and medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Research suggests that managing these risk factors could prevent over 30% of cases. Gut health also plays a role, as an imbalance in gut bacteria can trigger inflammation via pathways like the TLR4/MYD88/NLRP3 signaling cascade, and worsen cognitive decline.

Lifestyle changes, particularly diet, have been identified as a helpful way to reduce risk factors. Fermented foods are rich in probiotics, which are being explored for their potential to strengthen cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's. Such foods contain beneficial compounds that may reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, both key factors in the progression of the disease.

Among probiotics, kefir stands out as it has a rich composition of microbes and nutrients, containing minerals, vitamins, and proteins in addition to probiotics. However, its microbial composition can vary significantly depending on production methods, complicating comparisons across studies. Standardizing these formulations will be crucial for ensuring reproducibility in future clinical applications. Recent research suggests that kefir may support brain health by decreasing oxidative damage and inflammation and modulating insulin signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/mTOR axis, which plays a key role in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. In this review, researchers systematically identified and assessed studies on the effects of kefir on Alzheimer's disease.

This figure illustrates the role of intestinal dysbiosis in neuroinflammation and the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Dysbiotic gut microbiota activates inflammatory pathways, leading to increased oxidative stress. This, in turn, triggers microglial activation in the central nervous system. Activated microglia then stimulate astrocytes, resulting in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which further perpetuates microglial activation in a vicious cycle. Both BBB compromise and microglial activation contribute to the formation and deposition of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, through hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which promote neuronal apoptosis, synaptic dysfunction, and disease progression. 

Researchers identified seven relevant studies from across five medical databases, of which only one included human participants. In this study, 13 patients with Alzheimer's disease were given kefir supplementation; the analysis found that their oxidative stress and inflammatory markers decreased while their motor skills, cognitive functioning, and memory improved. Specifically, patients showed a 28% improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and approximately 66% and 62% improvements in immediate and late memory tests, respectively. However, another trial cited in the review (Agahi et al., 2018) found no cognitive benefits in severe Alzheimer's patients, highlighting the need for further investigation into dosage, microbial composition, and stage-specific effects of kefir supplementation.

GALT= Gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The figure illustrates the central role of the gut microbiota in human health through interconnected functions. It regulates the immune system by promoting tolerance to non-pathogenic stimuli and competing with pathogens. The microbiota affects the gut-brain axis through bidirectional nerve communication and bloodstream transport of bacterial metabolites, toxins, and fragments, influencing brain function and inflammation. It aids in metabolism by producing short-chain fatty acids, converting bile acids, and synthesizing digestive enzymes, while contributing to vitamin production. A healthy microbiota maintains the intestinal barrier, preventing harmful bacterial byproducts translocation to the bloodstream and protecting systemic and neurological health (LeBlanc et al., 2013).

Unlike many dairy products, kefir contains significantly reduced lactose levels, making it more digestible for people with lactose intolerance. Some studies suggest that kefir could help improve lactose digestion over time by increasing the presence of beneficial gut bacteria.

Of the remaining studies, four included rodent participants, namely mice, albino rats, and Wistar rats. These studies focused on brain tissue change, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function. One research article found that kefir modified the gut microbiome, reducing brain inflammation via TLR4 pathway modulation and improving cognitive function. Additionally, kefir supplementation was associated with reduced beta-amyloid accumulation, hippocampal neuron preservation, and improved learning ability in rodent models.

Another study showed that combining stem cell therapy with kefir effectively protects against oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Rodents treated with pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic medication, and kefir showed reduced neuronal damage and memory decline, while simvastatin (a lipid-lowering medication) and kefir jointly decreased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.

Two studies examined the effects of kefir on amyloid buildup and neurodegeneration using fly models. One found that kefir increased motor function and antioxidant activity while decreasing amyloid accumulation, while the other showed that kefir reduced brain damage while improving motor skills and survival. Additionally, biochemical analyses in these models confirmed reductions in oxidative stress markers and enhancements in neuronal survival.

While symptom management is the primary approach in current Alzheimer's treatment, commonly used medications do not stop the progression of the disease despite improving cognitive outcomes. Dietary approaches are increasingly considered to reduce the risk of developing the disease, with kefir drawing focus due to its richness in bioactive compounds.

Integrating lifestyle and dietary interventions with pharmacological treatments is necessary, particularly as Alzheimer's is a complex condition affected by several factors. While kefir shows promise in animal models and a single study involving human participants, its effects may depend on microbial strain composition and dosage. Clinical trials and longitudinal studies are necessary to assess the long-term impacts of this and other probiotics, generating evidence on its interactions with other measures to prevent cognitive declines.

A comprehensive understanding of its efficacy and safety, including optimal doses and standardized formulations, is also needed to gauge its utility in therapeutic and clinical contexts. Moreover, researchers emphasize that kefir's therapeutic potential is influenced by variations in microbial content and fermentation conditions, necessitating further standardization efforts before clinical implementation. While a cure for Alzheimer's disease remains unavailable, emerging research offers promising strategies for improved screening, monitoring, prevention, and management.

Now Trump aims to reverse course.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250318/Her-case-changed-trans-care-in-prison-Now-Trump-aims-to-reverse-course.aspx","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:47:00 GMT","

In 2019, Cristina Iglesias filed a lawsuit that changed the course of treatment for herself and other transgender inmates in federal custody.

Iglesias, a trans woman who had been incarcerated for more than 25 years, was transferred from a men's prison to a women's one in 2021. And in 2022, she reached a landmark settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to receive gender-affirming surgery, which the agency said it had never provided for anyone in its custody.

By the time she got the surgery 10 months later, another federal inmate had also received a procedure to align their body with their gender identity. No other such surgeries for people in federal custody are publicly documented, although some people in state prisons have also received gender-affirming surgery, including at least five in Illinois and 20 in California within a U.S. prison population that tops 1.25 million people.

Still, those procedures loomed large in the 2024 presidential election. Political advertising for President Donald Trump and other Republicans included $215 million on anti-trans ads, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. One such ad declared that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris supported ""taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,"" and concluded, ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you."" Some Democrats bemoaned the ads as having helped tip the election.

In the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, 55% of voters felt support for trans rights had gone too far, according to VoteCast, a survey by The Associated Press and partners including KFF, the health policy research, polling, and news organization that includes KFF Health News.

On Inauguration Day, Trump issued a flurry of executive orders that included a directive to bar federal spending on gender-affirming care in federal prisons and to ""ensure that males are not detained"" in federal women's facilities.

""President Trump received an overwhelming mandate from the American people to restore commonsense principles and safeguard women's spaces — even prisons — from biological men,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email. ""Forcing taxpayers to pay for gender transition for prisoners is the exact sort of insanity that the American people rejected at the ballot box in November.""

But for Iglesias, 50, Trump's order was a shocking reversal.

""It puts someone's life in danger being in a men's prison as a trans woman,"" she said from Chicago, where she's lived since her release in 2023. ""It'd be like putting sheep in a hyenas' den.""

Iglesias said she faced emotional and physical abuse from her father for her desire to be female. When she was 12, she said, he put a gun in her mouth after finding her wearing her sister's clothes. Iglesias said she ran away from home, stole checks, cars, and jewelry, and ended up in jail.

Lockup was not fun, Iglesias said, but it was the first place she got to be treated as a woman. So, she said, she wanted to stay. In 1994, she landed in federal prison after writing threatening letters to federal judges and prosecutors, according to court filings. In 2005, records show, she pleaded guilty to sending a letter to British officials that she falsely claimed contained anthrax. She told investigators she hoped to get extradited.

""I was reading these things where they were allowing trans females to start living with females,"" Iglesias said.

She said her outlook changed after the death of her mother in 2010, which prompted her to get serious about having a life outside of prison, and about improving her life inside it.

She began requesting hormone therapy in 2011 and was approved for it in 2015, according to court records. The 2019 lawsuit that led to her transfer to a women's prison and her surgery was initially handwritten and prepared with the help of only another inmate.

""The lawsuit was the foundation for everything that I am today,"" Iglesias said. ""For the first time in my life, instead of digging myself in these holes, I was digging myself out.""

Along with her settlement, Iglesias received a commitment from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to create a timeline for considering other inmates' requests for gender-affirming care, and to recognize permanent hair removal and gender-affirming surgery as medically necessary treatments for gender dysphoria — a medical condition in which the discrepancy between a person's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth causes significant distress.

In February, in response to Trump's executive order, the bureau issued new guidelines requiring prison staffers to refer to inmates' ""legal name or pronouns corresponding to their biological sex,"" and ending clothing requests ""that do not align with an inmate's biological sex."" The guidelines end referrals for gender-affirming surgery but allow inmates already receiving treatment, such as hormone therapy, to continue.

However, in a lawsuit filed March 7, a trans prisoner alleged the hormone therapy she had been receiving since 2016 was stopped on Jan. 26.

Spokespeople for the bureau did not respond to requests for comment.

The bureau spent $153,000 on hormone therapy in fiscal year 2022, its former director told Congress, 0.01% of its total spending on health care.

The new guidelines on trans inmates say that Trump's executive order ""does not supersede or change"" the obligation to comply with federal regulations. But the executive order calls for amending them to prevent trans women from being housed in women's prisons.

""It hurt my heart when I seen that because I do know other girls that are still in prison,"" said Iglesias, who spent more than 25 years in male facilities. ""Female prison is safe for a trans woman, and you can be who you are. You're not penalized because you're feminine.""

But requesting a transfer to a facility matching inmates' gender identity had not been easy, and few prisoners had been moved before the order. A 2025 government court filing said that federal prisons house 2,198 trans prisoners out of over 155,000 inmates. Of those, the filing said, 22 are trans women housed in female facilities, and one is a trans man in a men's facility. Although courts have blocked attempts to move that small subset of trans prisoners after the order, a trans prisoner not included in those suits had been relocated, The Guardian news outlet reported.

A Department of Justice report from 2014 estimated that trans inmates in state and federal prisons were 10 times as likely as other prisoners to report incidents of sexual victimization.

Iglesias said she experienced such violence firsthand. Included in her suit was a copy of a 2017 psychological report that said Iglesias reported being the victim of sexual misconduct or abuse in 1993, 2001, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Later filings included allegations of having been raped in 2019 and 2020, and a series of rapes, threats, and other abuse in 2021 before she was transferred to a female facility. Iglesias said she faced more abuse than she officially reported.

""Just because you commit a crime doesn't mean you deserve to have violence against you,"" said Michelle García, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Illinois and one of the attorneys who ultimately represented Iglesias.

Federal law requires all inmates to be protected from abuse. A 1994 Supreme Court decision acknowledged trans inmates as particularly vulnerable to attack. Regulations from the Prison Rape Elimination Act, passed unanimously by Congress in 2003, contain specific provisions for trans inmates, including allowing them to shower separately from other inmates and requiring prison officials to consider their health and safety when deciding whether to house them in male or female facilities.

Courts also have ruled that ""deliberate indifference"" to an inmate's ""serious medical needs"" violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ""cruel and unusual"" punishments. The quality of overall medical care for federal prisoners has come under scrutiny amid reports of inmates going without needed medical care and preventable deaths.

Iglesias successfully argued in court that gender-affirming surgery was necessary for her gender dysphoria. She was diagnosed with what was then called ""gender identity disorder"" soon after entering federal custody in 1994, according to court filings. Her diagnosis was updated to gender dysphoria in 2015.

Iglesias' court filings documented her having been assessed for the risk of suicide 33 times and placed on suicide watch 12 times, as well as an attempt at self-castration in 2009.

""Defendants are aware of Iglesias's suffering, but have delayed her treatment without evaluating her medically,"" the judge in her case wrote.

García called the Trump administration's targeting of care for trans inmates cruel, unnecessary, and illogical.

""They're not assessing the constitutional rights of people,"" García said. ""They're making choices because this is a vulnerable community that they can rally people behind to hate.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Lifestyle and health factors have greater impact on cardiovascular risk in women than men","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250318/Lifestyle-and-health-factors-have-greater-impact-on-cardiovascular-risk-in-women-than-men.aspx","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:02:00 GMT","

Lifestyle and health factors that are linked with heart disease appear to have a greater impact on cardiovascular risk in women than men, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25).

While factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and blood pressure have long been linked with heart disease risk, the new study is the first to show that these associations are collectively stronger in women than men. According to the researchers, the findings suggest that sex-specific screening or risk assessment approaches could give a more accurate picture of cardiovascular risk and better motivate people to adopt heart-healthy habits.

For the same level of health, our study shows that the increase in risk [related to each factor] is higher in women than in men—it's not one-size-fits-all. This is novel and something that hasn't been seen in other studies.""

Maneesh Sud, MD, PhD, assistant professor in the department of medicine, interventional cardiologist and clinician scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto and the study's lead author

The study focused on eight factors associated with heart disease: diet, sleep, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure. Overall, the results showed that women were more likely to have fewer negative risk factors and more positive ones compared with men. However, women with more negative risk factors faced a more pronounced increase in their chance of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event compared to men with a similar risk factor profile.

""We found that women tend to have better health than men, but the impact on outcomes is different,"" Sud said. ""The combination of these factors has a bigger impact in women than it does in men.""

The researchers analyzed data from over 175,000 Canadian adults who enrolled in the Ontario Health Study between 2009-2017. None of the participants had heart disease at baseline and about 60% were women. Each participant was classified as having ideal or poor health in terms of each of the eight risk factors, and these scores were combined to calculate an overall risk factor profile as poor (fewer than five positive factors or more than three negative factors), intermediate (five to seven positive factors) or ideal (ideal across all eight factors).

During a median follow-up period of just over 11 years, researchers tracked the incidence of seven heart disease outcomes—heart attack, stroke, unstable angina (chest pain that results from restricted blood flow to the heart), peripheral arterial disease (narrowed blood vessels in the arms or legs), heart failure, coronary revascularization (procedures to open blocked arteries) and cardiovascular death—among participants in each of the three groupings.

In the study population, significantly more women were categorized as having ideal health, with 9.1% of women and 4.8% of men scoring a perfect 8 out of 8. Women were also less likely to be categorized as having poor health, with 21.9% of women and 30.5% of men falling into this category. In terms of individual risk factors, women were more likely than men to have ideal diet, blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure, while women were slightly less likely than men to have ideal physical activity levels.

After adjusting for age, the results showed that participants of both sexes saw an elevated risk of heart disease if they had poor or intermediate health compared to those with ideal health, but these differences were more extreme in women than men. Women with poor health had nearly five times the risk of heart disease as women with ideal health, while men with poor health had 2.5 times the risk of heart disease as men with ideal health. Women with intermediate health had 2.3 times the risk as those with ideal health, while men with intermediate health had 1.6 times the risk as those with ideal health.

Further study is needed to understand how each factor might be affecting outcomes differently in men and women based on either biological or sociocultural factors, the researchers said.

The researchers plan to conduct additional analyses to determine whether there are any differences in risk factor impacts among people of different racial and ethnic groups or among women before and after menopause.

Closer collaboration between child health services and specialist care has resulted in faster support for young children with autism. A study from the University of Gothenburg shows that, on average, children are diagnosed one year earlier.

Today, when young children show signs of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as difficulties with social communication or repetitive behaviors, it can take a long time before they are assessed and receive the right support.

In recent years, the specialist child and adolescent medicine department at Angered Hospital in Gothenburg has tested a new approach that brings together child health services, specialist care, and the municipality, including preschool. The initiative has seen pediatric nurses receive training in identifying early signs of autism, as well as the introduction of a structure whereby children suspected of having autism receive immediate support from child health services and a referral for assessment by a specialist.

This evaluation shows that the initiative has delivered positive results. Families have received help sooner, and the average age at which children are diagnosed with autism has fallen from an average of three years and eight months to two years and seven months.

The earlier we can identify children with autism, the better we can support them. We see that families get help sooner without having to wait several years for an assessment.""

Emilia Carlsson, senior lecturer in speech and language pathology at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg and researcher at the Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre

Angered, where the approach is being tested, is a city district in northeast Gothenburg where many families have an immigrant background and healthcare has previously had difficulty with outreach. The collaboration developed within the project is now well established and remains in place.

The study shows that improved collaboration between different parts of the healthcare system can make a major difference for children and parents. The model can be introduced in other regions, although it requires training for healthcare staff and the necessary resources to provide support as soon as autism is suspected - not only after waiting a long time for both assessment and intervention.

""Greater knowledge among healthcare staff and effective collaboration enable us to better help families immediately, giving them the support they need,"" says Gudrun Nygren, pediatrician and child and adolescent psychiatrist, as well as a researcher at the Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg, and co-author of the study.

Tracy Morgan gave fans a health update Tuesday morning after being taken from Madison Square Garden in a wheelchair during Monday night's New York Knicks game.

The 56-year-old comedian revealed he had food poisoning as he assured fans he was on the mend.

""Thank you for all your concern! I'm doing ok now and doctors say it was food poisoning,"" Morgan shared Tuesday morning on Instagram. ""Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!""More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I'll have to break it out again in the playoffs,"" he joked.

A Hollywood intimacy coordinator believes there was, at least at one point, some “affection” between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.

Mia Schachter, whose credits include Apple TV+'s Lessons in Chemistry and HBO's Insecure and Perry Mason, weighed in on the dramatic on-set feud between the It Ends With Us costars, which is now the subject of multiple lawsuits. (Baldoni also directed the film.)

Dueling lawsuits filed by Lively, 37, and Baldoni, 41, include text messages the stars sent one another while filming the movie, including a discussion in which the pair discussed script changes that Baldoni ultimately acquiesced to.

“From reading their text messages, I do get the sense that, at one point, there was genuine affection between them and what felt like a friendship,” Schachter, who was not involved in the making of It Ends With Us, opined during a new television documentary, He Said, She Said: Blake Lively vs Justin Baldoni, which aired on Channel 5 in the U.K. on Monday, March 17.



In her December 2024 lawsuit accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment, among other things, Lively alleged that Baldoni wanted to add sex scenes that weren't in the film's script, improvised unwanted kissing and that there was often no intimacy coordinator on set. In a January counter lawsuit, Baldoni claimed Lively declined to meet the film's appointed intimacy coordinator before production began. (Both Lively and Baldoni have denied one another's accusations against the other.)

“In my experience, when an actor says, ‘I don't need to meet the intimacy coordinator until we're shooting,' as much as it hinders my process, it does typically indicate that they trust their scene partner,” Schachter said during Monday's documentary. “ And those texts made me think that at one point, she did feel a lot of trust with him.”

Schachter also dissected raw production footage shared by Baldoni's team in January that shows him and Lively filming a dancing scene for a slow-motion montage. According to Lively's lawsuit, Baldoni “leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, ‘It smells so good.' … None of this was remotely in character. When Ms. Lively later objected to this behavior, Ms. Baldoni's response was, ‘I'm not even attracted to you.'” Lively said she tried to avoid kissing Baldoni by suggesting they talk in the scene.

In his countersuit, Baldoni denied “that this scene was filmed in any manner other than pure professionalism,” noting that he was in character. He alleged that Lively tried to take over the direction of the scene and “insisted” they talk, claiming she was “consistently unable to take direction” and “continued to break character” while shooting.

“His team seemed to be accusing Blake of trying to direct that scene and undermine his creative vision. I don't see that,” Schachter said. “I see an actress trying not to kiss her coworker and instead of saying, ‘I don't want to do that,' she's making other suggestions, which is actually pretty considerate because I think it could be humiliating for everyone there to see Blake Lively tell Justin Baldoni, ‘Stop trying to kiss me.'”

Grant Ellis dropped an L-bomb on The Bachelor — but was quick to wonder if he jumped the gun.

The 31-year-old Bachelor had overnight dates with his final three, Juliana Pasquarosa, Litia Garr and Zoe McGrady, (at the Secrets Tides Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic!) on the Monday, March 17, episode after the three women had visits from ghosts of Bachelor Nation past.



Juliana was up first, revealing to Bachelor season 28 runner-up Daisy Kent that she was nervous about the fantasy suites because of infidelity in her past relationship.

“I was cheated on for so long. He had a bunch of chicks on the side,” Juliana explained.

Daisy, who ended things with Joey Graziadei just before he proposed to Kelsey Anderson, advised Juliana to take this time to talk to Grant. “I had a hard time opening up too. … [But] I started opening up and it kind of changed everything for me,” she said. “I know I did everything I could and I gave it my all. I look back on it and I don't regret it.”

Grant and Juliana subsequently headed out on an ATV date.

“This week is hard, but I want to let you know that I think about you a lot,” Grant told Juliana, adding that even the thought of her makes him smile. “It's scary for me, too.”

During the evening portion of the date, Juliana opened up to Grant about her ex having affairs “for six or seven years” of her life. “It's such a challenge to go from feeling so minimized in somebody's life and that just screwed me up so bad,” she said through tears. “I'm a little broken and I'm still working to fix myself. I want it so bad.”

Grant got teary listening to Juliana and noted that there's part of him that is broken too. “That's what love is for, it fixes you,” he said, telling her that he sees “treasure” when he looks at her.

They spend the night together and are all smiles in the morning. “We got a lot of questions answered. Said a lot of things, had a lot of fun,” Juliana said, with Grant applauding Juliana for opening up about her feelings.

Zoe then met up with Bachelor season 28 second runner-up Rachel Nance. (Tell Us Zoe is going to be the second runner-up without telling Us Zoe is going to be the second runner-up.) While Rachel was labeled as the girl with “the least amount of time” with Joey prior to the fantasy suites, she couldn't hide her shock when Zoe revealed she never had a one-on-one with Grant — which is tough since the pair then head to a silent Yoga date. (Justice for Zoe?)

While Grant opened up to Zoe about his dad's past struggles with addiction during the night portion of their date, it's hard not to feel like Zoe is still far behind. However, they opt to spend the night together.

Bachelor season 27 winner Kaity Biggar is called in to talk to Litia, which makes sense as Litia is struggling with the idea of Grant sleeping with someone else since she has decided she will not have sex with Grant in the fantasy suite.

“Zach basically went into this week and made, like, this whole declaration — sex is off the table,” Kaity recalled to Litia — as if anyone could forget how Zach Shallcross handled “sex week” with now-fiancée Kaity and runner-up Ariel Frenkel.

“I was the third girl that went, so he had previously had two overnights, two other women, and so I finally, like, meet up with him. About 30 minutes into our date, he tells me that he got intimate with another woman,” Kaity continued. “I tried so hard to compartmentalize each relationship, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I, like, broke down, started shaking. I was like, ‘I don't know how we recover from this.' I knew that this was a potential that could happen, and I didn't want to hear it. I wanted to focus on him and I.”

Litia explained to Kaity that she also doesn't want to know whether Grant is intimate with anyone else and Kaity advised her to make sure the lead knows that before it's too late.

Before she can rely Kaity's advice to Grant, however, Litia is forced to face a different fear — zip-lining.

When the duo do finally talk, it's clear how serious they are getting. They discuss moving to New York to be closer to Grant's dad in rehab in New Jersey, Litia's hopes to have kids in two years and finally, why Litia doesn't want to have sex in the fantasy suite.

“I have to make choices to protect my feelings and my peace, so sex is just, like, not on the table for me,” Litia, who is Mormon, told Grant.

“Honestly, I respect that. 100 percent,” Grant replied, agreeing with Litia that sex is “important” and “special” but not everything. “It's not the foundation of the relationship because when you make that your foundation, [your relationship] is not built the right way.”

Grant continued to praise Litia and dropped the bomb. “I think the maturity that you bring is big. I like the ground that you stand on, and I know where your priorities are, and I know what's important to you, it's what you are on the inside that I can see myself with you,” Grant said. “And see you as my wife, because I do love you.”

Litia said “I love you, too” — and they agree to spend the night together.

Grant later revealed to the cameras that this is only the second time he has said “I love you” in his life and he has fears that he shouldn't have said it on the show with other women left.

“Maybe I should have waited a little longer,” he admitted. “I do love her, but I also am falling hard — and, if not, very close to — in love with somebody else. I never thought it would be possible to be in love with multiple women.”

At the rose ceremony, Grant gave roses to Litia and Juliana, sending Zoe home.

Before the episode ended, fans saw a sneak peek at Grant's conversation with his family about being torn between his final two — and it's safe to say his mom is concerned about how this will all shake out. Grant even warned the cameras: “Stay tuned for my demise.”

The Bachelor season 29 finale airs on ABC Monday, March 24, at 8 p.m. ET.

Below Deck Down Under‘s Adair Werley faced her fair share of challenges trying to navigate working on deck and in the galley, which wasn't always easy while working with two different heads of departments.

“You have to do everything whether you like it or not. You see such small bits of the entire situation with everything that's going on — and there's so much that goes on,” Adair exclusively told Us Weekly. “We all have to pitch in and we all do everything. As you see, we're understaffed and we are lacking people.”



Adair noted she was willing to help wherever she was needed, adding, “We are all filling in places that we're not comfortable — but you're expected and obligated to do everything the second that you step on that boat. Whether you like it or not.”

She continued: “As much as we sit and tease and laugh that, ‘Oh, I can't do this or I don't do that.' You do it all with a smile on your face. And you do it for not only your crew but you do it for the guests and for the money. So there's a lot worse that I can do than cleaning heads and beds. There's a lot worse. That's the easy part.”

Adair admitted the complications came from reporting to two different people: bosun Wihan du Toit and chief stew Lara Rigby.

“I don't think there was ever a point where I ever once ever said that there was something that I'm not going to do. If anything, I was the one that was saying I'm going to do anything and everything. That's the purpose of my role as a deck stew is to do whatever I'm needed to do,” she explained. “I think it was an imbalance of what my priorities were at the time. Because it's like, ‘Do I go help out on deck? Do I go rinse off all of our beach setup stuff, help put things away, help lift the jet skis and help clean the deck for tomorrow? Or do I help serve plates and help with turndowns? Do I go to laundry and restock and clean the crew mess? What am I supposed to do?'”

While reflecting on season 3, Adair recalled not always being split evenly, saying, “I'm just running around trying to do a little bit of everything. So it is hard for myself — especially when you have heads of department that are not necessarily meshing to know what to do or to do what everyone wants me to do. Everybody wants me to do something differently because they want me to help them on their task so I'm just trying to bounce around and help everybody.”

Adair admitted it can “sting” when the feedback doesn't take into account her hard work.

“[Especially] when you're grinding and you're busting your butt to try and help everyone and then your heads of department are not fulfilled enough with what you're trying to do,” she noted. “But everyone [on Below Deck Down Under] was very thankful. We all were working really hard together.”

The Below Deck universe has occasionally had crew members who were both on deck and a stew. While those positions usually didn't work out, Adair appeared more positive about her outcome on the Katina.

“As someone going into my third year in the yachting industry now, I still consider that newer in the industry. There was a lot of responsibility and a lot of communication that you have to have and so many things that you have to stay persistent and consistent on,” she detailed. “So the way that [the heads of department] have to work together on top of what their own responsibilities are and then also directing their people, I give them the biggest shout-out ever. I'm not prepared for that yet. I'm nowhere near that and it's definitely difficult, and it takes a lot of work and effort.”

Below Deck Down Under airs on Bravo Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. New episodes stream the next day on Peacock.

Katie Cassidy didn't see her exit from Arrow coming — and she still has her theories on what caused the decision.

“Happy to be here, easy to work with. It's my slogan,” Cassidy, 38, shared on the Tuesday, March 18, episode of the “Inside of You” podcast before host Michael Rosenbaum asked if that was always her slogan on the Arrow set, to which she replied, “I will say this, I had to eat some humble pie when they killed me off that show. It was really hard.”

Cassidy recalled the onscreen mystery about who was buried in a grave they introduced during the season 4 premiere. She had a feeling her character, Laurel Lance, was getting killed off — and that turned out to be true.

“I was in shock because the next day I was in New York going to Comic-Con with my whole cast. I was angry at first. And I was emotional because I was sad and I was angry because I was so happy [working on the show],” she recalled. “It was a couple of things [that led to the decision]. I have theories. I think it was political. It's a lot.”



Cassidy allowed herself an “anger moment” despite always being “a professional” on set.

“I was like, ‘I just have to say [this to the executive producers]. I feel like I've always been given the short end of the stick and I have to go,'” she continued. “I didn't yell. I just cried because I was sad. I worked really hard on that show and that character. I loved it.”

Arrow, which aired on The CW from 2012 to 2020, was based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow. After four seasons on the show, Cassidy was killed off as Laurel Lance but was subsequently brought back as Earth-2 doppelgänger Black Siren in a crossover with spinoff The Flash. From there, Cassidy was asked to come back to Arrow following backlash to her character's departure.

“Unfortunately, after they killed me, I guess their ratings went down a little. But I did get a call after The Flash aired that said, ‘Will you come back as a series regular? I think we may have made a mistake,'” she recalled. “That was season 6, and on season 5 I was recurring. Then I was back and better than ever.”

Cassidy previously reflected on how her character's death wasn't her choice.

“I think that them killing me off the show was actually, for me personally, a very good thing, because like I said, you sometimes need to get knocked down,” she told TVLine in 2020. “I didn't want to get killed off — to be honest. I was sad but I also understood. I wasn't mad or bitter. I was like, ‘I get it, this is TV.' And it was a platform for the writers to write for other characters and how they react to a lead getting killed off.”

Cassidy continued: “I have to say that as a person going through that, I was grateful and lucky enough — the universe does work for us if we allow it to — that they brought me back shortly after. For that I was so grateful. … You kind of go through all the emotions, so you really just have to ground yourself and have appreciation and gratitude for everything. I really am glad that I got to learn that lesson.”

She remained with the series through the eighth and final season and was one of the leads of the potential spinoff Green Arrow and the Canaries, which ultimately didn't move forward.

Mariah Carey Sparks Romance Rumors with a Fan Favorite Rapper

Justin Theroux and Nicole Brydon Bloom are married, and they're sharing their sweet story of how they met following their star-studded wedding this past weekend in Mexico.

The actors first met in 2022, when their mutual friend Louisa Jacobson introduced them at a private party at The Nines, a bar in Manhattan, back in 2022.

“After the party, a group of us went to grab a drink nearby,” Nicole told Vogue. “It was an abnormally cold night in New York City—about six degrees—and Justin very kindly offered me his gloves, which I gratefully accepted and promptly returned once we were back inside.”

Keep reading to find out more…

The next morning, Nicole got a text from Justin that said: “This yours?” with a photo attached. “It was a picture of him holding my little criss-crossed diamond ring which I had worn, and sadly assumed I'd lost, the night before,” she said.

“Turns out it had slipped off my cold finger into his large gloves when I returned them. Justin put his hands into the glove the next morning and the ring slid halfway onto his finger. He likes to joke that I proposed first, the very first night we met!”

“I for sure thought leaving the ring in my glove was a move,” Justin added. “Which now, knowing Nicole as well as I do, it certainly was not. She has left more jewelry, jackets, and bags in places than I can count. So, definitely not a move.” 

Justin recalled being smitten with Nicole within the first 10 minutes of talking to her.

“I pointed her out across the room to my friend Rassi and when he saw her he did a double take, turned to me and literally said, ‘She is the one,'” Justin revealed. 

“I had no way of knowing how prescient his comment would turn out to be. I then begged him to go over to collect her name, which like an idiot I had not gotten.”

Justin proposed during a vacation on the coast of Italy at Hotel Il Pellicano on the coast of Monte Argentario.

“We almost skipped dinner but decided to take advantage of our first evening on the coast together and ended up having a really poignant conversation over a candlelit dinner,” Nicole said. 

“While eating, a radiant, full blue moon came out and left us both in awe. Justin suggested bringing our drinks down to the water. He popped back to the room, under the guise of getting us some towels, but was really collecting the ring. We were looking out at the water and the moon when he proposed. He said some of the most beautiful things. It was wonderful—we were both crying.”

Lucy Dacus is officially confirming her relationship with Julien Baker. 

Lucy, 29, and Julien, 29, are a part of the musical supergroup Boygenius, along with Phoebe Bridgers, 30. While speculation that Lucy and Julien are dating has been circulating for months, Lucy went public with the news while discussing the lyrics to her song “Forever is a Feeling” in a new interview. 

Keep reading to find out more…

“It's been interesting, because I want to protect what is precious in my life, but also to be honest, and make art that's true. I think maybe a part of it is just trusting that it's not at risk. Maybe a healthier way to think about it is that it's not actually fragile,” Lucy told The New Yorker. 

Lucy says that she is doing her best to protect her boundaries with her relationship when it comes to dealing with the public. 

“It only takes a handful to make your life feel like a really easily threatened thing. I've been practicing not reinforcing that narrative to myself,” she said. 

The musician also discussed previous patterns with her dating life. 

“How are you doing romance without friendship? I can't imagine. That feels so hollow. It makes me feel ill! Someone that's not my friend? Are you serious? Almost every relationship I have been in, we've had some business or creative dealings. I don't mean this just sexually, but it turns me on. To have your minds meet on something, and be, like, ‘Oh, my gosh, you said what I couldn't say. I love your mind,'” she said.

Gal Gadot is speaking out about her views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

If you don't know, the 39-year-old Snow White actress used to serve in the Israel Defense Forces under the country's compulsory military service laws. She expressed her support for Israel after the October 7 attacks, writing,  ""At least 250 Israeli have been murdered and dozens of women children and elders held as hostages in Gaza, by Palestinian military group Hamas. Starting early morning more than 3,000 rockets were fired. Hamas is holding hostages, controlling bases and settlements in Israel. There have been more than 1,500 injured and heavy fighting is still ongoing. 'I hear their voices and they are banging on the door. I am with my two little children'. My heart is aching. Praying for all of those in pain.""

Now, in a new interview, she's speaking out about her support of Israel, which has caused some backlash.

In a new interview published on Tuesday (March 18), Gal told Variety, “After October 7th [2023], I don't talk politics — because who cares about the celebrity talking about politics? I'm an artist. I want to entertain people. I want to bring hope and be a beacon of light whenever I say anything about the world. But on October 7th, when people were abducted from their homes, from their beds, men, women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors, were going through the horrors of what happened that day, I could not be silent. I was shocked by the amount of hate, by the amount of how much people think they know when they actually have no idea, and also by how the media is not fair many times. So I had to speak up.”

“I'm not a hater. I'm a grandchild of a Holocaust survivor who came to Israel and established his family from scratch after his entire family was erased in Auschwitz. And on the other side of my family, I'm eighth generation Israeli. I'm an indigenous person of Israel,"" she continued.

On why she spoke out, she explained, “I am all about humanity and I felt like I had to advocate for the hostages.” And about criticism she's faced for her views, she added, “when your compass is clear, your conscience is clean. I know what I'm advocating for, and I know what I wish for the world.”

“I am praying for better days for all. I want everybody to have good life and prosperity, and the ability to raise their children in a safe environment,” she said.

Following October 7, more than 700 Hollywood figures signed an open letter condemning Hamas and supporting Israel.

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked President Donald Trump from deporting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, is among the judges who have attracted attention from critics. 'Fox News @ Night' takes a closer look.

Federal judges who have attempted to put up roadblocks to President Donald Trump's deportation efforts could endanger national security, according to one expert.

""It's incredible that basically a rogue judge is putting our national security at risk when they block this enforcement action without any legal basis,"" Alfonso Aguilar, a former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship and the director of Hispanic engagement at the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. ""Swift enforcement of the law is essential to dissuade foreign actors from trying to engage in criminal behavior in our country.""

The comments come after Judge James Boasberg, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, issued an order Saturday halting one of Trump's rapid deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. 

However, the order was not followed by the administration, who argued that the flight was already in the air before it got word of the judge's order, prompting Boasberg to hold a hearing Monday that set a one-day deadline for the administration to provide more information on the flight, such as how many people it was carrying and how many of those were removed ""solely on the basis"" of Trump's interpretation of the 1798 wartime-era Alien Enemies Act.

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

The ruling by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, right, has raised ire among conservatives. (Getty Images)

The act, which was last invoked during World War II, provides the president broad powers to imprison or deport foreign nationals during a time of war.

A proclamation signed by Trump on Saturday claimed that gang members belonging to the Venezuelan-based gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) were ""conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States,"" a follow-up to Trump's move last month to designate several drug cartels, including TdA, as ""Foreign Terrorist Organizations.""

That move prompted a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, eventually resulting in Boasberg's decision to issue a 14-day restraining order halting deportations under the act.

However, Aguilar believes the lawsuits are part of a broader strategy by opponents of the president to bog down his administration, arguing that left-wing groups have engaged in ""forum shopping"" for judges who they believe will be politically sympathetic to resisting Trump.

""We've seen it since the beginning of the administration, on every single executive order, certainly on immigration enforcement actions, is to go forum shopping, they look for a federal district judge that they know is going to be sympathetic to try to block an order or action from the administration,"" Aguilar said.

William Jacobson, a Cornell University law professor and founder of the Equal Protection Project, told Fox News Digital that the trend of judges blocking Trump's orders does raise serious legal questions.

""This has been an issue since the start of the Trump second administration,"" Jacobson said. ""There was a very highly organized effort to drown the administration in lawfare and tie it up and essentially freeze the executive branch.""

Jacobson argued that there have already been a ""number of rulings"" that potentially ""overstepped the boundaries of separation of powers,"" something he noted has already caught the attention of four justices on the Supreme Court.

""The courts are not supposed to rule on political issues,"" Jacobson said. ""The courts are supposed to rule on legal rights. And I think the administration's argument is, and they make this argument in the DC Circuit, in the emergency state that's being briefed right now, that if a judge can interfere in something like this, can a judge order the government not to issue drone strikes on terrorists abroad? Where is the limit in that the federal courts have no ability to interfere in the conduct of foreign policy, in the conduct of military action?""

Jacobson believes that the only way to rectify the situation for the administration will be for the Supreme Court to step in, issuing clear guidance to lower court judges on what they can and cannot rule on.

Aguilar also believes the Supreme Court will need to intervene, though he stressed that delays in the meantime could continue to spell trouble for national security.

""If you send a clear message to these individuals that if you're coming here to commit crime or engage in terrorism, we will detain you. We will remove you immediately,"" he said. ""That serves as a powerful form to dissuade this type of behavior. So it does have an impact on the administration's efforts to protect the security of our country.""

The issue of diversity, equity and inclusion programs is among the most tightly divided and polarizing questions in the United States at this time, with wide gaps emerging along partisan and racial lines, according to the latest national NBC News poll. 

President Donald Trump has made dismantling DEI programs an early focus of his administration, and voters are split over the future of the programs in the workplace, with deep differences depending on their political party.

Half of registered voters (49%) in the NBC News poll say DEI programs should be eliminated “because they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills and experience.” 

And 48% say DEI programs in the workplace should continue “because diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.” 

Asked to share whether they have positive or negative feelings about DEI programs, a slightly higher share of voters (43%) say they have negative feelings, while 39% have positive views and 14% are neutral. (The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.)The divides over DEI are part of a broader cultural split. In another question in the poll asking them to pick between two different statements, 51% of voters say there is “too much political correctness in our society today, and too much pressure on people to limit what they can do or say to avoid offending other people.” Meanwhile, 45% say there is “too much prejudice in our society today and people need to be more respectful in what they do and say to avoid offending other people.” 

Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office to end DEI programs at federal agencies, which prompted some private companies to also roll back programs focused on increasing diversity in the workplace. The Education Department has launched investigations of more than 50 colleges and universities as part of a broader push against DEI programs. The Federal Communications Commission also moved to open an inquiry into DEI practices at Comcast. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)

“When we see these heated conversations at a partisan level about DEI, it really comes down to: How are they looking at American society today? Where do they see the problems? And that's going to lead to very different solutions and very different approaches,” said Democratic pollster Aileen Cardona-Arroyo of Hart Research Associates, which conducted the poll with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm.

Beneath the surface of the overall division in the electorate are wide gaps depending on voters' party affiliation and race. Fully 80% of Republicans believe there is too much political correctness, while 77% of Democrats say there is too much prejudice. Independents are split, with 46% saying there is too much political correctness and 43% saying there is too much prejudice.An overwhelming share of Republicans (85%) believe DEI programs should be eliminated, while the same share of Democrats believe they should continue. More independents side with Democrats on that question, with 59% saying DEI programs should continue and 39% saying they should be eliminated.  

And while younger people were more likely to support DEI programs than older respondents, the issue highlights another example of a wide gender gap among younger voters on politics in the Trump era.Among women ages 18 to 49, 67% say DEI programs should continue, while 31% want to eliminate them. But among men ages 18 to 49, 40% want to continue DEI programs, while 57% say they should be eliminated. More older women support DEI programs than older men, but the gap between them is not as large.

“The survey also points to there being more political intensity and salience for Republicans around these issues than there is for Democrats,” Cardona-Arroyo said, noting the overwhelmingly negative views of DEI programs from voters who make up Trump's base, including white men without a college education, self-described MAGA Republicans and self-described conservatives.

Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies said that Trump's actions on DEI and other issues such as immigration underscore the president's near-unified support from Republicans, which has bolstered Trump's early approval numbers.

“You can see how his efforts, including on DEI, are just really echoing with his core political base,” McInturff said. 

The survey also finds divisions along racial lines, with a majority of white voters saying DEI programs should end and that there is too much political correctness in society. White women with college degrees were the exception among white voters, with 59% saying there is too much prejudice and two-thirds saying DEI programs should continue. 

An overwhelming share of Black voters (80%) say DEI programs should persist, and 71% say there is too much prejudice in society today. The share of Latino voters in the survey was too small to analyze the group's overall views on the issue. 

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

As part of his efforts to crack down on immigration, President Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an obscure law that has been used sparingly throughout U.S. history to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime or an invasion. 

Trump's directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang that has grown into a multinational crime organization over the last decade and was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in February. 

The proclamation authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens ages 14 and older deemed members of the group and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, calling them ""a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States."" 

""I find and declare that [Tren de Aragua] is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,"" the proclamation reads, borrowing the language of the centuries-old act. 

The Alien Enemies Act is a wartime law: It has its roots in a conflict between the U.S. and France, and the three times it has been used until now were all during major wars. 

Legal experts have long been skeptical of the Trump campaign promise — and facet of the 2024 Republican Party platform — to utilize the act during peacetime since immigration hasn't historically constituted an invasion. Immigration advocates worry the act could lead to the targeting of other groups of immigrants, regardless of their criminal history.

Trump's proclamation was immediately blocked by a federal judge, who ordered deportation flights to turn around — though the administration still deported some 250 people to El Salvador. 

""The Trump administration is seeking to circumvent the process that we have in our country in order to just expand power and do something with no process at all,"" Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward — which, along the American Civil Liberties Union, sued over the administration's use of the law — told NPR, adding, ""It's highly concerning and should be concerning for all Americans."" 

The last time the act was invoked was during World War II, when it was used to put thousands of noncitizens of Japanese, German and Italian descent in internment camps — for which the federal government formally apologized decades later. 

""History shows the risks,"" wrote Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel with the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.

Here's what else to know about the act and Trump's efforts to use it. 

The Alien Enemies Act specifically allows the president to detain, relocate, or deport non-citizens from a country considered an enemy of the U.S. during wartime:

“Whenever there shall be a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States, by any foreign nation or government, and the President of the United States shall make public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being males of the age of fourteen years and upwards, who shall be within the United States, and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies.

Congress, with the support of President John Adams, passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 as the U.S. stood on the brink of war with France.

""There was a lot of fear-mongering about French supporters in the United States and about conspiracies to basically get the United States in on France's side,"" Georgetown University Law Center professor Steve Vladeck told NPR during the presidential campaign last fall.

The controversial group of laws severely curtailed civil liberties, including by tightening restrictions on foreign-born Americans and limiting speech critical of the government.

After President Thomas Jefferson was elected in 1800, he either repealed or allowed most of the acts to expire, except for the Alien Enemies Act, which does not have an expiration date.

It not only remained on the books but continued to expand in scope: Congress amended it in 1918 to include women.

The Alien Enemies Act has been used only three times before in American history — all in connection with major military conflicts.

During the War of 1812, all British nationals living in the U.S. were required to report information including their age, length of time in the country, place of residence, family description and whether they had applied for naturalization.

A century later, during World War I, President Woodrow Wilson invoked it against nationals of the Central Powers: the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. 

According to the National Archives, U.S. authorities used the law to place over 6,000 ""enemy aliens"" — many of them Germans — in internment camps, with some remaining in detention up to two years after fighting had ended.

The U.S. Marshals Service says it registered 480,000 German ""enemy aliens"" and arrested 6,300 between the declaration of war in April 1917 and the armistice in November 1918.

Most recently, President Franklin Roosevelt invoked the act after the attack on Pearl Harbor, designating Japanese, German and Italian nationals as ""alien enemies"" during World War II.

Roosevelt's proclamation required residents from all three countries to register with the U.S. government and authorized the internment of any alien enemy ""deemed potentially dangerous to the peace and security of the US.""


                Tom C. Clark, coordinator of the Alien Enemy Control program of the Western Defense Command, points to the first warning card telling ""enemy aliens"" in Los Angeles to evacuate prohibited areas by midnight, Feb. 15, 1942.

By the end of WWII, over 31,000 suspected enemy aliens and their families — including Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany — had been interned at camps and military facilities across the U.S., according to the National Archives. Several thousand of them were ultimately repatriated to their country of origin, either by choice or by force.

Vladeck says the Alien Enemies Act was used to detain mostly Italian and German nationals. The bulk of the more than 100,000 Japanese Americans who were placed in internment camps during the war were U.S. citizens, detained under different legal grounds.

The act's fine print states that the president can only assume this authority once Congress has declared war. While the U.S. has been involved in plenty of conflicts over the decades, it hasn't done so formally since 1942.

""It hasn't been a source of contemporary controversy because we haven't had a declared war,"" Vladeck explains. ""And no one has tried to argue that that invasion or predatory incursion language could be used in any context other than a conventional war.""

Until Trump, that is. The former president — who has a long history of using dehumanizing language against minority groups and political opponents — has repeatedly referred to the influx of migrants to the U.S. as an ""invasion"" and vowed mass deportations. 

Ebright, with the Brennan Center, called Trump's argument a  ""flagrantly illegal"" power grab. 

""The president has falsely proclaimed an invasion and predatory incursion to use a law written for wartime for peacetime immigration enforcement,"" she wrote after Trump invoked the act. ""The courts should shut this down.""

The Trump administration has defended its actions and pushed back against a federal judge's attempts to intervene, even refusing to answer basic questions about its deportation flights.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the administration ""acted within the confines of the law"" and is ""wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court.""

But even some anti-immigration advocates in favor of deploying the act have acknowledged the likely legal obstacles.

Defining illegal immigration as an invasion and migrant gangs as foreign nations would be an ""uphill climb in federal court,"" George Fishman, former deputy general counsel at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Trump, wrote in 2023.

Trump doesn't need the Alien Enemies Act to go after undocumented immigrants, Vladeck says, noting that presidents already have the authority to arrest, detain and remove them.

""The issue that has hamstrung each of the last four presidents, of both parties, has not been legal authority — it's a lack of resources,"" he says. ""The federal government doesn't have the capacity to identify, track down, round up and remove every single one of the 11 million-plus undocumented immigrants in this country.""

He said he doesn't expect courts to look kindly upon Trump invoking the act ""where, one, he doesn't need it, and two, it would really be a stretch in what is already a pretty controversial legal power."" 

Ebright agreed that ""immigration law already gives the president ample authority to deport Tren de Aragua members who inflict harm on our communities."" Still, she said, it's not completely clear what the courts will do. 

The last time the Supreme Court heard a case on the act, in 1948, it deemed questions about the definition of wartime too political to answer. On the other hand, she noted, a lot has changed since then.  Ebright wrote last year that the surest way to prevent the act from being abused would be for Congress to proactively repeal it.

Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats, have tried to do so in recent years by introducing the ""Neighbors Not Enemies"" Act, which would repeal the Alien Enemies Act, but hasn't gained traction.

The lawmakers reintroduced the act in January, two days after Trump took office. 

""We cannot allow antiquated laws to continue enabling discriminatory practices that harm immigrant communities,"" Omar said at the time. ""Repealing this law is a necessary step toward creating an immigration system rooted in justice and compassion.""

Trump announced the files' release while visiting the Kennedy Center Monday.

The Justice Department's National Security Division has been in a scramble trying to meet President Donald Trump's promise on Monday to release declassified information from the JFK assassination investigation today.

Trump, during a visit Monday to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, announced the government would be releasing all the files on Kennedy's assassination on Tuesday afternoon.

Less than half an hour after that announcement, the Justice Department's office that handles foreign surveillance requests and other intelligence-related operations began to shift resources to focus on the task, sources said.

In an email just before 5 p.m. ET Monday, a senior official within DOJ's Office of Intelligence said that even though the FBI had already conducted ""an initial declassification review"" of the documents, ""all"" of the attorneys in the operations section now had to provide ""a second set of eyes"" to help with this ""urgent NSD-wide project.""

Eventually, however, it was other National Security Division attorneys who ended up having to help, sources said.

Attorneys from across the division were up throughout the night, into the early morning hours, each reading through as many as hundreds of pages of documents, sources said. Only prosecutors with an impending arrest or other imminent work did not have to help, sources said.

A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

In promising the release of JFK files today, Trump said Monday that there is ""a tremendous amount of paper.""

""You've got a lot of reading,"" he said. ""I don't believe we're going to redact anything. I said, 'Just don't redact. You can't redact.'""

Trump in January signed an executive order directing the ""full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy"" in order to end the decades-long wait for the release of the government's secret files on Kennedy's 1963 assassination.

A visitor to Arlington National Cemetery's website earlier this year would have seen links to information about a wide range of notable African Americans, Hispanic Americans and women buried there.

Not anymore.

The Trump administration unpublished, altered, or hid content and links about all three groups buried at the cemetery ‒ one of the nation's most hallowed military sites.

Links for other ""notable graves"" of veterans remain, as well as for sports figures, and leaders in politics, medicine, science and culture.

The alterations are part of a sweeping effort by the Trump administration and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove references throughout the department to diversity, equity and inclusion issues or ""gender ideology.""

Dozens of pages and links on the national cemetery's website appear to have been caught up in the purge.

One now-missing page on the cemetery's website linked to 14 educational lesson plans on African Americans, including walking tours and a unit on the famed Tuskegee Airmen, according to a search of the Wayback Machine by Internet Archive. The unlinked lesson plans are still available through a web search.

A similar lesson plan page devoted to the Borinqueneers ‒ a storied unit of Puerto Rican soldiers awarded for their service in the world wars and the Korean War ‒ is now even more difficult to find.

Other pages also vanished from the website, but are still accessible through Google searches.

In response to questions from USA TODAY, the cemetery stated some of the removed content is being restored, while still complying with the orders from President Donald Trump and the Department of Defense. It did not specify which pages will be restored and when.

What the Trump administration means for your identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.

Kevin Levin, a historian and educator in Boston who specializes in Civil War history, brought attention to the changes in a newsletter published on March 8. He told USA TODAY he learned of the changes from a teacher using the website.

“The story of Arlington is essentially a story of diversity, equity and inclusion,” Levin said. “That is the very thing that the Trump administration is trying to wipe clean, and that entails erasing our history.”

More than 400,000 people are buried at Arlington. The first military burial at the Virginia cemetery, operated by the U.S. Army, took place on May 13, 1864. Among the historical figures buried there are two U.S. presidents, John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft; Gen. Colin Powell, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Supreme Justice Thurgood Marshall; and boxer Joe Louis, a former world heavyweight champion and grandson of a slave.

""Stepping on the grounds of Arlington offers a powerful reminder of the service and sacrifice of Americans from all walks of life,"" Levin wrote in his newsletter. In recent years, the cemetery had expanded its historical accounts of people who fought and died for the country, he said, creating a way for students around the country who may not get to visit Arlington, to connect with people from more diverse backgrounds.

With the ongoing changes, Levin said he worries about how materials may be rewritten, ""and in what way those revisions prevent us from getting at the full history of Arlington.""

From the beginning of his second term, the president made it clear he wanted to eradicate references to diversity, equity and inclusion. He signed an executive order ""ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs"" on Inauguration Day, and another related order on DEI in the military on Jan. 27.

The Office of Personnel Management sent out a memo on Jan. 21 directing all agencies to take several steps on DEI, including taking down ""all outward facing media"" of diversity and inclusion offices.

On Jan. 29, the DOD distributed a memo stating diversity, equity and inclusion policies are ""incompatible"" with the department's values. Hegseth also created a task force to oversee the ""standing down"" of the diversity and inclusion offices throughout the department and military services and the end of all actions by the offices that promote ""ideologies related to systemic racism or gender fluidity.""

""The DOD mission is to win the nation's wars,"" Hegseth said. ""To do this, we must have a lethal fighting force that rewards individual initiative, excellence and hard work based on merit.""

Hegseth set a March 1 deadline for an initial report from the task force and a final deadline of June 1.

On Feb. 26, Sean Parnell, assistant to the Defense secretary for public affairs, ordered all department news and feature articles, photos and videos that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion be removed. The memo also directed that all removed items be archived.  The memo also stated the websites should provide blanket statements to acknowledge content was being removed to align with the executive orders from the president. 

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, criticized the recent changes in an emailed statement to USA TODAY, calling them ""an egregious insult to the people who have served our country valiantly.""

""Wasting time on so-called culture wars entirely of the Trump Administration's own making is a monumental waste of time and resources,"" Smith said. ""If they were serious about addressing inefficiency in the Defense Department there are plenty of real issues to focus on.""

Committee chair Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., did not respond to requests for comment.

Changes also have occurred to other DOD websites, including military branches and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to eradicate mentions of Black History Month and Pride Month, which celebrates gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and transgender individuals.

In some cases, the keyword searches being used to flag content pulled up subjects that had entirely different meanings. The Associated Press reported, for example, that photos were flagged on the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The news shocked the granddaughter of the pilot Paul W. Tibbetts Jr., whose mother the plane was named for, the Columbus Dispatch reported.

The DOD removed an article linked to Black History Month about Army Maj. Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers, the most senior Black soldier ever awarded the Medal of Honor.

A West Virginia native, Rogers served in the Army for 32 years, including during the Vietnam War. He was recognized for ""conspicuous gallantry"" for his service while a lieutenant colonel commanding an artillery battalion. He was wounded three times while helping to repel an attack on a forward support base, according to the citation. Awarded the Medal by then-President Richard Nixon in 1970, Rogers was buried at Arlington when he died in 1990.

Social media sleuths noticed the article's web address in a copy available in the Wayback Machine had the letters ""dei"" added before medal.

After a public outcry, the department reinstated the article as of Monday, flagging it as part of a historical collection. USA TODAY has asked the DOD for comment about the article removal.

Among the other changes:

◾Some videos and at least three pages with articles for Black History Month in 2024 are no longer available on the Army's website.

◾Black History Month photos were removed from the DOD's visual information distribution website.

◾On the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers website, a story about engineering pioneer Hattie Peterson was taken down.

◾On a U.S. Army site, a story with a timeline of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the armed forces is no longer accessible.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA TODAY'}"

PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic — The family of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki has asked police in the Dominican Republic to declare her dead, a police spokesman said Monday.

Dominican Republic National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said Konanki's family has sent the agency a letter requesting a declaration of death.

Konanki, 20, was on spring break with friends in the Caribbean island nation when she disappeared early March 6. Despite an extensive search, her body has not been found.

The Konanki family did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

Konanki is a junior in biology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is from Loudoun County, Virginia, where her family lives. 

Konanki was last seen early March 6 after she went to the beach with friends. 

After her friends left the beach, she stayed behind with people she met on the trip. She vanished after 4:15 a.m. that day.

The last person thought to have seen Konanki has been identified as Joshua Riibe, 22, a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is from Rock Rapids, Iowa. 

Dominican authorities confiscated Riibe's passport Friday as part of an investigation, his attorneys told NBC News.

NBC News spotted Riibe with investigators and his attorney on a beach in Punta Cana early Sunday. He was seen pointing toward the sea while a group of security officials kept people away from the area.

Speaking exclusively to NBC News briefly at the resort where Konanki had been staying before she disappeared, and before he was spotted by NBC News on the beach, Riibe said, “I'm just trying to help them out,” adding: “The ocean is a dangerous place.”

Riibe “has been confined to the hotel since the investigation began. He is permanently escorted by the police anywhere he goes. So no, he is not free to leave,” the law firm representing him said in an email Saturday.

Pesqueira, the national police spokesperson, said no signs of violence were found at the beach.

A hotel spokesperson said red flags — which indicate “that the sea had a strong current and very high waves” — were flying when Konanki disappeared.

In an interview last week with Dominican investigators, Riibe said he was on the beach with Konanki shortly before she disappeared.

He said they were “in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,” according to a transcript of the interview obtained by NBC News. A wave crashed, taking them both “out to sea,” it quotes him saying.

“I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,” he said.

Riibe said he got Konanki back to shore before she disappeared.

“The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her answer,” he said. “I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she'd grabbed her things and left.”

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have said no one is considered a suspect in Konanki's disappearance. 

U.S. authorities have said it is a missing persons case and not a criminal matter.

Over the weekend, the Trump administration transferred more than 200 immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order to bar the deportations temporarily.

On Saturday night, District Judge James E. Boasberg ordered the administration not to deport anyone in its custody over the newly invoked Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century declaration that has only been used three times in U.S. history, all during periods of war. Trump issued a proclamation that the 1798 law was newly in effect due to what he claimed was an “invasion” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Flights were in the air at the time of the ruling.

On Monday, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit to halt the deportations and asked a federal judge to force officials to explain under oath whether they violated his court order.

Here's the latest:

The Trump administration has fired most of the board of the U.S. Institute of Peace and sent its new leader into the Washington headquarters of the independent organization Monday.

The remaining three members of the group's board fired President and CEO George Moose on Friday, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.

An executive order Trump signed last month targeted the organization and others for reductions.

Current USIP employees said staffers from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency entered the building despite protests that the nonprofit is not part of the executive branch.

Moose called it “an illegal takeover by elements of the executive branch of a private nonprofit.”

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the organization wasn't complying with Trump's executive order and that “rogue bureaucrats will not be allowed to hold agencies hostage.”

Trump says Bryan Bedford will bring over three decades of experience in aviation and executive leadership to the “critical position” of administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.

He said Bedford will work with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to overhaul the agency, safeguard exports and ensure the safety of air travelers.

The position requires Senate confirmation.

Employees of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have entered the U.S. Institute of Peace despite protests from the nonprofit that it is not part of the executive branch and is instead an independent agency.

The organization's CEO, George Moose, said, “DOGE has broken into our building.”

The DOGE workers gained access after several unsuccessful attempts Monday and after having been turned away on Friday, a senior U.S. Institute of Peace official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

It was not immediately clear what the DOGE staffers were doing or looking for in the nonprofit's building.

Associated Press reporter Matthew Lee contributed.

President Trump said Monday he was ending “immediately” the Secret Service protection details assigned to Joe Biden's adult children, which the former president had extended for six months shortly before leaving office in January.

Trump, in a social media post, objected to what he said were 18 agents assigned to Hunter Biden's protective detail while he is in South Africa this week. He said Ashley Biden has 13 agents assigned to her detail and that she too “will be taken off the list” for protection.

Former presidents and their spouses receive life-long Secret Service protection under federal law, but the protection afforded to their immediate families over the age of 16 ends when they leave office, though both Trump and Biden extended the details for their children for six months before leaving office.

An autopen is a mechanical device that is used to replicate a person's authentic signature. A pen or other writing implement is held by an arm of the machine, which reproduces a signature after a writing sample has been fed to it. Presidents, including Trump, have used them for decades. Autopens aren't the same as an old-fashioned ink pad and rubber stamp or the electronic signatures used on PDF documents.

The Oversight Project at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank recently said its analysis of thousands of pages of documents bearing Biden's signature found that most were by autopen, including pardons. Conservative media have amplified the claims, which have been picked up by Trump. He has commented for several days running about Biden's autopen use.

Mike Howell, the project's executive director, said in an interview that his team is scrutinizing Biden's pardons because that power lies only with the president under the Constitution and can't be delegated to another person or a machine. Howell said some of Biden's pardon papers also specify they were signed in Washington on days when he was elsewhere.

There is no law governing a president's use of an autopen.

The president of a small U.S. federal agency that invests in businesses in South America and the Caribbean has sued Monday to block her firing last month by the Trump administration.

After Sara Aviel was fired from the Inter-American Foundation, a Trump appointee declared himself the acting president and laid off almost the entire staff. Since then, the administration has canceled essentially all of the agency's contracts.

“This wholesale gutting of the IAF by the Government flies in the face of the law,” Aviel said in her suit.

The Trump administration also targeted three other independent federal agencies for closure.

No One Left Behind helps Afghans and Iraqis who qualify for the special immigrant visa program, which was set up by Congress in 2009 to help people who are in danger because of their efforts to aid the U.S. during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.

The charitable organization consists of U.S. military veterans, Afghans who once fled their country and volunteers in the U.S. Their efforts come after the Trump administration took steps to hinder Afghans who helped America's war effort from resettling in the U.S.

In a marked departure from the previous administration, Trump gave U.S. Central Command the ability to take action when it deems appropriate.

The Biden administration had required White House approval to conduct offensive strikes such as the ones over the weekend. It did allow U.S. forces to launch defensive attacks whenever necessary, including the authority to take out weapons that appeared to be ready to fire.

Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said delegating the authority for an offensive mission to the regional commander “allows us to achieve a tempo of operations where we can react to opportunities that we see on the battlefield in order to continue to put pressure on the Houthis.”

He said the expanded authorities also allow the U.S. to hit a broader array of targets.

U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Trump made the decision last week.

Associated Press reporter Lolita C. Baldor contributed.

Thousands of Food and Drug Administration employees are returning to the office to find overflowing parking lots, cramped workspaces and missing equipment.

The FDA is the latest federal agency scrambling to meet the Trump administration's return-to-office mandate. Monday was the first day that all FDA staffers were required to report to the agency's headquarters in Maryland.

Staffers who spoke with The Associated Press described long lines to park and get through security, followed by hours of hunting for office space and supplies. Employees also confronted broken desks, missing chairs and locked offices for which they didn't have keys.

Trump, after he was sworn into office, ordered the release of the remaining classified files related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

While at the Kennedy Center, Trump told reporters his administration will release 80,000 files on Tuesday, though it's not clear how many of those are among the millions of documents that have already been made public.

“We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading,” Trump said to reporters.

He also said he doesn't believe anything will be redacted from the files.

“I said, ‘Just don't redact. You can't redact,'” he said.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, speaking ahead of an expected phone conversation Tuesday between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Monday that while the negotiations to end Russia's war with Ukraine have just begun, Trump is “looking forward to success.”

Gabbard criticized former President Joe Biden's handling of the war in Ukraine and said Trump's push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an “unwavering commitment to peace.”

Trump will speak with Putin on Tuesday in a possible pivot point in efforts to end the war in Ukraine and an opportunity for Trump to continue reorienting American foreign policy.

Over the weekend, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport more than 200 people he said were part of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

Trump has not identified who was deported, nor provided any evidence they are in fact members of the gang or that they committed any crimes.

The flights from the U.S. to El Salvador were already in the air when a federal judge issued an order to stop the action.

To invoke the law from 1798, a president has to declare the U.S. is at war. He can then detain or deport people who aren't citizens who would otherwise be protected by immigration or criminal laws. The last time it was used was to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.

The White House used the song in a deportation video on social media showing a man with his wrists handcuffed and shackled to his waist as he's patted down. The video was captioned with the song's lyrics “You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.”

“We did not authorize or condone the White House's use of our song in any way. And no, they didn't ask. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely,” the power pop trio said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Asked about it Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “our entire government clearly is leaning into the message of this president.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection retweeted the White House's post on X with the caption “It's closing time. We are making America safe again.”

Semisonic joins a long list of performers who've objected to Trump using their songs.

Military leaders say the U.S. airstrikes in Yemen against Houthi targets have struck more than 30 targets since Saturday, including headquarters locations, drone launch sites and weapons storage facilities.

Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated those strikes have killed “dozens” of militants and would continue in the coming days.

The strikes targeted headquarters positions and drone sites where militants the Pentagon identified as “key leaders” for the Houthis' drone program were located, Grynkewich told reporters Monday.

During the attacks, the Houthis claimed to fire one-way attack drones and ballistic missiles in response.

At a news briefing, both Grynkewich and Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the responses “didn't come anywhere near” U.S. assets in the region, including the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman.

“He'll be coming in the not too distant future,” Trump said during a meeting of the new Kennedy Center board.

Trump mentioned the Xi visit as he said he's had foreign leaders visiting him at the White House in recent weeks and has been asking them how Washington looks.

Trump says he's “cleaning up Washington,” including trying to clear tents used by the homeless and graffiti.

The president said he took time out of his day Monday afternoon to go to the performing arts center because it “represents a very important part of D.C. and actually our country.”

“I think it's important to save this structure and this building,” he said.

He said his message to Americans was “Come here and see a show.” But then he immediately followed up by saying, “I was never a big fan, I never liked ‘Hamilton' very much.” The popular Broadway musical canceled planned shows at the center after Trump took over the institution's leadership.

The Environmental Protection Agency says it reinstated about 419 employees in response to the ruling Thursday night that ordered agencies across the government to bring back workers fired by the Trump administration.

Most of the affected EPA employees have been placed on administrative leave, an agency spokesperson said in an email Monday.

Tens of thousands of probationary workers were let go in mass firings across multiple agencies as part of Trump's dramatic downsizing of the federal government. Two judges separately found legal problems with the way the terminations were carried out and ordered the employees at least temporarily brought back on the job.

The deportation of 34-year-old Dr. Rasha Alawieha over the weekend has sparked widespread alarm.

Homeland Security officials on Monday said Alawieha “openly admitted” to attending the funeral of a Hezbollah leader, as well as supporting him. News outlets that were able to obtain access to sealed court records report that Alawieh had photos of Hassan Nasrallah — the leader of the Lebanese militant group for the past three decades — on her phone.

Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who had worked and lived in Rhode Island previously, was detained at least 36 hours. She was to start work at Brown as an assistant professor of medicine.

The flood of workers at the main campus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention caused extreme traffic back-ups and other delays Monday morning.

Employees said driving the last two miles took as long as 40 minutes. One said a CDC administrator greeted employees coming back with a card that said; “YOU ARE APPRECIATED!”

Many CDC employees began working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the Trump administration ordered that employees who live within 50 miles of the office had to show up in-person starting Monday.

Many CDC workers have been dreading the return, in part because the CDC in the last few years has been reducing the amount of office space it leases in the Atlanta area, meaning fewer desks and parking spaces.

The steady trading may be short-lived, though, with a decision by the Federal Reserve on interest rates coming later in the week and worries continuing about President Trump's trade war.

The S&P 500 was 1% higher in afternoon trading, coming off its fourth straight losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 483 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:34 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% higher.

Stocks have been tumbling recently on worries that Trump's rat -a- tat announcements on tariffs and other policies are creating so much uncertainty that they'll push U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending, which would hurt the economy.

She was asked by a reporter about a video of the deportations the White House shared on its X account Monday showing a man with his wrists handcuffed and shackled to his waist as he was patted down. The video was set to the Semisonic song, “Closing Time.”

“I think the White House and our entire government clearly is leaning into the message of this president. And we are unafraid to double down and to take responsibility and ownership of the serious decisions that are being made,” Leavitt said said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wouldn't get into details about Tuesday's scheduled call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But she sounded optimistic that the talks can help push Russia closer to a deal to end it's three-year war in Ukraine.

“I won't get ahead of those negotiations, but I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace,” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “And we've never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment. And the president, as you know, is determined to get one done.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday again said the Trump administration did not violate a court order when it deported more than 200 immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge ordered the deportations to be temporarily stopped.

“All of the planes that were subject to the written order of this judge departed U.S. soil, U.S. territory, before the judge's written order,” Leavitt said at a news briefing.

Leavitt said there are questions about whether the judge's verbal order “carries the same weight as a legal order, as a written order.”

The announcement Monday from the Department of Veterans Affairs said the change was in response to President Trump's executive order declaring there are two sexes, male and female. The VA has never offered gender-affirming surgery, but has provided hormones, voice training and prosthetics to a small number of patients.

The VA will continue to offer hormone therapy to veterans already receiving such care and those who become eligible for VA care who were receiving hormones in the military. Veterans with gender dysphoria will continue to receive other types of care.

VA Secretary Doug Collins said transgender veterans “will always be welcome at VA,” but if veterans want “to attempt to change their sex, they can do so on their own dime.”

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the U.S. has been “extremely generous” over the years and “of course, it's within its rights to decide what it supports and to what extent.”

“But the U.S. also has a responsibility to ensure that if it withdraws direct funding for countries, it's done in an orderly and humane way that allows them to find alternative sources of funding,” the U.N. health agency chief told reporters in Geneva.

In his first day back in the Oval Office in January, President Trump issued an executive order announcing a U.S. pullout from WHO — which takes a year to take effect — and called for a pause of U.S. funding for the agency. Sweeping cuts to funding through the U.S. Agency for International Development has hit many aid providers hard.

Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France. So says a French politician who's making headlines in his country for suggesting the U.S. is no longer worthy of the monument that was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.

As a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, Raphaël Glucksmann cannot claim to speak for all of his compatriots.

But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans “have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants” reflects the broad shockwaves President Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe.

New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday during his first official overseas trip, seeking support from one of Ottawa's oldest allies as Trump attacks Canada's sovereignty and economy.

Macron did not address Trump's attacks on Canada ahead of the talks but noted tariffs only bring inflation.

“In the current international context, we want to be able to develop our most strategic projects with our closest, more loyal partners,” Macron said, adding that “we are stronger together, better able to ensure the respect of our interests, the full exercise of our sovereignty.”

Carney was sworn in Friday. After Paris, his next stop was London, where he was due to hold talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles III, the head of state in Canada.

The federal lawsuit seeks to to block enforcement of executive orders Momodou Taal fears could lead to his deportation.

Taal, 31, is a Ph.D. student in Africana studies at Cornell University and is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia.

He was temporarily suspended last fall after participating in a demonstration on the Cornell campus in upstate New York. He has limited access to campus for research, medical and religious reasons as he continues his studies remotely, according to the lawsuit.

The suit filed Saturday by Taal and two of his allies at the Ivy League school cite the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student, as well as a statement by President Trump promising more arrests at universities across the country.

The measure, approved by Republican majorities in the House and Senate, eliminates a federal fee on companies that release high levels of methane, a planet-warming “super pollutant.”

The fee, which hadn't gone into effect, was expected to bring in more than $7 billion over the next decade and lower U.S. methane emissions, averting thousands of early deaths and tens of thousands of asthma attacks and lost school days every year.

Methane is a much stronger global warming gas than carbon dioxide, especially in the short term. Oil and gas producers are among the biggest U.S. methane emitters.

Republicans said the fee would inflate energy prices, reduce domestic energy production and empower U.S. adversaries.

After Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool was no longer welcome in the U.S. and posted his decision Friday on social media, South African embassy staff were summoned to the State Department and given a formal diplomatic note explaining the move, the department said.

“We made the embassy aware that Ambassador Rasool has been found unacceptable by the United States to be a representative of his country,” the department said.

It said Rasool's diplomatic privileges and immunities expired Monday and he would be required to leave the United States by March 21. It isn't clear if he's in the U.S. now.

Rubio announced his decision in a post on X, accusing Rasool of being a “race-baiting politician” who hates President Trump.

Plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed to halt deportations under a rarely-used 18th century wartime law invoked by President Trump asked a federal judge Monday to force officials to explain under oath whether they violated his court order by removing more than 200 people from the country after it was issued and celebrating it on social media.

The motion marks another escalation in the battle over Trump's aggressive opening moves in his second term, several of which have been temporarily halted by judges. Trump's allies have raged over the holds and suggested he doesn't have to obey them, and some plaintiffs have said it appears the administration is flouting court orders.

McGregor appeared in the briefing room alongside press secretary Karoline Leavitt, where he criticized his country's government as having “abandoned the voices of the people of Ireland.” He said there was “zero action with zero accountability,” and complained about the “illegal immigration racket.”

His comments come days after Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin visited the White House to meet with President Trump.

McGregor has faced legal problems of his own. He was ordered to pay 250,000 Euros ($257,000) to a woman who sued him for sexual assault. McGregor denied the accusations.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was planning to promote his new book, “Antisemitism in America: A Warning,” but is rescheduling after some liberal groups shared plans to stage protests.

A representative for Schumer's book, Risa Heller, said that the tour would be rescheduled “due to security concerns.”

The cancellations of events in Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and other cities came amid widespread criticism from the party's liberal base over Schumer's vote to move forward with Republican spending legislation last week.

Schumer said the bill was “terrible” but that a shutdown would have been far worse, and difficult to get out of, as Trump has already slashed jobs and funding for agencies across the government.

U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending a just bit in February after a sharp pullback the previous month, signaling Americans are shopping more cautiously as concerns about the direction of the economy mount.

Retail sales rose just 0.2% in February, a small rebound after a sharp drop of 1.2% in January, the Commerce Department said Monday. Sales rose at grocery stores, home and garden stores, and online retailers. Sales fell at auto dealers, restaurants, and electronics stores.

The small increase suggests Americans may be growing more wary about spending as the stock market has plunged and Trump's tariff threats and government spending cuts have led to widespread uncertainty among consumers and businesses.

The Sunday meeting came two days after Jeffries publicly criticized Schumer over a vote to move forward on Republican spending legislation.

The two New Yorkers met in Brooklyn, according to a person familiar with the meeting.

Schumer announced Thursday that he would join with Republicans on a key procedural vote to move the spending legislation to final passage. He said that the bill was “terrible” but that a shutdown would be far worse, and Democrats would not have an “off ramp” to get out of it.

Jeffries strongly disagreed and repeatedly declined to answer questions Friday about whether he has confidence in Schumer.

“We do not want to shut down the government. But we are not afraid of a government funding showdown,” Jeffries said.

The meeting was first reported by Punchbowl News.

The Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China — some already in place, others set to take effect in a few weeks — are already driving up the cost of building materials used in new residential construction and home remodeling projects.

The tariffs are projected to raise the costs that go into building a single-family home in the U.S. by $7,500 to $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Such costs are typically passed along to the homebuyer in the form of higher prices, which could hurt demand at a time when the U.S. housing market remains in a slump and many builders are having to offer buyers costly incentives to drum up sales.

But the calm may not last with a decision coming this week on interest rates from the Federal Reserve and worries continuing about President Trump's trade war.

The S&P 500 was up 0.2% early Monday. The index is coming off its fourth straight losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 97 points, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.1%.

Stocks have been tumbling on worries that Trump's rat-a-tat announcements on tariffs and other policies are creating so much uncertainty that they'll push U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending.

The Houthi rebels started attacking military and commercial ships in one of the world's busiest shipping corridors shortly after the war in Gaza began between Hamas and Israel in October 2023.

The Houthis said they were targeting vessels on the Red Sea with links to Israel or its allies — the United States and the U.K. — in solidarity with Palestinians, but some vessels had little or no link to the war.

The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, until the current ceasefire in Gaza took effect in mid-January. Other missiles and drones were intercepted or failed to reach their targets, which included Western military ones.

March 18 (UPI) -- Serial Guinness World Record-breaker David Rush may have created a new title category by juggling in all 63 U.S. national parks.

Rush, who holds the most concurrent Guinness World Records, visited all 63 U.S. national parks with his family over the course of five years, and at each park he took some time to film himself juggling.

Rush said he is now attempting to get a Guinness World Records title for his accomplishment.

""If I'm not the first to do it (which as far as I can tell I am), I'm at least the fastest, completing this journey in under five years,"" Rush wrote online.

Guinness World Records' online database does not currently list a title for juggling in every national park, so if Rush's application is successful, he will be the first to hold the record.

Rush's sons, Jeremy and Peter, completed the Junior Ranger program at each park the family visited, and have applied to originate the record for the youngest brothers to earn Junior Ranger badges at all U.S. national parks.

U.S. Justice Department Orders National-Security Lawyers to Review JFK Documents

Reuters

By Sarah N. Lynch

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department is ordering some of its lawyers who handle sensitive national-security matters to urgently review records from the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy that are due to be released on Tuesday, according to an email seen by Reuters.

Christopher Robinson, a National Security Division official, announced that ""all"" attorneys who work in the Operations Section of the Office of Intelligence are being ordered to review between 400 and 500 documents each, according to a Monday evening email seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

It is not clear whether that would interfere with the lawyers' regular work, which includes filing court requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor foreigners on U.S. soil. 

A Justice Department spokesman said that ""no FISA work was halted"" as a result of the review.

Robinson imposed a deadline of noon Tuesday to complete the review, which includes records related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, as well as Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., and ""possibly others.""

Trump has ordered roughly 80,000 pages of material related to Kennedy's assassination to be released, along with government records related to the assassinations of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and civil-rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

He previously signed an executive order in January, prompting the FBI to search for thousands of records.

""There is an urgent declassification review of documents related to the JFK, RFK, MLK investigations (and possibly others),"" Robinson wrote to the attorneys in the Office of Intelligence, adding that the only people exempt from the assignment are those who are on approved leave.

Related: 

""Everyone is being asked to review a batch of documents (between 400-500 each),"" he said.

Robinson said that FBI agents have already reviewed some of those files as part of the declassification review.

Last week, some FBI agents were ordered to stop working on their usual cases so that they could review files related to the 1968 assassination of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

The Operations Section of the Office of Intelligence is in charge of preparing and filing warrant applications with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to collect communications of foreigners on domestic soil.

Former department attorneys said the decision to require all of the attorneys from the Office of Intelligence Operations Section to handle the declassification review is highly unusual, and could undermine legitimate national security work.

""If the commitment of such resources came at the expense of processing FISA applications, that would be to the detriment of U.S. national security interests,"" said David Laufman, the former chief of the Justice Department's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. 

John F. Kennedy's murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald. The Justice Department and other federal government bodies later reaffirmed that conclusion.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now leads the Department of Health and Human Services, has alleged without evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency was involved. The CIA has repeatedly denied the claim.

He has also claimed his father was killed by multiple gunmen, a claim contradicted by official accounts.

STAFF SHAKEUP

The declassification review follows a staffing shakeup within the National Security Division.

Earlier this month, the head of the Office of Intelligence and another career official were abruptly reassigned to other jobs, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as part of a broader effort to purge career employees.

The leadership of the National Security Division, which would normally be staffed by up to 12 lawyers, has dwindled to about three attorneys, one of the sources said.

Trump and his allies have long complained about the use of FISA warrants after the Justice Department's inspector general in 2019 uncovered widespread errors by the FBI in its warrant applications during its investigation into contacts between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.

Decades before McDonald's, there was White Castle. Historians credit the hamburger chain with creating the modern fast-food industry as we know it.


The legend goes that White Castle founder Walter ""Walt"" Anderson started making hamburgers in the early to mid-1910s after he grew frustrated with how long it took to cook meatballs. So one day, Anderson smashed a meatball with a spatula, and, boom, he had a hamburger patty that he could cook much faster. If that's true, Anderson's embrace of hamburgers was really part of a quest for greater productivity — to cook and sell more meat sandwiches in less time.


That origin story may or may not be bogus, but after founding White Castle in 1921, Anderson and his co-founder, Billy Ingram, pioneered many of the hallmarks of the fast-food industry, including helping to make hamburgers a national staple, standardizing practices across their chain restaurants and bringing an assembly-line mindset to food production. White Castle took many pains to be productive, like making its burgers square to maximize the number of burgers that could fit on a grill, and limiting its menu to only a few items, which streamlined the process of preparing, cooking and serving food. (For more on the pioneering history of White Castle, listen to this Planet Money collaboration with 99% Invisible).


So, yeah, from the very beginning, fast-food restaurants were designed to be the epitome of productivity. Nearly everything about them was geared toward serving customers as quickly and efficiently as possible.


However, according to a new study, fast-food and other restaurants stopped seeing productivity gains between 1992 and 2019. While the productivity of the rest of the economy ""steadily grew,"" it remained ""flat"" for restaurants, the authors write. Fast-food chains and other restaurants struggled to find innovative ways to serve customers at a faster clip.


The study doesn't dig into why restaurants saw a slowdown in productivity growth. Maybe after so many years of innovations, fast-food restaurants hit a ceiling and had trouble finding more efficiencies. They apparently failed to take advantage of big technological changes, like the mass adoption of the internet and smartphones, to serve customers faster. Or maybe fast-food chains did streamline their business processes with the help of new technologies, but at the same time, maybe there were productivity-sucking counterforces. For example, maybe consumers started wanting a greater variety of food and fast-food companies diversified their menus, making food preparation more complicated and slower. Whatever the reason, this study finds, fast-food and other restaurants stopped seeing significant productivity growth for nearly 30 years.


But according to this new study, that dramatically changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fast-food and other restaurants saw ""a startling surge"" in productivity — and they've remained more productive since.


What caused this ""curious surge"" in productivity? That's today in the Planet Money newsletter. 








The name of the study is ""The Curious Surge of Productivity in U.S. Restaurants,"" and it's by economists Austan Goolsbee, Chad Syverson, Rebecca Goldgof and Joe Tatarka.


When the pandemic hit in 2020, the economists found, the restaurant industry saw a brief but steep drop in productivity. There were tons of disruptions to business during the era of lockdowns and social distancing, and that hurt the ability of restaurants to serve customers.


Pretty soon after, however, something remarkable started happening: Restaurants awoke from their decades-long productivity slumber and started innovating to serve customers faster.


The economists found that after 2020, the restaurant industry saw a surge in productivity ""to a level some 15% higher than the pre-COVID steady state that had prevailed for decades. This surge has persisted even as overall economic conditions seemed to return to normal."" Put another way, the average restaurant saw 15% more sales per employee.


Why did this happen? The economists run through various explanations for the productivity surge and then knock down most of them.


Is this possibly just a weird, COVID-related fluke in the data? Nope. They found a persistent change across multiple datasets.


Is this possibly because many restaurants died during the pandemic, and this helped give a boost to the restaurants that survived? In particular, did surviving restaurants find cost savings and efficiencies — in econospeak, ""economies of scale"" — because they now had less competition and a potentially larger pool of customers? No, the economists found. The data doesn't support that hypothesis.


To find the answer to why restaurants got more productive, the economists turned to ""microdata"" from smartphones. This data offers systematic information on things like how much time and money customers spend at restaurants. This data, they say, is more comprehensive for fast-food (aka ""limited service"") restaurants, so they focused on that sector of the market. Their data covers visits to ""over 100,000 restaurants across the U.S."" from January 2019 to December 2022, representing about $24 billion in sales.


So why did fast-food restaurants get more productive? The economists found a big clue in the data: The average length of time customers spent at restaurants fell, and the percentage of customers spending less than 10 minutes at restaurants skyrocketed. And who spends less than 10 minutes at a restaurant? Takeout and delivery customers! Since the pandemic, customers have wanted takeout and delivery much more than before. And, the economists say, this change in consumer behavior enabled restaurants to rejigger their business and labor processes in innovative ways.


""Restaurants figured out how to serve more customers faster, especially the type that aren't going to be there long,"" says Chad Syverson, an economist at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, who co-authored this study. ""They saw an especially big increase in the number of customers whose orders they could fulfill and get out the door in less than 10 minutes.""


While the economists' data doesn't say exactly what businesses did to accommodate customers faster, Syverson points to various anecdotal examples. For instance, restaurants began using smartphone apps to interface with customers much more during the pandemic. And they began doing things like building takeout-order shelves, so customers could preorder meals online and then they — or delivery people — could just come in and quickly grab that food off the shelf. Another example: Some fast-food restaurants doubled their drive-through lanes and assigned more workers to take drive-through orders.


The economists found that restaurants that were able to pivot to takeout and delivery service — where customer ""dwell time"" was greatly shortened — saw the biggest surges in productivity.


And, mind you, takeout and delivery, by definition, mean that customers aren't sitting and eating in the restaurant, and this potentially also means that restaurant workers had to spend less time cleaning up tables, floors and bathrooms. And for especially popular restaurants, a higher number of customers willing to eat off premises also helped remove the constraints of limited physical space within their buildings, allowing them to serve a larger consumer base.


Plus, many businesses struggled to recruit workers in a tight labor market during this period, and this perhaps gave extra incentive to businesses to figure out more productive ways to deploy technology and workers. ""Necessity is the mother of invention, as they say,"" Syverson says. 








Econ 101 suggests that when workers get more productive and thus create more value, employers will pay them more.


However, decades of research, including by Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, suggests that this is not an automatic process. Sometimes workers may need to organize, strike or elect politicians who pass policies like a higher minimum wage to compel employers to share the fruits of higher productivity with their workers.


""We know wages in the restaurant industry overall saw pretty fast growth — well above average — coming out of the pandemic,"" Syverson says. ""So the aggregate patterns line up. We don't have restaurant-level wage data, so I can't say for sure if the wage-productivity relationship holds across restaurants. But my speculations are built on the long-run pattern (seen in many, many markets) that wages and productivity tend to move together. I certainly wouldn't think of this productivity surge as bad news for restaurant workers.""


OK, so that's restaurant workers. Maybe good news. What about consumers?


Research from Acemoglu and another collaborator, Pascual Restrepo, suggests that sometimes companies use machines to essentially off-load work to customers themselves. So, for example, self-checkout kiosks at grocery stores mean that customers, instead of paid workers, scan their groceries. That may help stores' bottom line, but it also may sometimes be a pain in the butt for customers. Acemoglu and Restrepo call these ""so-so technologies"" because they kill jobs without necessarily boosting productivity much or making the consumer experience better.


Likewise, restaurants' adoption of QR codes and other self-ordering technologies may be faster and cheaper from a company perspective, but sometimes they can be annoying from a consumer perspective, especially if you really do want to sit down and be taken care of. Instead of having a paid employee take your order, you have to open your smartphone and potentially download an app, type in your credit card number, billing address and email, and then make the order yourself without getting to pick the brain of a paid employee about the menu. In fast-food settings, that may matter less. In fact, self-ordering may be more convenient, especially after you preload your apps with your payment information. But in sit-down and fancier food settings, the humanless process of ordering food can sometimes be irksome and even more time-consuming for customers.


Syverson says he believes the majority of sit-down restaurants have figured out that most customers dislike QR codes and other annoying ordering methods adopted during the pandemic.


""I think the QR codes in particular are a nice example of something that might have in principle created efficiencies (and maybe did a little), but not in a way enough customers appreciated,"" Syverson says. ""As a result, it's my impression they've been largely rolled back, especially at full-service restaurants.""


But many of the other changes that fast-food and other restaurants adopted during the pandemic are still with us. Think smartphone app ordering, quick-pickup takeout shelves, more delivery options and expanded drive-through lanes.


Syverson says the higher productivity that these new technologies and business processes have produced is generally good news for consumers. When businesses can make and sell more in less time, the cost of whatever they're making generally goes down. Our recent bout with inflation may mask those benefits. But the bulk of the evidence, Syverson says, shows that productivity gains are often passed on to consumers through lower prices.


For this reason and more, economists generally love productivity growth. They view it like this magic sauce that gets poured over the economy, allowing us all to get more out of less.


""Productivity growth is super important,"" Syverson says. ""It's the only way we get sustained increases in our economic well-being, and it's associated with good stuff for business, workers, customers and entire economies.""


And there may be reason to hope that fast-food restaurants will see another wave of productivity growth in the coming years. Many are experimenting with using AI and robots to speed up ordering, food preparation and other facets of their business to enhance productivity. Fast food could get even faster.

Prime Minister Mark Carney says United States President Donald Trump will have to stop his ""disrespectful"" comments about Canada before the two countries can have comprehensive bilateral conversations about trade and security.

""We've called out those comments. They're disrespectful, they're not helpful, and they need to stop,"" Carney said in response to a question regarding Trump's repeated remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state. 

""They will have to stop before we sit down and have a conversation about our broader partnership with the United States.""

The prime minister made the remarks in London, on the second part of a one-day trip to France and the U.K., which took place just days after he took office. Carney has used the trip to push for closer trade and security ties with Europe.




His European visit comes as Trump has instigated a trade war between the two countries, after pledging to use ""economic force"" to annex Canada.

Carney told reporters Canada wants to have a ""more comprehensive discussion"" with the Trump administration about the overall commercial and security relationship.

""When the United States is ready to have that conversation, we're more than ready to sit down,"" he said.

During a press conference in London, Carney was asked why Canada's allies haven't forcefully criticized Trump's comments about annexing Canada.

""I don't think one needs to respond to every comment about another country,"" Carney responded. ""Canada is strong, we can stand up for ourselves.""

Carney began the day in Paris where he had a private meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, before flying to London where he met first with King Charles and then Prime Minister Keir Starmer.




Carney said Monday that ""we have a steadfast defender in our sovereign.""

Carney and Macron discussed a new bilateral partnership on intelligence and security, focused on enhancing cybersecurity and sharing intelligence on ""significant threats,"" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement about the conversation.

""Key topics will include economic security, violent extremism, counter-proliferation, interference, espionage, sabotage, and threats associated with advanced technologies.""

Carney's European visit comes amid a shakeup in global security and intelligence as Trump has increasingly cozied up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, prompting concerns among some allies whether critical intelligence will end up in Putin's hands.

The PMO said Carney and Macron also discussed strengthening economic ties, including on artificial intelligence, critical minerals and clean energy, as well as their intention to ""defend rules-based trade.""




Making opening remarks in Paris before the meeting with Macron, Carney stressed both countries' shared values of sovereignty, solidarity and sustainability, and said Canada is the most ""European"" country outside of Europe.

He said France and Canada have been reliable partners for centuries, and are now committed to ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine.

Macron, who invited Carney to visit before Carney was even sworn in, called Canada a ""unique friend"" with a shared vision of freedom. He also underscored a deep strategic partnership for trade, defence, protecting the environment and creating new technologies.

""We believe that fair trade that respects international rules is a good thing for everyone's prosperity and it is far more effective than tariffs, that simply create inflation and destroy the integration of our economies and our supply chain,"" he said.




Diversifying trade away from the U.S. is becoming a more critical manoeuvre for Canada and Europe is a potentially huge customer.

France has notably not yet ratified CETA, Canada's free trade deal with the European Union, and Canada's talks with the U.K. about an independent free trade deal remain on ice.

On Friday, Carney ordered a review of Canada's F-35 fighter jet purchase from U.S.'s Lockheed Martin. He said Monday that given the ""geopolitical environment"" and other factors, it's prudent for Canada to review its options. 

Carney said Europe is increasing and consolidating its defence spending.

""That is of interest to us...because it's a potential alternative supplier that creates the potential to create supply chains that mean that Canadian companies are participating in the development of these defence systems.""




Carney said Canada is ""actively exploring"" this and that he discussed the subject during his visits to France and the U.K.

""Diversification of our suppliers in a way that ensures that as much as possible of that production resides in Canada and benefits Canadians in multiple ways is a prudent thing to do,"" Carney said.

Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer, which Canada is hosting.

The prime minister, however, has not yet spoken to Trump since succeeding Justin Trudeau as prime minister several days ago. A call with the U.S. president is unlikely until Carney returns to Ottawa.

Carney said in London there is a limit to the tariffs Canada should levy against the United States, given the size of the two countries' economies. 




He said the tariffs Canada has currently proposed have maximum effect on the United States and ""limited but not zero"" impact on Canada.

 ""There is a limit to matching these tariffs dollar-for-dollar, given the fact that our economy is a 10th the size of the United States,"" Carney said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has struck a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's biggest-ever acquisition at the same time it's facing a potential breakup of its internet empire. 

The proposed takeover announced Tuesday is part of Google's aggressive expansion into cloud computing during an artificial intelligence boom. The frenzy is driving demand for data centers that provide the computing power for AI technology and intensifying the competition in that space among Google and two other tech powerhouses, Microsoft and Amazon. 

If the all-cash transaction is approved by regulators, Wiz will join Google Cloud — an increasingly important part of its business separate from the search and advertising operations that account for most of the $350 billion annual revenue at Google's parent company, Alphabet. 

With the advent of AI, however, the cloud division has become a rising star at Google. Annual revenue in the division was $26.3 billion in 2022, and soared 64% to $43.2 billion last year. 

Wiz, a five-year-old startup founded by four longtime friends who met in the Israeli army when they were still teenagers, is on track for an estimated $1 billion in revenue this year. After getting its start in Israel in 2020, Wiz now oversees an operation that makes security tools protecting the information stored in data centers from its current headquarters in New York.

“Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,” Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote in a blog post.




In a Tuesday conference call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted Cloud division's addition of Wiz will result in even better security at a lower cost than can be provided now. That prediction may have been aimed as much at regulators likely to scrutinize how the deal will affect competition and pricing, as much as at prospective customers. 

Google had been courting Wiz for some time before finally settling on a price that's much richer than a reported $23 billion bid that was rejected last July. At that time, Wiz signaled it would instead pivot back to a previously-planned initial public offering. But recent volatility in the stock market has chilled the IPO market, and now Rappaport said Wiz expects to “innovate even faster” by becoming a part of Google.

Wedbush analysts called Google's move to buy Wiz “a shot across the bow” at other tech giants, particularly Microsoft and Amazon, who have already made big bets on cyber security as the fight to dominate cloud computing intensifies. Google had fallen behind its competition in the cloud space, Wedbush said, but the acquisition of Wiz could alter the parameters. 

The bid Tuesday easily eclipses the current largest acquisition in Google's 26-year history — a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012 that didn't pay off the way that the Mountain View, California, company had hoped. The $32 billion purchase of Wiz would also go down at the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition and rank among the 20 most expensive takeovers of a software company in history, according to Mergermarket, a financial intelligence service.

As often happens with high-priced acquisitions, investors reacted coolly to Tuesday's news as Alphabet's shares fell 3% during afternoon trading.

Some of Google's other acquisitions have turned into gold mines, most notably its $1.76 billion purchase of online video pioneer YouTube in 2006 and its $3.1 billion takeover of advertising technology platform DoubleClick in 2008. A $5.4 billion purchase of another security firm, Mandiant, in 2022 also helped fuel the recent growth of Google's Cloud division, which posted an operating profit of $6.1 billion last year.

Google's DoubleClick deal is now part of an antitrust case filed by the U.S. Justice Department targeting Google's technology for distributing ads across the internet. A ruling in that case, involving allegations that Google illegally abused its power to manipulate digital ad prices, is expected this year.

Regulators in the U.S. and abroad are targeting Google on other fronts, too.

Last year, a federal judge in another case brought by the Justice Department last year concluded Google had turned its ubiquitous search engine into an illegal monopoly. The penalization phase of that trial begins next month.

The Justice Department is seeking a rebuke that would include a requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser and would ban the company from making agreements with Apple and other companies to make its search engine the default tool for finding online information on the iPhone and other devices.

The Wiz deal will also get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to be more friendly to business deals, it has also shown itself to be leery of big tech. 

The Wiz deal raises antitrust concerns due to the potential impact on standalone cyber security vendors, as well as potential disruption for bigger rivals. Still, Wedbush's analysts note the industry is “ripe for consolidation” — which could pose “massive growth opportunities on the horizon heading into this AI Revolution.”

Antitrust worries were also believed among the reasons Wiz called off sales talks with Google last year while President Joe Biden's administration was seeking to block a variety of tech deals. Agreeing to a sale now indicates both Google and Wiz are more confident the deal will gain U.S. approval under the Trump administration, Mergermarket analysts Kevin Ketcham and Kevin McCaffrey wrote in a Tuesday note.

“The two sides likely wouldn't have struck the deal if they didn't at least see a potential path to closing,” Ketcham and McCaffrey wrote.

If they get the regulatory greenlight and meet several conditions spelled out in their agreement, Google and Wiz expect the deal to close in 2026.

Grantham-Philips reported from New York.

The SpaceX capsule carrying astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams undocked from the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. ET Tuesday, beginning the pair's long-awaiting trip to Earth. (SpaceX)

Stranded NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams successfully undocked from the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. Tuesday and began their long-awaited journey back home after more than nine months in space.

Wilmore and Williams are returning home in a SpaceX capsule with fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Alexander Gorbunov. They are expected to splashdown off the Florida coast at 5:57 p.m. on Tuesday.

Hours before their departure from the ISS, President Donald Trump said he had been in contact with NASA's acting administrator, Janet Petro, who is coordinating the mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back home.

""She is coordinating our Team of highly respected Scientists, Space Engineers, and various other ‘geniuses,' who has agreed to let our Astronauts come home long prior to the two week period originally approved by NASA,"" Trump wrote, in part. ""Janet was great. She said, ‘Let's bring them home NOW, Sir!' — And I thanked her.""

The president also took a swipe at his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and accused him of ""forgetting"" about Wilmore and Williams. Trump also spoke about Elon Musk and SpaceX's involvement in the return mission.

""This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so,"" Trump claimed. ""They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents.""

""Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home — Taking off tomorrow, and landing on Wednesday,"" he continued.

Trump also added that officials will release more information about the astronauts' return in the coming days. 

""Safety always comes first, and maximum standards are being adhered to. But after eight long months for a mission that was supposed to be eight days, IT IS TIME,"" he concluded. ""I look forward to seeing Butch and Suni, and thank you again to NASA and Janet Petro!""

President Donald Trump thanked acting NASA administrator Janet Petro for coordinating the mission to bring stranded NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back home.

Williams and Wilmore had been stranded on the ISS since June of last year. 

Originally planning to only be in space for a week, they patiently waited for a return to Earth after issues forced NASA to bring the Boeing Starliner back empty last summer.

            The leaders of several US-funded international networks have instructed their organizations to continue broadcasting, ignoring a Trump administration order, because they believe last weekend's terminations were unlawful, according to a person involved in the matter.
    


            The entities – including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks – are continuing to operate around the world while network executives contemplate next steps, including potential legal action.
    


            Lisa Curtis, who chairs the board of Radio Free Europe, wrote on LinkedIn that “our pro bono legal team is prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that RFE/RL continues its Congressionally authorized mission.”
    


            The source who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity did not say if or when a formal legal challenge will happen.
    


            In the meantime, the broadcasters are reporting on the uncertainty over their future.
    


            The top story on the English-language edition of Radio Free Asia's website Tuesday morning noted that “Asian dissidents” and activists were voicing “dismay” over the funding freeze.
    


            President Trump signed an executive order on Friday night calling for the dismantling of the US Agency for Global Media and several other federal agencies. The next morning, journalists at the Voice of America were told to stop working immediately, and employees were placed on administrative leave. Some were officially laid off on Sunday while others remain in a holding pattern.
    


            Voice of America's website is now frozen in time, with old articles like “forecasters warn of tornadoes in US in coming days” still on the home page, even though the stories from Saturday are now out of date.
    


            VOA employees work directly for the federal government, which is why Trump loyalist Kari Lake – recently named a senior adviser to the agency – was able to take such dramatic action.
    


            But most of the agency's other networks are structured as nonprofit organizations that are funded through federal grants, and that distance is making a big difference right now.
    


            Lake sent memos to the networks on Saturday telling them that their grants were terminated, effective immediately, and suggesting that any unused funds must be refunded.
    


            For the journalists who work at the networks, and believe in the mission of providing uncensored news coverage to censored parts of the world, the precipitous termination was a gut punch.
    


            But leaders of the networks said reporting and programming would continue for the time being.
    


            As Radio Free Asia noted in one of its stories, “staff at RFA were still working Monday and the Washington-based news organization has yet to announce how the funding freeze would impact operations.”
    


            Executives are trying to preserve what little money is left, the person involved in the matter told CNN, while coming up with a careful response to Lake's memo.
    


            One outstanding question is whether Lake had the authority to order the funding freeze. The memos identified her as “senior advisor to the acting CEO with authorities delegated by acting CEO.”
    


            Another question has to do with the separation of powers. Radio Free Europe's story about the dispute on Monday repeatedly referred to its “Congress-approved funding.” Curtis wrote on LinkedIn that the termination violates the statute that governs Radio Free Europe and “violates Congressional appropriations laws.”
    


            Over the weekend the American Foreign Service Mission, which represents some VOA employees, said that “unilaterally stripping a congressionally established agency of its core functions amounts to an affront to the constitutional balance of powers.”
    


            A USAGM spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            In Washington on Monday State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the rapid dismantling of the agency “a fluid situation.”
    


            People with knowledge of the situation in both Europe and Asia expressed concern that some journalists could be left in harms' way due to the funding freeze.
    


            Specifically, there are Russian-born journalists living in exile in Europe and working for Radio Free Europe who face imprisonment if they return home.
    


            “If they lose their jobs, that could trigger visa expirations, leaving them essentially in legal limbo,” another source told CNN. “Without further support in the countries where they're currently located, they face the risk of being stateless, deportation – things like that are all possibilities.”
    


            “A lot of people who are citizens of authoritarian countries… are extremely worried, because this could leave them very vulnerable” and upend the “safe haven” they had been granted, the source added.
    


            Although European countries could create legal routes for the most vulnerable journalists, nothing has yet been agreed.
    


            A number of European lawmakers and diplomats have rallied around Radio Free Europe since Saturday, with some suggesting that Europe could provide some funding to fill the American void.
    


            In an interview on “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Russian-American journalist Alsu Kermasheva said Radio Free Europe provides audiences in Russia, Iran and other countries with crucial access to information.
    


            Without the networks, there will be an “empty space” in the global media, and “Russia and Chinese propaganda will fill in,” Kermasheva said.
    


            But for the moment, “we are still in business,” she added, encouraging financial and legal support for the embattled broadcaster.

Global aviation services corporation, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd (DAE), has announced it recently signed agreements with multiple counterparties to obtain 17 aircraft for approximately $1 billion.

The portfolio is comprised of 100% next-generation aircraft, of which 89% are narrowbody aircraft. 80% of the aircraft are manufactured by Airbus and 20% are manufactured by Boeing. The 17 aircraft are on lease to 11 airlines in 10 countries.

Once completed, the aircraft are expected to decrease DAE's weighted average passenger fleet age to 6.9 years while increasing its weighted average passenger fleet lease term remaining to 6.6 years. DAE's pro-forma fleet composition is predicted to be 46% Airbus aircraft, 49% Boeing aircraft, and 5% ATR 72-600.

Firoz Tarapore, chief executive officer of DAE, said of the new agreements: “Consistent with our commitment to improve the next generation content of our fleet and reduce the fleet average age, we are delighted to add these modern, fuel-efficient, next-generation technology assets to our portfolio. This transaction also allows us to further deepen our relationship with our global base of airline customers, and we welcome three airline customers back to DAE.

“Amid ongoing orderbook delivery delays, we are continuing to source attractive assets in the secondary market to meet our growth and portfolio management targets.”

DAE serves more than 170 airlines worldwide, from its seven headquarter locations in Dubai, Dublin, Amman, Singapore, Seattle, Miami, and New York. The agreements to expand its fleet with new generation planes will help solidify it as a leader in aviation, as it aims to keep modernising its portfolio in anticipation of global trends and changes in the industry.

Long Island is scoring record tourism dollars, and the trend is expected to swing upward as the region attracts new visitors.
That's according to Discover Long Island (DLI), which markets the region. At DLI's legislative breakfast at Melville-based Hilton Long Island, leaders touted upcoming high-profile events. They spotlighted their marketing campaigns and efforts to highlight small local businesses. And there was talk about rebranding SUNY (State University of New York), and getting into one of the major athletic conferences, helping to attract tourism dollars.
As Discover Long Island President and CEO Kristen Reynolds put it: “Tourism drives revenue, and it drives revenue for the residents.” 



Long Island tourism-spending hit $7.5 billion, according to Tourism Economics, bringing in $900 million in local and state tax revenue, as reported in October 2024. Visitors increased their spending by 12.7 percent year over year, and tourism generated 76,227 jobs.
Now, “2025 is already proving to be a monumental year, and there is so much on the horizon,” said Mitch Pally, who chairs DLI's Board of Directors.
A significant focus this year is the 2025 Ryder Cup, the golf tournament coming to the famed Bethpage Black. 



The event is expected to bring in 250,000 visitors to Long Island, and “at least $150 million in overall economic impact,” Pally said. “This scale of event is unprecedented to Long Island and yet DLI has been hard at work to make each visitor's experience in the region unforgettable.” DLI has launched a microsite, an app, a golf commercial and a marketing strategy all around the Ryder Cup.
In addition, “the 100th anniversary of F. Scott Fitzgerald's iconic novel, ‘The Great Gatsby,' is putting a well-deserved international spotlight on our historic Gold Coast region, as it was the author's home and inspiration for the novel's setting while he was creating the story,” Pally said.
Other upcoming high-profile events include the NHL All-Star Game, the U.S. Open at Shinnecock and the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution on Long Island.
“Each of these events will further solidify Long Island's reputation as a premier destination for visitors from around the world,” Pally said.
DLI's legislative breakfast focused mostly on Suffolk County, as the organization is no longer contracted by Nassau County, Pally said.
In 2024, Nassau retained Glen Head-based RRDA as its official tourism marketing organization. Since then, RRDA has promoted such events as the Cricket World Cup last summer, which garnered national and international attention. Now, RRDA is gearing up for the National BBQ Festival in Eisenhower Park, which features a $100,000 purse. The event is expected to draw more than 20,000 attendees, pitmasters, celebrity judges and more from the region and nationwide.
Pally said DLI's challenges – including “contractual and financing issues” – have “slowed down our marketing efforts.”
Still, he said the organization was “hopeful” that Suffolk County would “continue to include a much-needed convention center” in its new plans for Ronkonkoma. The county, he said, “continues to lose the ability to host many conventions and conferences because of the lack of facilities to host, and we all know that out-of-county visitors and convention-goers spend four times the amount of fund as our residents do, thus significantly increase in the tax revenues collected by the county.”
To that point, Reynolds said that with the Ryder Cup, 12,000 rooms are booked. But she said, “250,000 people are coming. Do you know where they are staying? They're in New York City, because we don't have hotels. We are losing all that revenue. But the Long Island Rail Road is going to do robust business.” Visitors, she said “are coming, but they're staying elsewhere and spending their money elsewhere.”
At the meeting, state Assemblyman Michael Fitzpatrick of Smithtown spoke of his talks with state officials about rebranding the state university system.
He talked of “dropping the old SUNY acronym,” which, he said, “is stale,” and changing it to the ‘University of New York,” or UNY – similar to UVA (University of Virginia) or UNC (University of North Carolina).
“We have a great state university, but we are not a national brand,” he said. In conversations with leaders in academia, business and labor as well as alumni, he is trying to grow support for “not just rebranding,” but “creating that national brand to attract the best students to Long Island.”
With a UNY rebrand, Fitzpatrick said, a goal could be set within 10 years “to establish the University of New York sports program as a major player and get it into one of the major athletic conferences.”
While that might require a new or expanded stadium, Fitzpatrick framed a revamped sports program as a “major revenue driver.” Think of the opportunity, he said, for “tourism and hospitality.”
New campaigns about the region included marketing at airports in Florida from which JetBlue is offering nonstop flights to Long Island MacArthur Airport, and at spring training stadiums where the New York Yankees and New York Mets play. DLI also had its first Super Bowl commercial this year.
To promote local organizations and individuals, DLI introduced six new videos to its You Belong series. The series features Adventureland,  Arbor View House Bed and Breakfast, Fire Island Ferries, artist John Melillo, Huntington Lighthouse and Little Ram Oysters.

The event is expected to bring in 250,000 visitors to Long Island, and “at least $150 million in overall economic impact,” Pally said. “This scale of event is unprecedented to Long Island and yet DLI has been hard at work to make each visitor's experience in the region unforgettable.” DLI has launched a microsite, an app, a golf commercial and a marketing strategy all around the Ryder Cup.
In addition, “the 100th anniversary of F. Scott Fitzgerald's iconic novel, ‘The Great Gatsby,' is putting a well-deserved international spotlight on our historic Gold Coast region, as it was the author's home and inspiration for the novel's setting while he was creating the story,” Pally said.
Other upcoming high-profile events include the NHL All-Star Game, the U.S. Open at Shinnecock and the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution on Long Island.
“Each of these events will further solidify Long Island's reputation as a premier destination for visitors from around the world,” Pally said.
DLI's legislative breakfast focused mostly on Suffolk County, as the organization is no longer contracted by Nassau County, Pally said.
In 2024, Nassau retained Glen Head-based RRDA as its official tourism marketing organization. Since then, RRDA has promoted such events as the Cricket World Cup last summer, which garnered national and international attention. Now, RRDA is gearing up for the National BBQ Festival in Eisenhower Park, which features a $100,000 purse. The event is expected to draw more than 20,000 attendees, pitmasters, celebrity judges and more from the region and nationwide.
Pally said DLI's challenges – including “contractual and financing issues” – have “slowed down our marketing efforts.”
Still, he said the organization was “hopeful” that Suffolk County would “continue to include a much-needed convention center” in its new plans for Ronkonkoma. The county, he said, “continues to lose the ability to host many conventions and conferences because of the lack of facilities to host, and we all know that out-of-county visitors and convention-goers spend four times the amount of fund as our residents do, thus significantly increase in the tax revenues collected by the county.”
To that point, Reynolds said that with the Ryder Cup, 12,000 rooms are booked. But she said, “250,000 people are coming. Do you know where they are staying? They're in New York City, because we don't have hotels. We are losing all that revenue. But the Long Island Rail Road is going to do robust business.” Visitors, she said “are coming, but they're staying elsewhere and spending their money elsewhere.”
At the meeting, state Assemblyman Michael Fitzpatrick of Smithtown spoke of his talks with state officials about rebranding the state university system.
He talked of “dropping the old SUNY acronym,” which, he said, “is stale,” and changing it to the ‘University of New York,” or UNY – similar to UVA (University of Virginia) or UNC (University of North Carolina).
“We have a great state university, but we are not a national brand,” he said. In conversations with leaders in academia, business and labor as well as alumni, he is trying to grow support for “not just rebranding,” but “creating that national brand to attract the best students to Long Island.”
With a UNY rebrand, Fitzpatrick said, a goal could be set within 10 years “to establish the University of New York sports program as a major player and get it into one of the major athletic conferences.”
While that might require a new or expanded stadium, Fitzpatrick framed a revamped sports program as a “major revenue driver.” Think of the opportunity, he said, for “tourism and hospitality.”
New campaigns about the region included marketing at airports in Florida from which JetBlue is offering nonstop flights to Long Island MacArthur Airport, and at spring training stadiums where the New York Yankees and New York Mets play. DLI also had its first Super Bowl commercial this year.

While that might require a new or expanded stadium, Fitzpatrick framed a revamped sports program as a “major revenue driver.” Think of the opportunity, he said, for “tourism and hospitality.”
New campaigns about the region included marketing at airports in Florida from which JetBlue is offering nonstop flights to Long Island MacArthur Airport, and at spring training stadiums where the New York Yankees and New York Mets play. DLI also had its first Super Bowl commercial this year.
To promote local organizations and individuals, DLI introduced six new videos to its You Belong series. The series features Adventureland,  Arbor View House Bed and Breakfast, Fire Island Ferries, artist John Melillo, Huntington Lighthouse and Little Ram Oysters.

Founder Jeremy Zimmer steps back as CEO at age 66, prompting a look at cross-town rivals run by fellow boomers.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	On March 17, Jeremy Zimmer, the co-founder and CEO of UTA, informed staff at the agency that he would be stepping aside.


	In a choreographed succession maneuver, 66-year-old Zimmer named the 56-year-old David Kramer (who he had elevated to president of UTA just a couple years prior) his successor at the agency. Zimmer told staff that he would stick around for the year as executive chairman, and remain on the UTA board.




	“Let's be honest, the chances that I'm going to start an aluminum company in Alaska or a cement company in Cleveland are pretty slim. So this is not goodbye,” he quipped in his note to staff.

	Zimmer's exit and Kramer's ascension, however, comes at an intriguing moment for talent agencies, which are seeking to adapt to the new world of media just as much as Hollywood writ large.

	UTA's changing of the guard also sent tongues wagging across the industry. After all, when the current iterations of the agencies were founded in the 1990s, they were led by young guns (Kim Masters branded the CAA crew the “Young Turks”), 20 and 30-something agents who had their finger on the pulse of popular culture.


	Thirty years later and those young guns are largely still in charge.


	CAA's CEO Bryan Lourd is just a couple years younger than Zimmer, and has been at the top of the agency since 1995. Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel is just a year younger than Lourd, and has also led his company since 1995.


	To be certain, WME promoted Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead to co-chairman of WME in 2022, the same year that Kramer was promoted, while Endeavor COO Mark Shapiro has been playing an active role in the running the businesses.


	CAA, meanwhile, elevated a number of partners to the managing director level last year, giving them more autonomy to work alongside Lourd, co-chairmen Kevin Huvane and Richard Lovett, and president Jim Burtson.


	But with the entertainment industry figuring out a future that is more multifaceted than its present, with sports, creator-driven content and music all melding with the traditional bulwarks of film and TV, the major agencies appear poised to try and adapt accordingly.


	During his nearly 13-year run as CEO, Zimmer led UTA on an M&A onslaught, with some 19 strategic acquisitions that brought UTA into the sports, music and creator economy businesses, while raising cash from the private equity firm EQT to help turbocharge that growth in the pursuit of “what's next.”

	











	Now Kramer is telling staff that he is likely to continue that push. “Together, we will make sure that we foster real collaboration across our platform so that we can leverage our ability to see what's next in culture to unlock greater opportunity for both our clients and the company as a whole,” he wrote March 17.


	UTA, like one of its chief competitors, Endeavor-owned WME, has been bulking up over the last decade. Endeavor, however, now finds itself slimming down, shedding itself of businesses that are not connected to the talent agency business.


	The company is expected to close on its take-private with Silver Lake in the coming weeks, with WME the grand prize. Along the way it has been selling many of the assets that it had acquired, including IMG, Professional Bull Riders, On Location and its sports data division. Other assets like a pair of pro tennis tournaments and Frieze are up for sale (it is keeping its majority stake in TKO Group, which will take on PBR, On Location and IMG).


	While UTA focused on acquiring mostly businesses that were in the talent agency space (or talent-adjacent, like the consulting firm MediaLink or a creator economy data firm), Endeavor sought to bulk up with prestigious owned properties, particularly with a sports focus.


	UTA, of course, also invested in sports, particularly via its partnership with Rich Paul's Klutch Sports Group


	And CAA, now a centerpiece of Artémis, the investment firm controlled by François-Henri Pinault, has been acquisitive itself, most notably with its $750 million mega-deal for ICM in 2022. It bought the executive search firm Hanold Associates last year, in a further push into talent-adjacent businesses.

	











	For a business that was built on being at the speartip of culture, Hollywood now finds itself increasingly chasing the culture, ceding ground to platforms like TikTok and Instagram that are forging microstars every day. Agencies have bet that they can take those microstars and turn them into major stars, just as they are taking pro athletes and making them into mega-brands.


	But it is likely that it will fall to the next generation of agency talent to figure out that path forward, even though the moguls aren't ceding the stage just yet.

AirExplore, a Slovakia-based contract carrier for other airlines, is disengaging from cargo flying because of limited demand for narrowbody freighters and will focus on its passenger business, FreightWaves has learned.

The news follows other recent examples of small or midsize airlines that provide supplemental capacity to network carriers discontinuing or downsizing cargo operations amid a glut of standard-size freighters and stagnant parcel volumes.

AirExplore, a subsidiary of Lithuanian-owned holding company Avia Solutions Group, earlier this month issued a vague statement about changing its approach to cargo operations to align with market conditions. The statement was buried in a news release about airlines securing additional airlift from third-party providers to keep up with travel demand.

The airline is reducing its cargo fleet by two or three aircraft, returning aircraft to lessors and subleasing some units to other carriers because of the slowdown in business, spokesperson Silvije Sileike said in an email message. It continues to seek long-term transportation service agreements for its remaining aircraft.






“We were presuming that the e-commerce and narrow-body freighter market would grow more significantly after Covid, but the situation in the market is not as we expected. Currently, we are optimizing our fleet and focusing on the passenger business,” she explained.

As recently as last month, AirExplore's operating fleet included eight Boeing 737-800 converted freighter aircraft. It added some cargo jets last year and in November earned U.S. approval to begin passenger and cargo operations in U.S. airspace under a conditional foreign carrier permit using large aircraft on charter from other providers. 

Aircraft tracking site Flightradar24 shows only two cargo jets currently in operation – one in Europe and one in Africa. The Planespotters.net database shows three aircraft are in parked status.

Sileike said AirExplore has leased one freighter aircraft to Allied Air Nigeria, which operates for DHL Express in Africa, and another to Ascend Airways Malaysia, a new carrier owned by Avia Solutions Group that expects to begin operations late this year. Air Ascend Malaysia, a business-to-business passenger and cargo airline, is waiting for Malaysian authorities to issue an air operators certificate. 






AirExplore's rethink about air cargo operations is not unique. Sister company SmartLynx Airlines is shelving its fleet of Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters after losing a contract with DHL Express in Europe and having difficulty finding other customers. It too is returning planes to lessors, placing some aircraft with affiliated companies and subleasing to other carriers.

Avia Solutions Group last year shut down Iceland-based Bluebird Nordic, which operated Boeing 737-400 and 737-800 converted freighters, because it couldn't generate enough business during and after the airfreight downturn that lasted until the second half of 2023. The airline, which provided crewed aircraft to DHL, FedEx, UPS and other airlines, returned its fleet to lessors.

Canadian passenger airline WestJet closed its freighter division, which utilized four 737-800s, after one year because it couldn't generate enough business providing scheduled cargo service.





Global Crossing Airlines in Miami last year capped its freighter fleet at four Airbus A321 freighters because of thin business but has recently seen a pickup in demand.

Miami-based Amerijet, which operates larger Boeing 767 converted freighters, cut its fleet in half over the past two years and currently runs about 11 aircraft.

				Practice Range & Teaching 

The PGA of America has signed a strategic partnership with Silk Path Golf & Country Club and Everygolf Vietnam, two leading golf facility operators in Vietnam. 

Silk Path Dong Trieu Golf & Country Club, a Faldo Signature Design located in the Dong Trieu City on the outskirts of Hanoi, opened in January. The 18-hole public facility will host the first PGA of America Golf Academy in Vietnam. The academy will promote Association player engagement programs specifically designed for beginner and junior development. 

The newly constructed academy building and adjoining practice areas will also accommodate local golf professionals wishing to utilize the facilities, introducing them to PGA of America education pathways.

Additionally, the PGA of America has partnered with Everygolf, a leading brand for indoor golf simulator studios in Vietnam, providing the latest golf technology for coaching and entertainment opportunities in city centers. Two current studio locations in Hanoi serve as the home base for six local teaching professionals that will be introduced to PGA of America Membership opportunities through a commitment from the newly formed partnership.



“We couldn't be more excited to partner with the golf facilities under the Silk Path and Everygolf brands,” said PGA of America's Director of Global Development Sean Thornberry. “Their leadership team's enthusiasm to partner with the PGA of America is a result of our shared mission to support the long term growth of our sport. 

‘This new alliance will be a catalyst for the implementation of player engagement programs in Vietnam and the opportunity for the Association to spearhead the development of our game in such a rapidly growing international golf market.”





Kenny Nguyen, CEO of Silk Path G&CC and President of Everygolf Vietnam, said: “'Be a better golfer everyday' has been our motto since day one when we started Everygolf. Our mission from the start has been to help grow the game in the right direction and we believe the partnership with the PGA of America, along with our new Faldo Signature Design golf course at Silk Path Dong Trieu, will help us to achieve that goal.”

The PGA of America now has branded golf facility partnerships in eight countries, including Mexico, Dominican Republic, Morocco, India, China, Hong Kong, Philippines and Vietnam.

Barnham Broom Hotel, Spa & Golf Club, a 36-hole golf and leisure resort based in Norfolk, has been sold back to its founder and current operator by Breckland Council. 

Carnoustie Golf Links has come under private control following the decision by Angus Council to hand over the running of the three golf courses to Carnoustie Golf Heritage and Hospitality Group Limited.

Husqvarna has launched a new range of autonomous robotic mowers designed for commercial use, including golf courses.

BNBuilders last week topped out a new two-story academic building at the Lakeside School campus at 14050 First Ave. N.E.

The new building is taking shape on what was formerly a softball field on the southwest corner of the private school's 20-acre campus.

LMN is the architect. The new academic facility will be approximately 39,000 square feet and will house 20 classrooms.

English classrooms will line the west side of the building, science classrooms will be in the eastern portion and small breakout rooms will be located toward the back. In the middle will be a mixing zone of office spaces for both the science and English departments. There will also be a cafe and several communal spaces. Communal spaces will comprise private rooms for small-group study sessions, as well as a spacious atrium more suited to large get-togethers. Many first-floor classrooms will have access to outdoor seating.

Students will enter Lakeside's new building via outdoor spaces designed for socializing and learning.

DALLAS — Southwest's iconic blue, red and yellow planes may still be recognizable in the sky after its recent moves — but underneath, the company will operate a lot more like its competition in the skies.

Only time will tell whether that's a good or bad thing.

On March 11, the Dallas-based carrier announced it would do away with its “bags fly free” policy. Alongside other hallmarks of the brand, two free checked bags helped Southwest craft a customer-friendly image for decades. Now that many of those policies are on the chopping block, the airline's offerings are more in line with other carriers.

It remains to be seen whether that will work to Southwest's benefit, but it shows how the company has been forced to juggle the demands of impatient investors, loyal customers and the stark realities of its bottom line.

“Time will tell how consumers view the brand, because it is no longer going to have a real differentiated product,” said Nick Ewen, managing editor at The Points Guy.

“So will it be able to maintain the differentiated feel, the je ne sais quoi, the intangible?”

Southwest is preparing a raft of changes that will be implemented in the near future:

Free bags limited to loyalty program members, Business Select, branded credit cardholders and select others;

Assigned seating;

Premium seating;

International partnership with Icelandair;

Flight credits that only last a year;

New “basic” nonrefundable fare that's ineligible for changes or flight credits;

Reduced loyalty points rates for certain fares; and

First “redeye” flights.

According to an internal memo from Southwest Vice President of Inflight Operations Steve Murtoff viewed by The Dallas Morning News, updated boarding procedures and retrofitted, larger overhead bins are also on the way (though not till 2026) to accommodate a jump in carry-on bags.

“It's undeniable Southwest Airlines is rapidly evolving,” Murtoff said in the memo. “We are in a fight for our future and must quickly adapt to drive our profitability and encourage customer loyalty.”

The scale of Southwest's transformation has been augmented by its speed. The first hint at what was to come came during the company's first-quarter earnings call in 2024.

At the time, CEO Bob Jordan implied the airline was reconsidering its open seating policy. The why wasn't clear then, but the picture has crystalized over time.

June brought the beginning of Southwest's public fight with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, who disclosed an 11% stake in the company in tandem with biting critiques for Southwest's management and finances.

By July, open seating was dead. As Elliott mounted even more pressure, Southwest tried to fight it off. But despite the airline's efforts, Elliott reached the ownership threshold to call meetings in early September.

By the end of the month, Southwest's board of directors was remade to Elliott's liking, and the airline unveiled a “transformational plan” that detailed many of the changes angering customers today.

Jordan has denied that the changes were forced by Elliott, arguing it was “because we owe all of our shareholders better financial performance.” But the investor's influence is hard to ignore.

In a simplified world, Southwest's new policies would boost revenue, while other measures like buyouts and its first-ever layoffs, would cut costs.

However, the industry isn't that simple. For an airline that has always stood out from the crowd — and gained a loyal following because of it — some think these moves risk Southwest losing what helped make it the largest airline by domestic passenger volume in the first place.

Ewen says the task for Southwest will be striking a balance between luring new customers, which could potentially improve financials, and keeping existing customers happy.

But that task has gotten harder.

Southwest joined third-party booking platforms for the first time last year, starting with Google Flights. Analytics from these platforms would eventually get cited by Jordan as a reason for axing “bags fly free” after defending it in September.

These platforms conveniently let customers compare flights, but they also pit airlines against one another. Since Southwest's fare bundled everything and some fares don't bundle anything, it made the company's prices look high by comparison, according to Morningstar Industrials Equity Analyst Nicolas Owens.

That has put Southwest in a pinch, Owens said, as all air carriers fight to increase market share. Surging labor costs have put upwards pressure on fares, while factors such as inflation have made certain customers more sensitive to price.

Other customers, though, have become even more willing to shell out for an elevated experience, increasing demand for premium options.

“Without these options to price discriminate, Southwest just had a blunt instrument trying to pick off these little customer segments,” Owens said. “One size fits all does not work in a more picky product market.”

And Southwest needed to pick up more customer segments. In 2018, Southwest led the industry with 20% of the domestic market. That's now down to 17%, and Delta and American have taken the lead.

Meanwhile, Southwest has remained profitable, but that pot of money has progressively shrunk over the past three years. The airline's stock price has dived nearly 50% since hitting a post-COVID recovery peak of nearly $62 in April 2021.

“I think it's ultimately necessary and probably not surprising in the long run that they would have made some of these changes,” Owens said.

Yet Marbue Brown, author of Blueprint For Customer Obsession, a book that used Southwest as a case study on customer experience, thinks Southwest getting rid of its cherished perks may actually exacerbate financial issues.

“This transformation is going in the wrong direction. That's just my straight-up take,” he said. “I'm just concerned that Southwest is losing its anchor, and once they do, they're also going to lose customers and lose market share.”

The Ship of Theseus thought experiment asks whether an object is the same object if all of the components have been replaced over time. So is Southwest still Southwest if all its distinctive features have been replaced?

In a presentation with J.P. Morgan Chase this past week, Jordan argued the airline is “more than a policy. We're more than the way we paint our aircraft.”

“Southwest is all about very tangible things,” he said, referencing things like its point-to-point network. “But we're also about the intangibles, the best people in the business, the best hospitality in the business. And none of that is going to change.”

Morningstar's Owens largely agreed, and dismissed concerns that policy changes would affect Southwest's unique vibe.

“I think that the idea that Southwest culture somehow permanently goes away ... is overstated,” he said. “I think they still have probably the funnest flight attendants and kind of team spirit that you don't see everywhere.”

The analyst said Southwest did a lot of legwork to rebuild trust after its 2022 holiday meltdown, simply by getting passengers from Point A to Point B more efficiently. Part of that credit belongs to having good workers.

“They definitely pick people of a certain personality to deliver a certain kind of experience. And to that extent, they will probably still have some uniqueness to them,” said Brown.

“But if the policies are not supportive of the people, if the whole fly-feel doesn't work together, you're not going to get Herb Kelleher's Southwest Airlines,” he said.

While each change can, in a vacuum, improve financials, and Southwest can do its best to keep that quirky culture, airlines are a complicated web of real people and logistics.

Brown pointed out that baggage fees means more carry-ons, which means less available overhead space and more gate-checked bags. That makes boarding more stressful and potentially frustrating.

The best flight attendants can't make more overhead space appear or make oversized backpacks fit in the bag sizer. Over time, that unique vibe begins to fade.

“As they make this tweak here, and they make this tweak there, there are dominoes that are falling,” Brown said.

“As these dominoes fall, I think what you will wind up seeing is that, the more they look like other companies, then some of the other companies that do well from a customer experience perspective might surface as legit competitors to them.”

				Corporate 

Carnoustie Golf Links in Scotland, which has been under public ownership since 1890, has come under private control following a landmark decision by Angus Council to hand over the running of the three golf courses to Carnoustie Golf Heritage and Hospitality Group Limited (CGHH). 

Under the terms of a reported £5 million deal, Carnoustie Golf Links Management Committee (CGLMC), a charitable company that has managed the courses for years, has sold its intellectual property rights, including the ‘Carnoustie Golf Links' trademark, to CGHH, with all its assets and staff transferring to the private firm.

Carnoustie Golf Heritage and Hospitality Group Limited is listed in Companies House as having been incorporated in 2021 and currently has two named directors – Johann Herberstein and Paul Lisiak. 

According to a report published in The Scotsman newspaper, Angus Council reached the decision to hand the management of the golf links to CGHH as it no longer had the funds required to effectively run them. The article states that a short-term lease deal – until 2033 – has been agreed between Angus Council and CGHH, and talks on a longer-term deal, which could see the firm running the venue until 2123, are at an advanced stage. 

The long-awaited agreement is expected to unlock huge external investment as part of the Carnoustie masterplan. Carnoustie Golf Hotel, which was bought by CGHH in 2023, has recently reopened an upgraded spa, pool and gym as part of a £3 million investment in the venue, which is now under the same corporate umbrella as the golf courses.

Speaking to The Courier, Carnoustie Golf Links chief executive Michael Wells said the substantial investment was a “sign of things to come” as the new owners have pledged to invest further funds in upgrading the hotel facilities in a bid to attract The Open back to Angus.Mr Wells said: “A single entity has the golf and hotel business operating as one. It creates the environment for us to consider what's the best experience for our season ticket holders and guests from around the world. We are trying to improve the experience for everybody. The transaction means circa £5m was given to Carnoustie Golf Links Management Committee to continue its charitable aims. We hope this creates the ability for significant change in the town.”

He said: “We're keen to understand precisely what we need to do to meet market demand and The R&A's requirements as we seek to get The Open back as soon as possible. Our preferred outcome would be to get a multi-event deal from The R&A. I'm still hopeful that The Open could return this decade. But the most important thing is to get a sustainable model. There's no point doing something elaborate if it doesn't make financial sense.”

Carnoustie Golf Links has hosted The Open Championship eight times, most recently in 2018, when Stewart Cink lifted the Claret Jug. The Open is going to Royal Birkdale in 2026 and St Andrews in 2027, so the next earliest potential return to Carnoustie would be 2028. 

The PGA of America has signed a strategic partnership with Silk Path Golf Course and Everygolf Vietnam, two leading golf facility operators in Vietnam. 

Barnham Broom Hotel, Spa & Golf Club, a 36-hole golf and leisure resort based in Norfolk, has been sold back to its founder and current operator by Breckland Council. 

Husqvarna has launched a new range of autonomous robotic mowers designed for commercial use, including golf courses.

				People & Jobs 

The European Tour Group, which administers the DP World Tour, HotelPlanner Tour, Legends Tour, G4D Tour and the Ryder Cup in Europe, has announced the appointment of Grégory Havret to its Board of Directors. 

A three-time winner on the DP World Tour, the 48-year-old Frenchman made a total of 560 appearances on Europe's top tier tour after turning professional in 1999, winning the 2001 Atlanet Italian Open, the 2007 Barclays Scottish Open and the 2008 Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles. His best major finish was runner-up at the 2010 US Open at Pebble Beach. 

His most recent tournament was last October's FedEx Open de France when he made his farewell DP World Tour appearance in his national Open at Le Golf National in Paris. He was also part of European captain Thomas Bjorn's backroom team for the 2018 Ryder Cup at the same venue.

Havret retired from playing last year to take up a role with the French Golf Federation, with the aim of helping to develop future golfing talent in his home country. 

Havret said: “I am very proud and very happy to be able to continue my journey with the DP World Tour and the European Tour Group, which I consider like a second family. This Tour, and golf more broadly, have given me a lot: fulfilment, support and balance over those 25 rich years. 

“I can only thank the Board for offering me such an opportunity. I now have the chance to give back to this sport some of what it has given me, and I am really looking forward to starting at my first meeting on Monday.”

Eric Nicoli, Chairman of the European Tour Group, said: “I'm delighted to welcome Grégory to our Board of Directors. Having competed globally on the DP World Tour for more than 25 years, Grégory combines considerable knowledge and experience of our Tour, along with a passion for what makes it so unique and special. He is hugely respected by our players, our staff and our stakeholders and he will be another excellent addition to our Board.”

Havret joins Thomas Bjørn, Paul Eales, Chris Hanell, David Howell, Robert Lee and Ove Sellberg as Tournament Committee Directors, with Chairman Eric Nicoli, Abdulla Al Naboodah, Penny Avis, Martha Brass, Martin Gilbert, Jay Monahan serving as Non-Executive Directors. 

The PGA of America has signed a strategic partnership with Silk Path Golf Course and Everygolf Vietnam, two leading golf facility operators in Vietnam.

The inaugural 'National Geographic 33' list includes the likes of Don Cheadle, Selena Gomez, Sterlin Harjo, Michelle Yeoh and Jason Momoa.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	When the National Geographic Society published the first issue of its namesake magazine in September of 1888, it was, in the words of the publication, “a very staid affair.” There were no photos (those didn't arrive until 1905), and the articles were more akin to what you might find in a scientific journal than a popular magazine.


	Suffice it to say National Geographic evolved over the years, eventually leaning into photography and exploration, bringing the natural and human world to its readers every week during the heyday of magazines, and then every day amid the digital revolution.

	Now, National Geographic is embarking on what it is calling one of its most ambitious efforts yet: A new multi-platform list to highlight and celebrate 33 individuals (in honor of the 33 founders of the Society) “whose imaginative ideas and unstoppable drive are making the world a better place.” The inaugural National Geographic 33 will be featured in the April issue of the magazine, an interactive digital platform, and in a social video series.

	The inaugural list includes familiar faces to Hollywood, including actors Don Cheadle, Jason Momoa, Michelle Yeoh, Edward Norton, Selena Gomez, musicians Bjork and Arlo Parks, and writer-producers like Adam McKay and Sterlin Harjo, as well as some names that may be less familiar, like climate activist Jennifer Uchendu, endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh, and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard.


	You can see the full list of honorees, as well as video and multimedia content, here.


	“For more than 137 years, National Geographic has been driven by the belief that bold thinking and collective action can change the world. This principle is what inspired National Geographic's 33 founder —committed explorers, scientists and scholars—all those years ago,” said Courteney Monroe, president of National Geographic content, in a statement. “Since then and across all our platforms, National Geographic has believed in the power of visual storytelling to spark curiosity and inspire a deeper connection to our world. The inaugural National Geographic 33 represents an exciting milestone for us, as it embodies the very essence of our brand—sharing the stories of extraordinary individuals whose work is making a meaningful impact in the hope of inspiring others to help shape a better future.”

	











	“With the National Geographic 33, we're honoring a diverse group of changemakers, from all over the world and different walks of life, who aren't just recognizing the urgent challenges of our time, they are taking action to address them,” adds Nathan Lump, senior VP and editor-in-chief of National Geographic. “They all share a deep commitment to shaping a better future, and in shining a light on them and their contributions, we hope to elevate their work and showcase to a wide audience the positive impact they're making.”


National Geographic is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Society, with Disney owning a controlling stake which acquired the brand in its deal with Fox. Disney has incorporated the Nat Geo brand in its TV and streaming services, with a particular focus on documentary series.


	It hired Lump in 2022, with a mandate to harmonize the goals of both Disney and the Society, and to try and bring the media brand into a future less forgiving for traditional magazines.


	It is a strategy that has had some success with other storied publications. Time magazine, after all, has turned its Person of the Year and Time 100 list as bona fide franchises, and has had success pushing into film and TV production. Now National Geographic is betting that it can do the same.


	You can see the launch video for the National Geographic 33, below.

The Trump administration could slap new tariffs on Vietnamese goods as a tool to rebalance trade between the US and the Southeast Asian Country, U.S.-Asean Business Council President and Chief Executive Officer Ted Osius said at a Hanoi briefing.

“We think that the risk of tariffs is real,” Osius said. “Vietnam has one of the highest trade surpluses with the United States globally.”

The US ran a $123.5 billion trade deficit with Vietnam in 2024, according to the Office of the USTR. The gap is drawing attention to the country as Trump's America First agenda relies on tariffs as part of a strategy to rectify what it sees as unfair trade policies.

Osius, who was US Ambassador to Vietnam from 2014 to 2017, said the country can mitigate tariffs by buying more US products, including liquefied natural gas.

“We are urging the Vietnamese government to buy US LNG, to buy aircraft from the United States — civilian and also military aircraft — to buy US agricultural products, such as soybeans and fruit and high-value-added tree nuts,” he said.

Vietnam, Osius said, needs to aggressively police transshipments. Such shipments occur when products from another country, such as China, pass through Vietnam en route to the US to sidestep tariffs.

Osius said Vietnam should work closely with US customs and border officials.

Las Vegas, USA: Adobe Inc has become the latest company to join the bandwagon to offer artificial intelligence services with its agentic AI platform as the technology firm diversifies beyond its core offering.


     
      Alongside selling on-cloud, AI-integrated tools to generate content for a business' marketing operations, California-headquartered Adobe's new software platform will look to capture a share of customer service automation, technical support and other aspects.


     
      Its ‘Agent Orchestrator' will allow companies to access Adobe's family of ‘Firefly' foundational AI models, as well as third-party models such as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 and Google's Gemini 2.0., the company said at its annual ‘Summit' in Las Vegas, Nevada on Tuesday.


     
      Adobe has started selling its agentic AI platform to enterprises, counting technology integrator IBM, India's flag carrier Air India in aviation, and the largest domestic private bank HDFC Bank Ltd as three key early customers for its agentic AI push. Two senior executives confirmed, requesting anonymity since they were not authorized spokespeople, that the company is already generating revenue from its AI push.

      “In the long run, we see AI agents through our ‘Experience Cloud' offering to be a key revenue generator for Adobe, alongside our existing Creative Cloud and Document Cloud services to businesses,"" Sundeep Parsa, vice-president of Adobe's ‘Digital Experience' business, told Mint at the sidelines of the Summit.


     
      ""We're using our internal models for any text or visual content generation, while for other tasks such as reasoning, responses and debugging, we're partnering with third-party foundational AI model providers such as OpenAI and Google,"" Parsa said.


     
      Businesses can use Adobe's platform to use their internal datasets, training AI models to integrate automation into customer service and digital marketing operations to start with. To sell the platform, Adobe is working with top technology outsourcing partners around the world, Parsa said, without naming any company.


     
      Adobe, which follows the December to November financial year cycle, reported its first-quarter earnings for this fiscal on 12 March. Its quarterly earnings of $5.71 billion beat the $5.66-billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. However, its earnings guidance of $5.77-5.82 billion for the second quarter didn't impress analysts, causing its shares to tumble.

      While the stock opened at $437.74 per share on Nasdaq in the US before its earnings were announced on 12 March, the shares ended the day 3.8% lower at $420.98 apiece. The following day, it further dropped 10%—but has since recovered by just over 5% to close at $399.34 on Monday.


     
      Analysts, however, are optimistic.


     
      “Adobe is a large enterprise service provider, offering marketing tools for digital content creation and customer experiences to very large companies around the world. The move to roll out a complex agentic AI operation had to happen for a company like Adobe—it's a must-have if it wants to capture a larger share of businesses,"" said Kashyap Kompella, AI analyst and founder of technology consultancy firm RPA2AI.


     
      Kompella said the company's ‘ethical AI' approach could further improve the company's chances of roping in businesses—which can help Adobe break out of its stagnant growth.


Also read | Fractal bets on agentic AI to drive revenue


     
      “It will be a gradual journey—aspects such as multi-agent integration on Adobe's new AI platform for businesses will need time to really work. From a revenue standpoint, the more complex AI integrations could take longer to impact the company's stock and financials. But in the near term, investing in agentic AI capability is compulsory if Adobe would want to retain its large clients,"" Kompella added.


     
      Last week, Prativa Mohapatra, managing director for India at Adobe, told Mint that the company similar approach for its regional markets as well.


     
      “We're still in the initial years of AI, let alone using AI to drastically ramp up sales or clamp down upon unauthorized usage of software to increase monetization potential. But AI is steadily making a difference, and we expect to see its reflection in Adobe India's growth potential in an equivalent way in the years to come,"" she said.


     
      Shantanu Narayen, Adobe's India-origin global chief executive, was yet to deliver his keynote until press time.

			11.29am 18th March 2025	 -
				Property 

Barnham Broom Hotel, Spa & Golf Club, a 36-hole golf and leisure resort based in Norfolk, has been sold back to its founder and current operator by Breckland Council. 

The district council bought the land and buildings at the Norwich-based venue for £7 million in 2006. It has now sold the 237-acre site back its founder, Colin Bothway, for £6.9 million.

The council has reported that the total income – sale and rent – from its 19-year ownership of the hotel and golf club was £11.68m. During this time, the council said made a further investment of £1.95m in the asset, resulting in an overall profit of £2.73m over that period.

Breckland Council leader, Sam Chapman-Allen, commented: “The figures show just what a good investment the golf club has been for this council and our residents. The steady stream of reliable income over nearly 20 years has played a big factor in helping Breckland maintain a good financial position compared to our peers and has enabled us to keep the pressure off local taxpayers as much as possible.

“The rent brought in by this and our other investments has played an important role in enabling us to go above and beyond in the services we provide. We're now further putting the money from the capital sale to very good use by investing into temporary accommodation which will bolster this important resource and ensure that everybody in Breckland has a safe place to call home.”





Colin Bothway, the original founder and owner of Barnham Broom Hotel and Golf Club, commented: “I'd like to thank the council for being steadfast in its commitment to maintain our landlord and tenant relationship over a long period. I'm delighted that we have now bought back the freehold and can recombine this with our operating business. 

“The purchase strengthens our position to consider how we might evolve and grow further in the future for the benefit of our local communities, our golf and health club members, visitors and hotel guests, as well as our loyal staff and hard-working employees.” 

Barnham Broom, which first opened in, offers two 18-hole courses, The Hill and The Valley, and a 52-bedroom hotel. Other facilities include a gym, indoor swimming pool, sauna, and a spa.

The PGA of America has signed a strategic partnership with Silk Path Golf Course and Everygolf Vietnam, two leading golf facility operators in Vietnam. 

Carnoustie Golf Links has come under private control following the decision by Angus Council to hand over the running of the three golf courses to Carnoustie Golf Heritage and Hospitality Group Limited.

Husqvarna has launched a new range of autonomous robotic mowers designed for commercial use, including golf courses.

NASA will conduct a live flight test of aircraft performing simulated wildland fire response operations using a newly developed airspace management system at 9 a.m. PDT on Tuesday, March 25, in Salinas, California.

NASA's new portable airspace management system, part of the agency's Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) project, aims to significantly expand the window of time crews have to respond to wildland fires. The system provides the air traffic awareness needed to safely send aircraft – including drones and remotely piloted helicopters – into wildland fire operations, even during low-visibility conditions. Current aerial firefighting operations are limited to times when pilots have clear visibility, which lowers the risk of flying into the surrounding terrain or colliding with other aircraft. This restriction grounds most aircraft at night and during periods of heavy smoke.

During this inaugural flight test, researchers will use the airspace management system to coordinate the flight operations of two small drones, an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, and a remotely piloted aircraft that will have a backup pilot aboard. The drones and aircraft will execute examples of critical tasks for wildland fire management, including weather data sharing, simulated aerial ignition flights, and communications relay.

Media interested in viewing the ACERO flight testing must RSVP by 4 p.m. Friday, March 21, to the NASA Ames Office of Communications by email at: arc-dl-newsroom@mail.nasa.gov or by phone at 650-604-4789. NASA will release additional details, including address and arrival logistics, to media credentialed for the event. A copy of NASA's media accreditation policy is online.

NASA's ACERO researchers will use data from the flight test to refine the airspace management system. The project aims to eventually provide this technology to wildland fire crews for use in the field, helping to save lives and property. This project is managed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley.

A large Google logo is seen at Google's Bay View campus in Mountain View, California. Google announced a $32 billion deal on March 18 to buy rapidly growing cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion. It will be the tech giant's biggest-ever acquisition.

(CNN) — Google announced a deal Tuesday to buy rapidly growing cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion. It would be the tech giant's biggest-ever acquisition.

The all-cash takeover of privately held Wiz represents a big bet by Google on cloud security and cybersecurity in this period of explosive growth for artificial intelligence.

The Wiz deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, easily surpasses Google's previously biggest takeover: An ill-fated 2012 deal to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. Google would later unload Motorola for a big loss.

Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, was in talks last summer to sell itself to Google for about a $23 billion, sources previously told CNN. But the two sides failed to reach a deal and Wiz said it would instead focus on an initial public offering.

New York-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth since launching just five years ago. It was founded by Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik, who met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces.

“Wiz has achieved so much in a relatively short period, but cybersecurity moves at warp speed and so must we. The time is now,” Rappaport said in a Wiz blog post.

At $32 billion, the Wiz acquisition ranks as the seventh-biggest takeover of a private US firm on record, according to Dealogic.

Some on Wall Street are hoping the Google-Wiz deal will represent the start of a recovery in dealmaking, which has dried up in recent months amid turbulence in financial markets and weakening CEO confidence.

The revived talks and sale agreement come following the departure of Biden antitrust regulators who took a very tough approach to mega mergers. Lina Khan, former Federal Trade Commission chair, moved to block countless transactions on antitrust grounds.

“With Lina Khan gone at the FTC…the M&A engines are back underway in Big Tech,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Of course, some Republicans applauded Khan's antitrust crackdown — including Vice President JD Vance.

Last year, Vance praised Khan as “one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job.”

CorPower Ocean has secured financial backing from Vinnova, Sweden's national innovation agency, for a project exploring the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for improved performance and control in wave energy technology.

The WACE project, short for Wave energy AI-based Control Enhancement, is now underway and is set to run until November 2025.

CorPower Ocean is being supported by project partner Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

A model-based design framework will be used in the WACE project. After establishing requirements for the closed-loop control system, an AI-based optimal control strategy is being designed along with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test setup.

CorPower Ocean anticipates that its wave energy converters are operated in arrays or farms which will generate a vast amount of data. This project also aims for utilizing the available data to enhance an existing model-predictive control strategy combining optimal model-based control with AI.

This combination allows the exploration of more performant control schemes while keeping the devices in its feasible operating region. The performance of the developed algorithm will be proven using HIL testing providing a realistic real-time environment while using the existing operating strategy as a baseline.

“The optimal operation of wave energy converters is one of the key factors to lower the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ultimately making it an attractive part of the future clean energy mix. The main goal of the WACE Project is to combine AI methods with optimal control to enhance our existing operating strategy and further improve the performance of our point absorber type wave energy converter,” said Gabriel Forstner, WACE Project Lead and CorPower Ocean Control Engineer.

A key feature of CorPower Ocean's technology is its ability to tune and detune according to ocean conditions, limiting the response to storms and amplifying the motion and power capture in normal waves.

This feature has been demonstrated during the operational period of the company's C4 device in Aguçadoura, off Portugal. The verification of the amplified motion and power capture by the phase control system is seen as a key outcome from the HiWave-5 demonstration project.

Wave farm projects are being developed by customers using CorPower Ocean's technology along the Atlantic Arc, including sites in Scotland, Ireland, Portugal and Norway.

One project is being developed by Ireland's state-owned energy supplier, ESB, off the coast of County Clare, following two decades of investigating a wide variety of technologies.

The pre-commercial phase of the EU-backed Saoirse Wave project, will involve CorPower Ocean wave energy converts as part of a CorPack cluster.

 Chegg files landmark Google AI antitrust lawsuit, citing existential threat to publishers

In what could prove to be a watershed moment for digital publishing, edutech company Chegg has launched a high-stakes legal battle against Google, alleging the tech behemoth's AI Overviews feature is effectively killing the online content ecosystem by re-purposing publishers' material without adequate compensation or attribution.

The Google AI antitrust lawsuit, filed in Washington DC, argues Google uses its dominant market position to coerce publishers into allowing their content for AI-generated summaries that keep users on Google's platform rather than directing them to source websites.

Chegg, once valued at over $17 billion at its 2021 peak, has seen its market value plummet by more than 98%, with shares closing at just $1.57 on Monday.

The company that specialises in textbook rentals, homework assistance, and tutoring services, announced a 21% staff reduction in November and is now exploring a potential sale or take-private transaction as a direct result of these challenges.

“Our lawsuit is about more than Chegg – it's about the digital publishing industry, the future of internet search, and about students losing access to quality, step-by-step learning in favour of low-quality, unverified AI summaries,” said Nathan Schultz, Chegg's CEO, in a statement accompanying the filing.

Schultz accuses Google of profiting from Chegg's content without providing fair compensation, describing a fundamental shift in the relationship between search engines and content creators that threatens the digital publishing ecosystem.

At the heart of the Google AI antitrust lawsuit is what Chegg describes as a broken social contract between publishers and the search giant. Traditionally, publishers permit Google to crawl their websites to generate search results, which Google monetises through advertising.

In exchange, publishers receive valuable search traffic when users click through to their sites.

Chegg argues that Google's AI Overviews feature has fundamentally altered this relationship by extracting the key information from publisher sites and presenting it directly in search results, eliminating the need for users to visit the sources.

According to the lawsuit, this practice violates antitrust law by “conditioning the sale of one product on the customer selling or giving its supplier another product.”

The company claims Google is effectively coercing publishers to allow their content to be used for AI features that ultimately result in fewer site visits, creating an unsustainable model for content creators.

Google has dismissed the allegations as “meritless,” with spokesperson Jose Castaneda defending the company's AI Overviews feature.

“With AI Overviews, people find Search more helpful and use it more, creating new opportunities for discovering content. Every day, Google sends billions of clicks to sites across the web, and AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites,” Castaneda stated.

However, Chegg's lawsuit contends that those assurances ring hollow when faced with the dramatic decline in traffic and revenue experienced by publishers since the introduction of AI-generated search summaries.

While this represents the first instance of a single company accusing Google of antitrust violations, specifically through its AI Overviews feature, it follows a similar class action lawsuit filed by an Arkansas newspaper on behalf of the news industry in 2023.

Both cases touch on growing concerns about the sustainability of digital publishing in an era where AI systems can extract and repackage information from multiple sources, reducing the economic incentive to create original content.

Legal experts suggest the Chegg case could set a precedent for how courts view the intersection of artificial intelligence and antitrust law, potentially influencing future regulations governing how AI systems can utilise third-party content.

The Google AI antitrust lawsuit comes at a particularly challenging time for the search giant, which is already fighting a recent ruling by US District Judge Amit Mehta that Google holds an illegal monopoly in online search. Judge Mehta also oversees the Arkansas publisher's case against Google.

Perhaps most concerning is Chegg's warning about the long-term consequences if Google's practices continue unchecked.

The company argues that Google's approach will eventually lead to a “hollowed-out information ecosystem of little use and unworthy of trust.”

The stark assessment highlights the paradoxical risk that AI systems, dependent on high-quality human-created content, may ultimately destroy the very ecosystem they rely on.

For Chegg and other digital publishers, the answer to this question may determine nothing less than their continued existence in an increasingly AI-dominated information landscape.

Farsoon

Farsoon has announced the launch of its Beam Shaping Technology which has been demonstrated across four metal additive manufacturing systems live at TCT Asia.

The FS721M-H-8-CAMS, FS350M-4, FS273M and FS191M printers have been live printing at the event, with Farsoon suggesting the technology will deliver advances in performance, detail, efficiency and versatility.

Farsoon's Beam Shaping Technology dynamically forms laser spots into various shapes – such as ring-shaped, point-ring-shaped or fully customisable configurations tailored to specific application requirements. This, when combined with high-power lasers and optimised scanning strategies, is said to significantly enhance printing quality and efficiency, while delivering part densities exceeding 99.95%.

Among the key advantages of Beam Shaping, according to Farsoon, are increased build volume rates of 2.5+ times and melt pool width increases of 50-100%. The technology also reduces melt pool spatter compared to Gaussian spots, minimising powder contamination and porosity in build parts, and enables the manufacture of intricate features like thin wall structures. In addition, the technology will facilitate improved process stability and part consistency, as well as broad material compatibility. Farsoon counts stainless steel, aluminium alloys, titanium alloys and copper alloys among the compatible materials of its Beam Shaping Technology.

Moving forward, Farsoon intends to integrate Beam Shaping Technology into larger metal platforms like FS621M, FS811M and its metre-scale systems. The company has also debuted its 32-laser FS1521M-U metal 3D printing system at this week's TCT Asia.

 “Playas de TJ” by Jcarlosbulas is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.

A recent compromise in a well-used GitHub Actions utility has raised the issue of software supply chain security.

The tool, tj-actions/changed-files is thought to be used in over 23,000 repositories on GitHub. Malicious actors modified the tool on March 14, adding code to execute a Python script that read action logs, grabbing access tokens, passwords, and API keys from projects.

GitHub was swift to respond, replacing the tool on Sunday, March 16. Endor Labs stated that a bad actor likely targeted private repositories to amplify the attack's spread downstream the supply chain to other libraries, binaries, and artefacts – anything created with the tool.

READ NEXTMozi botnet boosts AndroxGh0st malware threat to IoT and cloud

The post by Endor Labs states, “We have no evidence that any downstream open-source library or containers has been impacted at this time. But we urge open source maintainers and the security community to join us in keeping a close eye out for potential secondary compromises.”

Researchers at Wiz (the security company currently in negotiations with Alphabet over a potential acquisition) have stated they have identified “dozens” of affected public repos that may have had sensitive credentials harvested. The company is attempting to contact project maintainers it believes have been the target of the malware.

GitHub recommends users who suspect they hay have been the victim of an attack from the rogue tj-actions/changed-files version to examine CI (continuous integration) logfiles for unfamiliar IP addresses and pin Actions to specific commit hashes, rather than version tags. It also advocates changing any active secrets, using allow-listing functions to only permit authorised Actions, and configuring pipelines to only run trusted and verified Actions.

Users are advised to update any version of the tool (up to 45.0.7) to the patched version provided by GitHub, replacing the compromised code. The issue has been designated CVE-2025-30066, after it was raised by StepSecurity, who alerted GitHub initially.

“Although the original has been restored, it's not clear why that got compromised,” the StepSecurity's CEO, Varun Sharma, said.

The CTO of Endor Labs, Dimitri Stiliadis said that the hackers could have used any credentials stolen by means of the CI/CD attack in software and container repos to infect other projects. “We could have packages infected with malware that nobody's going to know about. It could be thousands or […] even millions. We really don't know what the real damage is.”

The attraction for hackers of supply chain attacks lies in the common dissemination of code to multiple projects – one successfully compromised, popular element could be downloaded and implemented elsewhere many thousands of times. Popular targets are Docker container sources, and Ruby, NPM and PyPI repositories.

READ NEXTGitHub sees rise in Python numbers as AI bites

Identifying components used in software is the purpose of SBOMs (software bills of materials) which while not actively preventative, at least give project maintainers a full catalogue of the libraries, frameworks, and applications that make up their offerings.

Billions of lines of code are distributed freely under open-source licences, yet are often not actively maintained by their authors, due to monetary constraints. Lack of upstream contributions is held to be an important factor in the cause of many cybersecurity issues, which affect many organisations, including large, cash-rich enterprises.

Developers are advised to follow best security practice in addition to their other duties and concerns around achieving KPI targets.

The S&P 500 Index SPY today is down -1.15%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index DIA is down -0.67%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index QQQ is down -1.89%. March E-mini S&P futures (ESH25) are down -1.29%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH25) are down -2.04%. 

Stock indexes today are trading lower ahead of the 2-day FOMC meeting that began today. Stocks are being undercut by concerns that the US economy is losing momentum due to US trade policies. Weakness in the Magnificent Seven stocks and a slide in chip stocks are leading technology stocks and the broader market lower.

Stocks remained under pressure today despite better-than-expected US economic news on Feb housing starts, building permits, and Feb manufacturing production.

US Feb housing starts rose +11.2% m/m to 1.501 million, stronger than expectations of 1.385 million. Feb building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -1.2% m/m to 1.456 million, a smaller decline than expectations of 1.453 million. 

The US Feb import price index ex-petroleum rose +0.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m. 

US Feb manufacturing production rose +0.9% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m and the biggest increase in a year.

Geopolitical risks in the Middle East are also undercutting stocks. Israel today launched a series of airstrikes across Gaza, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to act “with increasing military strength” to free hostages and disarm Hamas. Also, the US launched weekend strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels. US Defense Secretary Hegseth said strikes would be “unrelenting” until the group stops attacking vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels said they would respond by attacking US vessels in the Red Sea. 

According to the latest survey from Bank of America, investors cut their US stock holdings by 40 percentage points from the previous survey, the most on record, from 17% overweight in February to 23% underweight in March, while cash levels have risen to 4.1% from 3.5%, the biggest jump since 2020.

Stocks have been under pressure over the past two weeks due to fears that US tariffs will weaken economic growth and corporate earnings. On March 4, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and doubled the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% from 10%. On Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that he would impose reciprocal tariffs and additional sector-specific tariffs on foreign nations on April 2. 

Market attention this week will focus on the Tue-Wed FOMC meeting (expected no change to the 4.25%-4.50% federal funds target range). The markets will also look at the Fed's economic projections and dot-plot for the future path of interest rates, along with post-meeting comments from Fed Chair Powell.

The markets are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut at the Tue-Wed FOMC meeting.

Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 climbed to a 1-week high and is up +0.58%. China's Shanghai Composite Index rose to a 3-month high and closed up +0.11%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rallied to a 2-1/2 week high and closed up +1.20%.

Interest Rates

June 10-year T-notes (ZNM25) today are down -1 tick. The 10-year T-note yield is up +1.2 bp to 4.310%. June T-notes today are under pressure after US Feb housing starts and building permits rose more than expected. Also, the Feb import price index ex-petroleum rose more than expected, a hawkish factor for Fed policy. In addition, supply pressures are undercutting T-note prices as the Treasury will auction $13 billion 20-year T-bonds later today. T-notes recovered most of their losses today as stocks retreated, which fueled safe-haven buying of T-notes.

European bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +1.3 bp to 2.831%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +3.0 bp to 4.667%.

The German Mar ZEW survey expectations of economic growth rose +25.6 to a 3-year high of 51.6, stronger than expectations of 48.3.

Swaps are discounting the chances at 55% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the April 17 policy meeting.

US Stock Movers

Chip stocks are sliding today, another bearish factor for the overall market. ARM Holdings Plc ARM and Marvell Technology MRVL are down more than -2%. Also, Micron Technology MU, GlobalFoundries GFS, KLA Corp KLAC, Lam Research LRCX, and Microchip Technology MCHP are down more than -1%. 

The weakness of the Magnificent Seven stocks today is weighing on the overall market. Tesla TSLA is down more than -5% after RBC Capital Markets cut its price target on the stock to $330 from $440.

US stocks retreated on Tuesday as Wall Street's recent sell-off resumed following two days of gains.

The S&P 500 dropped 1.1%, nearing correction territory, the Dow lost over 250 points, while the Nasdaq 100 tumbled 1.6%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks.

Tesla fell 5.5% after RBC Capital Markets cut its price target, citing growing competition in the EV market.

Alphabet shares fell 2.6%, with news showing Google will acquire cloud security Wiz for $32 billion.

Other tech names, including Nvidia and Palantir, also declined more than 2% and 3%, respectively.

Investors remain cautious ahead of the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday, with markets widely expecting interest rates to hold steady.

Attention is focused on the central bank's outlook and the potential impact of trade policy developments on market sentiment.

Meanwhile, economic data showed a stronger-than-expected rise in housing starts, while import price pressures raised concerns about inflation.

Google owner Alphabet will buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion — in a deal set to boost the tech giant's in-house cloud computing amid burgeoning artifical intelligence growth.

If closed, the-cash transaction, announced Tuesday, will become Google's most expensive acquisition in the company's 25-year history. The purchase gives Google new momentum in its efforts to compete in the cloud-computing business by offering more security for its services.“

Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,” Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said in a blog post.

The company says Wiz will join Google Cloud — and that this deal represents a company investment “to accelerate two large and growing trends in the AI era: improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.”

Together, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement, Google Cloud and Wiz “will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.”Assaf Rappaport, Co-Founder & CEO, added that the deal will “bolster our mission to improve security and prevent breaches by providing additional resources and deep AI expertise.”

Wiz, based in New York, was founded in 2020, makes security tools designed to shield the information stored in remote data centers from intruders. Google has had its eyes on Wiz for some time. The purchase price announced Tuesday surpasses a reported $23 billion buyout proposal that Wiz rejected last July.

The proposed buyout will get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to be more friendly to business deals, it has also shown skepticism of big tech. Also, the new Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson has vowed to maintain a tough review process for mergers and acquisitions.

OpenAI and Google, having long trained their ravenous bots on the work of newsrooms like this one, now want to throw out long-established copyright law by arguing, we kid you not, that the only way for the United States to defeat the Chinese Communist Party is for those tech giants to steal the content created with the sweat equity of America's human journalists.“With a Chinese Communist Party determined to overtake us by 2030,” OpenAI wrote Thursday to the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy, “the Trump administration's new action plan can ensure that American-led A.I. built on democratic principles can prevail over CCP-built, autocratic, authoritarian AI.”Built on democratic principles? More like built on outright theft.That's why news organizations, including this one and the New York Times, have sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft over their breaking copyright law by vacuuming up millions of newspaper articles without permission or payment, constituting copyright infringement on a colossal scale.Now OpenAI comes back with the absurd argument that this was somehow necessary for national security.In their letter, Sam Altman's crew added a whole lot of obfuscating, self-serving blather about “scaling human ingenuity” and “freedom of learning and knowledge” while describing the innovations of ChatGPT as part of some great and glorious trajectory from domesticated horses to steam power to electricity to printing presses and the internet.You see the irony there? Printing presses.For generations, those presses sent out the work of America's reporters, the fruits of capital invested, and hard labor performed, in city halls and crime scenes and throughout all the communities they served.

clear sky

Blockchain technology is reshaping industries beyond cryptocurrencies. Initially developed for Bitcoin transactions, blockchain has evolved into a powerful tool for securing data, automating processes, and improving transparency. Governments, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and supply chain managers are exploring blockchain's potential.

This article explores blockchain's future, its applications, and the challenges it must overcome.

Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain is immutable, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be altered. This feature makes it valuable for applications requiring trust and security.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies use blockchain to facilitate secure, borderless transactions. Blockchain reduces reliance on banks, enabling faster and cheaper international payments.

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with terms written in code. They eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency in legal, financial, and business transactions.

Companies use blockchain to track products from manufacturing to delivery. This improves transparency, reduces fraud, and ensures authenticity in industries like food safety, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods.

Blockchain enables secure storage and sharing of patient records. Hospitals and clinics can access verified data while maintaining patient privacy, reducing errors and improving treatment efficiency.

Blockchain-based voting systems enhance election security by preventing tampering and ensuring transparency. Several countries and organisations are exploring blockchain voting solutions to increase trust in electoral processes.

DeFi platforms use blockchain to provide financial services without banks. Users can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, increasing financial inclusion.

Blockchain's encryption and decentralised nature make it resistant to hacking. Industries handling sensitive data, such as banking and healthcare, benefit from its security features.

Blockchain creates permanent, tamper-proof records, reducing fraud and corruption. Businesses and governments can use it to increase accountability in transactions and record-keeping.

Real estate, art, stocks, and commodities can be tokenised on the blockchain, allowing fractional ownership and easier asset trading. This can increase liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets.

Blockchain can complement AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. For example, blockchain can enhance IoT security by preventing data breaches in connected devices.

Many blockchain networks struggle with slow transaction speeds and high fees. Solutions like layer-2 scaling and blockchain sharding aim to address these limitations.

Governments worldwide are still developing blockchain regulations. Inconsistent laws create uncertainty for businesses and investors, slowing adoption.

Some blockchain networks, like Bitcoin, consume large amounts of energy due to mining processes. Sustainable alternatives, such as proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, are being developed to reduce environmental impact.

Businesses and governments must invest in infrastructure and workforce training to implement blockchain effectively. Adoption remains slow due to high costs and resistance to change.

Blockchain technology is expected to evolve with innovations that address scalability, security, and energy concerns. Key trends include:

Blockchain technology offers immense opportunities for businesses, governments, and individuals. While challenges remain, ongoing advancements in scalability, security, and regulation will drive its growth. As blockchain becomes more integrated into everyday life, it will revolutionise industries and redefine digital trust.

The OnePlus 13 is primarily known for its Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered performance, Hasselblad-tuned cameras, and OxygenOS 15. However, the latest flagship from OnePlus offers much more than just these highlights. In fact, some of its lesser-known features are so handy that they elevate the user experience, making the OnePlus 13 an even more compelling flagship offering than it was perceived to be.

Here are five such features that every OnePlus 13 (review) user—and those considering getting one—must know:

The OnePlus 13 is the first smartphone from the brand to support eSIM in India. Unlike most phones with eSIM—especially from brands like Google and Apple, which offer a single physical SIM slot along with eSIM support—the OnePlus 13 includes two physical nano SIM card slots in addition to eSIM support. However, when using an eSIM, the secondary physical SIM card will be automatically disabled, meaning the phone can only accommodate two SIM cards at a time.

The OnePlus 13 is one of the first Android smartphones in the world that can be tracked even when turned off. This feature, which has been available on iPhones for a while, allows users to locate their device via Google's Find My network even when it is powered down. This can be especially useful in case of theft, as owners can continue tracking their phones.

The OnePlus 13 can function as a walkie-talkie, thanks to a feature called BeanLink. This allows the device to connect with other OnePlus and Oppo smartphones without requiring an internet connection, enabling users to make calls and send messages. Although it has a limited range, this feature can be highly useful in scenarios such as trekking or in areas with weak network coverage.

This feature ensures that the OnePlus 13 remains responsive even when the screen is wet. Combined with support for gloves mode, it makes the phone easy to use in extreme conditions. Simply put, the display on the OnePlus 13 will stay active and responsive in almost any environment.

Last but not least, the alert slider is a signature hardware feature on the OnePlus 13. However, this is likely to be the last OnePlus smartphone to include it, as the brand plans to replace it with a programmable button similar to the Action Button on the iPhone 16. The alert slider makes it easy to switch between different sound profiles without needing to turn on the screen.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Facebook (now Meta) executive, has published a shocking memoir, Careless People: A Story of Where I Used to Work, exposing the inner workings of the social media giant. The book details Facebook's toxic work culture, aggressive global expansion tactics, and how CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team prioritized growth over ethics. Originally reported by The Guardian, Wynn-Williams' revelations highlight Facebook's failures, from data privacy concerns to enabling political manipulation and even workplace harassment.

Wynn-Williams worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2018, rising to the position of director of global public policy. She describes the company as an almost “cult-like” environment, where employees were expected to be devoted to its mission at all costs.

In one shocking incident, she recalls working on a memo during labour, moments before giving birth. She was drafting an update on Facebook's expansion in Myanmar for then-COO Sheryl Sandberg. Her husband was furious, but the hospital doctor had to step in and physically close her laptop.

She also highlights Facebook's extreme work expectations for women, referencing Sandberg's Lean In philosophy, which encouraged women to work tirelessly, even during pregnancy. The reality, she later realized, was that this culture promoted self-exploitation rather than empowerment.

One of the book's most alarming revelations is Facebook's role in fueling hate speech and violence in Myanmar. Zuckerberg's Free Basics program, which aimed to provide free internet access in developing countries, was marketed as a philanthropic effort. However, Wynn-Williams exposes how it was a strategy for Facebook to dominate the internet in those regions.

She admits that initially, she believed in Facebook's mission to connect the world. However, she later realized that in Myanmar, Facebook became a tool for the military junta to spread hate speech and incite violence against the Muslim Rohingya population.

Wynn-Williams writes, “Myanmar would have been a better place if Facebook had not arrived.”

The book also details widespread sexual harassment on Facebook. Wynn-Williams recounts how senior executives, including Meta's global affairs chief Joel Kaplan, allegedly made inappropriate advances toward female employees. She describes a company culture where high-ranking men were protected while women were expected to stay silent.

She also shares a disturbing incident in which Sandberg invited her to sleep in the same bed during a work trip. While she declined, she later worried that rejecting the offer might have harmed her career.

According to Wynn-Williams, Facebook's leadership, including Mark Zuckerberg, knew about these issues but did little to address them.

Wynn-Williams criticizes Facebook's handling of political advertising and misinformation, particularly during the 2016 US elections. She describes how Facebook's ad-targeting system was used to spread disinformation, influence elections, and manipulate users.

She accuses Zuckerberg of misleading Congress about the extent of Facebook's cooperation with the Chinese government. She claims that behind closed doors, Facebook was developing censorship tools to comply with China's strict regulations, contradicting Zuckerberg's public statements.

Following the book's release, Meta dismissed Wynn-Williams' claims, stating that she was a disgruntled former employee trying to sell books. A company spokesperson labelled the memoir “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims, along with false accusations about our executives.”

Despite this, Wynn-Williams argues that Facebook's culture remains unchanged, even after rebranding to Meta. She warns that as Zuckerberg expands into artificial intelligence, the company's irresponsibility and pursuit of profit could pose even greater risks.

Her book, published by Pan Macmillan, serves as a critical insider account of Facebook's rise to power, its internal dysfunction, and the consequences of its unchecked influence on society.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has received approval from the Centre for the Chandrayaan-5 mission, ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan confirmed. The mission, aimed at further advancing India's lunar exploration capabilities, is part of the country's long-term goal of achieving a human landing on the Moon by 2040. The announcement was made during an event held in Chennai, where Narayanan also outlined ISRO's roadmap, including the development of an Indian Space Station by 2035. The Chandrayaan-5 mission is expected to feature a 350 kg rover and will involve collaboration with Japan.

According to reports, ISRO has outlined multiple upcoming missions, including Chandrayaan-4, which will focus on landing and sample collection. Chandrayaan-5 is expected to enhance lunar exploration by deploying a high-capacity lander, a critical step towards future human landings. Last year, Union Minister Jitendra Singh confirmed government approval for Chandrayaan-4, which will test key technologies for landing, sample collection, and a safe return to Earth.

Additionally, ISRO has been tasked with the development of an independent space station, named ""Bharatiya Antriksh Station,"" scheduled for completion by 2035. Plans are also underway to send Indian astronauts to the Moon aboard an indigenous rocket.

Reports indicate that ISRO has been expanding its launch capabilities, with significant progress made in satellite deployment. Since 2014, India has launched satellites for 34 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Canada. Over the past decade, 393 foreign satellites and three Indian commercial satellites have been launched using PSLV, LVM3, and SSLV launch vehicles.
The upcoming rocket launch facility at Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu is expected to play a key role in small satellite launches. Construction began on March 5, 2024, following the foundation stone-laying ceremony by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The spaceport will focus on polar launches using the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), with production supported by Indian industry.

During the Chennai event, Narayanan highlighted ISRO's achievements, including Chandrayaan-1's discovery of water on the Moon and Chandrayaan-3's successful landing at the lunar south pole, making India the first country to achieve this milestone. He also mentioned India's progress in solar research, stating that the country has become the fourth nation to launch a dedicated satellite for studying the Sun.

The event was attended by several dignitaries, including former Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, former MLA Vijayadharani, and former Chennai Mayor Saidai Duraisamy.

To be bylined to Don Mclean, CEO at global climate tech firm, IES.

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) recently declared 2024 as the hottest year on record. The escalating impact of climate change is becoming more evident by the day. From extreme weather events and resource scarcity to rising energy insecurity, the need for meaningful action has never been more urgent.

As a major source of greenhouse gas emissions – responsible for almost 40% of the global total – the built environment possesses immense potential to curb future harm to the planet. Therefore, the sector must undergo a profound green transformation by designing better buildings and retrofitting those we already have to meet critical net zero targets.

With more than 70% of today's buildings expected to still be in operation by 2050, retrofitting is not just an option but a necessity if we are to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.

Typically, retrofitting existing buildings results in 50–75% fewer emissions compared to demolishing and rebuilding. Yet, retrofitting at scale remains a major hurdle. The current global retrofit rate stands at just 1% of building stock per year – far short of the 3% annual rate required to meet climate targets. We need to increase the rate at which we retrofit while avoiding a ‘one-size-fits-all' approach, which can result in misguided and costly measures being implemented with no real impact, given each building comes with unique characteristics, operational needs and constraints. Without a tailored approach, retrofitting efforts risk wasting time, money, and resources.

This is where digital twin technology, advanced energy modelling, and dynamic simulation tools can transform the built environment's decarbonisation journey. These technologies enable building owners, designers, and operators to create flexible, targeted retrofit plans based on a building's specific context and the reality of its operation. They not only inform the initial optimum retrofit strategies but can continue to deliver value throughout a building's lifecycle, ensuring ongoing operational efficiency and environmental performance.

No two buildings are the same. A building's age, geographical location, physical structure, existing equipment, occupancy patterns and local climate conditions, can influence which retrofitting strategies will be most effective. As highlighted in IES's Energy Modelling for Retrofit white paper, building retrofits, particularly for large, complex buildings, must be modelled in context. Generic, ‘off-the-shelf' retrofit measures rarely deliver optimum results because they overlook a building's unique energy-use profile and operational realities.

By contrast, a tailored, strategic retrofit, developed through robust digital simulation, can identify which upgrades will perform best for a specific building – all before any physical work begins. Retrofitting measures can include improved insulation, advanced heating systems, and energy-efficient lighting, among others. By using digital simulation tools, the risk of measures underdelivering – or worse, causing other negative impacts on the building, such as overheating – is significantly reduced. This means investments can be strategically directed towards the most impactful solutions.

It's also worth pointing out that retrofitting in itself is not an isolated solution. A building's performance changes over time based on factors such as occupant behaviour, climate, occupancy rates, and evolving energy demands. Only a bespoke approach, guided by ongoing data collection, performance monitoring, and analysis, can ensure that retrofits remain effective throughout a building's lifecycle. Without continuous performance monitoring and adjustments, even well-executed retrofits can fall short of their potential. These factors, along with the growing unpredictability of the climate, make it clear why continuously monitoring a building's performance and implementing ongoing retrofits are essential to keeping it resilient and efficient.

The effectiveness of modern retrofit strategies can be turbocharged by digital twin technology – virtual replicas of physical buildings that enable advanced performance analysis. These dynamic models combine real building data with physics-based simulations of how various systems, such as heating, ventilation, and lighting, interact with the whole building under real-world conditions.

By combining these simulations with real-time data from sensors, meters and building management systems, digital twins offer granular insights into a building's energy usage. This allows project teams to make data-driven decisions rather than relying on vague assumptions. For example, while traditional approaches might prioritise window upgrades for energy savings, a digital twin might reveal that addressing ventilation inefficiencies would have a faster payback period and a greater impact on carbon reduction.

Ultimately, digital twins ensure that every pound spent on retrofit activity delivers measurable benefits and is spent in an optimal way. They enable building owners to forecast return on investment (ROI) for each potential action, prioritising interventions that align with both sustainability goals and financial constraints.

Despite the clear benefits, scaling retrofits across entire building portfolios presents significant challenges. One major hurdle is data availability and quality – particularly for older buildings that often lack accurate records of their systems and operational demands. Without this information, it is difficult to develop effective retrofit strategies. To overcome this, AEC consultants should undertake detailed building surveys and deploy smart monitoring technology to gather reliable, real-time performance data.

Budgetary constraints can also pose a significant challenge. While retrofits deliver long-term cost savings, the upfront investment can be prohibitive. This is where digital simulation plays a crucial role, enabling stakeholders to justify spending by demonstrating tangible cost savings through robust energy modelling. Additionally, prioritising optimisation, aided by the digital twin, as a first step prior to implementing any retrofit measures can further unlock significant operational energy savings, which can be reinvested into deeper renovations or upgrades. An optimisation-first approach will also ensure the impact of any subsequent retrofit measures are maximised and not fighting against an already inefficient building.

Additionally, occupant disruption and operational downtime can deter retrofit activity, particularly in commercial or hospitality settings. Digital twins can help mitigate this by allowing project teams to plan retrofit activities around building usage patterns, ensuring work is carried out with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.

As climate targets tighten, energy costs continue to rise, and the real-world impacts of climate change come to the fore, retrofitting the built environment will only grow in importance. Yet achieving meaningful impact will require a holistic, data-led approach that respects each building's originality. Digital twins, underpinned by advanced energy modelling and real-time performance data, will remain crucial in guiding these efforts.

From supporting evidence-based decision-making at the project outset to ensuring upgrades continue delivering results long after implementation, simulation-driven tools represent the future of sustainable building management. The path to net zero lies not only in faster retrofitting but in smarter retrofitting. By embracing technology and tailoring interventions to each building's specific needs, the built environment can deliver lasting environmental and economic benefits.

US President Donald Trump has warned Iran that it will face ""dire"" consequences if Yemen's Houthis continue to attack international shipping lanes.

He said the Iranian leadership would be held responsible for ""every shot fired by the Houthis"", which have long been backed by Tehran. The group later said it had targeted a US aircraft carrier three times in the past two days.

The Houthis first tried to attack the USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea on Sunday following deadly US strikes on Yemen. 

The Pentagon said it had struck 30 targets in Yemen since Saturday, in the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump returned to the White House.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Monday: ""Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN.

""And IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!""

The US president accused Iran of supplying the group with funding, weapons and intelligence, which Tehran denies.

In a letter on Monday to the UN Security Council, Iran's UN envoy denied it was in violation of a UN arms embargo on Yemen, and said it was not involved in any destabilising activities in the region.

Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani accused the US of ""baseless accusations"" against Iran, Reuters news agency reported.

In a briefing on Monday, Pentagon officials said the US attacks on Yemen were directed at a broader range of targets than the strikes authorised under former President Joe Biden.

Lt Gen Alex Grynkewich said that Houthi drone experts were among those targeted.

He added that there had been ""no credible indications of any civilian casualties"".

Washington has said some key Houthi figures were among the dead, although the group has not confirmed this.

Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the US was not seeking regime change.

""This campaign will be relentless to degrade their capability and to open up shipping lanes in the region and to defend our homeland,"" he said.

On Sunday morning, the Houthis launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S Truman.

US fighter aircraft shot down about 11 of the drones, a US official told the BBC's US partner CBS.

The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S Truman, the official added.

On Monday, the group said that it had launched a third attack on the ship in just 48 hours - disrupting US military strikes that were preparing to launch.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to the BBC when asked about the group's latest claims. Earlier on Monday, Pentagon officials said that one missile fired at the ship by the Houthis missed by over 100 miles (160km), and denied that any of the Houthi attacks have been successful.

The Houthis said at least five children were among 53 people killed in the US air strikes on Yemen's Al Jaouf and Hudaydah areas, casualties that the BBC has not independently verified.

The US also launched airstrikes against the group on Saturday and Sunday.

The Houthis said they would continue to target Red Sea shipping until Israel lifted its blockade of Gaza.

The group has claimed - often falsely - that they only target ships linked to Israel, the US or the UK in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Since November 2023, the  Houthis have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.

The group controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government.

A jury found Starbucks responsible for the incident, which caused a Postmates driver third-degree burns to his genital area.

Police have been searching for the missing University of Pittsburgh student, who was on spring break in Punta Cana, for the past two weeks. 

Paul Burke says his daughter Becky has been released from a US immigration centre.

Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement after Trump called for a judge that halted his deportations to be impeached.

President Donald Trump has vowed to impose a sweeping range of tariffs on Irish goods on 2 April.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Central Ohio surgery centers are earning high marks in a U.S. News & World Report list that showcases the best ambulatory surgery centers in the nation.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers, or ASCs, for short, provide same-day surgical care for procedures including colonoscopies, hip or knee replacements.

U.S. News researchers evaluated the centers based how successfully surgery center teams avoided complications, ER visits and unplanned hospitalizations. This is the organization's second year in creating the list.

The facilities in central Ohio include:

“Our overarching goal is to help empower patients to make informed decisions about the care that they need, their own health care goals,” said Chelsea Wen, a senior health data analyst at U.S. News and World Report. “Part of that is giving them the information very granularly about how all of these surgery centers are doing, specifically on the procedure that they're interested in.”

Wen said there may be facilities on the website that are rated as average. However, that does not mean they have a negative review; it means that those ASCs met expectations and had no red flags in terms of safety or quality.

Sky News speaks to experts about what a Ukraine without fighting would look like - from a replacement for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to potential peacekeeping forces from the UK and France - or India.


          News reporter
              @LaraKeay


Tuesday 18 March 2025 13:13, UK

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy's have both said any ceasefire between their two countries must lead to a lasting peace.

Ukraine has not long marked three years of war, in which hundreds of thousands have died or been injured on both sides, according to the respective authorities.

Follow our live blog for the latest updates about the Ukraine war

The Kremlin's annexation of more Ukrainian territory during its invasion - which it still calls a ""special military operation"" -and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's determination to uphold its sovereignty has left many analysts doubtful the war will ever end.

But since his return to the White House, Donald Trump has demanded the two sides ""make a deal"", withdrawing vital US support to Kyiv until it agreed to come to the negotiating table.

Mr Zelenskyy has now agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, with Mr Trump due to iron out Russia's demands in a phone call with Mr Putin on Tuesday.

But beyond that - what would a Ukraine without fighting look like? Here we go through some of the options.

Ongoing ceasefire

Beyond the initial 30-day agreement, providing neither side violates it, the ceasefire could continue indefinitely.

""A ceasefire can go on to be an enduring thing,"" Dr David Blagden, associate professor in international security and strategy at the University of Exeter, tells Sky News.

He gives the example of North and South Korea, whereby a demilitarised zone (DMZ) has effectively served as a border between the two countries since the Korean War ended in 1953.

""Even if it doesn't ever lead to a more satisfactory settlement, it might still be better for both parties than endless conflict,"" he says.

But any kind of DMZ would require both Ukraine and Russia to pull their troops away from the frontline, which is unlikely, adds Dr Huseyn Aliyev, senior lecturer in East European studies at the University of Glasgow.

Parts of Ukraine become 'New Russia'

The alternative would be for both Ukraine and Russia to offer concessions to formally end the war.

Top of Vladimir Putin's ""list of demands"" for ""long-term peace"", and his justification for invading Ukraine in the first place, is Crimea - and four other regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia - becoming part of a 'New Russia', as they were before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

Read moreUp to 30 countries to be part of Ukraine coalitionWhich infrastructure could be part of a deal?

While Luhansk is almost completely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds significant parts of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, making them more difficult for Kyiv to let go of.

""We know neither Crimea nor the Donbas regions [Donetsk and Luhansk] would be returned [to Ukraine] as part of a truce,"" Dr Aliyev says. ""So it would involve ceding control over those parts.

""But Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are more complicated - especially Kherson - as Kherson city was so painfully liberated by Ukraine in 2022.""

Although many doubt Russia would stop there in terms of territory, Dr Blagden adds: ""There would be Russian rationale for being content with what they already have. It's been hugely costly for them - and destroyed a lot of their expensively modernised military. It's also filtered through into Russian civilian life, to an extent, via the sanctions and casualties, despite the Kremlin's efforts to insulate Russia's upper and middle classes from the worst of the war.

""Likewise, for Ukraine - galling and unfair though it may be - there's likely now more recognition that retaking lost ground will be desperately hard, especially without assured supplies of US weaponry and intelligence. So, they could have reason to live with some sort of ceasefire too.""

Power plants and infrastructure split

Mr Trump has said his team has already proposed ""dividing up certain assets"" between the two countries - namely ""land and power plants"" - and will discuss the details with Mr Putin in a phone call on Tuesday.

He did not give any specifics, but these are likely to include the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which has been occupied by Russia since March 2022, and is one of the largest in the world.

Other key infrastructure that could come under Moscow's control includes the Nova Kakhovka dam, blown up in 2023 and not yet rebuilt, and other river crossings.

Zelenskyy replaced

A truce would also likely include a new leader for Ukraine. Mr Zelenskyy has already told Sky News he is open to stepping down if it means Ukraine can join NATO.

One of Mr Putin's demands is that Ukraine is never allowed NATO membership - but replacing Mr Zelenskyy could still serve to appease him - and Donald Trump, who has called him a ""dictator"" and accused him of ""gambling with World War Three"".

""It would be easier for Zelenskyy to call an election and have somebody replace him,"" Dr Aliyev says. ""But there's a problem of who that would be - as there's not much left of the Ukrainian opposition.""

Contenders include Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Valerii Zaluzhnyi - or one of the generals currently in charge of the military, he adds.

But the Kremlin would prefer a pro-Russian regime in Kyiv, according to Dr Blagden.

""Short of being able to conquer the whole country, a government that's more favourable towards Russian interests would obviously be their preference,"" he says.

""Similar to the one they've worked hard to install in Georgia, they might hope for the return of Ukraine's more pro-Russian politicians and sentiment from before 2014. But of course, Ukrainian opinion is now galvanised against anyone seen as a puppet of Moscow.""

'Minor concessions' for Ukraine

Although Russia's demands would mean a series of heavy blows for Ukraine, there could be some ""minor concessions"", security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke says.

US national security adviser Mike Waltz has said Ukraine would get ""security guarantees"" if it agrees to cede territory - but has not specified what they would be.

Other possible concessions include the return of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children who were abducted and forcibly resettled in Russia - and prisoners of war on both sides.

In principle, if a truce was agreed, the International Criminal Court could also begin an investigation into whether war crimes were committed on either side.

""In these situations where there's a fundamental disagreement and you can't see the way forward, you often concentrate on some of the minor details,"" Professor Clarke says.

Starmer's 'coalition of the willing'

Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have spearheaded the idea of a so-called ""coalition of the willing"" to uphold a potential truce or ceasefire.

Follow our channel and never miss an update

Sir Keir's team says ""more than 30"" countries are interested in contributing to the peacekeeping force - but the US has been notably absent from leaders' meetings so far. Vladimir Putin has also said he would not accept NATO forces in Ukraine, posing a major obstacle to the plans.

The prime minister has not specified how the coalition would work but said that military chiefs would meet to discuss the ""operational phase"" on Thursday.

Lower risk option

According to the experts, the coalition could take two potential forms.

Neither would involve guarding the entire frontline. That's because, at 640 miles long, it would require more than 100,000 troops at a time - and 300,000 with rotations.

By contrast, the first option would be stationing troops away from the line of control, largely in western Ukraine - or at key infrastructural sites or transport hubs to ensure they continue running smoothly.

This would be a similar operation to the British one in Estonia - where 900 troops are stationed to deter Russian aggression. The Ukrainian one would involve up to 30,000 personnel and be focused primarily on monitoring, logistics, and training, the experts say.

""The challenge for any peacekeeping force is balancing effectiveness and escalatory risk,"" Dr Blagden adds.

""Calling it a 'peacekeeping' force might create the impression of neutrality. But of course, it wouldn't be neutral - they're there to defend one of two sides. It would be better understood as a garrison whose job would be to ensure that Russia can't attack Ukraine without attacking NATO troops, and therefore risking a wider war with nuclear-armed powers,"" he says.

""A larger combat force closer to the frontline would create more deterrence but with more escalatory risk - whereas a smaller force further from the frontline - perhaps merely fulfilling training and support tasks - would carry much less escalatory risk but therefore also be much less of a deterrent"".

Ordinarily, that deterrent would be hugely bolstered by the US, which under NATO's Article 5 could send in powerful air forces to attack ones on the ground - as it has in places like Iraq.

But Donald Trump's tense relations with Ukraine and suggestions the US could leave NATO have thrown its Article 5 obligations into major doubt.

'Rapid reaction force' closer to frontline

Alternatively, coalition troops could be sent closer to the frontline, Professor Clarke says.

They would be split into brigades manning four or five strategic bases like the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kharkiv or Kyiv.

Describing them as a ""rapid reaction force at high readiness"", Professor Clarke adds: ""To be able to go to any trouble spot and snuff it out they'd need a lot of transport - particularly air cover to get there quickly enough.""

They too would likely need to be backed up by a US security guarantee, he says, but under the Trump administration, this is by no means certain.

Neutral peacekeeping force

Alternatively, a peacekeeping force could be led by the United Nations, which would recruit personnel from neutral countries in exchange for incentives, as it does elsewhere.

With the second-largest military in NATO, Turkey could be involved, Dr Aliyev says.

But with Vladimir Putin's rejection of potential NATO forces, he may be more likely to accept ones from the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) nations, Professor Clarke adds.

""Putin has hinted at troops from the Global South as monitors - because he thinks they are on his side,"" he says. India in particular could be a viable option, he says.

""India has got big forces and wants to play a bigger strategic role in the world. Russia wouldn't want to fire on Indian forces because of the political implications for their relationship - so they might be most acceptable to both Russia and the West.""

While a neutral option might be the most practical - it may not be hugely successful, Dr Aliyev cautions.

""Similar missions in Lebanon and sub-Saharan Africa have been relatively low in effectiveness,"" he says.""A UN force might be the most feasible for Russia - but a coalition of the willing would last longer.""","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

The leaders spoke to each other for over two hours.

During an over two-hour call, US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed that the war in Ukraine ""needs to end with a lasting peace"", the White House said on Tuesday. 

Reaffirming that the two countries will move closer under the Trump administration, the two leaders ""also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations"" between the United States and Russia. 

""The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people. This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts,"" a White House readout said. 



Readout of President Donald J. Trump's Call with President Vladimir Putin:Today, President Trump and President Putin spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also stressed the…



Outlining the contours of a possible pause in the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump and Putin agreed that ""the movement to peace"" will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire as well as technical negotiations on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, ""full ceasefire and permanent peace"". These negotiations, the White House said, will begin immediately in the Middle East. The White House said the leaders also spoke about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts and ""shared the view"" that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel. The need to stop the proliferation of strategic weapons was also discussed. 

On the ties between the United States and Russia, Trump and Putin agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship has ""huge upside"". This, the readout said, includes ""enormous economic deals"" and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.Putin's Condition

In its statement, the Kremlin said Putin ""expressed gratitude to Donald Trump for his desire to help achieve the noble goal of ending hostilities and human losses"". For movement towards peace, Putin, however, laid down a key condition: stopping foreign military aid and the sharing of intel with Ukraine.

""It was emphasised that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution through political and diplomatic means should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv,"" the Kremlin said.

The statement said Trump proposed that Russia and Ukraine mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days, to which Putin ""responded positively"" and gave the order to the Russian military. 

Another key development was the announcement that an exchange of 175 prisoners each will be carried out between the Russian and Ukrainian sides on Wednesday. ""As a gesture of goodwill"", 23 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen who are being treated in Russian medical institutions will also be transferred.

While the Kremlin statement also spoke about the Middle East and the Red Sea region, it did not specifically mention Israel or Iran. 'Expect Unconditional Agreement'

The call came amid concerns in Kyiv and several countries in Europe that Trump would give too many concessions to the Russian president. ""It is time for Russia to show whether it really wants peace. Ukraine supported the US proposal for a temporary ceasefire for 30 days. We expect the Russian side to unconditionally agree to this proposal,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said ahead of the talks. 

Putin gave a hardline speech ahead of the call, saying the West would try to undermine Russia even if the sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine were lifted. He also mocked the G7 - a group from which Russia was expelled in 2018 - saying it was too small to ""see on a map"", news agency AFP reported. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Live reporting by Ollie Cooper

Donald Trump has shared an update on his call with Vladimir Putin today. 

""My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one,"" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

""We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an end to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine,"" he added.

It appears the US president would need to get Ukraine to agree to the 30-day halt to energy infrastructure strikes. 

Trump also repeated claims that the war would have never started if he had been president when it began in 2022. 

""Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. 

""That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of humanity, get the job done!""

Away from the reaction to the Trump-Putin call, new photos today show the continuing destruction faced by Ukrainians.

These images show the aftermath of Russian drone strikes in two different parts of Ukraine. 

The first shows the damage to the AES Group private oil refinery after a shock drone attack yesterday in the Kharkiv region.

The AES Group confirmed the destruction of the facility in Merefa after about 20 drones were launched at it.

This picture, from the outskirts of Kyiv, shows the aftermath of another drone attack that saw debris land near a school.

We're getting some reaction through from Ukraine now.

Illia Ponomarenko, a prominent journalist, says the call outlines that the Kremlin is simply ""dragging things out indefinitely"".  

""The Kremlin is essentially sticking to its optimal strategy - dragging things out indefinitely, saying 'no' without actually saying 'no', drowning everything in meaningless demagogy,"" he says.

He claims Putin is ""manipulating Trump"" by ""massaging his ego, tossing him silly trinkets like imaginary 'thousands of Ukrainian soldiers lives spared only thanks to Trump' and hockey games, all while continuing its full-scale war against Ukraine"".

""And as long as Trump keeps indulging in his virtual 'victories' and tiptoeing around Putin, they have no reason to stop.""

One detail that may have slipped through the cracks from the call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is that the US leader suggested that a hockey match between Russia and his country could take place. 

Donald Trump supported Vladimir Putin's idea to organise hockey matches in the US and Russia between Russian and American players playing in the NHL and KHL. 

Kremlin readout of the call

Russia has been banned from most international sports, including the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and more, since its illegal invasion of Ukraine. 

But Trump seems keen to restore relations with the Kremlin, and this is one step that is arguably more significant that it may seem on paper.

Our US correspondent James Matthews says: ""The hockey match will speak to Trump.

""He likes to talk sport, he likes to sell sport - and Americans, many in this country, care more about ice hockey, frankly, than they do about a war they don't think affects them.""

""It looks like an air and sea ceasefire,"" defence analyst Michael Clarke says, responding to the Kremlin and White House readouts of the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin call. 

Under the terms of what appears to be a kind of ""limited ceasefire"", airstrikes on energy infrastructure will halt, and military action in the Black Sea could cease later. 

Clarke notes it's not too dissimilar to a plan outlined by Volodymyr Zelenskyy not long ago - a staged deal that begins with a halt to air warfare. 

While that may signal that Trump could be listening to Kyiv, Clarke says the fact that Zelenskyy was not involved in today's talks speaks volumes.  

""There's an old saying in diplomatic circles: 'If you're not at the table, you're on the menu',"" he says.

""And believe me Ukraine is on the menu.""

By Mark Stone, US correspondent, in Washington DC

The outcome of this call will allow both sides to claim a win.

For President Trump, he can and will claim that he has secured a phased ceasefire - an air and sea ceasefire. 

He will claim, correctly, that he has moved the dial closer to peace (at least in the short term) in this long conflict. 

For President Putin, he has accepted a partial ceasefire - namely that energy and infrastructure facilities will not be targeted - but he can still continue his ground war along the frontline. 

He wants to do this because he believes he has the upper hand and can continue the battlefield conflict to push the frontline as far west as he can.

This is a war all about territory - and Russia wants to have control of as much land as possible before it signs any full ceasefire plan.

In our last post, we brought you the US readout of the call, so now we can bring you the Kremlin's.

Russia's summary of the call is wide-ranging - from prisoners, to suggestions of hockey games between the US and Russia.

The Kremlin response has come in the form of bullet points - here they are in full: 

We've just received a readout of the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin phone call. 

Here are the key lines: 

Ceasefire

""The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,"" the readout says. 

On when/where negotiations will take place

""These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.

""The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts.""

On 'strategic' weapons - an apparent reference to nukes

""They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application.""

On broader US-Russia ties

""The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. 

""This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.""

More from the Kremlin on that Putin-Trump call... 

Vladimir Putin has agreed to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Russian state media is reporting. 

They say that Putin has ordered the military to stop strikes on those targets for 30 days following talks with Donald Trump. 

As per our last post, we've been awaiting a statement from the Kremlin and the White House after Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's phone call.

We are now getting a few lines out of the Kremlin, cited by Russian state media. 

Moscow says that Putin and Trump expressed mutual interest in ""normalising relations"" between the US and Russia, while a prisoner swap between Moscow and Kyiv for 175 prisoners of war (on each side) was also agreed.

Moscow also agreed to hand over 23 gravely wounded Ukrainian soldiers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday to a proposal by US President Donald Trump for Russia and Ukraine to stop hitting each other's energy infrastructure for 30 days and gave a corresponding order to the Russian military, the Kremlin said.

The Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders had a ""detailed and frank exchange of views"" on Ukraine during a phone call in which Putin had said that a resolution of the conflict must be ""comprehensive, sustainable and long-term"", taking into account Russia's own security interests and the root causes of the war.

The two leaders discussed a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine agreed last week. The Kremlin said Putin had raised ""significant points"" about monitoring such a truce and preventing it from being used by Ukraine to mobilise more soldiers and rearm itself.

""It was emphasized that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be a complete cessation of foreign military assistance and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv,"" the Kremlin said.

Donald Trump's rumbling conflict with the judiciary burst into open confrontation on Tuesday as Supreme Court Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke of the US president over his call for the impeachment of a federal court judge.

""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,"" Roberts said in a statement. ""The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.""

Roberts's extraordinary rebuke of the president came shortly after Trump called for the impeachment of a federal judge who ordered the suspension of deportation flights of alleged illegal migrants.

""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

The White House has been critical of federal district courts which have blocked some of the president's executive actions but this was the first time Trump has personally called for a judge's impeachment since he took office in January.

Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for ""high crimes or misdemeanors"" and convicted by the Senate.

Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010.

Shortly after Trump's message, a Republican lawmaker from Texas, Brandon Gill, said on X that articles of impeachment would be introduced in the House ""very soon.""

Trump, the first convicted felon to serve in the White House, has a history of attacking the state and federal judges who presided over his civil and criminal cases.

District Judge James Boasberg ordered a suspension over the weekend to the deportation flights taking alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador where they were put in prison.

The White House invoked little-used, centuries-old wartime legislation known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as legal justification for the move. However, no evidence has been made public to confirm the deportees were gang members or even in the country illegally.

Boasberg held a hearing on Monday on whether the White House had deliberately ignored his orders by carrying out the flights but did not immediately issue a ruling.

Justice Department lawyers told the judge the more than 200 Venezuelan migrants had already left the United States when he issued a written order barring their departure.

Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, also no longer had jurisdiction once the planes had left US airspace, they argued.

'I WON'

The Justice Department had previously filed a motion with an appeals court seeking to have the judge removed from the case saying he was interfering with the president's lawful ""conduct of foreign policy.""

Trump, in his Truth Social post, called Boasberg a ""Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama.""

Trump said the judge ""was not elected President.""

""I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY,"" he said.

Yale-educated Boasberg, 62, was appointed to the DC Superior Court by president George W. Bush, a Republican, and named a district court judge by Obama, a Democrat. 

The White House has repeatedly lashed out following court rulings it disagrees with such as the rejection of Trump's bid to end birthright citizenship.

Trump's bid to amass power in the executive has increasingly raised fears he will openly defy the judiciary, triggering a constitutional crisis.

Roberts, the chief justice, warned of the danger of ignoring court rulings in a year-end letter in December.

""Elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,"" Roberts wrote. ""These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.""

China Encourages Babymaking With Free Milk and Childcare Subsidies

Reuters

Women hold childrens' hands as they wait to cross a street after school in downtown Shanghai, China September 12, 2014.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia, announced a slew of childcare subsidies this month and promised to ""care"" for new mothers by giving them a daily cup of free milk, as local provinces strive to boost the country's flagging population.

More than 20 provincial level administrations across China have started offering childcare subsidies, the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday. Such subsidies have emerged as a key focus for policymakers as they try to encourage young couples to get married and have children.

China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, as marriages plummeted by a fifth, the biggest drop on record.

The country is facing an unprecedented demographic downturn, a result largely of China's one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015, rapid urbanisation and the high cost of raising a family. Couples have been allowed to have as many as three children since 2021.

Earlier this month at the annual meeting of China's parliament, Premier Li Qiang announced childcare subsidies and free preschool education to try and boost the birth rate.

An action plan to boost domestic consumption released on Sunday said that authorities should ""study and establish a childcare subsidy system"".

Hohhot, a bustling northern city surrounded by verdant grasslands, said couples would receive a 10,000 yuan ($1,382.51)one-off payment for their first child, and 10,000 yuan a year for a second baby until the child reached the age of five.

A third child would receive an annual subsidy of 10,000 yuan until they turned 10, a total figure roughly twice the annual income of local residents.

Hohhot also issued what it called the ""One cup of milk fertility care action for mothers"" with a cup of milk available for free each day for any mothers who give birth after March 1.

They will also be entitled to an electronic voucher worth 3,000 yuan from two dairy companies Yili and China Mengniu Dairy.

($1 = 7.2334 yuan)

Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump.

Ukraine's foreign minister on Tuesday urged Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Kyiv and Washington, ahead of a telephone call between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.

""It is time for Russia to show whether it really wants peace. Ukraine supported the US proposal for a temporary ceasefire for 30 days. We expect the Russian side to unconditionally agree to this proposal,"" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said.

More than 400 people killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes, Palestinian officials say

Israeli airstrikes pounded Gaza, killing more than 400 people, Palestinian health authorities said on Tuesday — collapsing a two-month ceasefire with Hamas as Israel vowed to use force to free its remaining hostages in the territory.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of ""repeated refusal to release our hostages"" and rejecting proposals from U.S. President Donald Trump's mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.

""Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,"" his office said in a statement.

Netanyahu's office said he would deliver a statement at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), while Israeli media reported his cabinet would meet at 9 p.m. local time.

After heavy strikes, the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for a number of neighbourhoods in Gaza, according to the statement.

Meanwhile, Hamas accused Israel of overturning the hard-fought ceasefire deal agreed to in January, leaving the fate of 59 hostages still held in Gaza uncertain.

Strikes in Gaza were reported in multiple locations on Tuesday during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Officials from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said many of the dead were children.

Palestinians flee eastern Rafah after Israel issues evacuation orders 

Israel's renewed intense pressure on Hamas came as tensions flared elsewhere in the Middle East, a major supplier of oil to global markets, which has seen the Gaza war spread to Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq.

Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any further attacks on international shipping carried out by the Houthi group, as his administration expanded strikes in Yemen — the biggest U.S. military operation in the region since he returned to the White House.

Strikes were reported in locations including northern Gaza, Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah in central and southern Gaza Strip.

""It was a night of hell. It felt like the first days of the war,"" said Rabiha Jamal, 65, a mother of five from Gaza City.

""We were preparing to have something to eat before starting a new day of fasting when the building shook and explosions began. We thought it was over but war is back,"" she told Reuters via a chat app.

In hospitals strained by 15 months of bombardment, piles of bodies in white plastic sheets could be seen stacked up as casualties were brought in. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 404 people had been killed, many of them children, and 562 people were injured.

The Israel Defence Forces said it hit dozens of targets, and that the strikes would continue for as long as necessary and would extend beyond air strikes, raising the prospect that Israeli ground troops could resume fighting.

The strikes drew swift reaction and condemnation.

The United Nations' Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory urged for the ceasefire in Gaza to be immediately reinstated.

""Waves of airstrikes occurred across the Gaza strip since the early hours of the morning ... This is unconscionable,"" Muhannad Hadi said in a statement.

Russia said on Tuesday that it was concerned by what it called a large number of civilian casualties after Israel struck Gaza and hoped that peace would return.

""Undoubtedly, it's another deterioration in the situation [in Gaza] and another spiral of escalation that is causing our concern,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Egypt said Israel's action violated the ceasefire and marked a dangerous escalation, while Turkey's foreign ministry said Israel's attacks represented a ""new phase in its policy of genocide"" against Palestinians and urged the international community to take a determined stance to ensure a ceasefire is upheld and humanitarian aid is delivered.

The attacks were far wider in scale than the regular series of drone strikes the Israeli military has said it has conducted against individuals or small groups of suspected militants and follows weeks of failed efforts to agree on an extension to the truce, which began on Jan. 19.

Despite the international condemnation, the airstrikes earned Netanyahu a political boost. Former national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who left the government over disagreements about the Gaza ceasefire, is rejoining the coalition after the resumption of Israeli strikes, a statement said, strengthening Netanyahu's government.

Among those killed was senior Hamas official Mohammad Al-Jmasi, a member of the political office, and members of his family, including his grandchildren who were in his house in Gaza City when it was hit by an airstrike on Tuesday, Hamas sources and relatives said. In all, at least five senior Hamas officials were killed along with members of their families.

Some people were brought to overwhelmed hospitals by private cars.

A strike on a home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed 17 members of one family — including at least 12 women and children, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies.

In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the U.S. administration before it carried out the strikes, which the military said targeted mid-level Hamas commanders and leadership officials as well as infrastructure belonging to the militant group.

""Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,"" White House spokesperson Brian Hughes said.

Negotiating teams from Israel and Hamas had been in Doha as mediators from Egypt and Qatar sought to bridge the gap between the two sides following the end of an initial phase in the ceasefire, which saw 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

With the backing of the United States, Israel had been pressing for the return of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a longer-term truce that would have halted fighting until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday in April.

However Hamas had been insisting on moving to negotiations for a permanent end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, in accordance with the terms of the original ceasefire agreement.

Each side has accused the other of failing to respect the terms of the January ceasefire agreement, and there were multiple hiccups during the course of the first phase. But until now, a full return to the fighting had been avoided.

Thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.

The Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave.

President Trump told reporters that he would use his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to save Ukrainian soldiers who are ‘deep in trouble.'WASHINGTON—President Trump's hopes of getting Moscow to agree to a 30-day cease-fire with Ukraine are pinned to a phone call planned for Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is likely to push for territorial and other concessions.

 In Moscow, the Kremlin dampened hopes of any breakthrough. On Monday a top foreign-ministry official said that any peace deal would have to guarantee Ukraine's neutral status and appeared to rule out any European peacekeeping force on Ukrainian soil, a key provision of Kyiv and Western allies of any peace deal.  Other Russian officials have been calling for a deal that addresses what Moscow calls the “root causes” of the conflict, signaling the Kremlin wants to retain key provinces of Ukraine and exert political influence over the rest of the country. With Moscow showing little sign of budging from its initial war aims, Trump's second official phone call with Putin since he was inaugurated is expected to end with some diplomatic niceties and a promise for more talks. After agreeing earlier this month to a cease-fire plan promoted by the U.S., Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the U.S. to exert pressure on Russia to end the war. In a weekly video address he accused Putin of using talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia as a delay tactic and covering up its opposition to a cease-fire. “After the talks in Jeddah and the American proposal for a cease-fire on the front line, Russia stole almost another week—a week of war that only Russia wants,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address Sunday. Moscow's reticence comes despite Trump's warm words toward Putin and broad rhetorical concessions by the Trump administration to Russia as it bargains with Moscow for an end to the war. Over the weekend Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, said that Ukraine would have to surrender “some type of territory” in a peace deal. Asked on Monday about reports that Trump on Tuesday would offer Putin territorial concessions, such as recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes denied the president planned to make any offer. “We have made no such commitments and we will not negotiate this deal through the media,” Hughes said. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who visited Moscow last week, told Face the Nation Sunday that it was “unfortunate” that some European leaders thought that Putin wasn't interested in a peace deal. “I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed,” Witkoff told Face the Nation. Trump's rhetoric, meanwhile, has bent toward the Kremlin's version of events in Ukraine as he pushes for a deal. In an Oval Office meeting with Zelensky last month, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said that he would be using the phone call with Putin to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers who are “deep in trouble,” apparently referring to a disputed report promoted by Moscow that Ukrainian forces have been surrounded by a Russian counteroffensive in Kursk and are on the cusp of being massacred. “I believe if it wasn't for me they would be—they wouldn't be here any longer,” Trump said of the Ukrainians. Kyiv has announced in recent days that Ukrainian troops withdrew from most of Kursk province in Russia, which Ukraine had hoped would serve as a bargaining chip in talks after seizing dozens of towns and villages there in August. Ukrainian officials have acknowledged a retreat there but repeatedly denied claims by Trump and Putin of a large-scale encirclement of troops. John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who is now a senior director at the Atlantic Council think tank, said that the Kremlin's talks with Trump and Witkoff stand little chance of reaching a peace deal soon, but they do serve Moscow's interest in persuading them that Kyiv, not Moscow, is to blame for the conflict. Herbst noted that Witkoff, Trump's envoy, has spent eight hours in meetings with Putin in recent trips. He said Putin will now spend time on the phone with Trump as part of a delaying tactic. “He has wisely praised Trump's cease-fire plans, but says he has problems with the nuances,” he said. “He wants to drag things out.” Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News Radio: “I don't think there's been movement to our satisfaction from anybody yet. I think what we have seen is that we're closer—we're not close to peace. I mean, I think there's a lot to be worked on, but we're closer than we were two weeks ago or closer than we were six months ago.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there are still no plans for a meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders that would signal a wider deal in the offing. Though Trump has mentioned the possibility of a meeting, Peskov said there are no dates, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. “There are not even any plans yet.” In an interview with Russia's Izvestia newspaper published Monday, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, signaled that Moscow's aims, including a retreat of NATO from Russia's borders, haven't changed since 2021, shortly before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Grushko noted that as of today, “the conflict has reached a phase where the West is strategically defeated.” Write to Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com

Kennedy Assassination","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lot-of-stuff-us-president-donald-trump-to-share-80-000-pages-on-john-f-kennedy-assassination-7951338","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:37:02 GMT","

US President Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump plans to release about 80,000 pages of material related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday, seeking to honor his campaign promise to provide more transparency about the shock event in Texas.

""It's a lot of stuff, and you'll make your own determination,"" Trump told reporters about the pages on Monday.

Trump signed an order shortly after taking office in January related to the release, prompting the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to find thousands of new documents related to the Kennedy assassination in Dallas.

Kennedy's murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald. The Justice Department and other federal government bodies reaffirmed that conclusion in the intervening decades. But polls show many Americans believe his death was a result of a conspiracy.

Experts doubt the new trove of information will change the underlying facts of the case, that Lee Harvey Oswald opened fire at Kennedy from a window at a school book deposit warehouse as the presidential motorcade passed by on a Dallas highway.



""People expecting big things are almost certain to be disappointed,"" said Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, who authored a book about the assassination.

He said some of the pages could simply be the release of previously published material that had a few words redacted.

Trump has also promised to release documents on the assassinations of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were killed in 1968.

Trump has allowed more time to come up with a plan for those releases.

Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of John F. Kennedy, has said he believes the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in his uncle's death, an allegation the agency has described as baseless.

Kennedy Jr. has also said he believes his father was killed by multiple gunmen, an assertion that contradicted official accounts.

One revelation the documents could contain is that the CIA was more aware of Oswald than it has previously disclosed. Questions have remained about what the CIA knew about Oswald's visits to Mexico City six weeks before the assassination. During that trip, Oswald visited the Soviet embassy.

""People have been waiting for decades for this,"" Trump said. ""It's going to be very interesting.""

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken today for at least 90 minutes. Russia has agreed to a partial ceasefire on targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure as a result, for a period of 30 days. Follow the latest here.

Live reporting by Ollie Cooper

Donald Trump has shared an update on his call with Vladimir Putin today. 

""My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one,"" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

""We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an end to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine,"" he added.

It appears the US president would need to get Ukraine to agree to the 30-day halt to energy infrastructure strikes. 

Trump also repeated claims that the war would have never started if he had been president when it began in 2022. 

""Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. 

""That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of humanity, get the job done!""

Away from the reaction to the Trump-Putin call, new photos today show the continuing destruction faced by Ukrainians.

These images show the aftermath of Russian drone strikes in two different parts of Ukraine. 

The first shows the damage to the AES Group private oil refinery after a shock drone attack yesterday in the Kharkiv region.

The AES Group confirmed the destruction of the facility in Merefa after about 20 drones were launched at it.

This picture, from the outskirts of Kyiv, shows the aftermath of another drone attack that saw debris land near a school.

We're getting some reaction through from Ukraine now.

Illia Ponomarenko, a prominent journalist, says the call outlines that the Kremlin is simply ""dragging things out indefinitely"".  

""The Kremlin is essentially sticking to its optimal strategy - dragging things out indefinitely, saying 'no' without actually saying 'no', drowning everything in meaningless demagogy,"" he says.

He claims Putin is ""manipulating Trump"" by ""massaging his ego, tossing him silly trinkets like imaginary 'thousands of Ukrainian soldiers lives spared only thanks to Trump' and hockey games, all while continuing its full-scale war against Ukraine"".

""And as long as Trump keeps indulging in his virtual 'victories' and tiptoeing around Putin, they have no reason to stop.""

One detail that may have slipped through the cracks from the call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is that the US leader suggested that a hockey match between Russia and his country could take place. 

Donald Trump supported Vladimir Putin's idea to organise hockey matches in the US and Russia between Russian and American players playing in the NHL and KHL. 

Kremlin readout of the call

Russia has been banned from most international sports, including the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and more, since its illegal invasion of Ukraine. 

But Trump seems keen to restore relations with the Kremlin, and this is one step that is arguably more significant that it may seem on paper.

Our US correspondent James Matthews says: ""The hockey match will speak to Trump.

""He likes to talk sport, he likes to sell sport - and Americans, many in this country, care more about ice hockey, frankly, than they do about a war they don't think affects them.""

""It looks like an air and sea ceasefire,"" defence analyst Michael Clarke says, responding to the Kremlin and White House readouts of the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin call. 

Under the terms of what appears to be a kind of ""limited ceasefire"", airstrikes on energy infrastructure will halt, and military action in the Black Sea could cease later. 

Clarke notes it's not too dissimilar to a plan outlined by Volodymyr Zelenskyy not long ago - a staged deal that begins with a halt to air warfare. 

While that may signal that Trump could be listening to Kyiv, Clarke says the fact that Zelenskyy was not involved in today's talks speaks volumes.  

""There's an old saying in diplomatic circles: 'If you're not at the table, you're on the menu',"" he says.

""And believe me Ukraine is on the menu.""

By Mark Stone, US correspondent, in Washington DC

The outcome of this call will allow both sides to claim a win.

For President Trump, he can and will claim that he has secured a phased ceasefire - an air and sea ceasefire. 

He will claim, correctly, that he has moved the dial closer to peace (at least in the short term) in this long conflict. 

For President Putin, he has accepted a partial ceasefire - namely that energy and infrastructure facilities will not be targeted - but he can still continue his ground war along the frontline. 

He wants to do this because he believes he has the upper hand and can continue the battlefield conflict to push the frontline as far west as he can.

This is a war all about territory - and Russia wants to have control of as much land as possible before it signs any full ceasefire plan.

In our last post, we brought you the US readout of the call, so now we can bring you the Kremlin's.

Russia's summary of the call is wide-ranging - from prisoners, to suggestions of hockey games between the US and Russia.

The Kremlin response has come in the form of bullet points - here they are in full: 

We've just received a readout of the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin phone call. 

Here are the key lines: 

Ceasefire

""The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,"" the readout says. 

On when/where negotiations will take place

""These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.

""The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts.""

On 'strategic' weapons - an apparent reference to nukes

""They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application.""

On broader US-Russia ties

""The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. 

""This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.""

More from the Kremlin on that Putin-Trump call... 

Vladimir Putin has agreed to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Russian state media is reporting. 

They say that Putin has ordered the military to stop strikes on those targets for 30 days following talks with Donald Trump. 

As per our last post, we've been awaiting a statement from the Kremlin and the White House after Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's phone call.

We are now getting a few lines out of the Kremlin, cited by Russian state media. 

Moscow says that Putin and Trump expressed mutual interest in ""normalising relations"" between the US and Russia, while a prisoner swap between Moscow and Kyiv for 175 prisoners of war (on each side) was also agreed.

Moscow also agreed to hand over 23 gravely wounded Ukrainian soldiers.

Artificial intelligence is turbocharging organised crime, from creating child sexual abuse images to money laundering via cryptocurrency, Europol warned Tuesday, with advances like quantum computing only poised to make things worse.

In a report laying out the threats posed by organised crime, the European police organisation said criminals had seized on the opportunities offered by AI as a ""catalyst"" to accelerate their activities.

""Rapid technological advancements -- especially in artificial intelligence (AI) -- are reshaping how crime is organised, executed, and concealed,"" Europol said in a detailed 80-page ""threat assessment"" report.

""These shifts are making organised crime more dangerous, posing an unprecedented challenge to security across the EU and its member states,"" the police added.

The use of AI and other technologies are helping criminals across the whole of their portfolio -- from drug and human trafficking, to cybercrime and identity theft.

Generative AI enables criminal gangs to hit their targets more globally across multiple languages and even generate child sexual abuse images, the police report warned.

""Explicit pictures of adults can be manipulated to make the individual look younger or applications can 'nudify' non-explicit images,"" the report said.

""The very qualities that make AI revolutionary -- accessibility, versatility, and sophistication -- have made it an attractive tool for criminals,"" noted Europol.

'AI-controlled criminals'

Technology is also making it harder for authorities to recover ill-gotten gains.

Confiscation of proceeds from crime has stagnated at around two percent, the police said, with the challenge ""further exacerbated by the increasing criminal exploitation of digital assets.""

Criminal groups are using cryptocurrency to launder money and move funds around, making it hard to track and eventually confiscate.

""The criminal exploitation of cryptocurrency as a payment method now has moved beyond the scope of cybercrime, and is encountered increasingly in more traditional crime areas such as drug trafficking or migrant smuggling.""

As technology improves, the boost to criminal activity is only likely to increase, according to Europol, noting the rapid developments in quantum computing, the metaverse, 6G, unmanned systems and brain-computer interfaces.

""The high levels of anonymity, speed, and sophistication currently demonstrated by criminal networks will only likely increase over the coming years,"" cautioned the report.

Quantum computing in particular will enable criminals to crack current encryption technology with ease.

Finally, the police raised the dystopian prospect of criminal gangs run entirely by AI.

""The emergence of fully autonomous AI could pave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks, marking a new era in organised crime,"" said the report.

A newborn in Taiwan lost three toes due to severe burns after her mother fell asleep with the hair dryer on. The woman, whose last name is Wu, used the appliance to dry her newborn daughter's wet bed.

The baby was exposed to hot air for three hours, burning 15.5 per cent of her body, including the infant's legs, necessitating the amputation of three toes.

The tragic incident occurred in Taipei on September 16, 2023.

Ms Wu slept with the hair dryer still running after she felt drowsy from a medicine she took at the time, South China Morning Post reported.

She woke up at 4 pm to find her daughter's legs scorched, prompting her to call emergency medical services immediately and go to the hospital.

Despite treatment, doctors determined that the burns covered 15.5 per cent of the baby's body, causing irreversible tissue damage. The medical team was left with no other option but to amputate the baby's middle, ring, and little toes on the left foot.

Following consultation with the hospital, the prosecutor admitted that, given the state of healthcare available today, the daughter's ability to walk would be affected by the toe amputation, but that the damage was not catastrophic.

On Monday, March 10, Ms Wu received a fine of NT$150,000 (almost Rs 4 lakh) and a term of five months in prison for negligent injury.

Ms Wu revealed to the court that she suffered severe postpartum depression and frequently dozed off after taking her medication. She claimed she did not expect any harm from the hair dryer and had set it at a low setting.

Ms Wu thought the heat could be controlled and didn't think the hairdryer could cause such severe burns, especially because she had already moved her daughter away from it.

However, the judge highlighted that Ms Wu, being the primary carer, ought to have given careful attention to the possibility that her infant would unintentionally change positions by rolling over or kicking.

The judge ruled the mother was negligent since she did not take preventative measures despite knowing that extended exposure to hot air could result in burns.

The court determined that Ms Wu should have had the basic common sense to avert such a disaster after evaluating her educational background, life experiences, and cognitive abilities.

Postpartum psychology is becoming a significant social issue in Taiwan. The yearly budget for postpartum psychological therapy from 2022 to 2024 is less than NT$100,000 (about Rs 2.59 lakh).

The rate of postpartum depression among Taiwanese women has increased to 20 per cent, per the Economic Daily News.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The administration of President Donald Trump was consulted on Monday by Israel on its deadly strikes in Gaza, a White House spokesperson told Fox News' ""Hannity"" show.

""The Trump administration and the White House were consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza tonight,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Fox News interview.

Palestinian medics in Gaza reported dozens of people were killed in the aftermath of a series of the most violent air attacks by Israel on the Palestinian enclave since a ceasefire was reached on January 19 between Israel and Hamas militants.

A senior Hamas official said Israel had unilaterally overturned the ceasefire agreement.

""As President Trump has made it clear - Hamas, the Houthis, Iran, all those who seek to terrorize not just Israel, but also the United States of America, will see a price to pay. All hell will break loose,"" the White House spokesperson said.

Trump had previously publicly warned using similar words, saying that Hamas should release all hostages in Gaza or ""let hell break out.""

The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli allies.



Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also triggering accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. The assault has internally displaced nearly Gaza's entire 2.3 million population and caused a hunger crisis.

Washington separately launched a new wave of airstrikes on Saturday in Yemen in which it said dozens of members of the Houthi movement were left dead. The Houthis said at least 53 people were killed. Reuters could not independently verify those casualty numbers.

The Houthis had launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping from November 2023, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.

Real-life spies say their world is nothing like that of James Bond, but in one way truth may soon follow fiction: MI6 could be about to get its first woman leader.

Britain's foreign intelligence agency launched a search for its next chief on Tuesday, and the current officeholder has suggested he'd like his replacement to be a woman. Although Judi Dench played M, the fictional head of MI6, in seven Bond thrillers starting in the 1990s, the real-life agency has not had a woman chief in its 116-year history.

Richard Moore, the current C — as the real-life MI6 chief is known — wrote on X in 2023 that he would “help forge women's equality by working to ensure I'm the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.”

Britain's two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world's glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller between 2002 and 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.

Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fits the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to shed its image as the least diverse of the agencies, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional “tap on the shoulder” at an elite university.

The agency's website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting “talented people from all backgrounds.”

In 2021, Moore apologized on behalf of MI6 for its treatment of LGBT staff and aspiring agents who were fired or denied jobs because of their sexuality. Gay people were barred from working for the agency until 1991.

Moore said in a 2023 speech that he wanted MI6 to “better represent the country we serve.”

“Diversity brings greater creativity, better problem-solving,” he said.

In posts on X last week to mark International Women's Day, Moore said: “No one gets a job in MI6 except on merit. But we men, as allies, can help our female colleagues achieve the success their talent deserves. We have yet to have a woman as Chief so there's still a glass ceiling to shatter.”

Moore, appointed in 2020, has led MI6 through the COVID pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. He has opened the secretive agency ever-so-slightly to media scrutiny, making public speeches and embracing social media.

Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing Moore's replacement takes place out of public view. It began with the country's top civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Chris Wormald, writing to government departments on Tuesday asking them to put forward candidates.

Applicants may come from among three MI6 directors-general who report to Moore, all of whom are women. That includes the agency's head of operations and its technology chief – the real-life equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.

Applicants also could come from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.

An announcement of the choice is likely in the summer, with the new chief taking up their post in the fall.

The injustice done by the West at the UN over Kashmir was highlighted at The Raisina Dialogue - a global multilateral conference held in New Delhi each year. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar did not mince his words as he showed how the United Nations had faltered in its understanding and approach to the issue.

Mr Jaishankar noted that the ""longest-standing"" illegal occupation of a territory globally after World War II has been experienced by India - in Kashmir. The enitre state of Jammu and Kashmir, which includes Gilgit and Baltistan, called Northern Areas before 1970, had acceded to India in 1947. Pakistan, in a unilateral act of aggression, invaded Jammu and Kashmir and has been illegally occupying parts of the Indian Union since then.



Speaking about Kashmir at the forum today, Mr Jaishankar highlighted the selective approach and application of global rules on issues pertaining to sovereignty and territorial integrity.

As he raised concerns over historical injustices in dealing with certain issues, he batted for establishing a ""reformed, strong, and fair"" United Nations. Explaining how the UN had greatly erred in not condemning Pakistan's illegal occupation of parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Jaishankar said that the ""attacker"" (Pakistan) and the ""victim"" (India) were clubbed under the same bracket.

""We all speak of sovereignty and territorial integrity. All of us agree that it is a vital principle. It's the bedrock of global rules. After the Second World War, the longest standing illegal, I would say presence, occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India, what we saw in Kashmir,"" he said.

""Now we went to the UN, but what was an invasion was made into a dispute. So the attacker and the victim were put on par. Who were the culpable parties? UK, Canada, Belgium, Australia, USA. So, pardon me, but I have some question marks on that one,"" the minister said.

Backing a reformed and strong UN, Mr Jaishankar said global norms and rules must be applied uniformly. ""We need a strong UN but a strong UN requires a fair UN,"" he asserted.

""A strong global order must have some basic consistency of standards,"" he said, calling for a new and reformed world order. ""Look, I think we do need an international order just like we need a domestic order. Just like you need a society in a country, you need an international version of that and its not just big countries who will benefit if there is no order. I would argue that any country which would take risk, which would have an extreme positions, which would test the system will actually use the disorder to its advantage. I mean we have seen in our own neighbourhood. You don't have to a big country to be a risky country. I have smaller neighbours who have done a pretty good job. So, first of all, we should all understand the importance of an order.""

Citing another example without naming Pakistan and how the West has been selective in its outlook, Mr Jaishankar said ""We (India) have military rule to our east - in Myanmar. They are no-no. But we have them even more to the west. You know where? They seem to be okay (to the West). I think it's important to audit the working of the world for the last eight decades and be honest about it and to understand today that the balances, the share holdings in the world have changed. We need a different conversation. We need frankly in that sense a different order.""

The minister made these remarks at the session on 'Thrones and Thorns: Defending the Integrity of Nations' at The Raisina Dialogue today.

 By Alasdair Pal and Christine Chen 

 SYDNEY, - Australia Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Tuesday she had raised with China concerns over anonymous letters sent to Australians offering a reward for information on the whereabouts of an Australian-based Hong Kong dissident. 

 Some residents in Melbourne received the letters late last week offering HKD$1 million for information about Kevin Yam, an Australian citizen and Hong Kong pro-democracy activist wanted by Hong Kong authorities for his role in organising anti-government protests in 2019. 

 ""The Australian government does not accept other governments interfering with our citizens, making anybody feel unsafe,"" Wong told a news conference on Tuesday. 

 Local media reported that the letters were mailed from Hong Kong and contained contact details for the Hong Kong police. 

 However, it was not clear who sent the letters, and there was no evidence that Beijing or Hong Kong were involved, said Wong, but added she had raised the issue with both. 

 ""I'll await whatever investigations come to light but I have made my view about Australians being targeted by the Hong Kong authorities very clear to both Hong Kong and to China,"" she said, when asked if she believed the governments of Hong Kong or China were involved in the letters. 

 Spokespeople for China's embassy in Canberra and the Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

 Yam returned to Australia in 2022 after two decades in Hong Kong, after the territory cracked down on pro-democracy protests that brought the financial centre to a standstill in 2019 and 2020. 

 He is one of eight foreign-based activists wanted by Hong Kong for their role in organising the protests against new laws that granted the Hong Kong government wide-ranging extrajudicial powers. 

 ""I will continue to live my everyday life,"" Yam said in a post on X in response to the letters. 

 ""I will not voluntarily return to Hong Kong before it is free.""

Russia's air defence units destroyed 46 Ukrainian drones overnight, its defence ministry said on Tuesday, the bulk of them over the Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine.

On the Telegram messaging app, the Russian defence ministry said 41 drones were downed over the Belgorod region, and the rest over the territories of the Bryansk, Kursk and Oryol region.

One person was injured in the overnight attack and several houses were damaged, Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram.

Alexander Bogomaz, the governor of the Bryansk region, which also borders Ukraine, said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damages from the attack.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine about the attack.

Kyiv has often said its strikes inside Russia aim to destroy infrastructure key to Moscow's war efforts and are in response to Russia's relentless bombing of Ukraine since the start of the war three years ago.

Three earthquakes struck Indonesia on Tuesday, with a 5.5-magnitude tremor hitting North Sumatra province in the morning, and two earlier quakes in Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara, the country's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency reported.

The 5.5-magnitude quake struck North Sumatra province at 5:22 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The epicenter was located 17 km southeast of North Tapanuli Regency at a depth of 10 km.

""One person was killed, and another was injured. Several houses and a road were severely damaged and the road is now impassable for transport,"" head of the emergency, equipment, and logistics unit of North Sumatra Provincial Disaster Management Agency Sri Wahyuni Pancasilawati told Xinhua. She added that risk assessments were underway.

Earlier, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Maluku province at 00:32 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The agency initially recorded its magnitude at 6.0 before revising it downward, Xinhua news agency reported.

Ten minutes later, a 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck East Nusa Tenggara province.

No tsunami alert was issued following the three earthquakes, as the tremors were not expected to generate large waves.

Indonesia, an archipelagic country with 127 active volcanoes, frequently experiences earthquakes due to its location within the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.

Some of these earthquakes are very large, such as the magnitude 9.1 quake off the west coast of Sumatra that generated the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This earthquake occurred along the Java-Sumatra subduction zone, where the Australian tectonic plate moves underneath Indonesia's Sunda plate.

But to the east of Java, the subduction zone has become “jammed” by the Australian continental crust, which is much thicker and more buoyant than the oceanic crust that moves beneath Java and Sumatra.

Due to the large number of shallow earthquakes along the plate boundaries, Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to tsunamis. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 165,000 people along the coast of Sumatra, and in 2006 over 600 people were killed by a tsunami impacting the south coast of Java.

Google on Tuesday announced health-care updates to Search, including a way for people with specific health conditions to compare their experiences with others.

The company unveiled a new feature called ""What People Suggest,"" which uses AI to pull together online commentary from patients with similar diagnoses. A patient with arthritis would be able to look up how other people with the condition approach exercise, for instance. The feature is available on mobile devices in the U.S., Google said.

Google said it has also expanded its knowledge panels, or the information boxes that appear to the right of search results, to cover ""thousands"" more health topics. The panels are coming to new countries and languages, including Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese, starting on mobile devices.

The tech giant has launched several health-care projects and features over the years, but it has struggled to outline a consistent business strategy within the sector. The company built out a formal Google Health unit starting around 2018, which swelled to more than 500 employees, but it was dissolved in 2021.

Dr. Karen DeSalvo, Google's chief health officer, told CNBC months later that the company was ""still all-in on health.""

In recent years, many of Google's health-care initiatives have centered around AI.

""With extraordinary advances in AI, we have an opportunity to reimagine the entire health experience,"" DeSalvo said during an event in New York City on Tuesday.

Google introduced artificial intelligence summaries called AI Overviews last year, and the feature shows a quick summary of answers to search questions at the very top of Search. The rollout was rocky, as users were quick to share examples AI tool giving incorrect and controversial responses, like encouraging users to add glue to pizza.

AI Overviews appear for some health-related queries, like ""How do I know if I have the flu?"" But some experts have encouraged users to use caution with these answers, according to a December report from The Senior List. Out of more than 200 health searches, a panel of medical experts said 70% Google's AI Overviews were considered risky.

Google said Tuesday that recent health-focused advancements with its Gemini models have allowed the company to improve AI Overviews for health topics.

In late 2023, Google announced MedLM, a suite of AI models designed specifically for health-care, to help clinicians and researchers carry out complex studies, summarize doctor-patient interactions and complete other tasks.

The company also unveiled Vertex AI Search for Healthcare that year, which organizations can use to build applications that help clinicians or patients quickly surface information from different data sources.

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly transitioning from a futuristic concept to a tangible force reshaping the healthcare landscape. 

Buoyed by early successes, healthcare firms are aggressively increasing their investments in GenAI, particularly in areas like product innovation and customer service, signaling a shift in how the industry operates. 

A report from PYMNTS Intelligence, “Healthcare Firms Going Long on GenAI Investment,” reveals that these bets are already yielding significant returns, prompting a wave of further adoption among major players.

The report surveyed C-suite executives at healthcare firms with at least $1 billion in annual revenue to understand their GenAI strategies. 

The findings indicate a strong conviction in the technology's potential, with nine in 10 executives anticipating a positive return on their GenAI investments. Consequently, a majority of these leaders plan to further escalate their GenAI spending in the coming year, placing healthcare ahead of the cross-industry average in its bullish outlook. 

The report highlights the strategic prioritization of GenAI in crucial operational areas as businesses strive to stay competitive.

Key data points underscore this accelerating trend:

Beyond these core areas, the report also noted that a significant portion of healthcare firms are leveraging the technology for data visualization and reports (55%), search and access to information (55%), and workflow automation management (51%). 

Interestingly, the adoption of GenAI in high-stakes areas such as fraud detection and cybersecurity management remains relatively low, suggesting a cautious approach to these critical functions, at least in the short term. On average, healthcare executives expect GenAI to be fully embedded across their businesses within 7.4 years, aligning with cross-industry expectations.

					Connecticut News from your locally owned & operated news source at the state Capitol since 2005.				

NEW HAVEN, CT – With Medicaid facing unprecedented cuts at the federal level, Connecticut is on the verge of a healthcare crisis that could devastate families, strain hospitals, and upend community health centers already struggling to stay afloat, officials said Monday.





Lawmakers, healthcare administrators, and advocates gathered Monday at Fair Haven Community Health Care for a roundtable discussion to address the potential consequences of these budget reductions, stress the urgency of action, and dispel widespread misconceptions about the program.





“Medicaid is often thought of as a program for people who don't work, but that's simply not true,” said Tiffany Donelson, CEO of the Connecticut Health Foundation. “Sixty-six percent of Medicaid recipients are employed. They're childcare workers, grocery store clerks, and home health aides. When we cut Medicaid, we are cutting the foundation that supports the workforce Connecticut depends on.”


Far from being a program that affects only the most economically disadvantaged, Medicaid serves 1.2 million Connecticut residents – a third of the state's population – including low-income families, people with disabilities, seniors in nursing homes, and even middle-class individuals who lack employer-sponsored insurance.





“There is not a single district in Connecticut without Medicaid recipients,” Donelson continued. “Even in our wealthiest towns, people depend on this program. Yet we are watching a situation unfold that could dismantle that support overnight.”





Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon said that Medicaid is woven into the financial structure of the state's healthcare system.


“Every hospital in Connecticut could not operate as it does without Medicaid,” he said. “Our nursing homes, our intermediate care facilities, all depend on it. If these cuts go through, it will devastate our healthcare infrastructure.”





Connecticut's Medicaid system had been facing challenges long before federal cuts were proposed. Health centers, which provide care for more than 440,000 low-income residents, have already resorted to depleting cash reserves and freezing hiring just to remain operational. Last week, Connecticut's Federally Qualified Health Centers filed a Declaratory Ruling Request with the Department of Social Services, arguing that the agency has failed to comply with both state and federal laws requiring reimbursement rates to reflect actual costs.





Sean Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, addressed the strain that health centers have been under. 


“We are already being forced to cut back on services due to underfunding,” Frick said. “If Medicaid funding is reduced even further, it will devastate healthcare access for the most vulnerable in our state.”





State leaders, including Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, discussed the fiscal constraints Connecticut is already facing. “We're already at our spending cap,” Looney said. “Even a small cut in federal Medicaid reimbursement could throw our state budget into chaos.”





The effects of Medicaid cuts will be widespread, with hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers uncertain about the future. Many Connecticut nursing homes depend on Medicaid funding, and further reductions could force closures, leaving thousands of elderly and disabled residents without care.


“We've already lost nursing homes due to financial pressures,” said Matt Barrett, president of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities. “If these cuts take effect, more will follow.”





Hospitals are also warning that reduced Medicaid reimbursements will push more patients into emergency rooms, further straining a system already struggling with staffing shortages and financial uncertainty.





The lessons learned about preventative health care from the COVID-19 pandemic were still fresh in many healthcare providers' minds as they expressed fear that Medicaid cuts will lead to worsening health outcomes for those who rely on the program.


“When people lose access to primary care, they don't disappear,” said Dr. Suzanne Lagarde, CEO of Fair Haven Community Health Care. “They show up in the emergency room, where hospitals are legally required to treat them. But ERs aren't designed for routine care. That means sicker patients, higher costs, and an overwhelmed healthcare system.”





“Medicaid pays for two in five births,” said US Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. “What happens before and after birth determines the trajectory of a person's health for life. If we start cutting these services, we're setting up entire generations for worse outcomes.”





DeLauro has been one of the most vocal opponents of the federal cuts, warning that the reductions wouldn't just hurt Connecticut but would create ripple effects across the country.


“This isn't a blue-state issue or a red-state issue – this is an American issue,” she said. “Speaker Mike Johnson himself represents a district where nearly half of his constituents rely on Medicaid. Yet here we are, fighting to protect a program that keeps people alive.”





Despite the looming threat, advocates and healthcare providers refuse to back down.





“We are releasing a story every week from a Medicaid recipient,” Donelson said. “We want Connecticut residents to see their neighbors, to understand why this matters. These are real people – not statistics, not abstract figures, but parents, children, workers, and seniors who rely on Medicaid to survive.”





DeLauro ended the roundtable with a warning: “This is not a policy debate. This is about whether people live or die. Every member of Congress who votes for these cuts should look into the eyes of the people they are hurting and explain why their healthcare isn't worth saving.”

The lessons learned about preventative health care from the COVID-19 pandemic were still fresh in many healthcare providers' minds as they expressed fear that Medicaid cuts will lead to worsening health outcomes for those who rely on the program.


“When people lose access to primary care, they don't disappear,” said Dr. Suzanne Lagarde, CEO of Fair Haven Community Health Care. “They show up in the emergency room, where hospitals are legally required to treat them. But ERs aren't designed for routine care. That means sicker patients, higher costs, and an overwhelmed healthcare system.”





“Medicaid pays for two in five births,” said US Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. “What happens before and after birth determines the trajectory of a person's health for life. If we start cutting these services, we're setting up entire generations for worse outcomes.”





DeLauro has been one of the most vocal opponents of the federal cuts, warning that the reductions wouldn't just hurt Connecticut but would create ripple effects across the country.


“This isn't a blue-state issue or a red-state issue – this is an American issue,” she said. “Speaker Mike Johnson himself represents a district where nearly half of his constituents rely on Medicaid. Yet here we are, fighting to protect a program that keeps people alive.”





Despite the looming threat, advocates and healthcare providers refuse to back down.





“We are releasing a story every week from a Medicaid recipient,” Donelson said. “We want Connecticut residents to see their neighbors, to understand why this matters. These are real people – not statistics, not abstract figures, but parents, children, workers, and seniors who rely on Medicaid to survive.”





DeLauro ended the roundtable with a warning: “This is not a policy debate. This is about whether people live or die. Every member of Congress who votes for these cuts should look into the eyes of the people they are hurting and explain why their healthcare isn't worth saving.”








Connecticut's Medicaid system had been facing challenges long before federal cuts were proposed. Health centers, which provide care for more than 440,000 low-income residents, have already resorted to depleting cash reserves and freezing hiring just to remain operational. Last week, Connecticut's Federally Qualified Health Centers filed a Declaratory Ruling Request with the Department of Social Services, arguing that the agency has failed to comply with both state and federal laws requiring reimbursement rates to reflect actual costs.





Sean Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, addressed the strain that health centers have been under. 


“We are already being forced to cut back on services due to underfunding,” Frick said. “If Medicaid funding is reduced even further, it will devastate healthcare access for the most vulnerable in our state.”





State leaders, including Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, discussed the fiscal constraints Connecticut is already facing. “We're already at our spending cap,” Looney said. “Even a small cut in federal Medicaid reimbursement could throw our state budget into chaos.”





The effects of Medicaid cuts will be widespread, with hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers uncertain about the future. Many Connecticut nursing homes depend on Medicaid funding, and further reductions could force closures, leaving thousands of elderly and disabled residents without care.


“We've already lost nursing homes due to financial pressures,” said Matt Barrett, president of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities. “If these cuts take effect, more will follow.”

Delaware's congressional delegation and health care leaders are sounding the alarm over proposed Medicaid funding cuts, warning of severe consequences for thousands of residents and the state's community health centers.

At a press conference Monday morning, Sen. Chris Coons, Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester and Rep. Sarah McBride joined health care professionals and Medicaid recipients to denounce House Republicans' budget resolution, which aims to slash Medicaid spending to fund tax cuts and increased defense and border security allocations. The proposed cuts could strip Delaware of an estimated $200 million in Medicaid funding, threatening access to care for more than 300,000 residents — nearly one in four people in the state.

Medicaid is integral to Delaware's health care system, providing access to essential services such as doctor visits, hospital care and prescription medications for thousands of residents. Delaware's four federally qualified community health centers would face significant operational challenges if the cuts take effect.

While many patients rely on Medicaid, these centers provide care to both insured and uninsured individuals on a sliding scale.

These centers include:

During the news briefing, representatives from several community health centers discussed the impact the proposed cuts would have on their organizations and patients. Chief Operating Officer Rosa Rivera of La Red Health Center expressed concern about patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

""Without Medicaid, they would likely put off care and medications they need,"" Rivera said.

Chris Fraser, president and CEO of Westside Family Healthcare, cautioned that reduced funding would force more Delawareans to delay care, worsening health outcomes and increasing costs across the system. ""Without this funding, more Delawareans would not be able to afford health care,"" Fraser said, stressing delayed care, worsened outcomes and an added financial strain on the health care system would result.

The Delaware Healthcare Association projects dire consequences if the cuts are enacted. According to Brian Frazee, president and CEO of the organization, Delaware could see ""a 40% change in Medicaid enrollment,"" while the uninsured rate could surge by more than 50% if Medicaid expansion is eliminated.

The providers warned that if the cuts proceed, the ripple effects would extend far beyond Medicaid recipients, potentially destabilizing the entire state healthcare system and leading to increased costs for all Delaware residents.

The financial fallout from Medicaid cuts would extend beyond individual patients. A report from the Urban Institute estimates significant nationwide impacts if Congress reduces federal support for state Medicaid programs. The study projects an $80 billion decrease in health care service spending by 2026, with hospitals facing revenue losses of approximately $31.9 billion.

Hospitals and health care providers could see an increase in uncompensated care costs by nearly $19 billion nationwide.

For Delaware, this could mean:

The proposed cuts would impact coverage for pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, seniors and lower-income adults.

""I can think of nothing worse than to advocate slashing Medicaid funding to pay for tax cuts for billionaires,"" said Sen. Chris Coons at the press conference.

Delaware's congressional delegation stressed that stopping these cuts would require bipartisan opposition.

Coons noted that while Democrats alone cannot block the legislation, public pressure on Republican lawmakers could prove crucial in preventing the cuts from advancing.

Blunt Rochester, who serves on the Senate committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, became emotional while addressing the implications of the proposed cuts. Drawing from her experience as Delaware's former deputy secretary of Health and Social Services, she emphasized the importance of public involvement in opposing the cuts.

""The power of the people is always greater than the people in power,"" Blunt Rochester said, urging constituents to contact their congressional representatives.

							By D. Taylor and Katy Johnson 

March 18, 2025


							Taylor is the current chair of Unite Here Health. Johnson is president of the American Benefits Council.						

As the new Congress and administration are settling in, all eyes in Washington are focused on the trillion-dollar question: whether and how to pay for the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law in President Trump's first term.

Among the various revenue-generating proposals emerging from GOP circles — including some of the president's most trusted advisers — is one that would increase taxes on American workers with employer-provided health care coverage. How to pay for the forthcoming tax bill is a valid debate, but one thing is certain: Burdening hardworking Americans with new taxes on something as fundamental as health care coverage is not the solution voters are looking for.

advertisement

We have seen proposals and recommendations from the Paragon Health Institute, Heritage Foundation, Republican Study Committee, and the Cato Institute — all of which boast close ties to President Trump — to tax employer-provided health care coverage.  The Bipartisan Policy Center also specifically highlighted a tax on employer-provided health care as an option to pay for extending the TCJA. Given how many identical proposals have surfaced from these conservative and bipartisan thought leaders, coupled with a need for federal revenue, employers and unions alike are understandably concerned workers' benefits could be taxed.

Employer-provided health care coverage is a cornerstone of American employment. More than 178 million Americans have employer-provided health care coverage. That's more people than Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchange marketplaces, TRICARE, and Veterans Affairs health care benefits combined.

Since their inception, these benefits have been “excluded” from income, meaning employees are not taxed on the cost employers pay for their health care coverage. Any proposal to add new taxes to workers' health coverage would undermine this system upon which the majority of Americans and their families rely.

advertisement

Many American families are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of food, housing, and other essential needs. Health care is no exception. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, annual per-capita health expenditures are expected to exceed $15,700 in 2025 — a 59% increase since 2015 — and rise to nearly $22,000 by 2032.

The soaring cost of health care is one of the fundamental economic challenges of our age. It is a crisis born of multiple problems: inflation, market consolidation, and a lack of price transparency, among many others. It would add insult to injury (and illness) if workers who are at their most vulnerable are forced to pay taxes on the insurance that makes it possible to afford the ever-increasing cost of health care. As demonstrated in 2024 Election Night polling, 93% of voters want employer-provided health care coverage to remain tax-free because it encourages employers to provide high-quality, affordable health care coverage.

Policy proposals to tax health care coverage can vary by design, but one option examined by the Congressional Budget Office could leave a working family making $35,000 paying an additional $1,100 in taxes in 2025 and by 2030, inflation would increase it to an additional $2,325 in taxes, resulting in a 62% higher tax burden.

Some proponents of taxing health coverage assert that they would only impose a tax on those with higher incomes or “Cadillac” plans. But once the concept is enshrined in law, every time Congress needs billions of dollars — perhaps to pay for some initiative completely unrelated to health care — it could turn the dial lower (or let inflation do it for them), subjecting many more people to the tax.

To what end? Perhaps the true goal is to push employers out of their role as sponsors of health care coverage. This would be deeply counterproductive. Not only do employers add value and innovation to the design and operation of health care coverage, but the government's own data shows that employer coverage is a tremendous bargain for the American taxpayer.

advertisement

According to the White House Office of Management and Budget, $216 billion in forgone taxes on workers and families was attributable to the income tax exclusion for employer-provided health coverage in 2023. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that employer group health insurance funds paid out $1.3 trillion that same year. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of $1.3 trillion divided by $216 billion reveals that each dollar of federal expenditure yielded approximately $6.02 in benefits for covered employees and their families — a more than 6-to-1 return on the government's investment.

Employer-provided health insurance not only brings value to the economy, but of all the health coverage options in the United States it also yields  the best bang for the taxpayer's buck. On a per-patient annual basis, the government (and taxpayers) pay the most for Medicare at nearly $18,000 per enrollee, then the Affordable Care Act's exchange marketplaces at nearly $6,000 per enrollee, then Medicaid at more than $5,500 per enrollee, and lastly employer plans at $2,000 per enrollee. While some of this delta reflects health status and demographic differences, it's safe to say employer plans are still a bargain to taxpayers in comparison. Recent Congressional Budget Office data also indicates that with the ACA's enhanced subsidies, the cost to the federal government of exchange marketplace plans will actually be higher than $6,000 this year and topping $7,000 in 2027. If Congress makes the wrong choice and eliminates the health care tax exclusion, people who leave employer coverage will likely be forced into the more costly markets in our health care system.

Furthermore, if the policy is designed to target the employers, they might cut benefits or drop coverage altogether, potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common reason adults between the ages of 18 and 64 choose to remain uninsured is because coverage is unaffordable. This means more healthy adults are likely to go without coverage than absorb a significant increase to their health care costs. When healthy adults leave the risk pools of large group plans, premiums rise even further for those who remain insured.

advertisement

In 2019, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act's 40% tax on employer-provided health care coverage — then known as the “Cadillac Tax.” This tax operated like a cap on the exclusion but was designed with a different policy mechanism. The biggest question now is, will President Trump double down on his support for millions of American workers and their families by rejecting proposals to tax health benefits for the first time.  

There is broad bipartisan support for protecting workers' health care coverage and opposing short-sighted and misguided proposals to tax health benefits.  As the current chair of UNITE HERE HEALTH and the president of the American Benefits Council, we recently joined a broad stakeholder group of 70 employer groups, unions, patient groups, and other health care stakeholders who urged Congress not to disrupt the vital employer-provided health coverage that the majority of Americans rely upon for lifesaving care every day.

Congress must wholeheartedly reject any proposal that seeks to undermine the health and financial security of American workers.

Correction: A previous version of this essay misstated the Bipartian Policy Center's position on taxing health benefits.

On March 7, the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences hosted the Fifth Annual Biotechnology Conference at New York Tech's Long Island campus. Industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and New York Tech faculty, students, and staff gathered to exchange innovative research and share ideas centered around the conference's theme: Therapeutics, AI, and Technology: New Directions in Healthcare.

The conference enabled experts from across disciplines to connect and collaborate, furthering the goal to transform the future of medicine and therapeutics through artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge technologies.

President Hank Foley, Ph.D., kicked off the conference by welcoming the guests. He reminded the audience that Long Island is a hub of innovative technological development and celebrated New York Tech's contributions to that culture, inviting everyone to tour the newly completed Biomedical Research, Innovation, and Imaging Center (BRIIC) on campus.

Babak D. Beheshti, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computing Sciences, complimented  attendees on their cutting-edge work to radically enhance patient success in the medical field. “The challenges we face today—whether in healthcare, sustainability, or technology—demand bold solutions,” he said, “and I have no doubt that the discussions and discoveries made here will shape the future of biotechnology.” He urged attendees to take advantage of this opportunity to connect with fellow pioneers in healthcare and computing.

Evan Shlofmitz, FACC (D.O. '10), director of intravascular imaging at St. Francis Hospital and Heart Center, shared in his keynote address how AI can enhance medical professionals' diagnostic capabilities. “Experience matters,” he affirmed, but not all physicians have adequate experience with the procedures they're performing on patients. AI, however, “brings the promise of bridging that gap.” He hopes that wider use of AI will help physicians become more comfortable with a larger range of medical procedures and lead to more accurate patient diagnoses.

Other presentations included how medical affairs employees could benefit from AI, the role of computing in integrated structural biology, and how AI could advance stem cell maturity detection in cardiovascular disease treatment.

David Putrino, Ph.D., professor of rehabilitation and human performance at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, explained how brain computer interfaces can improve autonomy and privacy for people with neurological disabilities. The audience watched a video of a man controlling his desktop computer using only his brain. Putrino pointed out the man's smile, demonstrating how technological solutions can drastically enhance healthcare accessibility.

The conference continued with a Q&A featuring biotechnology startup founders: College of Arts and Sciences student Ryan Ahmed of Niura; Thrasyvoulos (Thras) Karydis, M.Sc., of DeepCure; and Kaveh Vejdani, Ph.D., of Darmiyan. The three entrepreneurs shared insight on attracting investors, building their teams, and navigating growth.

The final session included presentations on using deep learning to identify tumors early in young children and how to use AI in medical education. Milan Toma, Ph.D., assistant professor of clinical sciences at the College of Osteopathic Medicine, warned the audience to be wary of AI until it is robust enough to be clinically applicable. AI diagnostic models “demonstrate their accuracy,” he said, “but they don't demonstrate how reliable their accuracy is.”

Stephen P. Welby, Ph.D., former special assistant to the president for science and technology policy, closed the conference by examining the intersection of biotechnology, AI, and public policy. He expressed optimism for all of AI's potential uses. “It's early; there's still so much work to be done in these spaces!” he excitedly proclaimed.

Although several presenters came from a computer science background, all were enthusiastic about the possibilities of applying computing to healthcare. “It's interesting seeing how AI is being implemented in medicine,” said Nicole McCormack, a computer science student. “I like learning what avenues I can take in AI development.”

Afterward, attendees examined posters showing the cutting-edge biotechnology research being conducted by New York Tech faculty and students, along with impressive prototypes of NASA patents developed by New York Tech's Entrepreneurship and Technology Innovation Center.

Professors, industry experts, global leaders, and student innovators mingled at the concluding luncheon, demonstrating how conferences like these can unite people from across departments, disciplines, and career paths. With new connections formed and relationships forged, guests left the 2025 Biotechnology Conference ready to build the life-saving technology of the future.

A new set of guidelines have been launched to create trustworthy AI systems in healthcare. The first of its kind, the FUTURE-AI guideline provides recommendations covering the entire lifecycle of medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in healthcare, helping with tasks like disease diagnosis and predicting treatment outcomes. However, despite these advances, many healthcare professionals and patients are still hesitant to fully embrace AI technologies. This hesitation largely stems from concerns about trust, safety, and ethics.

In particular, existing research has shown that AI tools in healthcare can be prone to errors and patient harm, biases and increased health inequalities, lack of transparency and accountability, as well as data privacy and security breaches.

To overcome these challenges the FUTURE-AI Consortium has developed a comprehensive set of guidelines published in the BMJ. Developed by an international consortium of 117 experts from 50 countries the new guidelines called FUTURE-AI provide a roadmap for creating trustworthy and responsible AI tools for healthcare.

The FUTURE-AI guidelines are built around six guiding principles:

These guidelines fill an important gap in the field of healthcare AI to give clinicians, patients, and health authorities the confidence to adopt AI tools knowing they are technically sound, clinically safe, and ethically aligned. The FUTURE-AI framework is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new technologies, challenges, and stakeholder feedback. This dynamic approach ensures the guidelines remain relevant and useful as the field of healthcare AI continues to rapidly advance.""

Healthcare providers are under immense pressure to deliver high-quality care while managing financial constraints, operational inefficiencies, and an ever-evolving regulatory landscape. Vital to overcoming these challenges is the need for seamless communication and data exchange across systems. Fewer than one in three hospitals can electronically find, send, receive, and integrate patient information from another provider, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving full interoperability.

Legacy systems are often what stands in the way between seamless integration and interoperability. While electronic health records (EHRs) and other modern platforms have transformed aspects of healthcare delivery, traditional fax systems continue to serve as the basis for transmitting critical patient records, authorizations, and referrals. However, these legacy systems often create barriers for healthcare organizations. The key to realizing the full potential of legacy systems in modern healthcare lies in overcoming interoperability challenges — ensuring seamless data exchange between various systems while preserving the trusted reliability and security healthcare providers depend on. This modernization is not just about maintaining outdated legacy systems, it's about building a stronger, scalable foundation for the future of healthcare.

Interoperability: A crucial step toward modernization


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

A significant barrier to digital transformation in the healthcare industry is achieving interoperability — the smooth flow of data between systems that typically operate in isolation. Despite the rising adoption of EHRs and other digital communication platforms, many organizations struggle to integrate their legacy fax systems into modern workflows. This creates silos where vital patient information becomes trapped in outdated formats, further increasing administrative burdens.  

Modern cloud-based fax solutions offer a bridge between traditional and digital systems. By leveraging APIs and technology partnerships, cloud fax can automatically integrate faxed documents into EHRs or other healthcare platforms. This ensures that vital information is accessible in real time while remaining confidential and HIPAA-compliant, enhancing coordination and decision-making. Moreover, interoperability facilitated by cloud fax lays the groundwork for adopting advanced technologies, such as predictive analytics and remote patient monitoring, which rely on seamless data exchange.

In 2023, 70% of hospitals engaged in all four domains of interoperable exchange, compared to 46% in 2018. This growing commitment underscores the importance of modernization efforts that enhance interoperability, allowing healthcare providers to unlock the full potential of their existing systems. 

Rather than eliminating legacy fax systems altogether, modernization efforts can build upon the reliability and trust that these systems have established over time. By enhancing these systems with cloud-based interoperability, healthcare providers can drive significant improvements in efficiency and patient care without the disruption of a complete overhaul. In fact, the global healthcare interoperability solutions market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2024 to 2029, highlighting the increasing demand for seamless integration and innovation in the sector.

Operational advantages & the path to digital transformation  

Healthcare providers face substantial financial and operational pressures, with over $8 billion lost annually due to IT inefficiencies, system downtime, and lack of integration. Interoperability and operational efficiency go hand in hand as seamless data exchange across systems reduces redundancies, minimizes downtime, and ensures that critical resources are utilized to their fullest potential. 

This is where cloud-based solutions come in. By eliminating the need for on-premises equipment, these solutions empower healthcare organizations to scale their communication capabilities without the limitations of traditional hardware. 

This scalability is especially crucial during peak periods, such as open enrollment or public health crises, when legacy servers often struggle to manage increased volumes. When integrated seamlessly with existing systems, cloud fax solutions enhance operational workflows, reduce administrative overhead, and allow IT teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine maintenance. 

These efficiencies not only support day-to-day operations but also provide a solid foundation for broader digital transformation, advancing interoperability and enabling a more connected healthcare ecosystem.

The future of healthcare communication  

As the healthcare landscape evolves, so must its communication systems. Cloud Fax represents the immediate future of healthcare communication: a secure, efficient, and compliant solution that meets the demands of a rapidly changing industry. By modernizing healthcare systems with cloud-based solutions, healthcare providers can preserve the reliability of traditional systems while overcoming their limitations to achieve ongoing growth. For organizations seeking to balance innovation with regulatory requirements, it offers a clear path forward.

DispatchHealth and Medically Home have entered into a definitive agreement to merge, creating a single provider of medical care at home.

Once the deal closes, Medically Home will become part of DispatchHealth. The combined entity will extend care into the homes of patients across 50 major metropolitan areas in partnership with nearly 40 health systems, as well as most major health plans and value-based care entities, the organizations said.

""This merger unlocks a future where high-acuity care at home is the new standard,"" said Dr. Mark Prather, co-founder and executive chair of the board for DispatchHealth, in a statement.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

To illustrate patients' increasing preference for receiving care at home, the companies cited Chilmark research showing that the hospital-at-home market is projected to reach $300 billion by 2028, driven by improved patient outcomes and cost efficiency.

The combined entity, they said, will be positioned to deliver services such as same-day medical care for serious health concerns, and complex, hospital-level care in the home. The organizations said they will aim to reduce the total cost of care by up to 30% over a 30-day period.

With expanded capabilities, the combined organization could free up more than 62,000 bed days, easing strain on health systems, the companies said.

""For many patients, the best hospital bed is the one at home,"" said Medically Home CEO Graham Barnes. ""By joining forces with DispatchHealth, we're creating a stronger, more integrated model that will enable more patients, providers, and health systems to embrace high-acuity home-based care with confidence.""

The merger is expected to close mid-year. The terms of the definitive agreement were not disclosed.

THE LARGER TREND

The home care and hospice market is growing along with an aging population. 

Reflecting the growing demand for home care services, home health volumes are expected to increase 22% by 2034, according to a November report from Research and Markets.

ON THE RECORD

""Hospital-at-home has consistently demonstrated better outcomes, and we believe every patient – regardless of where they live – deserves access to that level of care,"" said Pippa Shulman, chief medical officer and chief strategy officer, Medically Home. ""This merger allows us to break down barriers, reaching more families in underserved communities with high-quality, advanced medical care in their homes.""

With the hospital-at-home waiver extended six months through the recently passed Continuing Resolution in Congress, two of the largest vendors in the space have agreed to merge. When Medically Home becomes part of DispatchHealth, the combined entity will extend care into the homes of patients across 50 major metropolitan areas in partnership with nearly 40 health systems, as well as most major health plans and value-based care entities. The market for hospital at home is projected to reach $300 billion by 2028.The companies said the combined entity will be positioned to deliver everything from same-day medical care for serious health concerns to complex hospital-level care in patients' homes—improving outcomes while reducing the total cost of care by up to 30% over a 30-day period. With expanded capabilities, the combined organization could free up more than 62,000 bed days, easing strain on health systems while improving patient access to high-quality care at home, they said. ""This merger unlocks a future where high-acuity care at home is the new standard,"" said Mark Prather, M.D., co-founder and executive chair of the board for DispatchHealth, in a statement. ""We're combining decades of expertise to create a seamless, scalable model for hospital-level care at home—bringing the right care to the right place at the right time for more people."" ""Hospital-at-home has consistently demonstrated better outcomes, and we believe every patient—regardless of where they live—deserves access to that level of care. This merger allows us to break down barriers, reaching more families in underserved communities with high-quality, advanced medical care in their homes,"" said Pippa Shulman, D.O., M.P.H., chief medical officer and chief strategy officer for Medically Home, in a statement.

Both Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente were strategic investors in Boston-based Medically Home. Although terms of the deal were not disclosed, the merger is expected to close mid-year 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Meanwhile, hospital-at-home advocates will continue to urge Congress for a longer-term extension to both telehealth and hospital-at-home Medicare coverage.“By including these provisions in this stopgap legislation, Congress sent a very clear message that telehealth is a fundamental part of care delivery, and that we must not reverse the significant progress made in modernizing our healthcare system,” said Kyle Zebley, executive director of ATA Action, in a statement. “At the same time, the shortened duration of the extensions included are an impediment to long-term certainty, and the exclusion of other essential telehealth programs that expired or were absent from the final bill continues to prevent millions of individuals from accessing needed care. We must fix this, for the sake of patients, clinicians and our ailing healthcare system.”","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

The case for digitizing healthcare has never been more urgent. Hospitals are under pressure to deliver high-quality patient care, with demand increasing from an ageing population with complex healthcare needs. As healthcare institutions continue to operate against a backdrop of staff shortages, limited access to diagnostic imaging equipment, and a spiralling backlog of appointments – the NHS patient waiting list stands at 7.5 million – driving greater efficiency and accuracy has never been more crucial.

The reality, however, is that healthcare systems often involve archaic, non-digitized workflow processes that can introduce unnecessary delays to efficient operations. But times have changed and continue to do so. Compare the complexity and image quality of photography using an SLR camera ten years ago versus a smartphone today and you'll get a sense of what is happening in the healthcare industry today.

Data and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are revolutionizing the medical field when it comes to optimizing workflows – and this has become particularly evident in the case of medical imaging and diagnostics. Breakthroughs in imaging technology, including advances in image quality and noise reduction, for example, are driving more accurate and timely diagnoses and treatment planning for patients, whilst automated technologies are optimizing the scanning process.

With the right tools, healthcare providers, and their diagnostics teams, can significantly reduce time-consuming tasks, minimize errors, enhance overall operational efficiency and, in doing so, improve the patient experience. In addition to increasing patient throughput- and reducing the backlog of appointments – this allows more time to focus on care, keeping up with evolving healthcare needs via ongoing training, and facilitating better treatment outcomes.

We need to embrace a more holistic, integrated approach to mental healthcare: one that combines the best of human expertise with rapid innovations of technology, all while being mindful of the real-world challenges faced by marginalized and underserved communities. 

Share Options

Many would describe the current state of the mental healthcare system today as bleak. High costs of care, long wait times, and staffing shortages have left many people feeling disillusioned, disconnected, and, at times, hopeless. Not only do we need new solutions, we also need to be cautious not to simply scale what isn't working. 

Consider this analogy: two men started a business selling melons. They bought melons for $1 each and sold them for $1 each. After multiple trips between the farmer's field and their roadside shed, one partner remarked, “We're not making much money, are we?” The other replied, “Do you think we need a bigger truck?”

This story is a perfect metaphor for a problem we often see in the healthcare system: continuing to scale a broken model instead of rethinking it. It's not about getting a bigger truck – it's about rethinking the road we're traveling.

Not everyone needs or wants therapy 

The rapid expansion of teletherapy has opened up much needed access to mental healthcare. But as highlighted in Ellen Barry's recent New York Times article, a growing body of research demonstrates the teletherapy boom has disproportionately benefited privileged groups while leaving marginalized communities behind. 

As we look for answers, the demand for innovative solutions has surged. Over the last decade, people were increasingly turning to search engines for help, using Google to ask “How can I feel better?” or “Do I have depression?” in search of support. Today, they're turning to ChatGPT and other chatbots in the absence of an abundance of mental health clinicians. This isn't just a trend; it's a sign that people are actively seeking help but, for various reasons, are not engaging with traditional therapy. Whether due to stigma, cost, availability, or even uncertainty about where to start, too many individuals are left to navigate mental health challenges on their own.

But here's the question: what if we could offer a seamless bridge to human-led care and clinically proven digital mental health tools that provide real-time, evidence-based support? This vision doesn't replace human therapists; rather, it complements and enhances the existing system by ensuring the vast majority of people who need help have access to a safe, supportive, and ethical entry point for their mental health journey. 


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

AI is here to stay

As a clinical psychologist who has spent the vast majority of my career seeing patients in a therapy setting, I wholeheartedly believe that this is where AI and technology can play a transformative role. While many people find benefit from working with a clinician at varying points throughout their lives, there is a growing need to incorporate AI-driven support into the system. For many, technology offers a way to open up about their mental health in a way that feels less daunting. Subclinical AI tools can guide individuals with in-the-moment support during times of distress, help manage or understand symptoms, offer a judgment-free place to reflect, and connect them to resources for further support – all while offering anonymity and privacy. With the proper guardrails and training, AI can empower people who are otherwise hesitant to reach out or don't have access to traditional care.

But, like any innovation, we must tread carefully. The integration of AI into mental healthcare must be grounded in safety, evidence-based practices, and strong ethical considerations. That's why at Headspace, we're not just building technology for technology's sake; we're engaging clinicians and other mental health professionals, researchers, and data security experts to ensure our solutions complement and enhance traditional care, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for our members.

Yet, we have a responsibility to recognize and address the shortcomings that exist outside of technology. We know teletherapy isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, so we can't simply scale this model and expect to solve the deep disparities that exist in mental healthcare.

Reimagining the future of mental healthcare 

Instead, we need to rethink the infrastructure and design of mental healthcare altogether. This means:

The truth is, we don't need a bigger truck. We need to redesign the road entirely. To do this, we need to embrace a more holistic, integrated approach to mental healthcare: one that combines the best of human expertise with rapid innovations of technology, all while being mindful of the real-world challenges faced by marginalized and underserved communities. Only then can we begin to solve the crisis at hand.

A dual Russian and Israeli national was extradited to the United States on charges that he was a developer of the LockBit ransomware group, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

In August, Rostislav Panev, 51, was arrested in Israel, and late last week had an initial appearance before a U.S. magistrate judge. A trial is still pending.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Court documents say Panev acted as a developer of the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024. During that time, Panev and his LockBit co-conspirators allegedly grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world.

The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the U.S., the DOJ said. Their victims ranged from individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, including hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law enforcement agencies.

LockBit's members allegedly extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery, the DOJ said.

Its members were comprised of developers like Penev, who designed the LockBit malware code and maintained the infrastructure on which it operated. LockBit's other members, called ""affiliates,"" allegedly carried out attacks and extorted ransom payments from victims. Developers and affiliates would then split the ransom payments which were extorted from victims.

At the time of Panev's arrest in Israel in August, law enforcement discovered on his computer administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and stored source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which allowed its affiliates to generate custom builds of the ransomware malware for particular victims.

On that repository, law enforcement also discovered source code for LockBit's StealBit tool, which helped LockBit affiliates exfiltrate data stolen through the attacks.

In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work. 

Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network.

Panev also admitted to having written and maintained LockBit malware code and to having provided technical guidance to the LockBit group.

THE LARGER TREND

As of October, 389 healthcare institutions in the U.S. were attacked with ransomware in 2024, which caused network shutdowns, offline systems, rescheduled appointments and delays in critical procedures, a Microsoft report found.

The report, which aggregated information from other reports and data sets, cited a Comparitech analysis showing that the attacks are costly – healthcare organizations lose up to $900,000 per day on downtime alone, the data showed.

According to a recent U.S. government interagency report cited by Microsoft, ransomware attacks have surged by 300% since 2015, largely because ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has lowered the barrier for entry for hackers who lack technical expertise, with other ransomware groups finding safe harbor in Russia.

Out of the 99 healthcare organizations that admitted to paying the ransom and disclosed the ransom paid, the median payment was $1.5 million, and the average payment was $4.4 million, according to the HIPAA Journal.

VITAS Healthcare


MIAMI, March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the nation's leading provider of end-of-life care, VITAS Healthcare is setting the gold standard and redefining high-quality, industry-leading hospice care for patients with heart disease.

To that end, VITAS has become the first nationwide hospice provider to earn the American Heart Association® Palliative/Hospice Heart Failure certification across all 15 states in which it operates. The certification applies to 56 unique VITAS service areas, including the District of Columbia.



 

 

A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available by clicking on this link.

Achieving this certification reinforces VITAS' commitment to excellence in caring for patients with advanced cardiac disease, ensuring that its clinical practices align with the Association's science-based, evidence-driven standards for heart failure care at the end of life. It also affirms the organization's ongoing efforts to improve patient outcomes and enhance care coordination for one of the most prevalent life-limiting illnesses in the United States.

“Many patients with heart failure do not receive the hospice care that could significantly improve their final months of life,” said Joseph Shega, MD, executive vice president and chief medical officer at VITAS. “This certification affirms our commitment to providing evidence-based hospice care that helps patients and families navigate advanced heart disease with dignity, comfort and the right level of support.”

Despite being the most common cause of death in the United States, heart failure remains underrepresented in hospice care. Studies suggest only one in 10 patients with advanced heart failure is referred to hospice, despite evidence demonstrating the many benefits. Research continues to demonstrate hospice care improves pain and symptom management, patient satisfaction and emotional well-being for both patients and families.

The certification signifies confidence that: 

“This certification assures patients can have confidence that their heart failure care is coordinated and follows the latest evidence-based guidelines,” said Kristen Schaefer, MD, American Heart Association volunteer and vice president, associate chief medical officer at Care Dimensions. “We're pleased to have VITAS join the national network of American Heart Association Palliative/Hospice Heart Failure certified agencies.”

VITAS first earned this certification in Georgia in May 2023, becoming Atlanta's first hospice provider to achieve the distinction. Since then, VITAS has expanded its roster of certified service areas.

For more than 45 years, VITAS has been a pioneer in hospice and palliative care, serving more than 1.5 million patients across 15 states and the District of Columbia. Its interdisciplinary care teams provide expert, compassionate support wherever patients call home, whether in a private residence, nursing home, assisted living facility or dedicated inpatient hospice unit.

Oops, something went wrong

The projected fair value for Acadia Healthcare Company is US$56.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Acadia Healthcare Company is estimated to be 48% undervalued based on current share price of US$29.43

Our fair value estimate is 15% higher than Acadia Healthcare Company's analyst price target of US$49.46

How far off is Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.

Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

 See our latest analysis for Acadia Healthcare Company 

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2b

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$321m× (1 + 2.8%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.8%) = US$7.9b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$4.0b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$5.3b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$29.4, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Acadia Healthcare Company as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.965. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Strength

Debt is well covered by earnings.

Weakness

No major weaknesses identified for ACHC.

Opportunity

Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.

Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.

Threat

Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Acadia Healthcare Company, there are three important factors you should explore:

The good news is that U.S. hospital organizations are doing relatively well in the first quarter of the year, as rising patient volume has helped to offset the impact of rising operational costs, according to leaders at the Chicago-based consulting and advisory firm Kaufman Hall, a Vizient company.

In January of this year, according to data released by Kaufman Hall on March 17 in its “National Hospital Flash Report,” average monthly operating margins for U.S. hospitals were 4.4 percent, up from 3.7 percent in December, and considerably above the 0.5 percent in November of last year. Indeed, throughout 2024, the average monthly operating margin hovered between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent consistently, except in April, when it reached 2.0 percent, and in December, when it hit 2.1 percent.

Per the stabilized numbers, Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of dataand analytics at Kaufman Hall, said in a statement contained in Monday's press release, that “January was a relatively stable month for hospitals, as more people received care due in part to seasonal challenges like flu and other respiratory diseases. Hospitals are also experiencing more rapid revenue growth from inpatient than outpatient services. Expenses are also rising, driven primarily by drug costs, though the rate of cost growth has slowed.”

The report, which can be accessed here, offered the following “Key Takeaways”;

Ø   Hospital performance remains stable at the start of 2025. This is due to a confluence of greater service volume and rising expenses.

Ø  Expenses continue to be driven primarily by the cost of drugs. However, the rate of cost growth has slowed considerably.

Ø  Inpatient revenue grew more quickly than outpatient revenue in January. More patients were treated in the hospital and emergency room.","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of Michael Burry's Top Holdings Were Gaining While NVDA Was Crashing. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hca Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stands against other Michael Burry's top Holdings that were gaining while NVDA was crashing.

Michael Burry's name is synonymous with contrarian investing strategies, being one of the few investors who bet against the housing market and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis between 2007 and 2010. His stance on the real estate market in 2008 made the American investor and hedge fund manager famous enough to make it in the 2015 film “The Big Short,” where he was portrayed by Christian Bale.

Over the years, Burry, who established a renowned and well-regarded California-based hedge fund Scion Asset Management, LLC in 2013, often made headlines for his recession warnings and market crash “predictions”. However, with warnings about economic downturns fizzling out, Burry's reputation as both an expert and hedge fund manager was often at stake.

But even though some of his recession warnings have not played out as predicted, Burry remains one of the market geniuses whose moves investors value and follow as explained in our recent survey of Michael Burry's portfolio in 2024.

His firm has achieved a return of over 160% over the past decade, outperforming the S&P 500 during that time, according to Ticker Nerd.

Scion Asset Management manages hedge funds with discretionary assets under management of $196,206,549 (as of March 2024). In its fourth quarter SEC 13F filing on February 14, Burry's firm disclosed a total of 13 security holdings with a portfolio value of $77,435,131 and a top 10 holdings concentration of 93.62%.

Burry wrapped up 2024 being cautiously optimistic regarding long-term prospects in terms of China's online retail market, given ongoing regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainties in the Asian country. In the quarter ending December 31, he cut the stake in two of his top three investments in Chinese technology before the January release of DeepSeek's latest AI models which turned tech space on its head starting a massive rally in the country's stock market. Apart from that, it appears Burry is looking to capitalize on the growing demand for healthcare services and advanced analytical technologies, while also focusing on consumer discretionary taking positions in apparel, cosmetics, and luxury goods industries.

To make the list of Michael Burry's top portfolio holdings we reviewed Scion Asset Management's fourth-quarter 2024 portfolio and ranked the list according to the hedge fund's stake value in each firm. If there was an overlap, we prioritized the holding that was worth more money. We have also assessed the number of shares acquired by Scion Asset and hedge fund sentiment toward each stock from Insider Monkey's database of hedge investor letters.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Julia Strandberg, chief business leader, connected care, at Philips

Health systems are under increasing pressure to retain their patients – who have a variety of care options to choose from, both in-person and virtual. At the same time, inpatient capacity is limited and hospital care teams face a lot of strain.

By using cardiac data gathered through remote devices, ambulatory care is helping these facilities preserve and care for patients within the health system, but not always in the hospital.

Philips is one company that plays in this arena, and has insights on what facilities should know about leveraging this data to better work within their existing capacity and retain patients.

Healthcare IT News spoke recently with Julia Strandberg, chief business leader for connected care at Philips, to talk about some of the challenges hospitals and health systems face with patient retention. She also discussed capacity issues, how leveraging cardiac data via remote patient monitoring technologies can help overcome them – and what it will take for more healthcare organizations to adopt remote patient monitoring technologies.

Q. What are the challenges hospitals and health systems face regarding patient retention?

A. Impactful patient care in and out of the hospital is a non-negotiable – it's what patients require and desire. In the hospital, they seek high-quality care that is delivered quickly. Once home, they want to remain an active partner in their treatment, looking for timely updates on their health and clear guidance on next steps, including whether their healthcare provider recommends an in-person visit.

However, ongoing clinical staffing shortages and the complexities brought on by siloed hospital data often lead to longer wait times and delays in care.

As patient volumes grow and cases become more complex, fragmented data poses a significant challenge for hospitals and health systems. When clinicians lack a comprehensive, holistic view of a patient's health, it can add unnecessary roadblocks to determining a diagnosis and necessary treatment.

As a result, patients may be subjected to unnecessary tests and specialty visits. Not only can this increase patient stress, cost of care and dissatisfaction, but it can also take time away from patients who actually do require that specialty care.

To improve efficiency and ensure timely, high-quality care, hospitals should prioritize interoperability across all systems and devices, regardless of vendor. With seamless data access, clinicians can quickly review a patient's condition history and current health status, leading to faster, more accurate diagnoses.

These workflow improvements also free up clinicians' time, allowing them to focus more on direct patient care – whether in-person or remote – rather than sifting through disjointed records.

Q. What are the challenges hospitals face regarding capacity?

A. Health systems nationwide continue to struggle with overwhelming patient volumes and staffing shortages. These issues will only worsen as the population ages, and simultaneously, patients have become more complex, their conditions more acute. These factors significantly impact both patients and staff – eroding staff satisfaction and contributing to burnout, while decreasing patient safety and satisfaction.

One of the growing challenges healthcare professionals are facing, however, is they are overwhelmed by the volume of data generated. Almost 4 in 10 healthcare leaders (38%) say staff lose precious time pulling patient data together, leaving less time to care for patients.

Other administrative tasks such as scheduling and reporting also are time-consuming, with nurses spending 15-20 mins per hour on such tasks, taking time away from patients.

Open, interoperable systems will eliminate barriers and turn the vast pools of clinical data into actionable insights. For companies like Philips, it's critical we team up with healthcare providers and ecosystem partners to co-create systems that enhance care pathways and operational workflows, while reducing costs and the burden on staff.

Q. How can leveraging cardiac data via remote patient monitoring technologies help overcome some of these challenges?

A. Remote patient monitoring technologies, paired with advanced data analytics, are game changers when it comes to alleviating capacity bottlenecks.

Consider this scenario: a patient arrives at the ED following syncope, a fainting episode. While historically, this patient may have been admitted for observation, remote monitoring technology – in this case, a mobile cardiac telemetry device – can allow them to safely return home while their cardiac rhythms are monitored in real time.

Meanwhile, their data is shared with care team members, and their cardiologist will have this information in hand before their follow-up appointment, accelerating diagnosis and subsequent care.

This model reduces overcrowding by removing unnecessary admissions, allowing staff to focus more on acute cases. And the patient avoids a hospital stay and can recover comfortably at home.

Q. What will it take for more hospitals and health systems to adopt remote patient monitoring technologies?

A. We need to begin with an industry-wide mindset shift. First, we must recognize how quickly the care delivery model is evolving beyond the walls of the hospital and recognize the potential of this evolution.

Moving forward, we'll continue to see the advancement of home-based care technology, which is proven to improve patient outcomes, minimize acute care setting stay lengths for patients, and reduce the strain on healthcare facilities.

Riding the wave of this shift, we're in a better position to prioritize high-quality care delivery to patients virtually anywhere – and leverage remote patient monitoring tech to do so. Health systems can retain their patients while freeing up capacity by opening doors for more care outside the hospital.

Finally, hospitals and health systems must partner with technology vendors that prioritize interoperability. This approach gives clinicians access to high-quality, real-time patient information for enhanced care delivery.

Having a solid foundation of interoperability creates both clinical efficiencies and sets the stage for AI to empower providers with more timely, informed decision making across the care continuum – ultimately improving patient outcomes, cost savings and resource management.

WOOD COUNTY, Ohio — The World Health Organization predicts a global shortage of at least 10 million workers in the health care industry by 2030. To help curb this growing issue of fewer nurses, physicians, technicians, and specialists, Owens Community College has decided to expand and renovate its Healthcare Education Center. 

The more than $31 million dollar expansion, Dean of Nursing & Health Professionals Cathy Ford said, was to give all Owens Community College students more hands-on training tools. 

The classrooms are filled with state-of-the-art simulators and equipment aimed at giving current and future students a more immersive experience. The new building offers dedicated sections and rooms to 10 of the 11 departments. 

“All of the labs have been greatly expanded in square footage, but that is in comparison in the amount of technology that is available in each of the labs spaces,"" Ford said. ""That's really important now because we need to meet students where they are and in their learning process. Students learn very differently now than they did a decade ago and we're prepared for that now.”

Owens offers 22 degrees and certificates across its 11 healthcare disciplines:  

There are specific highlights like the Interprofessional Education and Simulation Center, where several of the disciplines collaborate with a goal of improving patient outcomes as a team versus just a few students learning at a time. There are simulated hospital rooms, high-fidelity mannequins, and flexible spaces, to name a few features. 

Owens celebrated the $31.3 million renovation and expansion, which started back in November 2023, at the Healthcare Education Center during a grand opening ceremony Monday.

Compass Health


EVERETT, Wash., March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Compass Health, Northwest Washington's behavioral healthcare leader, recently welcomed Janet Carbary as its new chief financial officer (CFO). With more than 20 years of experience in finance, healthcare management, and operations, Carbary is a valued addition to the organization as it continues to chart its course for growth and innovation.

“Janet brings a wealth of knowledge to our organization, but also an admirable passion for the work that we do,” said Tom Sebastian, CEO of Compass Health. “She is someone who entered the behavioral healthcare field early in her career and worked her way to executive-level positions, thanks to that passion. We couldn't be happier to have her join Compass Health, especially during a time when demand for our services continues to increase, and we're innovating not only to keep pace but also to get ahead. Janet's thoughtful, proactive leadership will serve our team well, and I'm looking forward to seeing how our organization thrives under her guidance.”

As CFO, Carbary will oversee the financial management of Compass Health, including planning, budgeting, and reporting. She will leverage her expertise to support the organization's spectrum of services, including those in which she has prior experience, such as the Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) and Wraparound with Intensive Services (WISe). Additionally, she will play an instrumental role in advancing large-scale initiatives like the Broadway Campus Redevelopment Project. Phase II of the campus, the Marc Healing Center, is set to open this summer.

“There are so many amazing programs and resources available at Compass Health that I wish more people in our community knew about,” said Carbary. “In joining the organization, I'm eager to increase awareness about the spectrum of services we offer as well as help remove the stigma around behavioral health. While working directly with clients is something I've enjoyed immensely throughout my career, as I moved into executive positions, I've found just as much fulfillment in taking care of the people who care for our clients and the systems that enable them to do so.”

Carbary has always been driven to the mental health field and began her career specializing in working with individuals with schizophrenia at Spokane Community Mental Health. There, she worked with one of the original intensive outpatient programs, after which the IOP currently at Compass Health is modeled.

Since then, she's served as CFO for several organizations, including the not-for-profit One Mind, where she campaigned for funding to research schizophrenia and traumatic brain injuries. She gained experience in operations, process improvement, and managing complex organizations through her tenure as CFO, COO and CEO for organizations like Carlsbad Medical Center, Pacific Physicians Lab, YouScript, and Integrated Rehabilitation Group.

“The vision, mission, and values of Compass Health resonate with my own goals to elevate the behavioral healthcare system so that we can better care for our neighbors across Northwest Washington,” said Carbary. “It was a natural fit for me to become a part of this team, which is filled with individuals who are making a real difference in people's lives. It's fulfilling to lend my expertise to advance an organization that's making such a profound impact.”

Outside of work, Janet enjoys spending time with her family, traveling, visiting local wineries, cheering on the Seahawks and Mariners, and mentoring young women in their professional careers.

WTOL 11 Vault on Plus | News of the Week from 1991

TOLEDO, Ohio — Five years after COVID-19 transformed healthcare operations virtually overnight, medical professionals are reflecting on the lasting changes to hospitals, staff and patient care.

In March 2020, healthcare systems were forced to adapt rapidly as the first wave of COVID-19 cases arrived. Hospitals implemented temperature checks at entrances, questionnaires about health history and eventually universal masking policies.

""I think that everyone can probably say that their lives have been changed through COVID,"" said Dr. Brian Kaminski, vice president of medical affairs for ProMedica's Metro Hospitals.

Hospitals quickly reorganized their facilities to handle the emerging threat. 

""We even had separate areas for our waiting rooms for people who were presenting with COVID or non-COVID-like symptoms,"" Kaminski said. ""We had installed a variety of different ways to provide negative pressure ventilation in our emergency departments and in our rooms.""

Dr. James Tita, chief clinical officer for Mercy Health Toledo, recalled the urgent need for isolation protocols. 

""We weren't even sure exactly how contagious it was, but given the fact that we didn't have any effective treatment, given the fact that it seemed to have a high mortality rate, we had to go to great lengths to make sure that we protected the staff, we protected each other, and of course, we protected the patients,"" Tita said.

Both health systems struggled with critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). 

""We were rationing masks, we were rationing gowns, we were trying to get as much equipment as we could,"" Tita said.

The pandemic created significant staffing challenges that continue today. 

""There was a big turnover of our bedside workers, so nurses, respiratory therapists, it took a terrible toll on them,"" Tita explained. ""In terms of replenishing those ranks and recruitment for all health care systems, that continues to be a challenge.""

Kaminski noted that staffing shortages forced difficult adjustments. 

""What we had to do, as did many other health organizations, is hire agency staffing, which is staff that's not permanent, often not from the area, qualified and competent, but not familiar with our organization, also very costly,"" Kaminski said.

Healthcare workers also experienced shifting public sentiment throughout the pandemic. Initial community support gave way to anger and mistrust as the crisis dragged on. 

""Suddenly, those heroes that we celebrated taking care of COVID initially turned into villains,"" Tita said.

The doctors noted that 1.2 million Americans died from the virus, many in isolation, leaving psychological, emotional and spiritual scars. 

""At some point, we will have to deal with this, and I'm sure we are dealing with it, maybe not in the best way,"" Tita said. ""This was a history-changing, a life-changing event for all of us.""

Despite ongoing questions about long COVID, both doctors said immunity through prior infection or vaccination has improved the situation. Most pandemic-era precautions like temperature checks and distancing markers have disappeared from hospitals.

""Most people can go out in public, do the activities that they're used to doing, not have to worry about entry into public facilities, and most people aren't masking right now,"" Kaminski said. ""It definitely feels good to me and it's nice to have a normal cadence and routine back again.""

Healthcare systems have applied lessons from the pandemic to other challenges. Kaminski said ProMedica used its ""COVID playbook"" when IV fluids became scarce following Hurricane Helene's impact on Puerto Rico and North Carolina.

Both hospital systems continue to utilize telemedicine services implemented during the pandemic.","{'href': 'https://www.wtol.com', 'title': 'WTOL'}"

Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, area hospitals and health systems are still reeling from its impact.

In the spring of 2020, hospitals were the first to feel the full force of the pandemic as they scrambled to find enough beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE). And yes, health care providers learned lessons that continue to help them care for the sick and prepare for any future outbreaks.

Anyone can see the impact in the easy availability of hand sanitizer and masks in health care facilities, the absence of salad bars in cafeterias and the prevalence of mental health therapists offering telehealth appointments.

And hospitals no longer struggle with a lack of basic outbreak supplies.

But the pandemic created huge staffing and financial challenges that have not gone away, health officials said.

“Our hospitals are still experiencing vacancy rates more than double pre-pandemic levels,” said Lauren Ford, vice president, strategy and analysis for the Iroquois Healthcare Association, which represents more than 50 hospitals and health systems in 32 upstate counties.

And those vacancies are hitting all departments, she said.

To fill the clinical vacancies, hospitals now rely far more heavily on traveling, or agency, nurses and other staff, driving expenses up. That's one factor that led to 60% of their hospitals ending 2023 in the red, Ford said.

The pandemic also created an atmosphere in which disease prevention has actually gotten harder, Dr. Gary Zimmer, chief medical officer in the Mohawk Valley Health System, argued. Too many people believe health misinformation, which has proliferated, and don't trust the advice coming from public health professionals, he said.

“I think that we'll be better prepared to respond to whatever the next outbreak is from a health system perspective,” Zimmer said.

But the public might be even less willing to follow the advice of public health officials given “such weaponization of information right now”, exacerbating any outbreak, he added.

“It's very interesting to me,” Zimmer said, “how it has been turned into some political agenda, which is a shame.”

One of the biggest benefits of the pandemic lockdown was simply a fortunate side effect. With people staying home when they got sick, with people spending less time together in general and with people wearing masks, almost no one caught the flu during the first and second winter of COVID-19, Zimmer said.

But the discovery that flu really is preventable hasn't changed much or prevented the rampant spread of flu, COVID-19, RSV and norovirus this winter.

Too many people aren't wearing masks when they're sniffling or coughing, or staying home from work when they're sick, Zimmer said. And too many people don't trust vaccines, he said.

“To me, it's mind boggling that we didn't learn our lesson,” he said.

He blamed conspiracy theories and the “politicization of science.”

“People don't trust what they're seeing (from public health officials),” Zimmer said. “I think we do know (best practices). I worry that that information is not being widely adopted.”

Health care providers and public health officials are doing a better job of reacting to outbreaks of illness, he added. But that's not enough.

They need to get better at giving the public proactive messages about, for example, what to do when flu cases are rising: stay home, don't go to the emergency room with sniffles, take a decongestant, stay well hydrated, don't get other people sick, Zimmer said.

“Those, we still have more work to do,” he said, “to be able to get the word out to the community in a way that they believe it's coming from a good place for their own health and welfare.”

Health care providers and public health officials did learn a lot during the country's first pandemic in a century. That knowledge led to new protocols, procedures and data collection in hospitals for infection prevention, treatment and tracking, Zimmer said.

In the Mohawk Valley Health System, the changes were as small as more masks kept at the front desk, ready for visitors with respiratory symptoms, and the end of the salad bar and self-serve soup in the cafeteria, said Caitlin McCann, vice president of marketing and communications.

 Wynn Hospital in Utica also restricted the public to accessing the hospital through its front door and emergency department door to improve security, but also to make it easier to ensure that infection control procedures are followed, McCann said.

The hospital has also put formal visiting hours back in place, no longer allowing visitors to stay past 8 p.m., except in special circumstances, to minimize exposure to infections, said Zimmer, who said he's spoken to colleagues about changes since he did not work at the hospital during the height of the pandemic.

In one sense, the pandemic came along at a fortuitous time for MVHS since it was still designing Wynn Hospital, which opened in October, 2023.

A few things in the hospital's design were changed based on what doctors learned about infection control and dealing with outbreaks during the pandemic, Zimmer said.

One big change was the inclusion of better isolation capabilities, he said. For example, an entire pod with 10 beds in the emergency department can turn into a negative pressure unit, which stops the spread of infection outside the room, if needed.

That's in addition to regular negative pressure rooms in the department, Zimmer said.

And there are more inpatient isolation units than had originally been planned, he said.

On a treatment level, doctors learned a lot about managing an infectious respiratory illness when resources, especially beds and ventilators, were tight, Zimmer said. As the pandemic progressed, they got better at deciding exactly which patients needed to be in the hospital; managing low-oxygen patients when there weren't enough ventilators, treating patients on other oxygen-delivering devices and managing patients on ventilators or other devices outside the intensive care unit, he said.

The pandemic changed “the dynamic about the care of contagious people and people with respiratory illnesses very dramatically,” Zimmer said.

And hospitals also learned about preparation.

 “We have lot of ventilators (now),” Zimmer said.

Rome Health also learned from capacity issues during the pandemic.

“COVID-19 was a catalyst for Rome Health to refocus efforts to ensure access to care was available in Rome,” said Cassie Winter, vice president of communications and marketing. “With regional demand exceeding capacity, we needed to be ale to provide the care locally because of the difficulty of transferring patients due to a lack of capacity at tertiary care facilities and the lack of ambulance availability due to staffing shortages.”

Winter also noted another big change that has done a lot to increase access to care: telehealth. Medicare, Medicaid and insurers wouldn't generally pay for providers for services delivered through telehealth before the pandemic. But that changed during the pandemic and telehealth continues to be used far more frequently.

And now providers all have telehealth infrastructure for smoother transitions during future crises, Winter said.

 “For example, during the snow emergencies this season,” she said, “some in-person visits could be converted to telehealth and some job functions could telecommute.”

One of the biggest impacts of the pandemic on health care has been how difficult it's gotten to hire and retain employees in every department, Zimmer said.

And for workers not involved in direct patient care, commutes have become a major problem, he said.

“People have opportunities to work in a lot of other areas that don't require them to drive to work every day,” he said.

There are even fewer volunteers now than before the pandemic, Winter said.

And burnout and anxiety from the pandemic continue to plague many clinical workers, which has contributed to staffing shortages, she said.

For registered nurses, the job with the highest gap between need and employees, the vacancy rate across the Iroquois Healthcare Association's member hospitals and health systems was 15.4% as of January, Ford said. That translates to over 2,600 unfilled nursing jobs, she said.

And in the long term care facilities run by the association's members, about 20% of positions for R.N.'s, licensed practical nurses and certified nursing assistants are unfilled, limiting facilities' capacity to care for patients just when the demand for services is rising, Ford said.

There's also a big shortage of behavioral health workers and a physician shortage that cuts down on services and leads to lower revenues, Ford said.

Even vacancies among, for example, patient registration clerks, affects operations and patient experience “in really meaningful ways,” she said.

With all the staffing issues, hospitals have been forced to hire workers, particularly nurses, who work for agencies and take on jobs per diem, Ford said. During the pandemic, these nurses made up staffing shortfalls given the surge in patients.

But hospitals have continued to rely on them to make up for unfilled positions, she said. At the height of reliance on them in 2022, some hospitals' costs for contract labor went up as much as 300% to 400%, she said. That year association member hospitals spent close to $1.2 billion on contract labor, Ford said.

By 2024, that had fallen to about $700 million, but that's still considerably more than they spent before the pandemic, she said.

Hospitals are trapped in a vicious cycle in which the cost of travel nurses prevents them from offering the kinds of compensation packages that would help them to hire the permanent staffing they'd prefer, Ford said.

Some hospitals never even used travel nurses before the pandemic, but they now form a consistent percentage of everyone's workforce, she said.

“I think there's just been a fundamental change in staffing models,” she said.

Total labor expenses for area hospitals and health systems have gone up 37% since 2019, Ford said. And other expenses have risen sharply, too, with medication showing the sharpest increase, she said.

And that's all contributed to financial struggles for hospitals and health systems. By the end of 2023, 60% of hospitals in the association had negative operating margins, Ford said. Things improved somewhat in 2024 given strong investments in health care by the federal and state governments, she said.

But some hospitals remained in the red and very few reached the 2.5% operating margins that experts in hospital finance believe to be healthy, Ford said.

And that means that the final state budget and the federal government's decisions on how much to cut health care expenses, Ford said, will play a big role in determining the health and stability of upstate New York's hospitals.","{'href': 'https://www.uticaod.com', 'title': 'Utica Observer Dispatch'}"

Yesterday the Health Impact Investment Platform (HIIP) held its inaugural Steering Committee meeting, marking a significant milestone in advancing innovative financing for global health. As the Platform's highest decision-making body, the Committee – consisting of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank – reviewed progress, endorsed key governance and operational priorities, and provided strategic guidance on HIIP's efforts to expand primary health care (PHC) services in low- and middle-income countries. The meeting represents a significant step forward in advancing sustainable financing solutions for global health.

The HIIP was unveiled during the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris in 2023, and is a landmark partnership between WHO, multilateral development banks and beneficiary countries. Amid a US$ 371 billion annual health financing gap for health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a US$ 31.1 billion annual funding requirement for pandemic preparedness, the Platform innovates multilateral solutions to increase the share of development funding going to the health sector. Integrating technical expertise, financial resources and local knowledge into impactful, country-driven investments in vulnerable communities, the Platform has mobilized over US$ 30 million of investment for WHO to support countries in developing prioritized investment plans for potential support from MDBs and donors.

The Platform aims to use these plans to generate over US$1.5 billion funding for low- and middle-income country governments to build resilience against pandemic threats and the climate crisis.

“Primary health care is the cornerstone of equitable, cost-effective, and inclusive health systems,” said Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General at the World Health Organization. “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a transformative initiative to mobilize financing for climate-adaptive and crisis-resilient primary health care in the countries that need it most. WHO is proud to partner with multilateral development banks and countries to ensure these funds deliver tangible impact for the communities we serve.”

The First Steering Committee builds on months of progress since the Platform's official launch in September 2024, with early-stage engagements in more than 10 countries. During the meeting, Committee members approved key operational documents for the platform, reviewed Concept Notes developed to operationalize primary health care investments in Burundi, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Morocco and Zambia and formally approved the Proposal for Action in Ethiopia, unlocking funding to support the finalization of its national PHC investment plan. Members reinforced the platform's core focus on scaling primary health care investments, accelerating progress toward universal health coverage, and strengthening health system resilience in low- and middle-income countries.

Issa Faye, Director General of Global Practice and Partnerships at the Islamic Development Bank noted, “We are committed to catalyzing impactful, sustainable investments that strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Today's discussions reaffirmed our shared vision and commitment to scaling up investment in primary health care, ensuring that no country is left behind in achieving universal health coverage and pandemic preparedness.”

The next Steering Committee meeting will convene on the margins of the Seventy-Eighth World Health Assembly (19–27 May 2025), where progress on Ethiopia's investment plan and new country engagements will be reviewed.

Thomas Östros, Vice President at the European Investment Bank and the newly appointed Chair of the Steering Committee emphasized, “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a unique opportunity to bridge the health financing gap and drive sustainable investments where they are most needed. As we look ahead to the next Steering Committee, our focus remains on turning commitments into action. We call on all stakeholders to join us in expanding access to quality primary health care, ensuring that investments today translate into stronger, more resilient health systems for the future.”

Going forward, the HIIP will deepen engagements with the first wave of applicants and expand support to other interested countries. Eligible countries for the HIIP include low- and middle-income countries which are a country of operation for at least one of the partner Multilateral Development Banks. Governments seeking to strengthen PHC through tailored technical assistance and investment support are invited to express their interest via an email addressed to hiip_secretariat@who.int.

Arrive AI successfully tested health-related deliveries in suburban Boston with Massachusetts Department of Transportation

INDIANAPOLIS, March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Arrive AI participated in a demonstration of medical deliveries via drone that Massachusetts transportation officials (MassDOT) described as a success that underscores ""the value of drones for many operational needs.""

See video of that demonstration here and read more about it here. 

The demonstration with Arrive AI was conducted in Lynn, Mass. MassDOT Aeronautics already uses drones to improve transportation safety, including for infrastructure inspection and incident response, supporting MassDOT, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. 

""Drones already have proven useful with operations, including, MBTA track corridor inspections, MassDOT Highway bridge inspections, overhead project evaluations, and other needs,"" said Massachusetts Transportation Secretary and CEO Monica Tibbits-Nutt in a MassDOT news release. ""We continue to assess the use of drones for other purposes in the future.""

Dan O'Toole, founder and CEO of Arrive AI said he was confident going into the demonstration that his product would prove to be a key part of improving healthcare-related deliveries. 

""It was great to have the demonstration show the possibilities for speeding life-saving devices and items where it's needed,"" said Arrive CEO Dan O'Toole. 

Autonomous delivery is expected to be a game-changer for the package delivery industry. For organizations like hospitals and clinics, it can provide a secure way to receive important medical products, bloodwork or other life-impacting items because the Arrive AI mailbox offers a clear chain-of-command control over the delivery chain and also a climate-controlled space for the products. Arrive AI has demonstrated its patented product in several health-care venues and anticipates working with medical facilities throughout the country. 

""In an era where every second counts, Arrive AI's innovative approach to secure drone delivery is setting new standards for healthcare logistics. By integrating advanced tracking, authentication, and secure holding solutions, we're not just delivering packages—we're delivering peace of mind,"" O'Toole said.

Image source: University of Oulu 

A new study published in Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders highlights the potential of More Stamina, a gamified mobile health (mHealth) app designed to help people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) manage fatigue, one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of the disease. 

The research, led by researcher Dr. Guido Giunti and neurologists Dr. Mervi Ryytty and Assistant Professor Johanna Krüger from the University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital in Finland, evaluated the feasibility, usability, and impact of More Stamina over a 60-day period. “Fatigue is an invisible but life-altering symptom of MS,” said Guido Giunti, digital health expert at the University of Oulu and leader of the More Stamina project. “Managing it requires more than just medication. More Stamina gives people the tools to understand their energy levels, take control of their day, and communicate their needs more effectively.”

The study followed 20 participants from Oulu University Hospital, who used the app daily for two months. Findings revealed that: 

More Stamina helps users track their daily activities and energy expenditure using “Stamina Credits”, a gamified approach that visualizes energy use and helps users make informed decisions about their daily plans. Unlike many digital health solutions, More Stamina stands out for its research-driven approach at every stage, from identifying patient needs to design, prototyping, development, and testing. Each phase has been accompanied by peer-reviewed research, creating a transparent scientific trail for a mobile health solution. “Digital health solutions are only as good as their foundation,” said professor Minna Isomursu, expert in user-centered design and co-author of the study. “We worked with real patients and healthcare professionals from the start to build something truly useful. That is key to creating tools that people actually find useful in their daily lives.” 

Many different forms, unclear origins: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological diseases that often leads to disability in those affected. Read more about current research and therapeutic approaches to MS.

Fatigue affects up to 80% of MS patients and has a profound impact on their quality of life. Managing fatigue is challenging, as it involves physical, cognitive, and emotional factors, often leaving patients feeling exhausted, misunderstood, and unsupported. While digital health solutions have been increasingly proposed to help manage chronic conditions like MS, few have been rigorously evaluated to ensure their effectiveness and real-world impact. Neurologists at Oulu University Hospital emphasize the potential of such solutions in complementing traditional MS care. ""Managing MS fatigue has always been a challenge, as it varies from person to person,"" said Dr. Mervi Ryytty, neurologist at Oulu University Hospital. ""Having a tool that helps patients visualize and plan their energy levels can make a real difference in how they manage their symptoms."" 

We need to move beyond gimmicks and ensure digital health solutions are truly beneficial

While the study confirmed that More Stamina is a feasible and acceptable tool, researchers emphasize that larger and longer-term studies are needed to evaluate its full clinical impact. The team is now exploring ways to integrate More Stamina into broader MS care strategies: ""This study reinforces the role of digital health solutions in MS care,"" added Dr. Johanna Krüger, neurologist at Oulu University Hospital “Now we need to refine it, expand access, and ensure that digital tools like this one can become an effective and seamless part MS care.” 

One of the unexpected yet powerful outcomes of the study was the role More Stamina played in facilitating conversations between MS patients and their families. Many participants reported that sharing their fatigue patterns with loved ones helped them feel understood and supported. “Invisible fatigue is hard to explain to those who don't experience it, especially since I do not always understand it myself,"" said Tonja Molin-Juustila, a patient representative involved in the project. ""More Stamina gives you a concrete tool to look at fatigue and discuss it with the family. Instead of repeating ‘I'm so tired now', it becomes ‘It seems you need to rest more often'. This makes a huge difference, turning the interaction from perceived guilt into mutual understanding.” 

The app's development was not just about technology, it was about people. Active participation from patient representatives was key to ensuring that the app addressed real-life challenges. Beyond its success in MS fatigue management, by combining scientific rigor, user-centered design, and real-world testing, this project has created a blueprint for how digital solutions should be developed and integrated into healthcare. ""We need to move beyond gimmicks and ensure digital health solutions are truly beneficial,"" said Dr. Guido Giunti. ""The way we've worked with More Stamina is proof that when we bring together science, technology, and patient voices, we can create tools that actually improve lives. We hope this approach sets a new standard for future digital health solutions.”

Oops, something went wrong

Google on Tuesday announced new products and features aimed at healthcare use cases, including improved overviews in Google Search for health queries, medical records APIs, and new health-focused ""open"" AI models.

In Search, Google says it's using AI and ranking systems to expand ""knowledge panel"" answers on thousands of health-related topics, and adding support for healthcare queries in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese on mobile. Search already provided knowledge panel answers for ailments such as the flu or the common cold, but the update greatly expands the number of topics the knowledge panels cover, the company said.

Google is also debuting a Search feature it's calling ""What People Suggest"" on mobile in the U.S. to highlight content from users with shared experiences relating to health conditions. For instance, if someone asks about common exercises for people dealing with arthritis, What People Suggest will collate reports from various forums around the web using AI.

What People Suggest builds on capabilities like Google's personal health stories feature on YouTube, and seems pretty clearly aimed at keeping people from leaving Search for Reddit and other sources of health advice.

""While people come to Search to find reliable medical information from experts, they also value hearing from others who have similar experiences,"" Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer at Google, wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. ""Using AI, we're able to organize different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes, helping you quickly grasp what people are saying.""

Google on Tuesday also launched new medical records APIs globally for its Health Connect platform for Android devices. These will help collect data from medical providers and let users see this data across different apps, as well as make it easier to access the info on devices like phones, Google said.

""These APIs enable apps to read and write medical record information like allergies, medications, immunizations, and lab results in standard FHIR format,"" DeSalvo explained in the blog post. ""With these additions, Health Connect supports over 50 data types across activity, sleep, nutrition, vitals, and now medical records — making it easier to connect your everyday health data with data from your doctor's office.""

In other product announcements pertaining to health, Google said that the Loss of Pulse Detection feature on its Pixel Watch 3 smartwatch, which has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will launch by the end of March in the U.S. The feature can detect when you've experienced a loss of pulse — for example, due to primary cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning — and automatically prompt a call to emergency services if you're unresponsive.

Google also unveiled new open AI models for drug discovery called TxGemma, following the company's launch of a collection of Gemini AI models for multimodal use cases in healthcare. TxGemma is set to be released in the coming weeks.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}"

The Yukon Party wants to see U.S. doctors set up shop in the Yukon — and they want to see the governing Liberals do everything they can to help facilitate that.

In the legislative assembly on March 13, Lake Laberge MLA Brad Cathers presented a motion urging the government to start taking steps to recruit American healthcare workers, including setting up a marketing campaign, allowing U.S.-certified doctors, surgeons and specialists to practice in the territory, and speeding up the licensing of American nurses and other healthcare workers.

As the News has reported, the territory is experiencing a physician shortage. None of the visiting physicians who practiced in the territory in 2024 put down roots, and a surgeon left the territory, stating the “systemic underfunding” of the territory's surgical services as a reason.

Geraldine Van Bibber, MLA for Porter Creek North, referenced the tumultuous political climate stateside in question period.

“Right now, given what is going on south of the border, there seems to be a unique opportunity to recruit American doctors who wish to leave the U.S.,” said Van Bibber, referencing Nova Scotia's 2023 move to allow American board-certified physicians to practice in the province without extra certification.

“Will the Government of Yukon take steps to quickly allow U.S. board-certified doctors, surgeons, and specialists to practise in the Yukon?”

The B.C. government is currently crafting a similar approach. According to a March 11 press release, that government is working with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. to allow American doctors, certified with the American Board of Medical Specialties to become fully licensed to work in B.C. “without the need for further assessment, examination or training.”

The release also says the province is working with the B.C. College of Nurses and Midwives to hasten the process of getting U.S.-registered nurses working in British Columbian healthcare.

With the new process, the B.C. government said that American nurses can apply directly to the college for licensing.

In answering Van Bibber's question, Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai said that the territorial department of community services is working closely like the health department to recruit healthcare workers.

In his response Pillai also mentioned a collaborative letter of intent about health human resources which signed between the Yukon and Nova Scotia on July 26, 2023.

A press release issued at the time said the two jurisdictions will “share best practices on the recruitment, retention and training of health care providers, including the credentialing and licensing of internationally educated health providers.”

He referenced the territory's newly-launched navigator system for foreign healthcare workers looking to become licensed and practice in the territory.

Health Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee said the government is working with regulators — as well as provinces, territories and the feds — to find ways to get physicians licensed, including internationally-educated ones.

She also said YG's goal is a recruiting system geared towards all sorts of internationally-trained healthcare workers, not just Americans.

Outside the legislature, Cathers told reporters he and his party want to see a marketing campaign promoting the Yukon, directly targeted at healthcare workers in the United States.

“There's a unique opportunity to, to go after them right now, to reach out to those people and to encourage them to come and work here,” Cathers said.

Cathers said YG needs to be competitive with other jurisdictions in terms of offers to attract healthcare workers. He said incentives should target American healthcare workers interested in moving north and providing service to Yukoners.

On March 17, Cathers and Yukon Party leader Currie Dixon asked questions about attracting U.S. healthcare workers in the legislative session, continuing the push from the previous week.

Not far from the joint police/fire rescue building along Northwest Martin Luther King Ave. is a place that offers health care for those underserved and anyone needing quality care.

Recently, a Star-Banner reporter went to the center and spoke with CEO Levonda Goodson.

Here's what we know:

Estella Byrd Whitman Community Health Center at 819 NW Seventh St., a non-profit primary health care clinic. Ironically, the location is on the grounds that used to be the home of Estella Byrd Whitman.

Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m.-4 p.m., and Friday from 8 a.m.-2 p.m. It's closed on Saturday and Sunday, and is staffed with three nurse practitioners and a medical director.

It was founded in 2009 by Carolyn Adams, Dr. Pamela Lewin and the late Arthur Adams. Estella Byrd Whitman Community Health Center got its name from Carolyn Adams' grandmother, Estella Byrd Whitman. The goal is to fulfill a promise of establishing a medical venue/home for those living in Tucker Hill, an historic Black community that's on the same street as the center. It was established because residents living in the area didn't have easy access to health care. And secondly, it was a way to treat the underserved. The center opened its doors in 2009 at St. Paul AME Church, which is a few yards away. Through donations and support from city officials, the center entered its present building in 2018.

On average, anywhere from 12 to 15 per day. Patients come from Ocala, Summerfield, Belleview and Citrus County. The staff provide services to those who are underserved, in between jobs, can't afford health insurance or people with insurance.

Multiple, to include regular check-ups, vaccinations, health screenings and primary care services.

Yes, along with walk-ins, sliding fee scales based on income and anyone who needs assistance. Goodson said their goal is to be an impact to the community which fuels them to move forward. She said they thrive on patient care, which is most important to the staff. For appointments, call (352) 875-2226.

Several days ago, SMA Healthcare announced they were partnering with the center for primary care services at its main facility in southwest Ocala. The northwest Ocala health center will start the care in April, according to a news release. The center won the non-profit of the year award that came from the Ocala/Marion County Community Foundation at their Inspire Gala held March 8.

Presently, they're working on funding to get another building so they can expand services for patients under one roof. The center is hosting a spring fund raising event on April 6 from 4-8 p.m. at The Reilly Arts Center at 500 NE Ninth St. The theme is a Roaring 20's Gangster and guests can wear clothing that matched the occasion.

Novak Djokovic co-founded the PTPA in 2020

The players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic has begun legal action against tennis' governing bodies, citing ""anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare"".

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has filed papers at the United States District Court in New York, where it is seeking a jury trial.

The 163-page lawsuit, which has been seen by BBC Sport, says ""professional tennis players are stuck in a rigged game"" which gives them ""limited control over their own careers and brands"".

It criticises the schedule, ranking systems and control over image rights.

The complaint is being brought by the PTPA and 12 players - including Djokovic's co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios. The PTPA says it is acting ""on behalf of the entire player population"".

Formed in 2020, the PTPA wants to increase the power of the players, and reduce the control of the governing bodies.

The ATP Tour, the men's professional body, said it ""strongly rejects the premise of the PTPA's claims"", declaring the case to be ""entirely without merit"" and promising to ""vigorously defend"" its position.

In a statement,, external it accused the PTPA of having ""consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress"" and said the ATP ""remains committed to working in the best interests of the game"".

The WTA, which runs the women's tour, also said it will defend its position and said in a statement the legal action is ""both regrettable and misguided"".

It added: ""Contesting this baseless legal case will divert time, attention, and resources from our core mission to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole.""

The lawsuit seeks an end to ""monopolistic control"" of the tennis tour, as well as financial compensation from the ATP, the WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

The organisation has also started legal proceedings in the UK and the EU to end what it considers the ""unchecked authority of the sport's governing bodies"".

""Tennis is broken,"" said Ahmad Nassar, the executive director of the PTPA, who told the BBC in October the organisation would have no qualms about going down this route.

""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.

""We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.

""Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis - it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.""

The ITF and the ITIA say they do not wish to comment at this stage.

'Sport was a big release' - how autism helps Brooksby on court

The PTPA believes, external the governing bodies act as a ""cartel"" by forming agreements with tournaments that cap prize money and prevent potential competitors entering the market.

The union describes the ranking points system as ""draconian"" as it effectively forces a player to enter their tournaments in order to build a status and reputation as a professional.

The lawsuit also takes aim at an ""unsustainable"" schedule which runs for 11 months of the year, and can require players to compete in excessive heat or in the early hours of the morning.

It alleges players suffer serious wrist, elbow and shoulder injuries because the type of ball used changes regularly throughout the season - and that the governing bodies' control of image rights diverts money from players' pockets.

The ITIA is accused of a ""gross invasion of privacy"" for searching the phones of players under suspicion of corruption or doping offences.

The ATP Tour is staging 60 events across 29 countries this year, and also runs its own Challenger Tour. The ATP says it distributed $241.6m to players in 2023 through prize money, bonuses and retirement plan contributions.

The WTA, which is offering 51 tournaments across 26 countries this season, said it paid out record prize money of $221m in 2024. It has also just introduced paid maternity leave for the first time.

Players have frequently complained they do not receive a high enough percentage of the revenue generated by the sport, especially the four Grand Slams.

It was the driving force behind Djokovic's desire to form the PTPA.

The Grand Slams tried to develop the concept of a Premium Tour - featuring a streamlined season and greater financial rewards - but have so far found too many obstacles in their path.

Pospisil says the lawsuit is about ""fairness, safety and basic human dignity"".

""I'm one of the more fortunate players and I've still had to sleep in my car when traveling to matches early on in my career,"" Pospisil added.

""Imagine an NFL player being told that he had to sleep in his car at an away game. It's absurd and would never happen. No other major sport treats its athletes this way.""

""It is time for free-market forces to enter professional tennis,"" said Drew Tulumello of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm instructed by the PTPA.

The PTPA looks enviously at the rewards earned by players in team sports such as football, NFL, baseball and basketball - and also the more comparable sport of golf.

Many of those who joined the breakaway LIV Tour now enjoy even greater wealth but have lost the ranking points which facilitate entry into the major championships.

Saudi Arabia's intervention caused much bitterness and the new tour changed golf dramatically.

The PTPA's methods are very different, but they could yet have a similar effect.

Former World No. 1 Iga Swiatek posted a lengthy explanation on social media this week after the tennis pro faced heavy criticism for nearly hitting a ball boy out of frustration during her semifinal loss at the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, last week. 

During the third set of the match, a ball boy tossed a ball in Swiatek's direction, which she then immediately swatted back at him – just missing him.

The ball hit the ground and deflected into the crowd behind the ball boy, prompting a harsh reaction from fans in the stands. That criticism continued on social media in the days that followed the Friday match.

On Monday, Swiatek responded with a lengthy post explaining the situation and also calling out the double standard of fans. 

""I see there's been a lot of recent talk about changes in my on-court behavior and emotions. Although I'm not comfortable explaining myself, it's time I share my perspective to stop the speculation and baseless theories,"" her post began.

""First, about the incident during my last match. It's true - I expressed frustration in a way I'm not proud of. My intention was never to aim the ball at anyone but merely to release my frustration by bouncing it on the ground. I immediately apologized to the ball boy, we made eye contact, and nodded to each other when I expressed regret that it happened near him.""

Swiatek said she has seen many players ""bounce balls in frustration"" and was surprised by the criticism she received for it.

TENNIS STAR IGA SWIATEK ACCEPTS 1-MONTH SUSPENSION FOR BANNED SUBSTANCE

""I didn't expect such harsh judgments. Usually, I control such impulses, so half-jokingly I can say I lack experience in this and misjudged my aim in the heat of the moment.""

Swiatek also lamented the ""constant judgement"" she said she is subjected to. 

""When I'm highly focused and don't show many emotions on court, I'm called a robot, my attitude labeled as inhuman. Now that I'm more expressive, showing feelings or struggling internally, I'm suddenly labeled immature or hysterical. That's not a healthy standard-especially considering that just six months ago, I felt my career was hanging by a thread, spent three weeks crying daily, and didn't want to step on the court.""

Swiatek made reference to her recent doping scandal, when, in August, she tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, or TMZ. The results of that test were made public in November and the International Tennis Integrity Agency accepted her explanation that the result was unintentional and caused by the contamination of the non-prescription medication melatonin that she was taking for issues with jet lag and sleeping.

""Today, after everything I've been through, I'm still processing and coming to terms with those experiences. Will sharing this change anything? Probably not, because I clearly see how much we love judging, creating theories, and imposing opinions on others. But perhaps a few people who genuinely want to understand what I'm experiencing will understand this. In any case, this external standard is definitely not my standard, and I don't accept my team and me being boxed into external expectations.""

Iga Swiatek is ""not proud"" of the way she took her frustration in Indian Wells out on a ball boy but has criticised the ""standards"" she faces in her behaviour as ""not healthy"".

The world number two was heavily criticised on social media for appearing to hit a ball towards a boy during her semi-final loss to Mirra Andreeva.

A video shows Poland's Swiatek swiping angrily at a ball thrown to her by a ball boy, with the ball landing close to him before bouncing into the stands.

The 23-year-old wrote a lengthy social media post on Monday addressing the incident, as well as the scrutiny of her behaviour and the emotional impact of her one-month doping ban.

""I immediately apologised to the ball boy, we made eye contact, and nodded to each other when I expressed regret that it happened near him,"" the five-time major champion wrote., external

""I've seen many players bounce balls in frustration, and frankly, I didn't expect such harsh judgments.

""Working on oneself isn't something you achieve once and keep forever. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back.""

Swiatek has not reached a final this year, with her last title coming at the French Open last June.

She added she was ""not comfortable explaining myself"" but wanted to share her perspective ""to stop the speculation and baseless theories"".

""When I'm highly focused and don't show many emotions on court, I'm called a robot, my attitude labelled as inhuman,"" she said. 

""Now that I'm more expressive, showing feelings or struggling internally, I'm suddenly labelled immature or hysterical.

""That's not a healthy standard – especially considering that just six months ago, I felt my career was hanging by a thread, spent three weeks crying daily, and didn't want to step on the court.

""Today, after everything I've been through, I'm still processing and coming to terms with those experiences.""

Swiatek tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in August, when she was world number one.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted the test result was caused by contamination.

She missed three tournaments during her ban, with Aryna Sabalenka ultimately replacing her at the top of the world rankings in October.

Swiatek will be the second seed at the Miami Open, which begins on Tuesday.

The sporting world has a new power couple after a US tennis star went public with his relationship with another famous athlete.

The world has another sporting power couple after American tennis star Ben Shelton went public with his relationship with champion soccer player Trinity Rodman.

Shelton posted a photo to Instagram on Tuesday of the pair looking cosy in an elevator together, and was quickly inundated with comments about the couple's “hard launch”.

“I been focused, but I'm steady climbin', I'm nowhere near my peak,” Shelton captioned his photo dump.

Average of 9 LIVE Regular Season games per week plus the best of the NBA Playoffs, including every game of the NBA Conference Finals & NBA Finals LIVE with ESPN on Kayo Sports. New to Kayo? Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer.

Rodman commented: “Shooters shoot I guess” with a smiling face and the eyes emoji.

2023 US Open champion Coco Gauff said: “Hard launchhhhh!!”

Fellow tennis player Frances Tiafoe commented: “We gram now” with several eyes emojis.

Another follower commented: “The hard launch OMG”.

Tennis guru Bastien Fachian wrote on X: “Ben Shelton goes Instagram official with USWNT soccer superstar Trinity Rodman.

“Objectively a direct entry into the top 10 best-looking sports couples in the world.”

Shelton, 22, is the World No. 17 — he made the semi-finals of this year's Australian Open and last week lost to eventual champion Jack Draper in the quarterfinals at Indian Wells. 

The lefthander burst onto the scene with a run to the 2023 US Open semi-finals and has emerged as a rising star of American tennis thanks to his big serve, forehand and personality on and off court. 

Rodman, also 22, plays as forward for the Washington Spirit in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and the United States women's national team. 

She was a member of the US team that won the gold medal at last year's Paris Olympics — the fifth time the American women had won the event.

Rodman's Washington Spirit defeated the Orlando Pride in the NWSL Challenge Cup earlier this month. 

In December, the footballer opened up on her strained relationship with her father, five-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman. 

Trinity was a guest on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast — entitled, “The Truth About My Family” — and revealed her difficult upbringing because Rodman's partying lifestyle with “random b–hes” wasn't a suitable environment for her to live in.

“We had an Expedition and we kind of lived in that for a little bit,” Trinity told host Alex Cooper, who mentioned that some might assume money wasn't an issue for her growing up. “We tried to live with him but he's having parties 24/7, he is bringing random b–ches in,” Trinity said. 

“He loves the spotlight. He loves the cameras.”

Rodman was known for his wild partying lifestyle — including his whirlwind marriage to model Carmen Electra at A Little Chapel of Flowers in Las Vegas that lasted just a few months.

Trinity's mother is Michelle Moyer, Rodman's third wife. Moyer filed for divorce in 2004 and it officially went through in 2012.

The Chicago Bulls great has two other children.

Trinity went on to recall the emotional moment she and Rodman shared when he surprised her at a Spirit victory during an NWSL playoff game in November 2021.

The USWNT forward explained that it wasn't a happy reunion like the public had thought.

Trinity went on to recall the emotional moment she and Rodman shared when he surprised her at a Spirit victory during an NWSL playoff game in November 2021.

The USWNT forward explained that it wasn't a happy reunion like the public had thought.

“I lost hope in ever getting him back, I answer the phone now for my conscience to be like, ‘He needed to hear my voice' before anything happens. That's why I answer the phone, not for me. He's not a dad maybe by blood but nothing else.”

Trinity explained that she hadn't spoken about her father in depth because she wanted to protect his image — but she admitted it became difficult to stay silent because of her pent-up anger.

“We never want to make him look bad, and that is at the cost of kind of holding it in a lot,” she said. “I guess it's just like the anger that I haven't really been able to let out is difficult for me.”

Rodman responded, writing on social media: “Sorry I wasn't the Dad you wanted me to be but either way I still tried and I still Try and Never will Stop,”, including a video that showed photos of them through the years.

“I will keep trying even when you're being told as an adult not to respond to my phone calls. “I will try even when it's difficult and if it takes a long time.

“I'm always here and tell you all the time (even if it's over voicemail) … how proud I am.

“I always had one wish and it was I wish my kids would call me and come see me.

“Hopefully one day I can get that. I'm here and I'm still trying pick up the phone you have my number, You see me calling, I'm still here Dennis RODMAN - Dad.

“FYI: I watch you play All the time (actually flew in to watch you play and was told not to show up because who I was with instead and me just wanting to support you.

“So I watched you from my hotel balcony just to make everybody happy. I love All My Kids,” Rodman concluded, adding the hashtags, “untold' and “stories”.

American tennis star Ben Shelton and USWNT star Trinity Rodman made their relationship official on Monday when Shelton posted a picture of the couple on Instagram.

Fans had been speculating this month that the two sports stars were an item, especially after Shelton and Rodman made similar TikToks with the same sound seemingly directed to each other. Shelton's caption said ""T****** wsp with u,"" which fans figured spelled ""Trinity."" Rodman's caption said ""_ _ _ wassup w you,"" seemingly spelling out ""Ben."" These videos were both posted on March 6.

Shelton's fellow American tennis players couldn't contain their excitement when the 22-year-old posted on Instagram. Frances Tiafoe commented ""We gram now"" with three eye emojis, while both Coco Gauff and Sloane Stephens commented ""hard launch"" on the post.

Shelton will begin his Miami Open campaign on Friday, and it'll be fun to see whether Rodman appears in his player's box at some point during the tournament. Rodman and the Washington Spirit will be hosting the Kansas City Current this Saturday.

Rodman helped the USWNT secure a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer by scoring three goals during their run. Shelton skipped out on the Olympics last summer to instead focus on his hard court season ahead of the U.S. Open, where he lost in the third round.

Ben Shelton's Indian Wells campaign was ended by eventual champion Jack Draper but it appears the tennis star had a shoulder to cry on. 

On the eve of the Miami Open, Shelton and USWNT star Trinity Rodman shocked fans when they made their relationship Instagram official Monday. 

Shelton shared a series of photos of off-court moments to his profile, and buried amongst them was the revealing snap. 

Shelton, 22, and Rodman, also 22, were captured in a loved-up pose with the soccer player wrapping her arm around her tennis beau's neck and plating a kiss on his cheek while he snapped the moment in an elevator mirror. 

'I been focused, but I'm steady climbin', I'm nowhere near my peak,' wrote Ben in the post's caption. 

The post contained other snaps, including Shelton posing with his dad - former tennis pro Bryan Shelton - and a friend outside a private jet. 

But it was the 'hard launch' that captured the attention of fans - and the tennis world. 

Shelton's on-tour friends rushed to share their support with fellow Americans Coco Gauff and Frances Tiafoe flooding the comments. 

'hard launchhhhh !!,' an excited Gauff, the World No 3 and Shelton's mixed doubles partner, wrote. 

'We gram now,' Tiafoe added, alongside a series of side-eye emojis. 

Meanwhile, Rodman, who is the daughter of NBA icon Dennis Rodman, commented, writing, 'Shooters shoot I guess.' 

The couple first spoarked romance rumors earleir this month when fans became convinced that they were flirting over social media. 

Shelton posted a TikTok video of him listening to GloRilla and Jorjiana's song, 'ILBB2,' which includes the lyrics, 'They say shooters shoot Duke Dennis whats up with you.'

Text appeared across the video which read, 'T****** wsp with u,' leading fans to believe he was referring to Rodman.

🔫

Rodman then seemingly responded with a video of her own, in which she mouthed the same lyrics with the text across the screen reading, '_ _ _ wassup w you.'

Rodman was previously in a relationship with NFL wide receiver Trinity Benson, going public with their relationship last May in an Instagram post that was captioned: 'Trinity squared.' 

It is unclear when the Olympic gold medalist and Benson, who hasn't played in the NFL since 2022, split. 

The Washington Spirit player made headlines back in December when she took aim at her famous father. 

Trinity hit out at her 'alcoholic' father, Dennis Rodman, in an astonishing appearance on Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy podcast. 

She accused Dennis of being absent for the majority of her life while claiming he is only her father 'by blood'.

'He's not a dad,' she told Cooper. 'Maybe by blood, but nothing else.'

'We tried to live with him,' Trinity added, likely referring to herself and brother DJ. 'But he's having parties 24/7, bringing random b****es in. He loves the spotlight'

After the damning interview, Dennis sent an apology to Trinity on Instagram, insisting he will keep trying to fix things with her no matter how long it takes.

However, Rodman's attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter has not gone down well, with Trinity instead claiming she is 'done' with him in a furious response.

Throughout his career Rodman was known just as much for his partying antics as he was for his legendary defensive and rebounding skills over two decades in professional basketball.

When he bowed out from the sport in 2006 those antics didn't slow down, and he has since sought treatment for alcohol abuse.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}"

Something went wrong

Novak Djokovic, Nick Kyrgios and other tennis stars are suing the ATP and WTA Tours, as well as the International Tennis Federation, in multiple jurisdictions.

The striking move comes as part of a wider claim from the Professional Tennis Players Association, the organisation set up by 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic in conjunction with former player Vasek Pospisil.

“The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades,” a statement read.

Among the complaints are the tennis schedule, exploitation of players, player welfare and suppression of competition between tournaments.

And leading lawyers have told City AM that those involved – the ATP Tour, WTA Tour, International Tennis Federation and International Tennis Integrity Agency – will likely prefer mediation rather than the events being played out in public.

This news should come as no surprise, Church Court Chambers sports barrister Yasin Patel said. “The ‘deal' regarding the [men's world No1 Jannik] Sinner drugs allegations, the unbearable playing conditions in some tournaments, many players complaining of a two-tier system of payment, the lack of transparency from governing bodies and little say on all of these subjects has meant that players have almost reached the end of their tether.

“The governing bodies will have to mediate and negotiate with players and the landscape will have to change as a result. Otherwise, much of the tennis profession's ‘dirty linen' will be washed in public.”

Kyrgios has raised issues with the length and format of bans for both Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner, after they tested positive for prohibited substances. Sinner is serving a ban having won the Australian Open but will be back in time for the next Grand Slam, the French Open. Swiatek's month-long suspension was not made public at the time.

And there has been growing discontent with some events and Grand Slams forcing players to play deep into the night to satisfy television audiences.

Pospisil, a former Wimbledon doubles champion, said of the action: “This is not just about money, it's about fairness, safety, and basic human dignity.

“I'm one of the more fortunate players and I've still had to sleep in my car when travelling to matches early on in my career. Imagine an NFL player being told that he had to sleep in his car at an away game? It's absurd and would never happen, obviously. No other major sport treats its athletes this way.

“The governing bodies force us into unfair contracts, impose inhumane schedules, and punish us for speaking out. The legal actions taken today are about fixing tennis for today's players and future generations.

“It's time for accountability, real reform, and a system that protects and empowers players. All stakeholders deserve a sport that operates with fairness and integrity.”","{'href': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance UK'}"

Tennis

When reflecting on his favourite moment of 2024 in December, Jack Draper didn't pick reaching the U.S. Open semifinal, winning his first and second ATP Tour titles, or beating Carlos Alcaraz.

He picked the aftermath of his most disappointing defeat of the year, a loss to qualifier Jesper de Jong at the French Open in May.

“When I came home from Paris, I was all over the place thinking: ‘I need to get my s— together, what am I doing? I'm not fulfilling my potential. I'm not the player I want to be,'” he told a small group of reporters in a pub in west London just before Christmas.

“When I look back over this year, that's something that actually brings me the most satisfaction. The most joy is working out certain situations and then turning into a different player.”

Draper, 23, was ranked No. 40 and having an identity crisis about his game. He had brought on former world No. 6 Wayne Ferreira to support his main coach James Trotman, and Ferreira wanted Draper to use his bulky 6ft 4in (193cm) frame more. But after a disappointing clay-court season, Draper decided instead to lean on his other talents: soft hands, athleticism, and a heavy forehand that he could blast through the court or kick up above an opponent's shoulders.

“Wayne wanted me to try to be braver,” he said.

“I suppose I needed that, but at the same time, I needed to understand that that's not the player I am as well. One of my main attributes as a player is my ability to move well for my size, and be able to get that one more ball back in court.

“That's how I won matches when I was younger, when I was small.”

Draper and Ferreira split after the grass-court season, and while Draper took some of Ferreira's advice to heart by not being so “one-paced,” he has embraced the natural variety he possesses and stormed up the tennis ranks ever since.

Last Sunday, Draper won the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. It is his first ATP Masters 1,000 title — the rung just below the Grand Slams — and it moved him into the ATP top 10 for the first time. The slow, grippy hard courts in the Californian desert reward players who can mix up their shots; witness Alcaraz, who Draper stunned in the semifinals despite being on the ropes in the third set. The 21-year-old Spaniard is perhaps the most dexterous player in the world and a two-time Indian Wells champion.

During the Indian Wells final against Holger Rune, Draper demonstrated his mental strategy, centering his vision on his thumb at changes of ends. Because he is so open about discussing the mental side of the game — including on-court anxiety — and his misfortune with injuries, the texture of his tennis and its specifics sometimes get overlooked. In the California Desert, it was in full bloom.

Draper's forehand is his most devastating ground stroke, but his backhand is his most reliable. Like another tennis southpaw, Rafael Nadal, Draper is a natural right-hander who plays left-handed, so he finds natural stability on the two-handed backhand.

“I think that really helps me, because my forehand has been improving all the time,” he said in a news conference after beating Alcaraz on Saturday. “My forehand is naturally the shot where I'm not as comfortable. It's always been my backhand which I can hit with my eyes closed.”

Draper's solidity on the backhand side is discomfiting for his opponents. Against most lefties, the go-to play for a right-hander is to try and get into a cross-court rally in which they hit their forehand to their opponent's backhand, which is typically the weaker shot.

“I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand,” Draper continued. “Usually that's something where players struggle, but with myself, that's a big strength.”

According to data from TennisViz and Tennis Data Innovations (TDI), we can see that over the last year, opponents won 42.8 percent of points when hitting cross-court forehands against Draper, compared to the tour average of 45 percent. Last week at Indian Wells, this figure for Draper's opponents was even lower, down at 41.7 percent — a significant drop below the average for one of the most important and regularly deployed shots in tennis.

By contrast, Draper's forehand was even more devastating than usual, particularly against Rune in a one-sided final. When hitting it from the middle of the court, with the choice to go to his opponent's forehand or backhand, Draper destroyed Rune's forehand, winning 100 percent of points behind that play.

Draper has worked with Trotman on his movement to stabilize the forehand, acknowledging that he used to struggle when anyone went after it — as he did to Rune Sunday.

“Any pace into it was a problem,” he told a small group of reporters on a video call.

“I remember when I played Carlos Alcaraz here a couple of years ago, I felt like I couldn't hit the skin off a rice pudding. So I just feel like I've come a long way with that.

“I think a lot of it has to do with my positioning, with my body. I've worked on that feeling of being balanced a lot on the forehand and not lifting off. I still lift off some forehands, but I feel like most of the time my commitment is to go through the ball and to feel like I'm hurting off that shot instead of it just being a kind of average, spinny ball.”

In that match against Alcaraz, he lost 6-2, 2-0 by retirement. Things looked very different in their semifinal.

Despite Draper's evolution as a player, there is still no weapon in his game bigger than his serve. That too developed relatively late, since Draper was only 5 feet 6 inches until a handy growth spurt in his mid-teens.

Speaking after his devastating serving display against Rune, Draper said: “My rhythm and my placement has been really, really good. And it's obviously a huge, huge part of my game. If I can get that right, that sets me up well for the rest of my tennis.”

At Indian Wells, Draper improved his second-serve points won from 52 percent over the last year to 54 percent. He also used his accuracy to account for the slower courts' effect on his speed, winning 78 percent of points behind serves to the T on the deuce side, and 83 percent on the ad; 40 and 39 percent of those serves went unreturned, respectively.

The serving display gave him the platform to play with more of the variety he has been striving for, mixing up his pace and coming to the net at various points. Against Ben Shelton in last week's quarterfinals, Draper somehow manoeuvred his body to hit a volley that was flying towards his chest, fell down, and got back up to win the point.

Against Rune, Draper showcased some outstanding defense to go alongside his devastating attack, winning 43 percent of points when defending, per the TDI “steal score” metric. Draper's average in the past 52 weeks is 35 percent. It was his rich mix of attacking and defending options, rather than a brute force approach, that took him to the title.

Draper is one of many ATP players who are facing up to how Alcaraz and world No. 1 Jannik Sinner have reconfigured tennis, but he appears better placed to embrace that change than some of his peers in the rankings. 1990s-born players, including world No. 2 Alexander Zverev, No. 4 Taylor Fritz and No. 6 Casper Ruud have openly said that they feel ill-positioned to adjust to the huge hitting and court coverage. Draper has studied them both carefully and gotten to know them well, too; Sinner is a friend and former doubles partner, while Draper was planning on spending the most recent off-season with Alcaraz in Spain before a hip injury intervened.

Draper is ranked No. 3 by his 2025 results, and has won 13 of his 15 matches this year, including 10 of the last 11. He heads to Miami as one of the tournament favorites, and then has very few points to defend during the clay-court swing. But the biggest challenge is the Grand Slams — the biggest tournaments in the world which bring the elongated five-set format in which Draper has struggled more in the past. His recent form, however, is making him believe he is on his way.

“I can compete consistently against top players in the world. I feel like I belong completely,” he said.

Changes in WTA tour means the days of child stars are gone, which is why 17-year-old's achievements are so significant

There are two teenagers in the top 100 of the WTA rankings at the moment. Women's tennis, in some ways, was built on the success of its child prodigies – Chris Evert, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters – who audaciously stormed towards the top in their youth, demanding attention.

Those days are long gone. Between the improved depth, physicality and professionalism at the lower levels, possibly a more sparse talent pool and the WTA's age eligibility rules restricting the number of tournaments a child can contest, it is increasingly more difficult to flit up the rankings so early.

For those reasons, the first three months of the season have been fascinating. Mirra Andreeva continued to defy trends and patterns on Sunday by winning the biggest title of her career at Indian Wells at 17 years old.

It is difficult to overstate the significance of this achievement. A few weeks after winning her first WTA 1000 title in Dubai last month, Andreeva triumphed in California by outplaying and outsmarting Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka, the two best players in the world, in consecutive three-set matches to win the title. She is now on a 12-match winning streak and has risen to No 6 with a bullet.

Before Andreeva, two players under 18 had beaten the top two in a WTA event: Steffi Graf and Serena Williams. The other teenager in the top 100, meanwhile, is the 18-year-old Australian Maya Joint, at No 80.

Despite her youth, it still feels like Andreeva has not missed any steps in her development and her recent form is right on schedule. Two years ago, Andreeva broke through, defeating two top 20 players en-route to the fourth round of the 2023 Madrid Open. Since then, she has rapidly risen up the rankings, reaching the French Open semi-finals and breaking into the top 20 last year. The obstacles she has faced and the tough lessons learned on her path have been just as important in her growth. She has endured plenty of difficult losses that sharpened her game and strengthened her character.

From the moment she emerged on the tour, it was clear Andreeva was blessed with a unique improvisational game. She possesses a large variety of shots, intelligent point construction and the ability to time the ball sweetly and redirect pace, particularly with her wicked two-handed backhand. Her game was sometimes underpowered against the top players, but as she continues to grow into an adult and gain physical strength, she has made significant offensive improvements. Her increased ball speed and weight of shot this year have allowed her to trade from the baseline with the best players as equals.

That growth was particularly on show in the final stages of her title run. Against Swiatek, Andreeva was spectacular in horrendous windy conditions, overpowering the Pole from the baseline as she lasered down-the-line backhand winners from all parts of the court. The added pace on her first serve was astonishing; the 126mph ace she struck in the first-set tiebreak is one of the fastest women's serves of all time. After trailing by a set against Sabalenka, Andreeva expertly soaked up the world No 1's enormous strokes, again serving well and dragging the Belarusian into uncomfortable parts of the court with her drop shots and low slices. At such a young age, Andreeva's game is already complete.

The momentum Andreeva has built has much to do with her blossoming partnership with the 1994 Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martínez, who Andreeva has frequently bantered with during her on-court interviews. Aside from being a quality coach – she helped Garbiñe Muguruza to a Wimbledon title in 2017 – she seems an enjoyable person to work with.

After Elena Rybakina's former coach, Stefano Vukov, was banned by the WTA for a year due to alleged emotionally abusive behaviour, which he denied, their success underlines the importance of female coaches in women's tennis, of which there are still too few.

Indian Wells 2025 will represent two young talents marking themselves as true contenders on the world stage. The next challenge for Andreeva and Jack Draper is simply to move on. The Miami Open main draw began on Tuesday with Naomi Osaka in action. While Emma Raducanu plays her first match against the 19-year-old Japanese wildcard Sayaka Ishii on Wednesday, Andreeva and the other seeded players have received a first-round bye.

In the men's draw, which will showcase Novak Djokovic's return to Miami for the first time since 2019, Draper will begin his pursuit of the “Sunshine Double” against either Jakub Mensik or Roberto Bautista Agut in round two.

The reality of being a top player and consistently making deep runs in the biggest events is that they have less time to reflect on those successes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","LeBron James reacts to teenage tennis prodigy being inspired by him","https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/lebron_james_reacts_to_teenage_tennis_prodigy_being_inspired_by_him/s1_13132_41920947","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:03:31 GMT","

If anyone is qualified to advise a teenage sporting prodigy, it's LeBron James. The Lakers star walked into the NBA as a 17-year-old and more than lived up to the hype, and continues to shatter expectations at 40.

Tennis has seen its share of teenage prodigies, but 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva promises to transcend the sport like few before her. On Sunday, she followed in Steffi Graf and Serena Williams's footsteps as the first teenager to beat the top two ranked players at the same event en route to her second ATP1000 title within a month. 

After her win, the Russian told Tennis Channel that she was inspired by an old interview with James in which the basketball legend spoke on the importance of the mental aspect in sports. Andreeva revealed she remembered James' words when she dropped the first set to World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Sunday's Indian Wells final.

""I was listening to LeBron James' interview and he was saying that even if you don't play at 100% or if you don't feel 100% physically, I'm going to choose to be 100% mentally,"" the teenager recalled. ""He said that's what makes us champions. So, I kind of tried to do the same."" 

Andreeva admitted her mind-over-matter gameplan didn't ""really work in the beginning,"" but when it did, she knew there was no stopping her.

""I managed to overcome that and really go for my shots and act like one of those legends,"" she added. 

A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)

This wasn't the first time she credited James. Andreeva praised the Lakers star after winning the Dubai Tennis Championship, her first-ever WTA1000 title, last month.

Mirra Andreeva: I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews & he said that It's easy to be confident & play good when everything goes your way, but what makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. So that's what I tried to do today. pic.twitter.com/u3pvTggjFU

James took to social media to share encouraging words for the rising tennis superstar. 

""Congratulations!! Happy to have helped, but honestly YOU did THAT!! All your hard work, drive, and dedication towards your craft! KEEP GOING!""

Andreeva has arrived in South Florida for the prestigious Miami Open, which begins this week. The teenager is trying to win a hat trick of WTA1000 titles after her wins in Dubai and Indian Wells. No teenager in tennis history, male or female, has won the Indian Wells and Miami titles, dubbed the Sunshine Double, in the same season.

The Professional Tennis Players Association issued a press release this morning to announce that it has filed a series of legal actions against a “cartel” of tennis-governing bodies that stand accused of operating a “Corrupt, Illegal and Abusive System” that amounts to a monopoly.The defendants include all the major governing bodies in the sport: the International Tennis Federation (ITF), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA). The latter oversees the game's anti-doping and anti-corruption efforts.“Tennis is broken,” Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA, said in the press release. “Behind the glamorous veneer that the Defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.”

The plaintiffs allege that the defendants “operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices.”

The ATP has since released a statement in response:""While ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.""We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.""The WTA also released a statement on social media:""The PTPA's action is both regrettable and misguided, and we will defend our position vigorously in due course.""

The PTPA was founded in 2019 by Novak Djokovic and his fellow pro, Canada's Vasek Pospisil. Their mission was to create an association dedicated solely to the well-being and interests of players in a profession that does not allow unionization. Since the start of the Open Era, pro tennis has been run by various partnerships between the players, tournaments and administrators from the named defendants.The plaintiffs allege that the defendants “operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices.” Those efforts are said to include a collusion to reduce competition that enable the cartel to pay “artificially low compensation” to the players, and to prevent potential competitors from entering the market.Also alleged: A collusion to cap prize money; a “draconian” rankings system that dictates, among other things, which tournaments a player can compete in; the imposition of an “unsustainable” rankings system; disregard for the health and well-being of the players; financial exploitation and violations of privacy rights, as exemplified by random drug tests and the confiscation of players' cell phones for the purpose of searching them.In short, this may be the first significant shot fired in a new war in a sport famous for its conflicts.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

The Professional Tennis Players Association, along with 22 players, have filed multiple lawsuits in several countries against the ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA. The suit alleges that those international tennis organizations have engaged in anticompetitive business practices that suppress their potential earnings and cast aside health and safety concerns, according to ESPN.

PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar, who has worked with the NFLPA in the past, claims that players are being exploited by aforementioned organizations.

""Tennis is broken,"" Nassar said in a statement. ""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety.""

The complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, obtained by ESPN, describes the ATP, WTA, ITF and ITIA as a ""cartel"" that works together to fix tournament prize money. The suit also alleges that some tournament owners won't even allow players to request an increase in prize money.

Other allegations include unfair name, image and likeness deals, a lower cut of revenue sharing than other professional sports, privacy violations via drug testing and poor tournament and match conditions.

The players association has filed suits in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  One of the players named in the suits is Vasek Pospisil, co-founder of the PTPA and 2014 Wimbledon doubles champion.

Pospisil explained that he began his career sleeping in his car while traveling to matches. He noted that would never be allowed to happen for rookies in the NFL or any other major league.

""I'm one of the more fortunate players and I've still had to sleep in my car when traveling to matches early on in my career -- imagine an NFL player being told that he had to sleep in his car at an away game,"" Pospisil said. ""It's absurd and would never happen, obviously. No other major sport treats its athletes this way.""

The PTPA hopes that these suits will create a handful of positive changes for the players. Among them are better scheduling, higher revenue sharing and more consideration for players' concerns.

Other notable names in the lawsuit include Nick Kyrgios, Reilly Opelka, Sorana Cirstea, Ingrid Neel and Corentin Moutet.

Nassar and Pospisil said the PTPA met with over 250 players about the suits, and the majority were supportive. However, many players were concerned about putting their name on the suits due to fear of ""repercussions.""

Since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990, ATP has played a leading role in the global growth of men's professional tennis. Throughout more than three decades, ATP's 50-50 governance structure has ensured that players and tournaments have an equal voice in shaping the sport's direction at the highest level.

Recent years have brought about transformative changes for players. The introduction of a prize money formula, record-setting on-site prize money, and new and expanded Bonus Pools have contributed to a major increase in player compensation (up $70 million in the past five years). The introduction of annual, independent audits has given players full transparency over tournament financials at ATP events. ATP's Baseline programme has introduced minimum guaranteed income for the Top 250-ranked singles players, providing unprecedented financial security in professional tennis. 

Contributions to the player pension fund have surged, while prize money at ATP Challenger Tour events has more than doubled - reinforcing ATP's commitment to strengthening the player pathway.

These advancements have been achieved through ATP's governance structure, with every key decision made with player input and by their elected representatives. Meanwhile, players - as independent contractors - have retained extensive control over their schedules, allowing them the flexibility to compete, train, and monetise their careers as they see fit.

While ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising. 

We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.

The last five years for Elon Men's Tennis have been a span of success. The Phoenix won its first Coastal Athletic Association Championship in 2019. The team has been to three more finals since, including an appearance last year after a 16-8 season. This was all under the guidance of former head coach Michael Leonard, who held the position for 20 years.

But after the conclusion of the 2023- 24 season, Leonard decided to retire from collegiate coaching, leaving an opening of no small stature. Following a two-decade coaching legacy, new men's tennis coach Maciek Sykut has big shoes to fill.

“Previous coaches at Elon have built a great foundation,” Sykut said. “It's up to me to try to continue on what's already been built.”

Sykut adds a plethora of experience to the Phoenix team. The former pro played for three years on the Association of Professional Tennis tour, reaching a career high doubles ranking of 145. After leaving the pro-circuit, Sykut became an assistant for the North Carolina State University and University of Arizona tennis team. In 2020, he joined the staff at Duke University, where the team competed in the NCAA tournament four times during his tenure at Duke.

To kick off Sykut's first season as head coach, the Phoenix have opened with a 2-5 record. The early season has been headlined by losses against the No. 16 ranked University of Tennessee and a 0-7 sweep against Old Dominion University. However, Elon was able to pick up a 5-2 win against Coastal Carolina on Feb. 28. Sykut has been encouraged by the energy his players bring to the table.

“We have a great group of kids,” Sykut said. “They've been very receptive to working hard and trying to strive for more.”

That group of players has a variety of collegiate experience. Veljko Krstic, a junior, plays at the top of the team's lineup for the team. Fellow junior Oskar Antinheimo, who was last year's team MVP, also plays in the Phoenix top three.

While older players with veteran experience still hold high positions, Elon has benefited from younger contributions. Freshman Rafael Ymer, a newcomer to the team, has played well at #2 singles for the Phoenix. Jack Curtis, a sophomore from England, regularly plays at #4 singles.

“They certainly were eager for that challenge,” Sykut said. “They've responded to it well.”

Ymer and Curtis have opened the 2025 season strong. Both have won three singles matches so far. However, the young pair share only one doubles win, a trend for the entire team.

Elon currently holds a 4-12 doubles record over six games, with the #1 pairing of Krstic and Antinheimo only achieving one collective win. For the Phoenix, victory on the doubles court is crucial.

This CAA men's tennis season will conclude at home for the Phoenix, as Elon will host the CAA tournament at the Jimmy Powell Tennis Center. It's a moment Elon's first-year head coach looks forward to.

“It's obviously a fantastic opportunity,” Sykut said. “We look to take advantage of that.”

Elon last hosted the men's championship in 2022. It's an opportunity the team is excited for. Although the start for Elon has not been perfect, Sykut hopes the culture of hard work on-and-off the court he's been building will pay off.

“We're building the habits,” Sykut said. “Habits required to do what we need to be victorious in the end.”

The team hopes to utilize those habits when the CAA comes to town in April.

                Milk is known to help strengthen bones and muscles, but for Elon sophomore Jacob Bradshaw, it has also helped him build a strong humor-filled bond with his classmates. It all started at Elon's 2024 fall organization fair where Bradshaw jokingly walked around with a piece of notebook paper asking people if they wanted to join a then-nonexistent milk club. He walked away with 70 signatures. From those 70 signatures, milk club has grown from its joke state to a legitimate organization.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Calling the groups in charge of professional tennis “a cartel,” the players' association co-founded by Novak Djokovic filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's and men's tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport's integrity agency on Tuesday in federal court in New York.

The suit by the Professional Tennis Players' Association says the organizations that run the sport hold “complete control over the players' pay and working conditions” and their setup constitutes “textbook violations of state and federal law” that “immunize professional tennis from ordinary market forces and deny professional tennis players and other industry participants their right to fair competition.”

The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and wants players to gain access to more earnings, arguing that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments — Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open — and other professional events “cap the prize money tournaments award and limit players' ability to earn money off the court.”

The WTA Tour and ATP Tour issued separate statements Tuesday saying they would “vigorously” defend themselves.

The WTA said it has “committed to a $400 million increase in player compensation” in recent years and labeled the PTPA action a “baseless legal case” that is “regrettable and misguided.” The ATP touted a “major increase in player compensation” that created a jump of “$70 million in the past five years,” and called the PTPA's case “entirely without merit.”




“The PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,” the ATP's statement said. “Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.”

The ITF and the International Tennis Integrity Agency — which investigates and adjudicates doping and corruption cases — declined to comment.

The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in August 2020, aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport. One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a sort of full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports.

“For the past few years, the PTPA, an organization I've worked on tirelessly since its inception, has made countless efforts to collaborate with the tours in hopes of achieving positive change for players. Despite these efforts and attempts to engage in constructive dialogue, we were met with resistance and a lack of meaningful action. It is because of this ongoing disregard for players that we were left with no alternative but to take action of our own,” Pospisil posted on social media. “For too long, players have been forced to accept a broken system that ignores our well-being, undervalues our contributions, and leaves us without real representation.”

Djokovic is not one of the players listed as a plaintiff.

“His support for this is already explicit. It's redundant since PTPA (is) named as plaintiff, and he is on (the executive committee),” PTPA spokesman David Cooper wrote in an email. “He wanted to allow others to step up since this is not just Novak's (organization).”

The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players — women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings — before going to court.

“Tennis is broken,” PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said in a news release. “Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis — it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","Professional Tennis Players Association likens ATP, WTA to a cartel in federal lawsuit","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/03/18/tennis-players-lawsuit-atp-wta-tours-cartel/82516435007/","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:20:16 GMT","

The Professional Tennis Players Association sued several organizations, including the ATP, WTA and International Tennis Federation, likening them to a ""cartel,"" alleging several antitrust violations, systemic abuse, collusion to reduce competition, exploiting players financially, and forcing athletes to play an unsustainable schedule.

Court documents filed in New York City, London and Brussels and obtained by USA TODAY Sports, name 22 players, including Vasek Pospisil, Nick Kyrgios, Sorana Cirstea and Reilly Opelka as plaintiffs, who demand a jury trial.

""Tennis is broken,"" Ahmad Nassar, executive director of the PTPA, said in a statement. ""Behind the glamorous veneer that the Defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.""

The Professional Tennis Players Association, which was co-founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and Pospisil in 2019, says their mandate is to unite and mobilize ""tennis players to foster transparency and fairness in professional tennis.""

The 162-page lawsuit filed Wednesday details some of those complaints and the PTPA says they are backed by more than 250 players, many of whom are ranked in the top 20.

""Defendants do so by capping the prize money tournaments award and limiting players' ability to earn money off the court,"" the lawsuit says. ""Rather than being determined by market forces, players' earnings are instead subject to limitations agreed upon by the defendants and their co-conspirators.""

Another grievance in the lawsuit is the tour schedule, which the lawsuit says the men's tour, the ATP, ""schedules an annual slate of over 60 tournaments in which male players play,"" leaving little time to rest and recover.

""Defendants do so by capping the prize money tournaments award and limiting players' ability to earn money off the court. Rather than being determined by market forces, players' earnings are instead subject to limitations agreed upon by the defendants and their co-conspirators.""

The lawsuit says that four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open, are co-conspirators with the defendants who use the tournaments ""to enrich themselves at the players' expense, to the detriment of fans and the game.""

The International Tennis Integrity Agency, which says it tries to safeguard tennis to make sure the sport is free from corruption and doping, is also a defendant in the case.

""The ITIA's aggressive, unrelenting, and, at times, illegal investigative processes subject players to dozens of drug tests (both blood and urine), invasive searches of their personal cell phones, hours-long interrogations without counsel, and harassment by unaccountable and ill-trained investigators,"" the lawsuit says.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA TODAY'}"

The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), an organisation co-founded by Novak Djokovic, has launched legal action against tennis' governing bodies.

The lawsuits are against the ATP and WTA tours, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA). The PTPA has labelled the governing bodies a “cartel” and accused them of implementing “anticompetitive restraints and abusive practices.”

The 163-page complaint was filed in the United States District Court in New York, where the PTPA is seeking a jury trial. PTPA co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios are two of 12 current or former professional players listed as plaintiffs.

A statement from the PTPA read: “Following years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has taken decisive legal action.

“Today, the PTPA, alongside over a dozen professional tennis players, and on behalf of the entire player population, and renowned international law firm and historical player advocates Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP initiated a series of legal actions in the U.S., UK, and EU against the sport's governing bodies—the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

“The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades.

“The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anticompetitive restraints and abusive practices.”

The PTPA also claimed that the lawsuit has been “backed overwhelmingly by the top 250+ men's and women's players including a majority of the top 20 players.”

Ahmad Nassar, the Executive Director of the PTPA, said: “Tennis is broken. Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.

“We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.

“Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis – it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.”

In a tweet, Nassar explained: “The legal challenges centre on the following illegal actions:

Schedule abuse
Data misappropriation and betting collusion
Prize money manipulation
Player exploitation and hostile work environment
Abuse of power
Health and safety malpractice
Massive conflicts of interest
Investigative abuses and privacy rights violations

We stand ready to engage with anyone to solve these problems and lead tennis to a bright future for all.”

LOS ANGELES, CA — March 18, 2025 – Solinco, a leader in high-performance tennis equipment, has taken its newest co-polyester string, Mach-10, to new heights–literally. In a daring campaign and bold fusion between sports and aerospace, the brand partnered with an aerospace engineering firm to launch its new Mach-10 into space – making it the first-ever tennis string to leave Earth's atmosphere.

“We spent five years of research and development perfecting Mach-10, and feel like we have achieved a breakthrough in what it can deliver to the modern player,” said KT Kim, Solinco Director. “It's a true testament to the hard work behind it. Just like in tennis, the path to innovation requires a commitment to push boundaries in the pursuit of excellence, no matter the obstacle.”

Solinco's Mach-10 made history recently at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, where its space launch footage debuted alongside the string's official release. Fans tuned in through digital campaigns and a YouTube documentary to witness its journey 110,000 feet into space.

A custom-engineered rig carried the Mach-10 string set on its epic journey to space. Suspended beneath a hydrogen-filled stratospheric balloon, the string ascended 110,000 feet, the equivalent of stacking 1,410 tennis courts end to end. After spending two hours in space, Mach-10 made its return to Earth, landing in the hands of the legendary Bryan Brothers. The Bryan Brothers are tennis' greatest doubles team of all time, having won 16 Grand Slam titles and held the No. 1 ATP doubles ranking for 438 weeks. Having endured the ultimate test beyond our planet, the space-traveled string will now be put through its paces on the court, proving its performance where it truly matters.

For over a decade, Solinco has been a lead innovator of high-performance tennis strings, redefining what players can expect from their equipment. Tour Bite changed the game in 2008, setting new benchmarks for spin and durability. Hyper-G—the neon green icon—became the No. 1 string in America and a go-to for players at every level. Now, after years of development, Mach-10 has made its mark—launching with a bold campaign that reflects its innovation.

Mach-10 ushers in a new era of high-performance co-polyester strings, a testament to Solinco's relentless innovation in the space. Engineered for the modern player, it pushes performance to unprecedented heights with its unique combination of power, feel, and tension maintenance.

By Martyn Herman

LONDON (Reuters) - The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has filed a lawsuit against the sport's governing bodies, accusing them of anti-competitive practices and a disregard for player welfare.

The PTPA, co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2019 to give players more power over their careers and earnings, said on Tuesday that after years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, it had been forced to take legal action.

In a statement, it said that along with more than a dozen players the PTPA had filed papers in a New York court against the ATP Tour, the WTA Tour, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).

""Tennis is broken,"" Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA, said in a statement. ""Behind the glamorous veneer that the Defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety.

""We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis, it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.""

The ATP accused the PTPA of choosing ""division and distraction"" and having no meaningful role in the sport.

""We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position,"" the ATP said in a statement.

""ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.""

Legal action has also begun in Britain and the EU, the PTPA said.

Describing the various governing bodies as 'a cartel', the PTPA accuses them of paying ""artificially low compensation to professional tennis players"" and imposing a ""draconian"" ranking system that forces them to compete in certain tournaments.

It also calls the schedule unsustainable, says players are made to play in extreme heat and often in the early hours of the morning, that tennis balls chosen by the tournaments are a factor in causing chronic injuries and that players' privacy rights are being abused by random drug tests.

Prior to filing the lawsuit, the PTPA said it met with more than 250 players across the tours, including the majority of the men's and women's top 20.

""The overwhelmingly positive player feedback was a resounding confirmation -- change is needed now, and players are united in their fight for reform,"" the statement said.

Serbia's 24-times Grand Slam champion Djokovic has been a fierce advocate for change to the organisation of tennis, insisting lower-ranked players get a bad deal.

""Women and men who are around 200 and lower ranked in the world, they are struggling a lot,"" he said in a CBS 60 Minutes interview in 2023. ""They can't afford a coach, they can't afford travels, they skip tournaments, many of them leave tennis who are super talented and maybe capable of reaching great heights.""

The ITIA, which manages the sport's anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes, said it would not comment on the PTPA's lawsuit. The ITF and WTA have also been contacted by Reuters for comment.

Michigan infielder Mitchell Voit issued a public apology on social media Monday after his controversial and drug-inspired celebration during an 11-0 victory over USC the previous day went viral online. 

Voit, a 20-year-old junior from Wisconsin, went 3-for-3 with three runs and four RBIs in the shutout victory, but it was not his performance in the game that had fans talking on social media.

With a 2-0 lead in the second inning, Voit ripped a triple to center field and slid to third base, where he celebrated the play by imitating the use of cocaine. 

The video made its rounds on X, prompting Voit's apology. 

""I would like to apologize for my actions on third base yesterday. I made an immature decision in the heat of the moment,"" his post read.

Watch CBS News


Updated on:  March 17, 2025 / 10:10 PM MDT
          / CBS Colorado
        

Commissioners in Colorado's Douglas County will discuss plans for a mega sports complex in a work session on Tuesday morning. 

 Commissioners say the idea is a top priority and was added to their strategic master plan for the Parks, Trails, Historic Resources and Open Space Fund. County voters extended a 0.17% sales tax benefiting that fund in 2022. 

 Now, county leaders are in the early stages of planning a number of projects that will use those funds. Sterling Ranch could see a 500-acre sports mega complex, including ball fields, polo fields and a botanic garden.  

""We're talking about basketball courts, baseball fields, soccer potential ... cultural facilities, walking trails, biking. It's going to be interconnected to the East-West Regional Trail and accessible to all citizens in Douglas County,"" said County Commissioner Abe Laydon.

Laydon said the proposed Zebulon Sports Complex is what county taxpayers want, based on a recent survey of parks and open space funding priorities. 

 ""The summary to that survey is yes. Coloradans in Douglas County want all the above. They want indoor, outdoor sports courts. They want a sports village. They want botanic gardens. They want a place to have open space, trails, riding facilities, and all of those things associated with great recreation in Colorado,"" Laydon said. 

 The survey found the single highest priority for taxpayers was open space. 

 ""Most people moved out here to be away from the city, and they feel like the city is encroaching on them. They really want to preserve the open space,"" said Roxborough Park neighbor Ephram Glass. 

 Glass would rather see parks tax dollars go to preserving open space than to a sports complex. 

 ""For most people who voted on the extension of the sales tax going to parks and open space, most people were assuming the vast majority of the funds would go towards open space. However, it seems like it's more of a pot up for grabs for developers where they're trying to avoid spending their own money and using Douglas County funds for these developments,"" Glass said. 

 One Sterling Ranch mother said she is excited at the prospect of having kids' sports facilities nearby. 

 Youth sports groups have been vocal about the need for more ballfields in the county. Raptors President Mark Steinke said he supports Zebulon for increasing youth sports but that the plan will not be a solution for his Castle Rock players who lack fields. 

Laydon could not say how much Zebulon would cost the county but said it would be funded by the parks and open space dollars, which are strictly governed by ballot language. 

 ""It's not a surprise that over 70% of the people voted in favor of keeping the sales tax for open space, but if they hear that most of that money is not going to open space, they'd be very upset,"" Glass said.  

But Laydon insists the plan incorporates open space. 

 ""There will be elements that are truly parks and recreation, elements that are open space and certainly some historic elements as well,"" Laydon said. 

 Sterling Ranch would donate the 500 acres to the county. Development company President Brock Smethills shared the following statement about Zebulon: 

 ""In an effort to be a good neighbor, Sterling Ranch Development Company volunteered a recently acquired parcel of land located outside of the main portion of Sterling Ranch for a regional sports complex that would serve all of Douglas County with world-class sports facilities. This is a Douglas County Board of County Commissioners directed project that would benefit the entire county, and Sterling Ranch Development Company is thankful to the board to yet again be a regional partner to Douglas County. This project would also drive economic development, restaurants, transportation improvements, hotels, and so much more to an area that has been lacking those types of amenities and infrastructure. This attraction would benefit Sterling Ranch residents with new shopping, dining, recreation, and community gathering spaces that Sterling Ranch would not be able to support at this time on its own. Sterling Ranch Development Company looks forward to continuing the initial feasibility study for Zebulon with the Board of County Commissioners to also include future regional parks within Sterling Ranch as part of this new entertainment area, including Burns Park."" 

The plan is in early stages and is not the only parks project on the table. Laydon said commissioners still want public input on this and other ideas. Their work session on Zebulon on Tuesday will be at 10:30 a.m., and neighbors can Join the Meeting Remotely via Teams or call 720-739-2066 (audio only) and enter Phone Conference ID: 385 389 957#. 

County commissioners plan to hold a live town hall on the Zebulon idea next month in Sterling Ranch.

Frewsburg Central School District Board of Education members, and school Superintendent Dr. Danielle J. Cook conducts school district business Thursday.

FREWSBURG- The Frewsburg Central School Board of Education will hold a special meeting Monday to approve the merger of some sports with Southwestern Central School. 

The issue was discussed recently by Frewsburg school board members. Following several months of fact finding and an informational gathering process, Dr. Danielle Cook, Frewsburg superintendent, requested a special meeting be scheduled to formally vote on a potential merger with Southwestern Central School District's athletic program. 

“I am going to request that we schedule a special board meeting, at the end of the month, to vote on the merger of some fall 2025 sports programs -really- just focusing on the fall, and I'm asking that you send your availability to Laura (Smith, district clerk) for the last week of March so we can get a special meeting scheduled,” Cook said.

Cook said her recommendation was that the district keep all of the modified sports separate, with only Frewsburg athletes, and that the district look at merging with Southwestern for football, cheerleading, soccer and tennis this fall. 

Frewsburg and Southwestern are sharing a girls varsity flag football team. Frewsburg hired Trent Gray as its girls varsity football coach while Jake Burkholder, who also coaches the Southwestern varsity football team, is the coach of the Southwestern girls flag football team. Practices for the spring sport began Monday.

Jackson Elementary Elementary school's music program members and band, performed for the Frewsburg Central School Districts Board of Education and Superintendent Dr. Daniel Cook at a board meeting held Thursday.

In addition, Cook said that while there are more students who are signed up for sports with Frewsburg now than in the previous 10 years, the school district is still having issues filling the various team rosters for a variety of sports. The lack of athletes in the district is being caused by decreases in the number of students attending Frewsburg. 

The proposed merger of sports with Southwestern isn't as large as had been previously discussed. In February, fall sports that were included in the merger also included boys and girls cross country as well as girls volleyball. 

In other business: 

– Board members are looking at two options for its 2025-26 school budget. One plan calls for a $23,433,387 budget with no increase in the tax levy, though the district needs to find $571,060 in spending cuts to avoid a tax increase. A second option calls for a $25,593.680 budget with a 2.58 percent increase in the tax levy. The district would still need to cut an additional $410,767 in expenditures to meet the state's 2% tax cap. 

Cook also highlighted two other possible revenue streams to possibly add to the budget.

“Possible additional revenues we could receive is excess from BOCES (Board of Cooperative Educational Services) of $350,000, and the additional tax levy at 2.58% would raise $160,293,” she said.

No further action was taken. 

– Cook reported that she attended a convention for New York state school superintendents from March 2-4 hosted by the New York Council of School Superintendents (NYCOSS.)

“The tone set from the commissioner of education for New York state was that regardless of what is going on nationally, we are still New York state, and she expects that we will educate all our students,” said Cook. “A theme she really stressed is affordable education. She also stressed the importance of continued support for mental health with funding,  and continued request for funding with special needs education -which typically isn't a public mandate. I was also able to attend some sessions which focused on leadership.” 

– Board members were treated to a musical variety performance from fourth through sixth graders in the Robert H. Jackson Elementary Elementary school music program and band.  

“Our students are working very hard and have made tremendous gains,” said Music Teacher Drew Minton. “We use a color-coded award system, kind of like a karate belt or martial art system, to signify advancement in our program.” 

Students who performed for the board consisted of Petra Dahlin, Greta Roushey, Cordelia Dahlin, Peyton Brady, Jackson Brady, Ethan Ecklof, Jackson Levandoski. The students used a variety of instruments during their performance such as a recorder, drums, trombone, saxophone and clarinet. 

– The board appointed Sarah Olson as the new principal for Robert H. Jackson Elementary School. The appointment is for a four-year term, starting on  July 1, 2025 and ending on June 30, 2029.

–  The board also approved a driver's education class which will consist of two sessions. Session One: – July 9, 2025 – July 30, 2025, and session Two: – July 31, 2025 – August 18, 2025.

– The board approved the creation of a Travel Club and for a staff position to supervise it. The board also approved for Cook to execute a memorandum of agreement with the Frewsburg Faculty Association to fill this position. 

“The club is currently running under the Spanish club (2024- 2025), and we'd like to make it its own stand-alone activity,” said Cook. 

For months there were some who thought the legal fight over landfills in the town of Carroll were over.

Messenger photo by Britt Kudla: St. Edmond junior Hunter Horn reacts to his team's Class 1A state quarterfinal win in Des Moines. Horn was named a first team all-state selection by the Iowa Print Sports Writers Association.

Individual accolades are nice, but for the St. Edmond junior duo of Hunter Horn and Jakob Koopman, they view themselves as small pieces to a much bigger picture.

Both Horn and Koopman, along with Manson Northwest Webster's Logan Moline and Algona's Ben Helmers, were named all-state in boys basketball by the Iowa Print Sports Writers Association on Monday. 

Horn landed on the Class 1A first team and Koopman the third squad for the Gaels, who advanced to the state semifinals. Moline was a third-team selection in 2A, and Helmers made the second team in 3A. 

Along with joining the 1,000-point club for his career, Horn scored 609 points this past season, which ranked seventh in all of 1A. He averaged 24.4 points per contest, adding almost 10 rebounds with 43 assists, 34 steals and 22 blocks all while shooting 60 percent from the field.

“It's been a goal of mine for a long time (to be named all-state) and it feels great to be able to show the hard work paid off,” Horn said. “I couldn't have done it without the support of all my coaches and teammates.

“We have some unfinished business for next year. That's the overall end-goal: to make it back to the state tournament and compete for that championship.”

Horn will head into his senior season with the St. Edmond career scoring record within striking distance. He currently has 1,106 points in 50 games, just 434 from passing Andrew Gibb. 

Koopman racked up 278 points this season with 206 rebounds, 65 assists, 58 steals and 16 blocks, shooting 60 percent from the field and 73 percent at the free throw line. He led the Gaels with 18 points in a quarterfinal win at state over Woodbine, just 11 days after suffering a serious leg injury in the substate final.

“Being named all-state is a great honor,” Koopman said. “I couldn't have done it without my coaches and teammates — especially Hunter. He commands so much attention from other teams, (which) gives me and my teammates a lot more open looks.”

St. Edmond won 20 games for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign, finishing in a tie for second in the North Central Conference. Horn and Koopman were both all-league picks, with Horn also earning all-substate team honors. 

Moline, who has signed with Buena Vista University to continue his career, became Manson Northwest Webster's career scoring leader this past season. He averaged 20.8 points with 8.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and almost two steals per game, helping the Cougars tie a program record with 19 victories and reach a substate final for the first time since the MNW consolidation nearly 35 years ago.

“(Being named all-state) shows the time and hard work I've spent playing and trying to get better at the game,” Moline said. “I couldn't have done it without my family, friends, teammates and coaches who have helped me along the way.

“I hope the younger generation of kids see what I've done and strive to achieve great things, too.”

A three-year starter for Manson Northwest Webster, Moline finished his career with 1,421 points to go along with 549 rebounds, 199 assists, 135 steals and 48 blocked shots. 

Helmers was a repeat all-state selection, scoring 26.4 points per game with 83 rebounds, 62 steals, 43 assists and 13 blocks for the Bulldogs.

“I'm very honored to be selected again,” Helmers said. “I wouldn't have been able to get to this point without the support of my teammates and fans, and the coaching staff pushing me and helping me get better this year and throughout my whole career at Algona.”

Helmers, a three-year starter and four-time letterwinner for Algona, scored 1,509 points with 370 rebounds, 184 steals, 147 assists and 53 blocks.

Jamison Poe, a senior who attended school in Fort Dodge before moving to Ames, was named to the 4A second team after helping the Little Cyclones reach the state tournament. Bode Goodman, the grandson of former FDSH head coach and all-stater Tom Goodman and nephew of ex-Dodger star Jay Goodman, landed on the first team in 4A for his efforts at Waukee Northwest this season. The Wolves were the state runner-up.

Valley's Trevin Jirak was named Mr. Iowa Basketball after leading the Tigers to a third consecutive 4A state title. Jirak is headed to the University of Northern Iowa to continue his basketball career.

NEW YORK—NBCU's streaming service Peacock continues to ramp up its sports offering with the launch of in-market streaming of four NBC Sports Regional Networks as add-on subscriptions.

The new option enables Peacock Premium or Premium Plus subscribers located in the respective network's television territory to purchase a monthly add-on subscription in addition to their Peacock subscription to receive the 24/7 stream of their regional sports network's programming.

The MLB, NBA and NHL teams' games available to subscribers include MLB's Athletics, San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies; NBA's Boston Celtics, Sacramento Kings, Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia 76ers; and NHL's Philadelphia Flyers and San Jose Sharks.

The NBC Sports Regional Networks' live MLB, NBA and NHL game schedules include non-nationally exclusive regular-season and postseason games, as well as select preseason matchups.

Mustang News

Connor Heffler knew the risks of playing football. As a former Cal Poly linebacker, he saw teammates suffer multiple concussions — some so severe they could never play again. But what frustrated him most was how concussions were diagnosed.

“You have to play [football] fearlessly,” Heffler said. “But after seeing friends suffer as many as six concussions and never being able to play again, I realized something had to change.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur nationwide each year, with nearly half going unreported. Inspired to change that, Heffler set out to develop a more accurate, data-driven solution to detect concussions.

Heffler's focus was on repetitive head trauma because, for college-age athletes, these repeated injuries lead to longer recovery times, impact learning capabilities and have a higher risk for mental illness, according to the National Library of Medicine.

Their efforts culminated at Cal Poly with the creation of ODIN, a startup developing a virtual reality headset that tracks eye movements to diagnose concussions in real-time. The headset conducts a series of ocular tasks, asking users to follow moving objects, focus on specific points and respond to visual stimuli.

“A lot of innovation was needed in this space to prevent further damage after injury and to help mitigate successive undetected concussions,” Heffler said.

What started as a senior project quickly gained momentum through Cal Poly's Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), a campus resource offering mentorship and funding to student-led startups. 

Heffler's team won $15,000 in funding through the CIE's Innovation Quest competition, helping the startup advance to the CIE's Summer Accelerator program. The intensive, 12-week initiative provides funding, coaching and a dedicated workspace at the CIE HotHouse, a startup hub in downtown San Luis Obispo.

For Heffler, the CIE's support was invaluable.

“The whole experience with the CIE and the HotHouse has been life-changing,” Heffler said. “I could call advisors at almost any hour of the day, and they were always quick to help.”

Now, ODIN continues to develop as a part of the CIE's Incubator program, a two-year initiative designed to help startups bridge the gap between concept and application. 

As ODIN refines its technology, the team is focused on expanding its impact beyond Cal Poly.

The urgency of ODIN's mission is underscored by the growing awareness of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disorder caused by repeated head injuries. 

Josh Gottschalk, a biomedical engineering senior whose senior project was sponsored by ODIN, said the company's virtual reality headset provides a portable, self-sufficient solution for concussion detection. 

“Unlike current methods that rely on subjective assessments, this device offers objective and measurable results,” Gottschalk said. 

ODIN Diagnostics is expanding its team in preparation for additional testing throughout 2025. Looking forward, the team is a finalist in the CIE's annual pitch competition, AngelCon, and will compete in May in hopes of winning $100,000 in funding.

KALAMAZOO, MI — Records were set on and off the courts, fields, ice and wrestling mats in 2024 as Discover Kalamazoo Sports hosted more than 50 sporting events over the year. 

The organization announced the events resulted in an all-time record of $30.3 million in estimated direct visitor spending, according to a Tuesday, March 18 news release.

The economic impact was made possible through the more than 38,000 youth, amateur, college and professional athletes that competed in sports events and tournaments in the Kalamazoo area in 2024. 

Those athletes, along with their families, friends and fans, contributed to the region's local economy by paying for lodging, transportation, food and beverage, retail, recreation, space rental and other business services. 

The organization stated it continues to punch above its weight class in sports such as ice hockey, figure skating, wrestling and tennis. Those four sports accounted for 53% of Discover Kalamazoo Sports room nights in 2024. 

In an attempt to drive that impact higher, the organization is planning a $40 million basketball and volleyball facility.

Some of the biggest names in Texas sports hope so","https://www.keranews.org/politics/2025-03-18/will-the-legislature-legalize-sports-betting-some-of-the-biggest-names-in-texas-sports-hope-so","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:05:00 GMT","

Texas is once again looking at legalizing sports gambling during this years' legislative session, and supporters are being backed by some of the most influential people in Texas sports.


Sen. Carol Alvarado (D-Houston), has filed Senate Joint Resolution 16, proposes legal sports wagering and legal gambling at casinos and other destination resorts in the state. If passed, it would also create the Texas Gaming Commission, a new organization that would regulate gambling.


Alvarado has been filing bills on gaming in Texas since 2009, including a measure that cleared the Texas House in 2023, but stalled in the state Senate. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads that chamber, has expressed strong opposition to legalized sports betting.


Still, she said it's worth the fight because she strongly believes sports betting will improve the state's economy and make it an even bigger tourist destination.


“Promoting Texas as a place to come and bring your family — come to this beautiful resort that has everything that you could find in many other other resorts, like shops and restaurants and shows. This would certainly lure people to visiting Texas,” Alvarado told The Texas Newsroom.


While Patrick's disdain for sports betting remains, other powerful Texans are coming out in support of the change, including former governor Rick Perry and Gov. Greg Abbott.


“I don't have a problem with online sports betting,” said Abbott in a recent interview with the Houston Chronicle's Texas Take podcast. “The reality is that I'd be shocked if there were not some Texans that do it already.”


There's also been a powerful lobbying effort behind the change. The Texas Sports Betting Alliance, a group consisting of sports teams such as the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Astros and Dallas Mavericks, has been actively pushing for the change, along with Las Vegas Sands, a massive player in the world of casinos.





Experts acknowledge legalizing online betting could be a financial boon to the state and the sports teams based here.


“Bringing a sports book generally into a professional sports venue brings a whole new set of customers, a whole new set of revenue streams that you're going to be able to bring in,” said Mark Pannes, a teaching fellow at the Center for Sports Communication and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. He also owns Inner Market Media, a company that advises clients on investing in sports teams.


“It's just a further expansion of the end to end relationship you'll have with a fan,” Pannes said. “They're watching it on tv, reading about it, coming to events and now they would be gambling at your venue as well. It's just another key revenue driver for a team.”


That sentiment seems to resonate with Ryan Lawton, an Austin native who occasionally places sports betting. He said he enjoys watching sports in other states because he has the ability to bet on games.


“It just makes it interesting to follow a game that you may not be (otherwise) interested in,” Lawton told The Texas Newsroom.


Despite the benefits supporters say legalized sports gambling could offer the state, SJR 16 and Alvarado have an uphill battle ahead. While the proposal may once again receive some support from the House, it seems unlikely Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will change his strong opposition to the measure.


Loni Mcfadden, a Houston-area therapist who specializes in addiction and shame, said she understands why the Texas Senate and Patrick are hesitant to legalize sports wagering.


“I've really seen the ugly parts of addiction and what it's cost people,” Mcfadden said. “I think that should be a topic of conversation because addiction thrives in secrecy and so does gambling.”


Given the support behind — and opposition to — the legalization of sports gambling, the debate around SJR 16 could get heated. Alvarado said she's aware SJR 16 may not gain traction this legislative session, but remains optimistic sports gambling will be legalized in the future.


“I'm in it for the long haul and each session we're garnering a different level of support. So I'll take it. And this session will build on that,” Alvarado said. “I know it's going to continue to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Alvarado said.

A research team from the Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics won the 19th Annual MIT Sloan Research Paper Competition.

Department of Sport Management student and lead author Alivia Uribe '26, Sport Analytics Professor Shane Sanders and Sport Analytics Associate Professor Justin Ehrlich teamed with University of Reading (U.K.) Professor James Reade and University of Stirling (Scotland) senior lecturer Carl Singleton to write “Do Behavioral Considerations Cloud Penalty-Kick Location Optimization in Professional Soccer: Game Theory and Empirical Testing using Polynomial Regression and ML Gradient Boosting.”

Their research was named best in field at the prestigious MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, held March 7-8 at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Sloan Sports Analytics Conference showcases cutting-edge research that's featured in top media outlets throughout the world and has changed the way sports are analyzed. This year's competition featured six sports tracks: basketball, baseball, soccer, football, business of sports and other sports. Abstracts were selected based on the novelty, academic rigor and impact of the research.

The team that won the Research Paper Competition at the prestigious MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference included, from left to right, Shane Sanders, James Reade, Alivia Uribe, and Justin Ehrlich.

Ehrlich explained that the group submitted an abstract in the fall. Out of thousands of submissions, the most promising were invited to submit full papers. These manuscripts were then evaluated, and the authors of the top seven papers were invited to present orally at the conference in Boston earlier this month. A panel of industry experts judged these presentations, and the winner was announced during an awards ceremony at the conclusion of the conference.

“I am incredibly proud of our team's work as it resulted in a fantastic project that resonates deeply with others,” Ehrlich says. “Although aiming for riskier, higher areas of the goal can yield greater expected conversion rates, players typically avoid these zones due to the increased risk of missing entirely, which carries negative perceptions. Our findings generated enthusiasm among many attendees and received considerable attention at the conference.”

Uribe, a forward on the Syracuse University women's soccer team, is the first female lead author to be on the Research Paper Competition-winning team in MIT Sloan's 19-year history, according to the event organizers.

“This is something I'm extremely proud of,” says Uribe, a sport analytics minor. “I could not be more grateful for the professors who have helped me create this opportunity. The knowledge and expertise I bring into it as a student-athlete is something very unique.”

Sanders and Ehrlich built on their previous analytics research to assist Uribe with her research, while Reade and Singleton provided invaluable soccer data. This was the second consecutive year that Sanders and Ehrlich had a research paper selected among the top seven at MIT Sloan. Last year, they presented their study on the NBA that shows the average expected value of 3-point shots has become less than 2-pointers since the 2017-18 season.

“Falk College is an ideal place to work and teach, the best college I've ever been affiliated with by far,” Sanders says. “The administrators, faculty, and students really pull together here like nowhere else I've been. Moreover, our leadership team has positioned sport analytics to shine as a program.”

Read the team's full research paper on the MIT Sloan Research Papers web page.

The expansion National Women's Soccer League team in Denver has unveiled plans for a new downtown soccer stadium

Expansion NWSL Team Unveils Plans for New Downtown Denver Women's Soccer Stadium

The expansion National Women's Soccer League team that will kick off next year in Denver has unveiled plans for a new downtown soccer stadium. 

The facility will be only the second purpose-built women's soccer stadium in the league after the Kansas City Current opened CPKC Stadium last year. 

The owners of the Denver team intend to build a privately funded 14,500-seat facility with an open end that looks out over green space, along with a future mixed-use entertainment district. The site is near light rail. 

“Doing something iconic and authentic, doing it in a park, connecting neighborhoods, being close to downtown, those were all things that spoke to myself and the rest of the ownership group,” said majority owner Robert Cohen, CEO of IMA Financial Group. “If you want to build a stadium, this is the right way to do it.”

The architectural firm Populous is designing the stadium and the adjacent recreational area. 

“It's only fitting that the hottest ticket in town will be making its home on Broadway,” Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement. “This project at Santa Fe Yards will transform an underutilized eyesore into a recreational and economic hub where memories are made, culture is built, and championships are won.”

The Denver City Council is expected to approve the land deal for the stadium and the surrounding area in the coming weeks. 

“We want to do something that's unique and authentic to Colorado, and that when you see it, and you see that it's a stadium in a park, you're going to say `That's the stadium in Denver, Colorado,” Cohen said. “We're still in discussions with the city, and we want to be respectful of that process that we're going through with them, but the plan is for the ownership group to pay for and build the stadium.” 

Denver was awarded the NWSL's 16th team earlier this year. The club has not announced where it will play while the new stadium is being built. 

The NWSL currently has 14 teams. A club in Boston will join Denver in kicking off next year. Groups in Cleveland and Cincinnati were also vying for a team during the latest round of expansion.

MARK NANCE/Sun-Gazette Correspondent
Loyalsock's Jillian Kennedy(10) bats down a pass intended for Dunmore's Sophia Talutto (2) in the third quarter of last week's PIAA Class AAA quarterfinal game at Martz Hall in Pottsville. 

As Loyalsock studied Dunmore film, it repeatedly watched the Bucks carve up opposing defenses as they brilliantly ran their offense.

So, Loyalsock's game plan was fairly simple. Don't let Dunmore run an offense. Against a district champion which had won 18 straight games while routinely blowing out the opposition, that seemed a tall order.

But Loyalsock raised some outstanding offensive work with even better defensive execution and held all the cards in last Friday's Class AAA state quarterfinal. Loyalsock made Dunmore feel uncomfortable all night, rarely let it run its sets and won, 60-36. The Lancers (28-2) earned a second straight Final Four appearance and will play Imhotep on Friday at Parkland.

“I'm just going to go back to the defensive effort. It was pretty incredible,” Loyalsock coach Curtis Jacobson said. “They run such good stuff and we came into the game saying, ‘I don't want them to run an offense.' We don't want them running anything they want to run.”

They didn't.

Loyalsock had Dunmore out of rhythm from the start, not allowing a point until nearly five minutes into the game. The Lancers limited the Bucks to 15 first-half points and put the game away with a 27-7 third quarter run as offensive and defensive dominance came together.

Dunmore entered the game 24-2 and averaging 56.1 points per game. Point guard Sophia Talutto is an all-state player who has more than 1,500 career points and will play at Scranton. This was a task easier said than done, but Loyalsock found a way to make sure the vital parts in the Dunmore machine could not properly function.

“I don't think they really ran much all night on offense,” guard Lacey Kriebel said after making three steals. “They were just trying to do something, so that was huge to disrupt them. Defense wins us games.”

It has helped Loyalsock win 28 games this season, more than any Lancer team in program history. Loyalsock allows just 30.9 points per game and understands that defense travels. Offense can come and go at times, but play outstanding defense and a team has a shot to win any time it plays.

That has shined through all season. Even in defeat, Loyalsock has come close to winning. Its two losses are to 5A state semifinalist Crestwood (on a buzzer-beater) and District 4 Class AAAA champion Central Columbia (with 2.6 seconds remaining) by a combined three points.

The defense has continued surging throughout the playoffs and Loyalsock has held three straight state opponents to 36 points or fewer. Defense kept the Lancers ahead in a close game against West Catholic in the second round before the offense erupted in the fourth quarter and they pulled away for a 54-35 win.

It was a similar story early against Dunmore. The Lancers ran their offenses well throughout the first half but shots were not falling. Still, the swarming defense gave Dunmore fits and allowed Loyalsock to build a 22-15 halftime lead. The offense exploded in the third quarter, the defense remained constant and Loyalsock was Final 4-bound.

“We came in with a game plan,” Julie Ellis said after helping set the game's early tone. “We had two games to really prepare and we went out there and executed it.”

Loyalsock did so by utilizing a triangle-and-two defense, one which it had not run all season; one that it installed the previous day. Loyalsock features a well-rounded group which has some good height, speed and length. Equally important, this is a smart team, one which learns fast and adapts quick.

The Lancers often switch defenses during games, whether via their press or in half-court. They ran some zone at other times which looked like man-to-man and through in a little straight man-to-man at times.

The main objective was neutralizing Talutto. The junior guard scored 29 points in a double overtime second round win against Notre Dame-Green Pond, taking the game over in the second overtime. She played well again and scored 18 points against Loyalsock but never could heat up and the points came sporadically. Defensive ace Jaekairah Harden often stuck to Talutto and the Bucks were not able to run the offenses which so often freed the quick guard with long range.

“I tried to get her on her non-dominant hand,” Harden said. “We wanted to get her out of the stuff she's used to doing.”

Slowing Talutto slowed the entire Dunmore offense. The Lancers harassed ball-handlers, defended space well, rotated, helped and communicated. Good shots were hard to come by and when Dunmore did put them up, Loyalsock did effective work on the boards, often limiting it to one shot.

“That's always a point of emphasis. Extra possessions in the state playoffs are really valuable,” Kriebel said. “We just try and get as many steals and rebounds to get us as many extra chances to score.”

Loyalsock consistently denied Dunmore chances to score. It was an outstanding collective performance, born from film work and then translated to the court.

As a coach, Jacobson enjoyed watching Dunmore on film running its offenses so well. As Loyalsock's coach he was filled with pride watching his team break down that offense and with tremendous defense.

“Every game I watched, they walked the ball up the court, called a play and executed it to perfection. I said, ‘I can't watch this (Friday),'” Jacobson said. “I told our players I can't watch them do this because they're going to pick us apart if they do. That was the goal and the girls did it.”

King

The Circle K Fieldhouse at NexusPark has a new sports and events coordinator.

Francys King was introduced by NexusPark Fieldhouse Sports Manager Martavius Mims during a parks board meeting last week, but she had already gotten started in the role earlier in the month.

As sports and events coordinator, King will oversee youth and adult recreational programs and work to develop new ones for the fieldhouse as well, according to Brady Buckley, associate director of sports, Columbus Parks and Recreation.

King will also serve as the on-site contact for weekend events, coordinate scheduling for part-time event staff and concessions, as well as oversee weekly drop-in activities.

King earned her MBA in business administration from Ball State University, where she also competed as a Division 1 pitcher on the Cardinals softball team. She also played softball for two years at Tennessee State, according to a profile on Ball State's athletics page.

During her time in Muncie, King developed her own pitching business, organizing camps and clinics to help young athletes enhance their skills and build confidence, according to parks officials.

King told members of the parks board that she's originally from Mechanicsburg, Ohio.

“I'm thrilled to step into this role at Circle K Fieldhouse,” King said. “I look forward to bringing my experience as an athlete, coach, and businesswoman to the program and community.”

“We're super happy to have Francys on-board, she's come in and hit the ground running with the youth and adult leagues that we have operating in the Fieldhouse,” Mims said.

F

 Haslam Sports Group (""HSG"") today reiterated its actions and investments to ensure a thriving long-term future for the Cleveland Browns, its fans, Greater Cleveland and Northeast Ohio.

The heart of this commitment would be a new, enclosed NFL stadium and mixed-use development to be built in Brook Park, Ohio without impacting any existing taxpayer revenue streams and relieving Cleveland of any stadium-related taxpayer expenses. The centerpiece of the project will be a state-of-the-art enclosed stadium for the Browns – consistent with other world-class NFL stadiums – that can host major year-round events. The new stadium, which would sit less than a mile from Cleveland city limits, would also anchor a mixed-use development to catalyze meaningful economic impact for Cleveland and the surrounding region. Its location in the heart of the Greater Cleveland metropolitan area is particularly important with 85% of home game attendees living outside city limits.

Despite the new stadium's significant benefits, the City of Cleveland has been misguiding Clevelanders by inaccurately conflating the Brook Park project with Art Modell breaking a lease and moving a team to an entirely different state. The City has done so by invoking the so-called Modell Law – an Ohio law passed in the 1990s in response to the relocation of the Browns out of Ohio – to try and halt the project. Earlier today, HSG submitted an amended complaint in its federal suit, challenging the city's baseless assertions.

Ted Tywang, HSG's Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, stated, ""The city has never explained how the Modell Law could sensibly apply to the Browns, who will continue to play games in its stadium until the expiration of its lease, and whose owners have committed to keeping the team in the local area long after the lease expires. In fact, the Haslams' proposed unprecedented private investment in a world-class stadium and surrounding development, and their continued unwavering commitment to Northeast Ohio, are the complete opposite of the Modell situation. It's also important to recognize that at least 10 NFL teams play their home games in metropolitan areas outside of the city they represent, so our proposal is entirely consistent with other hometown teams across the country. Our actions in court are intended to ensure that the city's irresponsible and baseless attempt to apply the Modell Law to the Browns does not slow our momentum to build a world-class stadium right here in Northeast Ohio for the Browns, our fans and the entire region.""

Today's filing affirms that – far from running from the Cleveland area – HSG is reinforcing its commitment and increasing its investment in the region in an unprecedented way. HSG, together with its development partners, is committing to invest more than $2 billion in private capital in the proposed new stadium and the adjoining mixed-use development, with the total project representing $3.4 billion in economic development. The $2 billion includes an investment of at least $1.2 billion from [the Haslam family/HSG] towards construction of the enclosed stadium (plus any cost overruns), marking the largest per capita private sports facility investment in U.S. history.

The Browns' owners, Dee and Jimmy Haslam, stated, ""The Cleveland Browns and our community need and deserve a new home – and from the outset we have been unequivocal that it must positively benefit our community and Northeast Ohio. The proposed Huntington Bank Field in Brook Park meets this vital objective and will reflect positively on our world-class region and its promising future. It also reflects our 100% commitment to keeping the Browns in their home market for generations to come.""

In addition to its longtime local counsel, Thompson Hine LLC, HSG has engaged the firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as it seeks to expeditiously resolve this matter and break ground in Brook Park in 202 ","{'href': 'https://www.wfmj.com', 'title': 'WFMJ'}"

Brandon Graham, one of the most revered players in Eagles history, is hanging up his cleats after 218 games, 82 sacks and two Super Bowl championships.Next stop: Eagles Hall of Fame.B.G. announced Tuesday afternoon that the 2024 season will be his final season. It's not a huge surprise, considering he turns 37 in two weeks, he suffered two torn triceps injuries in 2 ½ months and he plays for a team that's in the midst of a major youth movement.But it's still huge news when one of the iconic figures in franchise history calls it a day. Especially coming a year after Fletcher Cox and Jason Kelce retired.That's 40 years of service to the Eagles walking away from the only organization any of them ever played for.Graham is the final Eagle that played under Andy Reid, and one of only four players to win two Super Bowls in an Eagles uniform, along with Lane Johnson, Jake Elliott and Rick Lovato.

Graham, the Eagles' 1st-round pick in 2010, set franchise records by playing 15 seasons and in 218 games, including 12 in the postseason. His 76 ½ regular-season sacks trails only Reggie White (124) and Trent Cole (85 ½) in Eagles history.Whatever else B.G. ever did or ever does, he'll always be known in this city for one of the greatest plays in Philadelphia sports history.

His historic strip sack of Tom Brady just before the two-minute warning in Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis went a long way toward delivering the first Lombardi Trophy to the Eagles. Graham became a shining example of determination and persistence early in his career after recording just 17 sacks in his first five seasons. But he just kept working and by 2016 he was a 2nd-team All-Pro and in 2017 he had a career-high 9 ½ sacks and helped the Eagles win their first Super Bowl.His transformation from a player who was perceived as a 1st-round bust as late as the fifth year of his career into one of the most popular Eagles ever was remarkableThat began a string of very good seasons, including 8 ½ sacks in 2019, 8.0 and a Pro Bowl in 2020 and a career-high 11 sacks in 2022 after missing most of 2021 with a torn Achilles. This past year, playing under Vic Fangio, B.G. was rejuvenated and played at a consistently high level before the first triceps injury in Week 12. He had 3 ½ sacks, six tackles for loss and seven quarterback hits.Out of 108 edge rushers who played at least 300 snaps this year, Graham's PFF grade of 79.2 grade ranked 19th.No player in Eagles history had more sacks after his 29th birthday and no player in Eagles history had more sacks from his seventh season on.Graham's 206 regular-season games played are 6th-most ever by an edge rusher who spent his entire career with one team. And his 76 ½ regular-season sacks are 20th-most all-time by a player who spent his entire career with one team.To get an idea just how long Graham spent with the Eagles, among his teammates his rookie year were Michael Vick, Quintin Mikell, Asante Samuel, Ellis Hobbs, King Dunlap and Hank Baskett.B.G. wasn't just a terrific football player during his years with the Eagles, he was a vocal leader on the field and in the locker room and a tireless worker in the community. He was the Eagles' 2024 nominee for the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which recognizes a player for his contributions on and off the field.Graham has been outspoken about his desire to remain with the Eagles' organization in some sort of role, and Eagles owner Jeff Lurie and GM Howie Roseman have been very good about bringing former players into the fold in various roles. Among them Darren Sproles, Brent Celek, Connor Barwin.

Most jobs in EPA's research arm would be eliminated under a plan to downsize the environmental agency. 

A flag flies at EPA headquarters in Washington on April 22, 2022. Francis Chung/POLITICO

The Trump EPA is planning a sweeping removal of its scientists as part of a reorganization that will eliminate the agency's existing science office, according to House Democrats.

The agency's plans, reviewed by Democratic staff on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, entail eliminating a majority — between 50 percent and 75 percent — of the 1,540 positions in EPA's Office of Research and Development.

The agency also plans to eliminate the office, which serves as its scientific research arm, as a national program office. Some of the science shop's functions, positions and employee skills have “been identified as directly supporting statutory work in other EPA program offices,” the plan says.

The intent to slash EPA's science staff is one portion of a broader layoff and reorganization plan from the agency, according to House Democrats. President Donald Trump directed every federal agency to submit proposals for workforce cuts and reorganizations earlier this month, with another round due in April. 

EPA's plan also suggests the agency will request an exception to a requirement to give employees 60 days' notice about layoff plans. The agency is seeking to reduce the requirement to 30 days' notice.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said he envisions cutting at least 65 percent of his agency's spending, which will likely coincide with significant workforce reductions.

The agency's plans, shared with POLITICO's E&E News, were first reported by The New York Times.

An EPA spokesperson said Tuesday that plans had not been finalized.

“EPA is taking exciting steps as we enter the next phase of organizational improvements. We are committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for all Americans,” the spokesperson said. “ While no decisions have been made yet, we are actively listening to employees at all levels to gather ideas on how to better fulfill agency statutory obligations, increase efficiency, and ensure the EPA is as up-to-date and effective as ever.”

Zeldin told Fox Business on Tuesday morning that The New York Times was “way ahead of their skis on this one,” but he did not directly address details about proposed cuts to the science office.

“A decision is something that we are working through. We will, across all offices of EPA, always look for ways to operate better, more efficiently,” Zeldin said.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the science committee, said eliminating the EPA science office would be illegal.

“Last time around, Trump and his cronies politicized and distorted science — they knew the value of ORD, and they sought to weaken it,” Lofgren said. “Now, this is their attempt to kill it for good. EPA cannot meet its legal obligation to use the best available science without ORD, and that's the point.”

Former EPA officials also warn that gutting the science office would make it impossible for the agency to achieve its mission of protecting human health and the environment.



“Shuttering EPA's science offices would take a chainsaw to the work of toxicologists, physicians, nurses and other experts across the country, particularly in places like North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Georgia, where the agency operates major research labs,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, the former principal deputy assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Research and Development.

“I don't know how without scientists they will be able to implement the mission,” said Chitra Kumar, managing director of the Climate & Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a former EPA official.

“ORD did a lot of the science behind regulations. and without that science we would expect to see increased risk for everyday people,” Kumar said.

Shrinking or closing the office would affect a wide range of EPA programs and regulations, according to former agency staff. EPA scientists' work includes researching water quality, the impacts of air pollution and health hazards posed by chemicals.

With 1,540 positions in the office, cutting 75 percent of its staff would mean terminating 1,155 employees. The office's staff level excludes special government employees and public health officers, according to the EPA plans.

The Trump plan appears to be “part of an overall, larger, overall attack on the use of science to inform decisions about environmental regulation,” said Stan Meiburg, a former senior career official at EPA who served as acting deputy administrator during the Obama administration.

EPA scientists help inform the agency's rules for air and water quality, Meiburg said.

“It was ORD scientists, for example, who were able to look at the status of pipes in Flint [Michigan] and determine how those pipes were being impaired by the absence of corrosion control,” Meiburg said.

Meiburg said the personnel cuts would mainly impact the ORD headquarters in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, as well as offices in Cincinnati, Ohio, and laboratories that are scattered around the country.

Losing the research shop would also hurt state environmental agencies, Meiburg said, which rely on EPA research to support their own permitting and monitoring activities for air and water.

The EPA science office represents approximately 10 percent of EPA's staff and 5 percent of its total budget, said Chris Frey, who led the Office of Research and Development from 2022 to 2024. “In terms of cost savings, there's not a lot of cost savings at the federal scale from eliminating ORD, but there's a lot of disbenefit,” Frey said. “This is an example of penny-wise and pound-foolish.”

EPA research and science was heavily criticized in Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint organized by The Heritage Foundation.

That plan states that the Office of Research and Development is EPA's “largest employer” and claims it has been tainted by political influence and is “hostile to public and legislative input.” 

“A top priority should be the immediate and consistent rejection of all EPA ORD and science activities that have not been authorized by Congress,” Project 2025 says. “Several ORD offices and programs, many of which constitute unaccountable efforts to use scientific determinations to drive regulatory, enforcement, and legal decisions, should be eliminated.”

Cuts to the EPA science office could have long-term impacts, said Chet Wayland, a longtime EPA career official who recently retired as head of air quality monitoring.

“What ORD did for us is they worked on scientific issues and looked at health studies to determine what the new science was providing around health effects on air pollution,” said Wayland, who was based in the science office's North Carolina headquarters.

“If there's a loss now, you might not feel it immediately from a regulatory standpoint,” Wayland said. “But boy, down the road, you're going to really feel it, because once science stops, it takes a long time for it to catch back up again.”

A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.

A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.

But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC ""there was an assault"" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.

In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with ""utmost urgency"".

South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.

The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to ""a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals"", which all members had cleared.

In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was ""not uncommon"" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.

It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February ""all was in order"", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February. 

The statement added the department ""immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base"". 

""This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,"" it said.

The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect. 

The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had ""willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended"".

The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said. 

The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year. 

The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months. 

South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists. 

These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.

But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of ""deeply disturbing behaviour"" by a colleague and an ""environment of fear"".

A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by ""a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do – a weather dependant task that required a schedule change"".

Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.

Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.

""One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,"" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.

""So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,"" he told the BBC.

Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.

""You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.

""And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you… because there's nothing else – there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,"" she said.

Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.

But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.

Water is a necessity that humans cannot live without.

Despite this, accurate water quality data is not widely accessible in real-time, which is a detriment that can impact public health and aquatic ecosystems.

Assistant professor of computer science Ahyoung Lee is working to fill in these gaps using a bacterial monitoring and forecasting system that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI), real-time monitoring, and predictive analytics to provide water-quality information and predict potential bacterial outbreaks.

The project, NSF I-Corps: Translation Potential of Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Bacterial Forecasting System for Water Quality Monitoring, blends hands-on learning with a direct investigation of the industry to assess the feasibility of adapting an AI-driven system that predicts bacterial levels for monitoring water quality in real-time.

Lee is looking specifically at Escherichia coli (E. coli) detection. E. coli is common in surface water, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) noting 25.2% of water supply sources for households are contaminated.

“The bacterial forecasting system helps everyday people by ensuring cleaner and safer water,” Lee said. “By improving water quality and reducing contamination risks, it protects public health and enhances recreational experiences.”

Enhanced recreational experiences include boating, swimming, fishing, and other activities that occur in lakes, rivers, and ponds, which fall into the category of surface water.

While surface water is most prone to contamination, E. coli can be found in groundwater such as private water wells.

“This project also helps lower costs for communities, making water monitoring more efficient and accessible, especially for underserved areas that struggle with water safety issues,” Lee said.

Lee has several students working with her on this project, including a Ph.D. student, a graduate research assistant (GRA) and three undergraduate students who are a part of the First-Year Scholars Program (FYSP).

Ultimately, Lee's innovative bacterial monitoring and forecasting system represents a significant advancement in real-time water quality tracking. By utilizing AI and predictive analytics, the system not only provides vital water quality data but also helps predict potential bacterial outbreaks at a lower cost than other technologies.

PLYMOUTH MEETING, PA [March 17, 2025] The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) is sharing a webinar today that answers critical patient questions about cancer clinical trials. The newly released, on-demand webinar is titled “Why Should I Consider a Clinical Trial?” It is available for free at NCCN.org/patientwebinars thanks to funding from the NCCN Foundation®, along with a handout summarizing the key information.

Cancer clinical trials play a critical role in advancing treatment and improving patient outcomes. However, confusion about their purpose, benefits, and accessibility keeps many people from enrolling. This free webinar features leading experts in oncology and patient advocacy, who break down the complex concepts, making them accessible to all.

“Every standard treatment we have today was found by the intellect of science and the courage of patients who participated in clinical trials,” said Ann Fish-Steagall, RN, BSN, SVP Patient Services and Health Care Delivery, LUNGevity, who was one of the presenters. “Clinical trials provide the medical community with important building blocks to further research and improve treatment options for all.”

“Clinical trials are a cornerstone of cancer research, but many patients are unsure how to approach them,” said Patrick Delaney, Executive Director, NCCN Foundation. “Our goal with this webinar is to empower individuals with knowledge, address misconceptions, and make the whole process feel less daunting.”

“Diversity in clinical trial participation is essential to ensuring that new treatments work for everyone, regardless of their background,” Delaney continued. “This session emphasizes the importance of inclusive participation and explores how to make that easier across every demographic.”

The webinar addressed key questions:

Tiffany Colvin, CCRP Sr. Director Clinical Trial Operations, Fred Hutch Cancer Center— another presenter—emphasized the dedication of the people involved in running a clinical trial, spanning various areas of healthcare: “Without collaboration, we couldn't offer the latest and greatest treatment options. We hold ourselves accountable to transparency, quality, safety, and integrity in conducting these clinical trials. Trials offer patients early access to promising new therapies under strict supervision and comprehensive support from a dedicated research team.""

The newly posted on-demand webinar occurred live on February 28. Support was provided by AstraZeneca; Daiichi Sankyo; Genentech, Inc; and GSK.

NCCN has long advocated for clinical trial participation through the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)—evidence-based, expert consensus-driven recommendations used to guide cancer care decisions around the world. On every guideline, the front cover includes the statement: “NCCN recognizes the importance of clinical trials and encourages participation when applicable and available. Trials should be designed to maximize inclusiveness and broad representative enrollment.”

South African officials say a member of a research team at an isolated Antarctica base has been put under psychological evaluation after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues

Fear at Isolated Antarctica Base as a Man Is Accused of Attacking a Colleague and Making Threats

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.

The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.

The email pleaded for help.

“His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the email said, according to The Sunday Times. “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.

South Africa's Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely “to mediate and restore relationships at the base.” They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.

“The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,” the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.

The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.

The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.

The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.

Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.

The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.

“It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said.

Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.

In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.

The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they'd experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.

Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto.

Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump's White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom.

“When there's financial distress, they always print money. It doesn't matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News.

The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump's on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession.

""When the floodgates open, it's go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they're going to reflate and print more money than anyone's ever printed before.”

The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing.

“We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said.

Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices.

“All eyes are on the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week,” BlackRock analysts wrote in a note.

The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed's latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump's campaign to see them brought down.

Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell's all-important, post-decision press conference.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news","BTC, DOGE, XRP News: Dogecoin, Ripple XRP Lose 3% as BTC Traders Look to FOMC","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/18/doge-xrp-down-3-as-bitcoin-traders-eye-wednesday-fed-decision","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:32:00 GMT","

The crypto market was little changed-to-lower on Tuesday, with dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP leading declines among major tokens with losses of just over 3% in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, fell 2%.

The lack of volatility comes as bitcoin (BTC) traders largely brace for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday, which could set the tone for monetary policy and influence risk assets including cryptocurrencies.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates — widely expected to remain unchanged at 4.25%–4.50% — and any comments from Chair Jerome Powell could sway investor sentiment. A hawkish stance, signaling tighter policy or a slower path to rate cuts, might pressure bitcoin and lead to more pronounced losses in altcoins. Conversely, a dovish tilt hinting at future easing could spark a relief rally.

“A rate cut this Wednesday remains highly unlikely as the U.S. pivots away from fiscal dominance, where government spending fueled growth, toward [President Donald] Trump's push for deficit reduction,” traders from QCP Capital shared in a broadcast message Tuesday. “The shift puts the burden back on monetary policy. While we do not anticipate a surprise cut, any dovish signal from Powell could be the catalyst that sparks upside momentum.

“Capital may be rotating out of Trump-driven momentum trades like NASDAQ and Bitcoin and into long-overlooked European and Chinese markets. Historically, crypto prices have lagged shifts in global liquidity conditions,” QCP Capital traders added.

Agne Linge of WeFi noted that broader market volatility remains elevated, with the crypto fear and greed index at 22 — indicating ""extreme fear"" — as investors grapple with uncertainties around inflation, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions.

“In the United States, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recorded their fourth consecutive weekly declines last week, with the Dow Jones dropping by 3.1% to record its worst weekly turnover in about 24 months. While the previous week saw an unusual drawdown, more uncertainty lies ahead for the rest of the month,” Linge said, noting any macroeconomic headwinds could ultimately weigh down bitcoin prices.

At Bitget Research, chief analyst Ryan Lee said bitcoin remains in a tight range with a move to either $75,000 or $90,000 equally likely, based on how traders react to the U.S. rate decision.

“Bitcoin's recent pullback has traders watching key support levels between $82,000 and $85,000. It's a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether the recent momentum has real staying power,” Lee said in an email to CoinDesk. “Any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market.

“If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000,” he added.

Some cities in the metro area are making an effort to ban cryptocurrency machines due scam risks. FOX 9's Mike Manzoni has the story.

FOREST LAKE, Minn. (FOX 9) - The Forest Lake City Council met Monday night to discuss how to handle a surge in scams involving cryptocurrency kiosks.

The backstory:

Forest Lake police said victims have lost more than $300,000 in schemes involving cryptocurrency kiosks over the last two years. The Forest Lake City Council met Monday night to consider how to clamp down on the scams. The options include regulating or banning virtual currency machines.

What is cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is purchased electronically. Both Bitcoin and Ether are popular cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency is used for payments and as an investment.

How the scams work:

The scammers typically impersonate police officers or government officials, often convincing victims over the phone that they have committed a crime and need to pay money to avoid jail time. The scammers then stay on the phone and force the victims to lie to bank tellers, police officers and others. The scams conclude when the victims wire funds to the scammers via cryptocurrency kiosks, which are found at many convenience stores.

Scammers also commonly use investment fraud schemes, which involve convincing victims to send them funds under the guise of investments. In many cases, the victims never recover their lost money.

What are the city's options:

The city council has three options: do not take any action, pass an ordinance requiring owners to register kiosks or ban them outright.

During Monday night's meeting, the council expressed support for an ordinance.

The ordinance would impose a $2,000 to $3,000 fee and require signage and cameras at kiosk locations to deter fraud. In addition, a kiosk operator would not be allowed to register if there were three or more reported instances of fraud involving one of their kiosks in the preceding 12 months.

What they're saying:

""The employees will even see people come in all confused standing at the kiosk and they'll ask them questions like, ‘Do you know what you're doing? Do you need help?' And they're so wrapped up in the scam that they just brush everyone off,"" explained Forest Lake police Detective Nathan Olstad.

The City of Woodbury has reported $6.6 million in cryptocurrency losses from kiosks and online transactions since 2021. The City of White Bear Lake reported about $125,000 in losses in 2023.

The cities of Stillwater, Hastings and Cottage Grove are considering banning kiosks.

Big picture view:

In 2023, the FBI received more than 5,500 complaints involving cryptocurrency kiosks, with losses totaling more than $189 million. There were nearly 70,000 reports of fraud involving cryptocurrency, with total losses of $5.6 billion, a 45 percent increase from the previous year, according to the FBI. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the losses have increased tenfold since 2020.

In 2023, there were 976 complaints involving cryptocurrency fraud in Minnesota, with total losses of more than $75 million, according to the FBI. The state ranks in the top 20 for both virtual currency fraud reports and losses.

What's next:

The city council will discuss an ordinance requiring owners to register cryptocurrency kiosks at its March 24 meeting.

“To me, it would seem almost crazy not to consider Bitcoin as a potential asset to hold given how well its performed,” said Rep. Jordan Teuscher. 

That's exactly what Utah lawmakers plan to do with a new bill, House Bill 230, sponsored by Representative Jordan Teuscher and Senator Kirk Cullimore, which would allow the state treasurer to invest public funds in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.

“It is a bill that establishes important rights for those that own or mine digital assets, while at the same time pointing to the rest of the nation that Utah is innovative and taking advantage of new technologies,” said Rep. Teuscher. 

This bill isn't the first of its kind. Rep. Teuscher said around 15 other states have similar bills pending. The bill also doesn't specify any digital asset for investment, but includes a provision that it must have a market cap of more than $500 billion, making Bitcoin the only asset that qualifies currently. Rep. Tuescher explained this bill as an investment for the government of Utah.

“I think what we look at here is this is a long-term investment play. This is not playing daily trading of crypto on the market. It's an asset class that we're seeing investments for all the major investment players.”  

This bill would allow the state treasurer to invest about 5% of public funds, amounting to around sixty million dollars as a cap. With public investment on the table, it raises a key question: what is cryptocurrency?

“The idea here is Bitcoin is, at this point, become a sort of important macroeconomic asset. It's sort of the 21st century version of gold, but it's digital gold. It's like gold that you could email. And it has properties that are very different than other types of assets,” said Zachary Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute.

“I think this bill does a good job of saying, listen, don't discriminate against Bitcoin miners as a consumer of energy. Bitcoin miners are just data centers similar to the data centers that train AI. They have all sorts of possible potential good externalities for the grid and for the environment, and if you're concerned about carbon emissions, you should regulate those carbon emissions,” 

Cryptocurrency poses energy consumption concerns but Shapiro argues that Bitcoin mining is no different from other energy-intensive industries.

Japanese internet marketing service QRESTIA has announced that its cross-border e-commerce site, wafuu.com, will accept cryptocurrency payments worldwide. Customers can purchase Japanese goods and products more securely using any of 16 cryptocurrencies, supported by 83 wallet types and 22 exchanges.

Some of the more common cryptocurrencies accepted include BTC, USDT, ETH, TON, USDC, SOL, APE, BNB, POL, TRX, SAND, DAI, AXS, TUSD, MKR, and UNI. Customers can use exchanges and wallets not currently supported by the platform, although the user experience is less smooth.

The launch of cryptocurrency payments should enhance the shopping experience for wafuu.com customers from around 70 countries, in a faster, more reliable purchasing process. Multilingual support is available in 21 languages, making it easier for global customers from outside Japan to shop securely and with confidence.

The president and CEO of Wafúú's parent company QRESTIA, Hidemasa Fukada, said of the cryptocurrency launch, “Adopting cryptocurrency payments marks a significant step for wafuu.com in delivering Japan's high-quality products to people around the globe. We will continue to provide a safe and convenient environment for cryptocurrency holders and serve as a bridge connecting Japan and international markets.”

Wafúú plans to introduce further localised payment options and schemes in other countries around the world, and build partnerships with overseas collaborators.

According to QRESTIA Inc, the move to accepting cryptocurrencies is to break down the “barriers of distance, language, and currency, to provide a truly border-less experience.” The use of cryptocurrencies in addition to fiat currencies should strengthen cross-border e-commerce to the site and streamline international transactions for the seller and customers.

Wafúú, roughly translated, means ‘Japanese style,' and the company's hook-line is “Bringing the best of Japan to the world.” It offers a range of goods produced in or for Japan, including electronics, foods, clothing, toys, and lifestyle accessories.

It is not every day that you hear someone call Bitcoin BTCUSD not just a bad investment but outright harmful to the economy. But then again, Peter Schiff is not just anyone. 

The economist, known as the biggest skeptic of cryptocurrencies and an equally popular gold proponent, has once again taken aim at Bitcoin, this time framing it as a destructive force for the United States of America. 

While his views might not sit well with crypto enthusiasts, Schiff's arguments are hard to ignore, especially when you look at what is happening on the markets.

Bitcoin will cause a lot of people to lose a lot of money, and its been very harmful to the U.S. economy.

Bitcoin vs. gold

The precious metal has been on a tear recently, closing above $3,000 for the first time ever, a milestone that Schiff believes is just the beginning. Silver, too, is flexing its muscles, trading at $34.10, while U.S. stocks are lagging behind their foreign counterparts. 

The expert points out the irony in the new U.S. administration's reported moves: selling domestic stocks to buy foreign ones and, as he alleges, dumping Bitcoin to invest into gold. It is an occurrence that, in his view, shows where smart money is at.TradingView"">

But let's talk about Bitcoin for a moment. Schiff is not buying the hype, and he is not alone. Since its peak in November 2021, the cryptocurrency has lost 26% of its value against gold, a trend that Schiff says underscores the growing outflow of investors from crypto to the precious metal.

“What do you think they're buying with the money?” he asks, pointing to the downtrend in Bitcoin's price as evidence that gold is leaving ""crypto in the dust.""

Then there's inflation

He argues that while the ""tariff war"" is often blamed for rising prices, the real issue is inflation - something the Federal Reserve has failed to take under control. 

As the cost of goods climbs higher, Schiff believes gold will continue to shine, while Bitcoin's so-called resilience will be put to the test as ETF investors start cashing out.

For now, Bitcoin is indeed struggling, losing the $82,000 price point today. But whether Schiff's predictions come true remains to be seen. 

One thing is for sure, though: his warnings about Bitcoin's impact on the economy are as bold as ever.

Xapo Bank now offers bitcoin-backed loans, allowing members to access USD funds using their BTC as collateral without asset sales. 

A new lending product from Xapo Bank allows qualifying members to access USD loans using their bitcoin holdings as collateral. This enables bitcoin holders to tap into the fiat value of their assets without having to sell.

Xapo Bank, a licensed bank focused on bitcoin services, launched bitcoin-backed lending this week. Eligible members can now take out loans up to $1,000,000 secured against their bitcoin.

Once approved, the loan funds are instantly deposited into the member's bank account. The corresponding bitcoin is held in secure storage by Xapo until repayment. This allows members to retain their bitcoin long-term while borrowing against their current value.

Members can select flexible repayment terms from 30 days up to 1 year. There are no early repayment fees or penalties, giving borrowers control over minimizing costs.

According to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, the product addresses the need for responsible bitcoin and crypto lending solutions. Many bitcoin holders have previously faced loss of assets from high-risk lending platforms.

Xapo states its bitcoin-backed loans have more conservative loan-to-value ratios from 20% to 40% to protect member assets. Automated controls around repayment and loan health monitoring further reduce risks compared to other crypto lending products.

The launch comes as bitcoin holders increasingly look to access the value of their holdings without asset sales. Selling bitcoin to cover short-term financing needs can result in lost future upside.

However, experts urge caution when leveraging bitcoin holdings, as price declines could trigger collateral liquidations if loans become undercollateralized. Thorough due diligence on lender practices and risks is advised.

The calm that has returned to the bitcoin (BTC) market may be short-lived, potentially setting the stage for a storm that could trigger significant price volatility, according to insights from the decentralized crypto on-chain options platform Derive.

Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve.

With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive.

""BTC's weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today,"" Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk.

It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin. 

“Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%),"" Forster added.

Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction.

According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including ""a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration.""

Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date.

Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well. 

The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher.

Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock.

""Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don't point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut,"" BlackRock said in a weekly note.

The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.

Bitcoin may have lost some of its sheen in the last eight weeks, but for Alexis Sirkia, the asset's value proposition hasn't changed. 

In fact, investors are getting a stunning deal on the $1.6 trillion cryptocurrency. 

“The value of Bitcoin is still the same,” the co-founder of market maker GSR and founder of crypto clearing house Yellow told DL News. 

“It's still $100,000, now there's just a 20% discount because of risk and uncertainty.”

Despite President Donald Trump's abrupt pivot to embrace the crypto industry, his administration's aggressive tariff regime has sent investors fleeing. 

When he threatened to tax European spirits by 200% on March 13, the S&P 500 dropped by 10% from its February high. 

Bitcoin has also plummeted over 20% off its record set on January 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.

Likewise, the president's promise to establish a national crypto stockpile has developed in fits and starts. 

On March 2, he said the reserves would include four tokens in addition to Bitcoin, such as Ether, Solana, Cardano, and Ripple's XRP. 

While initially bullish — the messaging sent those assets soaring — it's unclear when precisely the multibillion-dollar buying is expected to kick off. 

Meanwhile, investors are flocking to gold as the VIX, which tracks market expectations for volatility, has soared over 50% this month.

The precious metal, historically a haven asset, hit a new record price of $3,000 in March.

“It's not such a long-term asset in the view of institutions as gold,” Sirkia told DL News regarding Bitcoin's investment profile.

Still, Sirkia, who said he first bought Ether at just 27 cents, is unphased.

Calling from his mega-yacht off the coast of New Zealand via Starlink, the crypto exec said it's just a matter of time before Bitcoin returns to smoother waters. 

He's not alone, either. 

Arthur Hayes, CIO of Maelstrom, said in March that the recent correction is a temporary liquidity squeeze — and that once the cycle turns, it will rally to $250,000 by year-end. 

“If we remove all the uncertainty, Bitcoin will appreciate,” said Sirkia. “We're in the middle of a bull run.”

The Bitcoin price appears to be holding its breath ahead of tomorrow's Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has slid just below $83,000, having lost 0.8% in the past day, according to CoinGecko data.

Traders are moving a lot less Bitcoin than they were this time last week, when President Donald Trump's trade war again got put on pause. In the past 24 hours, $22 billion worth of Bitcoin has changed hands—a very sharp drop from the $49 billion worth of volume BTC saw a week ago.

Only 1% of traders are holding out hope that the Federal Reserve will announce a rate cut tomorrow, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. President Trump has been among the voices calling for the Fed to drop rates.

""I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world,"" Trump said in remarks made over video to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The Bank of England and European Central Bank have all cut rates recently. And the Bank of Japan is expected to pause its rate hikes at its next meeting.

But the Fed hasn't budged.

Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said markets could see some positive action if Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at least keeps hope alive that the FOMC will cut rates later in the year.

""Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin's growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact,"" he said in a market note shared with Decrypt.

Analysts at Singapore-based QCP Capital agreed that traders could shift sentiment if Powell leaves hope alive. ""While we do not anticipate a surprise cut, any dovish signal from Powell could be the catalyst that sparks upside momentum,"" they wrote in a market note Tuesday morning.

Although Lee expects some volatility immediately during and after Powell's remarks, scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m. EST, Lee added that Bitcoin could drop as low as $80,000.

""Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence,"" he said, ""while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level.""

Users of MYRIAD, the decentralized prediction market launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, are evenly split on whether Bitcoin's price will top $83,000 by the end of the day on March 23.

As macroeconomic turmoil has battered markets, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has taken a big hit since the start of the year.

Open interest reached a 2025 peak of $69 billion on January 21, but has since dropped by 30% to $48 billion, according to Coinglass data. Derivatives traders use futures contracts to bet on future price movements. That cuts both ways. When uncertainty lingers, open interest starts to dry up.

By Isabella Flores

Key Takeaways

The biggest financial manager in the world, BlackRock, just bought Bitcoin valued at $42.3 million, therefore underlining its increasing dedication to digital assets. Especially via its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has drawn significant investor attention, the company has progressively raised its exposure to Bitcoin.

The purchase fits BlackRock's more general plan of increasing its range of cryptocurrencies. The new Bitcoin acquisition by BlackRock fits CEO Larry Fink's changing attitude on cryptocurrencies, from doubt to strong encouragement. Institutional players like BlackRock are positioned to gain from Bitcoin's long-term growth as acceptance of the cryptocurrency picks speed. The company's ongoing Bitcoin accumulation points to growing faith in its function as a store of value and counter against economic volatility.

BlackRock's interest in Bitcoin is notable given its weight in conventional finance. With more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM), the company's support of Bitcoin provides institutional investors contemplating exposure to digital assets with a great confirmation.  Since its introduction, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has been performing rather well and drawing billions of inflows.

Apart from BlackRock's investment, ARK Invest under Cathie Wood bought $88.5 million worth of Bitcoin, therefore proving institutional conviction in the commodity. Regularly raising its visibility via both direct investments and its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), ARK Invest has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin's promise.



This purchase fits ARK Invest's optimistic long-term view of Bitcoin; Cathie Wood has projected that by 2030 Bitcoin might be valued at $1 million each coin. In the changing financial scene, the company sees Bitcoin as a major asset especially as demand for distributed assets driven by global economic instability and inflation worries shapes the scene.

One of the most ardent institutional backers of Bitcoin, ARK Invest's most recent acquisition lends more validity to the asset's prospective.

With BlackRock's combined investments of more than $130 million in a single day plus ARK Invest's, the market receives a strong positive signal.

The growing curiosity of institutional players like BlackRock and ARK Invest has significant effects on the direction of the Bitcoin market.

Boxford police Detective Nathaniel Peabody presents a check for the recovered cryptocurrency funds to resident Paul Miller at the station.

BOXFORD — Police say they have successfully recovered funds for a Boxford resident who fell victim to a sophisticated PayPal/Bitcoin scam last summer, marking the first time in Essex County authorities have been able to seize and reclaim cryptocurrency from an exchange.

The case began June 26, when the resident reported being scammed out of $13,000 after receiving a fraudulent email from PayPal, Boxford police said in a news release this week. The scam led the victim to a phone number displayed on his computer, where he was misled into believing a refund error had occurred and instructed to send funds back via Bitcoin.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and a key member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has warned that the U.S.'s increasing embrace of cryptocurrencies.

Trump's administration has been actively supporting the cryptocurrency industry, pushing for major reforms to make the U.S. the global leader in digital assets. Under his leadership, the U.S. has formed a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and introduced several crypto-friendly initiatives. However, the market's reaction has been volatile. Bitcoin, for example, recently dropped below $80,000, marking a 25% decline from its January peak of $109,000, highlighting investor uncertainty. The S&P 500 also fell over 10% after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European spirits.

The ECB has been critical of crypto's speculative nature, with ECB President Christine Lagarde previously calling Bitcoin a “speculative asset with no intrinsic value.” The bank has warned that unregulated digital currencies could undermine global financial stability. In contrast, the ECB has been working toward a more controlled approach with its digital payments infrastructure initiative, which aims to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), such as the digital euro. This initiative reflects the ECB's preference for safer, state-backed solutions as opposed to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.

Villeroy de Galhau's comments reflect Europe's growing concern about the U.S.'s laissez-faire attitude toward crypto. He believes Europe must strengthen its negotiating position to counterbalance the U.S. and avoid complacency in the face of the shifting global financial landscape. The ECB's regulatory approach stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has eased its regulatory crackdown on crypto platforms.

Furthermore, the European Union has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), designed to create a unified regulatory framework for the crypto sector across its 27 member states. While MiCA aims to provide more clarity and stability in the market, its strict licensing and compliance requirements could pose challenges for smaller crypto firms, especially those struggling to meet capital reserve and consumer protection standards.

As both the U.S. and Europe continue to shape their approaches to cryptocurrency, the potential clash in their regulatory philosophies could have lasting effects on the future of the global crypto industry.

Russian oil firms are using USDT, Bitcoin and Ethereum to evade Western sanctions and facilitate international trade, according to four anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.

Speaking to Reuters, the sources reported that Russian oil companies have been using the three cryptocurrencies to convert Chinese yuan and Indian rupees into rubles.

Andrew Fierman, Head of National Security Intelligence at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, told Decrypt that cryptocurrency, “has, and will continue to play a role in facilitation of sanctions evasion” by Russia, citing the “general lack of access to the traditional financial ecosystem, due to the extensive and broad reaching sanctions” imposed on the country.

Crypto is now a growing if still minor part of Russia's international oil and gas trade, which saw its revenues grow by 26% in 2024 to $108 billion—with one Russian oil trader's sales to China now worth “tens of millions of dollars per month,” according to one source cited by Reuters.

Russia's crypto-enabled oil trade usually works with a buyer of oil sending either yuan or rupees to an intermediary, who then converts payments into crypto and sends it onto Russia, where it is sold for rubles.

Most of Russia's international oil trade still operates using fiat currencies, with use of the United Arab Emirates' dirham becoming increasingly frequent in the wake of sanctions.

According to one source cited by Reuters, Russian oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even after sanctions are lifted, given the speed and convenience they can afford.

Fierman told Decrypt that the drive towards using crypto has come from the top of Russia's political system, with the State Duma introducing “legislation late last year permitting cross-border payments” settled using cryptocurrencies.

“However, it's not to say Russia won't continue using more traditional methods to evade sanctions, including through the use of shell and front companies,” he added.

In fact, the push towards the cross-border use of crypto goes back a little further than last winter, given that the Central Bank of Russia advised businesses back in July 2024 that they should use digital assets and other alternative payments as a means of conducting international trade.

“New financial technology creates opportunities for schemes which did not exist before,” said CBR governor Elvira Nabiullina, speaking at a financial conference in St. Petersburg at the time. She explained that, “This is why we softened our stance on the use of cryptocurrencies in international payments, allowing the use of digital assets in such payments.”

This pronouncement was then followed by the aforementioned passage of legislation which legalized the use of crypto for cross-border trade, and which also enabled the CBR to transfer money overseas using private virtual currencies.

Speaking in July, Nabiullina affirmed that cross-border crypto payments would begin in the fall.

“We are already discussing the conditions of the experiment with ministries, agencies and businesses, and we expect that the first such payments will take place by the end of this year,” she said.

Russia's embrace of crypto isn't without its challenges and vulnerabilities, according to Fierman.

“Russian entities seeking to evade sanctions run the risk of law enforcement disruption, as recently seen earlier this month with the seizure of Garantex's domains and servers, in addition to the freezing of over $26 million in funds,” he told Decrypt.

Fierman also noted that the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency disrupted a multi-billion dollar Russian money laundering network back in December, leading to more than 80 arrests and the seizure of more than $25 million in crypto and cash.

Not only is cryptocurrency usage often very traceable, but legislation is catching up to the growing use of crypto for sanctions evasion and money laundering.

Fierman explains, “As regulation continues to strengthen AML/CFT requirements, mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to protect against potential sanctions evasion through their platforms, which makes it more challenging to execute sanctions evasion at scale.”

As an example, Fierman cites how the European Union has prohibited the provision of cryptocurrency wallets, accounts and custody services to Russia or Russian persons, while the United States has issued dozens of sanctions designations in recent months against Russian entities involved in using cryptocurrency.

Tech giant Microsoft shared a new report warning of malware that targets 20 of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets used with the Google Chrome extension.



Microsoft's Incident Response researchers raised alarms of a new remote access trojan (RAT), dubbed StilachiRAT, which could deploy “sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data,” the team shared in a blog post.



According to the team, the malware was discovered in November 2024, and it could steal users' wallet information, and any credentials, including usernames and passwords, stored in their Google Chrome browser. StilachiRAT targets 20 crypto wallets including some of the most widely-used ones like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, OKX Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet.



While the malware has not been distributed widely, Microsoft did share that it has not been able to identify what entity is behind the threat and laid out some mitigation guidelines for current targets including installing antivirus software.



“Due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape,” the team wrote.

This policy permits the central bank to sell bonds that reduce the supply of cash floating around in order to keep inflation low and keep the economy in a safe place. If this policy winds down, as many expect it to, that could drastically increase the value of cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin. Because these digital funds get a large part of their value from their limited supply, they could become more valuable if the U.S. government takes its hands off the fiat currency supply.

Bitcoin is down 0.95% today to $82,273 (BTC/USD), and it has gained slightly over the last week. Tariff concerns and sticky inflation are keeping Bitcoin low, as both of these factors limit how much money people have available to risk on cryptocurrency.

Discretionary spending has been tight this year, with January marked as a month of high consumer prices and tight inflation. February was a bit better, but the economy is still in a rough spot, and the stock market is also being hit hard by new tariff policies that have kept the stock indices negative for four weeks. All of this hurts cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin and makes investors wary of putting their money into decentralized finance.

What may happen, though, if the Federal Reserve decides to decrease their quantitative tightening (QT), is that Bitcoin and other crypto tokens could shoot up. This may happen near the end of April in anticipation of the end of QT. That could bring Bitcoin back over the $100K mark in a big way. While it is still unlikely that the coin will hit $150K this year, it is the potential for QT ending that holds the most promise right now that Bitcoin will skyrocket.

Investors are also hoping that President Donald Trump will improve the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrency. If that happens this year, it could mean that there will be fewer crypto restrictions, and it will become easier to trade Bitcoin.

According to data provided by cryptocurrency analytics platform CoinGlass, a massive Bitcoin whale has increased their short position to an eye-popping $515 million on the Hyperliquid platform.

In fact, this is now believed to be the largest Bitcoin short ever.

As reported by U.Today, the whale opened a short position of $332 million with 40x leverage last week, causing a significant stir. 

After facing a multi-million loss on Monday, the trader has made a stunning comeback. His current unrealized profit stands at $6.43 million. 

Cryptocurrency market participants are now trying to hunt down the Hyperliquid whale and liquidate their position. The liquidation price currently stands at $85,557.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has just dipped below the $83,000 level. The cryptocurrency is down by nearly 1% over the past 24 hours. Overall, $184 million worth of crypto has been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with short positions making up the majority of this sum ($94.19 million).

Bitcoin is widely expected to experience more volatility on Wednesday when the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to unveil its rate decision on March 19. The Fed is widely expected to keep the benchmark rate unchanged. 

Ciara Sun, managing partner at C2Ventures, claims that Bitcoin's low volume is ""flashing caution"" despite the green close recorded by the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index, which tends to have a strong correlation with the largest cryptocurrency. ""Without strong momentum, we could see increased volatility and a further decline in BTC. Watching patiently for shifts in market sentiment,"" she said.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the Governor of the Bank of France and a prominent member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has cautioned against the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., hinting at possible global financial instability. In a recent interview with La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy de Galhau criticized the policies of the Trump administration here, characterizing them as potential precursors to future crises.

The support for the cryptocurrency industry from the Trump administration has been significant, with initiatives such as the formation of a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets and the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated volatility, with Bitcoin's value plummeting below $80,000—a stark 25% decrease from its January high of $109,000. This slump reflects broader investor uncertainty, as evidenced by the S&P 500's more than 10% decline following Trump's tariff threats on European spirits.

While the ECB remains wary of cryptocurrencies, describing them as speculative assets, Europe is actively pursuing a more structured approach through its digital payments infrastructure initiative. This reflects the ECB's preference for a digital euro, a central bank digital currency that stands in contrast to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.

Villeroy de Galhau's comments also underscore Europe's apprehension regarding the U.S.'s relaxed regulatory stance on crypto. This concern is evidenced by the European Union's introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), aiming to establish a coherent regulatory framework across its member states. Although MiCA seeks to provide clarity and stability, its rigorous requirements may pose challenges for smaller crypto firms.

As the U.S. and Europe continue to develop divergent regulatory philosophies on cryptocurrency, the impact of these differences on the global crypto industry's future remains to be seen.

According to Crypto Rover, a potential full ceasefire and permanent peace negotiation between Trump and Putin is seen as highly bullish for Bitcoin. This development could lead to increased investor confidence in cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset during times of geopolitical stability.

        Share    

Analysts speculate that a whale may have set up a $520 million Bitcoin short 40x leverage position on Hyperliquid as a trap to trigger a massive long.

On Mar. 16, a Bitcoin (BTC) whale placed a massive $520 million short position on Hyperliquid (HYPE) using 40x leverage, making it one of the largest known trades on the decentralized exchange. 

With a liquidation price of $85,561, the trade would be wiped out if Bitcoin rose just 1.75% from his entry at $83,898. This immediately drew the attention of traders who saw an opportunity to force a liquidation.

Pseudonymous trader Cbb0fe took to X  to rally a group to push Bitcoin's price higher and trigger the liquidation. The price surged by 2.5% within minutes on the same day, nearly hitting the whale's threshold before they added more funds to raise their liquidation price.

According to 10x Research's Mar. 17 report, analyst Markus Thielen noted that this event is part of a growing trend involving the democratization of stop-loss hunting. In this trend, independent traders, not just institutions, coordinate to move the market, powered by the transparency of leverage trading on DEXs.

Some analysts, however, think the whale's massive position might be a calculated strategy rather than a case of a careless short gone wrong. According to cryptocurrency analyst Josh Man, the whale might be intentionally exposing their position to liquidation in order to support a price rally, a rare tactic known as “self-liquidation.” 

So this there is a fairly rare and not widely used technique of self-liquidation and this FEELS a little like that.   In such events, the seller is actually creating a bomb designed to go off and create a rally from the liquidation of his own short.   One would expect that he has… https://t.co/JNcnCLO2E0

If the whale holds an even larger long position elsewhere, their own short liquidation could send Bitcoin higher, benefiting their long position significantly.

This isn't the first time Hyperliquid has seen such high-stakes plays. Just last week, a trader placed a $285 million leveraged Ethereum (ETH) bet that resulted in a $4 million loss for the platform. In response, Hyperliquid reduced leverage limits for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Now, the crypto community is watching the price movement of Bitcoin. Further upward momentum could be fueled if the whale's short position is liquidated. In any case, independent traders and the whale are currently engaged in a risky game of high-stakes competition in this trade.

Unrealized profits of Strategy from Bitcoin holdings have fallen below $8 billion, putting increasing pressure on Michael Saylor's Bitcoin investment strategy. The cryptocurrency market is clearly struggling, and Bitcoin has failed to maintain its recent bullish momentum.

Since 2020, MicroStrategy — now known as Strategy — has been actively buying Bitcoin, steadily growing its holdings even during downturns. However, the company's profit margins have drastically decreased as a result of Bitcoin's current price of about $83,000. According to recent disclosures, some of its most recent acquisitions were made for more than $97,000, putting them at an immediate loss. BTCUSDT Chart by TradingView"">

Although the company's dollar-cost averaging approach has held up well over time, its viability is called into question by the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin. Future purchases may become more cautious if the bearish trend persists because the unrealized gains may decrease even more.

Technically, it is still unclear how the price of Bitcoin will move. The 200-day moving average is serving as a crucial threshold as the asset is presently testing important support levels. If this level is broken, selling pressure may increase, and Bitcoin may enter a more severe correction phase.

The long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin, according to bulls, are still solid, and institutional adoption is still rising. Bears, on the other hand, point to declining volume and a dearth of pressing factors that might raise the price in the near future. 

Right now everyone is watching to see if Bitcoin can recover from higher resistance levels. A successful push above $90,000 might boost confidence, but if important supports are broken, there may be a protracted consolidation or more decline. Strategy's next course of action will probably rely on how well Bitcoin stabilizes and regains its bullish momentum.

In a series of intriguing social media posts and statements over the last week, rumors have been swirling that the US Department of Defense (DoD) may be on the verge of officially entering the Bitcoin mining space. The speculation stems from an X post by Michelle Weekley, Director of Product at Byte Federal, a well-known operator in the Bitcoin ATM sector.

Weekley wrote: “I think the DoD is going to start mining Bitcoin.” She attached four screenshots of posts on X as supporting evidence, each featuring a different prominent figure in the BTC community. While no formal confirmation has been issued by any government entity, these screenshots have sparked considerable chatter among industry watchers, particularly given the growing alignment between the current administration and some key players.

In the first post, Michael Saylor wrote, “₿ig things are coming.” The March 11, 2025 statement was viewed by 4.8 million users. Saylor, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of MicroStrategy, is known for his company's massive Bitcoin holdings—nearly 500,000 BTC—and also attended the first-ever White House Crypto Summit 10 days ago, making his cryptic post a subject of immediate speculation.

The second screenshot from Matthew Pines simply said, “The room where it happened,” posted on March 14, 2025, with 67,000 views. Pines is the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI), a Washington, DC-based think tank that last week hosted the “Bitcoin For America” summit. There, Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, which calls for the United States to acquire 1 million BTC.

The third set of tweets came from David Bailey, who stated, “When you think the show is over but it's really just beginning. Going to be a big month,” followed shortly by “Embrace the Game Theory,” referencing Saylor's declaration that “₿ig things are coming.” Bailey is CEO of BTC Inc., parent company of Bitcoin Magazine and The Bitcoin Conference, and is among the key figures who turned Donald Trump pro-BTC in his election campaign. The reference to “Game Theory” and the promise of a “big month” have led industry insiders to speculate about potential announcements on the horizon.

The fourth post is from Jason Lowery, who said, “Give it about 3 weeks and it should become more obvious,” quoting another tweet that asked about a change in profile picture. Lowery, a US Space Force officer and author of “Softwar,” is known for arguing that Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism could be interpreted as a form of strategic national defense.

Notably, Lowery liked Weekley's post on X. In response, she wrote “Just saying…” and shared a screenshot highlighting that Lowery had engaged with her post.

These developments arrive on the heels of President Donald Trump's recent Executive Order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the United States, which includes the directive that, “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

While the order does not explicitly mention mining, it seems like a possibility that mining could be one way to acquire additional BTC in a “budget neutral” way.

However, it is important to note that to date, no formal statement has confirmed any DoD involvement, and there is no official budget or legislative proposal explaining how such a program might be funded or organized.

At press time, BTC traded at $82,467.

Ashley and Grant arrive as a couple on Netflix's ""Temptation Island,"" hoping to mend their relationship.

However, Grant cheats and moves on to Natalie, and Ashley dates Danny and Logan.

Here's what we know about who Ashley, Grant, Natalie, Danny, and Logan are dating.

Ashley and Grant went on Netflix's first season of ""Temptation Island"" to mend their trust issues.

Instead, they found new lovers. And it seems that Ashley could still be with her new beau, Danny.

Losing your partner is the risk contestants take when they sign up for the dating show, where couples are separated and taken to live with singles who try to seduce them.

On this season, which is Netflix's first, four couples are featured, including Ashley and Grant. Ashley says on the show that Grant cheated on her a month into their relationship.

""Over time, it's just built up into this huge mess of mistrust and resentment, and I think if we can get through this, maybe it will clear that up,"" Grant says.

Grant says he wants to prove to Ashley and his daughter from a previous relationship that he can keep his word and resist temptation.

Ashley and Grant stay committed to each other in the first few days of the process.

But in the first of the show's bonfires in episode two, where contestants are shown what their partners have been up to, Grant sees a clip of Ashley complaining about his behavior and saying she's ""never going to trust him.""

Grant says this hurts him, and he gets closer to Natalie, one of the single contestants. By the end of episode three, Grant and Natalie kiss, and have sex in a shower in the following episode.

At the episode five bonfire, Ashley says she feels ""relief"" after seeing the videos of Grant cheating.

""I think I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting for the proof,"" Ashley says.

Grant initially regrets cheating. But after he sees another clip of Ashley bad-mouthing him at the bonfire, he deepens his relationship with Natalie when he returns to the villa.

At the same time, Ashley announces that she's single and starts to properly pursue Logan and Danny. As the show continues, she gets closer to Danny, eventually kissing him off-camera in episode six.

When Grant and Ashley reunite during the season one finale, he says he wants to leave the show alone, seemingly splitting up with Ashley and Natalie. Meanwhile, Ashley leaves the show in a relationship with Danny.

Ashley and Danny may still be dating, while it seems Grant and Natalie are over.

The finale aired a week ago, but none of the couples have publicly confirmed their relationship status. This could mean that Netflix is planning a reunion episode or will publish a ""Where Are They Now"" video like they do for ""Perfect Match."" Netflix declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider.

But on Tuesday, Ashley shared a photo of her and Danny on Instagram, captioned: 'This man always had me smiling ☺️""

They also follow each other on Instagram and TikTok. On their TikTok and Instagram feeds, they have shared videos featuring Logan where they joke about their throuple dynamic on the show.

On Monday, Ashley shared an Instagram story with a picture of her and Danny showing their close body language before the show's premiere party on March 15, captioned ""eyes up here.""

That day, Ashley reposted a video on her story of her interactions with Danny on the show, captioned: ""Wouldn't have survived without you.""

There are not many clues online about Grant's relationship status. On Sunday, he posted a video on Instagram and TikTok defending Natalie and told viewers to stop sending her hate.

Grant follows Natalie on both Instagram and TikTok, but she doesn't follow him. Natalie follows Ashley on Instagram. This suggests that Grant and Natalie are likely not together anymore. Natalie also hasn't said anything supporting Grant amid the backlash against them.

Season one of Netflix's ""Temptation Island"" is available to stream.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Tracy Morgan shared a selfie from his hospital bed — along with a health update — after a scary medical incident at the New York Knicks game on Monday, March 17.

""Thank you for all your concern! I'm doing ok now and doctors say it was food poisoning,"" Morgan, 56, wrote via Instagram on Tuesday, March 18, alongside a photo of himself smiling and giving the camera a thumbs-up. ""Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!""

Despite the scary situation, Morgan — who had wires stuck to his chest — proved that he hadn't lost his sense of humor. ""More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I'll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅 #goknicks,"" he quipped.

Morgan made headlines on Monday night when he was photographed vomiting courtside while the Knicks took on the Miami Heat. He was then escorted out in a wheelchair as Madison Square Garden staff cleaned the area around his seat — halting the game for 10 minutes before the Knicks ultimately defeated the Heat 116-95.

A post shared by instagram

The 30 Rock alum has faced his fair share of health issues through the years, most notably from a 2014 Walmart truck accident that killed his friend, comedian James McNair, and left Morgan in a coma with a broken leg.

In 2024, Morgan addressed the 10-year anniversary of the accident — which occurred when the truck slammed into Morgan's limo on the New Jersey Turnpike — revealing he has forgiven the driver of the vehicle.

""Today is 10 years since our fateful accident, and I want to say to everyone who was in the van with me that night I Love you, and we miss you, Uncle Jimmy Mac and God bless your family,"" the comedian said in a statement to People. ""To the driver that night and his family, me and my comrades forgive you.""

Pete Davidson is in a new relationship, and his partner is ""very different from anybody else he's ever dated.""

An insider recently told Page Six that the comedian is very happy with his new girlfriend, and that, unlike Davidson's most recent exes, she's not a celebrity. 

""She respects Pete and his desire for privacy. Although things are new for Pete, he really likes this woman."" The source also unveiled that Davidson's mother, Amy Waters Davidson, and sister, Casey Davidson, ""approve of this relationship and love seeing Pete so happy."" 

While the name of the star's current partner was not revealed, it was made very clear that he is in a good place and is enjoying where things are headed with his new flame. 

In recent years, Davidson has been romantically linked to reality star Kim Kardashian, songstress Ariana Grande, actresses Kate Beckinsale, Margaret Qualley, and Phoebe Dynevor, and model Kaia Gerber, per Elle. 

Just last month, the standout made a rare comment about the ""7 Rings"" hitmaker, whom he dated for a few months in 2018, revealing there's no bad blood between them during an interview with Page Six ahead of Saturday Night Live's 50th Anniversary Special, ""SNL50"". 

""When we see each other, which is few and far between, because we're not in the same circles, it's all love. I hope she wins the Oscar, I hope she takes the gold,"" he remarked, referencing her performance in 2024's Wicked. Davidson continued, praising all the women he's ever dated in a blanket statement. 

""I've had some pretty adult relationships with some pretty amazing women, and when it's ended it's been cool.""

Adam Sandler is back in the tee box as Happy Gilmore.

Happy Gilmore 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the 1996 golf comedy, has a brand-new trailer out Tuesday featuring Sandler taking his iconic running golf hack.

Ben Stiller, Julie Bowen, Bad Bunny and Christopher McDonald as Happy's arch rival, Shooter McGavin, appear in the new look. Real-life golfers such as Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau also appear briefly in the trailer.

Netflix also announced Sandler's two daughters, Sadie and Sunny Sandler, have joined the cast.

In the trailer, Happy is seen eyeing a collection of busts of golf legends Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, as well as a goofy-looking bust of himself.

Happy previews his return to the game, saying, ""I haven't swung a club in years.""

Later, the trailer shows Bad Bunny's character recklessly driving a golf cart with Happy on board before shattering a club over his knee.

Stiller, who appeared in the original film as Hal, is also seen reprising his role by greeting a shocked Happy.

Bowen, who plays Virginia, Happy's love interest from the first film, looks at him lovingly at one point in the trailer and teases, ""We're not done with golf.""

The teaser trailer ends with a hilarious modern twist, with Happy taking a swing on a golf simulator and launching a ball straight through the screen.

Netflix announced in May that Sandler would reprise his role from the 1996 comedy. The original film has evolved into a cult classic over the years and tells the story of a down-and-out hockey player who uses his prior experience to pick up golf.

Happy Gilmore 2 will hit Netflix July 25.

Interested in reading the Andor season 1 scripts? You're out of luck.

Tony Gilroy, the creator of the Star Wars Disney+ series, told Collider in a recent interview that he is no longer making any of the show's scripts public out of fear they will be used to train artificial intelligence.

Gilroy had been planning to release a book filled with the first season's scripts, but the rise of AI has put an end to that goal.

“I wanted to do it,” Gilroy said. “We put it together. It's really cool. I've seen it, I loved it. AI is the reason we're not. In the end, it would be 1,500 pages that came directly off this desk. I mean, terribly sadly, it's just too much of an X-ray and too easily absorbed. Why help the f****** robots anymore than you can? So, it was an ego thing. It was vanity that makes you want to do it, and the downside is real. So, vanity loses.”

Andor follows a year in the life of Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna. It showcases how he was radicalized into the rebel who helped steal the plans for the Death Star, which directly sets up the plot to the first Star Wars film, A New Hope.

Gilroy says the show has a ""pretty fancy bunch of writers.""

""Everybody's very experienced,” Gilroy said. “We only get together for five or six days in the beginning to talk about the story, and then we kind of go, and they do their thing, and then they go away. But I always have them as a reference to call upon.”

The second and final season of Andor premieres on April 22.

Disney is the parent company of Lucasfilm and ABC News.

Comedian Tracy Morgan left his courtside seat at the New York Knicks game on Monday (March 17) in a wheelchair after apparently falling ill during the team's matchup with the Miami Heat.

Cellphone footage taken at Monday night's game shows Morgan wiping what appeared to be vomit from his face before he was wheeled away from his courtside seat at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 

Following the incident, an announcer said the situation briefly delayed the game. The Knicks won their matchup against the Heat 116-95.

“We hope Tracy feels better soon and look forward to seeing him back courtside,” a Madison Square Garden spokesperson said in a statement.

Several celebrities offered their support for Morgan after video of the apparent health incident circulated online.

""Sending good thoughts to Tracy Morgan,"" Ben Stiller wrote on X.

""Prayers up for Tracy Morgan,"" former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III tweeted.

In his post-game interview, Knicks shooting guard Josh Hart told reporters, ""We hope everything's good with Tracy Morgan.""

""[He's an] avid, lifetime Knicks fan so prayers go out to him and his health and safety,"" he added.

On Tuesday (March 18), Morgan took to Instagram to reveal that he vomited at the Knicks game due to food poisoning. The comedian shared an update on his health alongside a photo of him from a hospital bed. 

""Thank you for all your concern! I'm doing ok now and doctors say it was food poisoning. Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!"" Morgan wrote on social media.

""More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I'll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅 #goknicks,"" he added.

Karlie Kloss is pregnant.

The 33-year-old model - who already has Levi, four, and 19-month-old Elijah with husband Joshua Kushner - took to Instagram to show off some photos of her growing baby bump, as well as pictures of her sons.

She captioned the post: ""Three's a party (sic)""

And Karlie admitted she is ""incredibly grateful"" to be expecting again.

She told Vogue.com: “Family is everything to me. Josh and I are incredibly grateful for this blessing.”

Karlie previously admitted that motherhood has changed her entire outlook on life.

The model described motherhood as a ""profound experience"" and confessed that she had ""no idea"" what to expect before she became a mom for the first time.

The catwalk star - who has been married to Joshua since 2018 - said on the 'Today' show: ""I just had this moment of like, ‘Wow, every woman who has a child, every parent goes through this'. It's just the most profound experience that I had no idea until having a kid.""

Karlie also revealed that motherhood has made her much more ""efficient"" and time-conscious, as her children are now her number one priority in life.

The model explained that she's ""actually on time everywhere now"".

She shared: ""Priorities change. Everything changes. I think the last few years have changed us as well. I have become, first of all, so much more efficient with my time. I'm actually on time everywhere now.""

The Estee Lauder spokesmodel shared her second pregnancy news at the 2023 Met Gala just weeks before she was due to give birth and previously admitted the reveal of her bump was ""really special"".

She said: “I felt kind of vulnerable. I was eight months pregnant here and I had somehow kept my pregnancy a secret.

“To actually see my friends and share this exciting, good news in person – and be able to see their reactions – was really special.”

Justin Baldoni's attorney insisted they may not be open to a settlement with Blake Lively.

The actress, 36, and 41-year-old filmmaker have been embroiled in a bitter labyrinthine legal dispute for months after she accused him of harassment while they made domestic abuse movie ‘It Ends With Us'.

Appearing on Matthew Belloni's podcast 'The Town', Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman was asked ""what it would require for this to go away"", as he referred to the ""potential for the circus and the damage to both sides"".

But Freedman argued: ""You keep referring to it as a circus and I get it. You see a lot of cases.

""You see a lot of things, but the reality is this is not a circus when you go through an experience like this.

""I've represented a lot of people in the worst moments of their career, the worst moments of their life. Justin has been destroyed by this.""

Freedman suggested ""the only way"" to really attempt to prove his client's innocence could be in court.

He continued: ""In this day and age, the only way that you can truly get back is to prove your innocence and that's what we're actively working to [do].

""That may only be able to be done in a courtroom.""

Justin, 41, completed filming on 'It Ends With Us' in early 2024 and started a press tour in August, and after fans noted Blake did not participate in interviews with him or attend the film's premiere.

Blake then filed a sexual harassment complaint against Justin – alleging that he and his agents conducted a smear campaign against her.

Her lawsuit against him is set to go to trial in March 2026, following her initial filing in New York Federal Court.

Blake - who played Justin's on-screen love interest in the movie - previously told the New York Times newspaper: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""

Justin - who also directed the 2024 romantic drama film - has denied the allegations, with his lawyer describing the claims as ""categorically false"".

Bryan, who is acting as a lawyer for the actor and his Wayfarer Studios production company, told Variety: ""These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.""

India TV 'She' Conclave: At the India TV 'She' Conclave, Bollywood actor, director and producer Kangana Ranaut came to speak candidly about her journey. The actor, known for her wit and talent, is also the Bhartiya Janata Party's (BJP) MP from Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. While talking about her last release, Emergency, Kangana Ranaut said that her film was not given the film certificate because people questioned the authenticity of her film. However, she believed that the film would see the light of day, and it did. She also mentioned the Chandigarh slap controversy and said that she was threatened before the release of the film. She said that people warned her to not show the Bhindranwale sequence from Emergency.

For the unversed, Kangana Ranaut's film Emergency was released on January 17, 2024, and was based on the life journey of India's first female Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.

Talking about the sexism in the entertainment industry, Kangana said that not just Bollywood but society loves to undermine women writers, actors and directors. 'This should change, and we as a society should bring this change,' the Queen actor added.

""Every field has its own mathematics, and this depends on several variables. You also see the filmgoing audience is largely men, and hence, that is shown on screen more. The more the women will move out of their homes and take charge, the more this situation will change,"" the Mandi MP said. Saying the same, the actor added that pay disparities are unfair towards women.

When asked about the biggest actor in Indian cinema, Kangana was quick to mention the late actor Rajesh Khanna. When she was asked for a female actor, she said her personal favourite is Vyjayanthimala. The National Award-winning actor added that she's influenced by her grace in real life.

For those who don't know, Kangana Ranaut marked her debut in 2006 with Emraan Hashmi and Shinny Ahuja starrer Gangster. She rose to fame with the 2008 movie Fashion. While Priyanka Chopra was in the leading role, Kangana made her presence felt, won her first National Award in a supporting role and told the world that she was here to stay. Over the years, Kangana has given several memorable films, like the Tanu Weds Manu movie series, Queen, Katti Batti, Rangoon, Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and Emergency, among others. She has won four National Awards in total for movies like Fashion, Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Queen and jointly for Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and Panga.

This is the time when you start thinking out of the box, instead of waiting for some brilliant successful commercial filmmaker to discover you. What is in my control is to go for the audition and give my 100 per cent.'
