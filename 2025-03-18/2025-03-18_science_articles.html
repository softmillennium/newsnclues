Mount Spurr near Anchorage has been showing signs of unrest for a year. Now scientists think it's creeping closer to an eruption.

A huge volcano in Alaska appears to be "moving closer to an eruption," scientists monitoring it have said.

Mount Spurr, which sits 81 miles (130 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is now releasing unusual levels of volcanic gases near its summit and from a flank vent that last erupted in 1992.

The 11,000-foot (3,370-meter) volcano has been undergoing an uptick in earthquakes and snow and ice melt on its slopes in the past year, indicating magma movement under the surface. Now, according to scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), it's most likely that this unrest will end in an eruption.

That's an increase in risk from the observatory's last assessment in February, which gauged that Mount Spurr was equally likely to simmer down as it was to erupt. Now, observations of increased carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from the volcano have tipped the balance toward an eruption, said Matt Haney, the scientist-in-charge of the AVO at the U.S. Geological Survey.

"This time period of unrest will eventually most likely end in an explosive eruption like the ones that happened in 1953 and 1992," Haney told Live Science.

Those eruptions both took place at Crater Peak, a flank vent about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the stratovolcano's summit. The last time the mountain's peak erupted was likely more than 5,000 years ago, Haney said, so scientists don't expect an eruption there — most likely, the rock between the eruptible magma and the summit crater is well-solidified and would be hard for any magma to burst through.

Any eruption will probably occur at Crater Peak, which has been more recently active and which probably has easier pathways to the surface for magma to move.

Crater Peak exploded three times over several months in 1992 and once in 1953. In both cases, ash erupted at least 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) in the atmosphere, Haney said. One of the explosions in 1992 sent the cloud drifting over Anchorage, blanketing the city in an eighth an inch (3.1 millimeters) of dust. In 1953, Anchorage experienced a quarter-inch (6.4 mm) ashfall.

If the magma movement beneath the volcano doesn't settle down, the next sign of an eruption will likely be volcanic tremor, Haney said.

Unlike the brief, small earthquakes that have been shuddering the volcano over the last year, volcanic tremor is a long, ongoing shaking that can last for minutes, hours, or days. It indicates that magma is rising and that an eruption is likely imminent.

In 1992, volcanic tremor started about three weeks before Mount Spurr erupted. Another nearby volcano that erupted in 2009, Mount Readout, showed volcanic tremor for two months before it blew its top.

"If we see [tremor]," Haney said, "that will be the next sign that Spurr is further progressing toward an eruption."

Environmentalist and author Paul Hawken speaks to Live Science about the worldview that has led to the mindless exploitation of the planet — and how we can shift perspectives for a better future.

The element carbon, in its oxidized form, is at the center of discussions about climate change. Carbon is often vilified and cast as the culprit for global warming, destruction and loss.

But what we tend to forget is that carbon is the main ingredient for life. And we are the only species on Earth that disrupts the natural flow of carbon, says environmentalist and author Paul Hawken.

Hawken's new book, "Carbon: The Book of Life" (Viking, 2025), shines a spotlight on the countless flows of carbon that power life, from individual cells to vast underground fungal networks and entire human societies. Through the lens of carbon, the author takes the reader on a journey through corporate retreats, the pharmaceutical sector, the food industry and the realms of plants, insects and fungi.

Live Science sat down with Hawken before the book's publication on March 18 to discuss the language we use to talk about the climate and the paradigm shift needed to start valuing, restoring and protecting the natural flow of carbon on Earth.

Q: "Carbon" is about showing that carbon is not just a problem we need to neutralize, but also a vital force that flows through every living being and Earth system. How does this encourage us to think differently about climate change?

Hawken: The narrative [around global warming] is really screwed up, frankly, because it has objectified carbon, the atmosphere, climate change, etcetera. It's the same mindset that caused the problem: We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends.

When people say we're going to "fix" the climate, or "tackle" or "combat" climate change, to me it's just so emblematic of this profound disconnection between self and other. We don't have a climate crisis; the climate cannot have a crisis. We are the crisis. That's what I want to explore. [I want] to go to a place that's not just insular and about self, but actually [gives rise to] a sense of being in the world that can create a sensibility that forms community. Because all of life as we know it exists in a community.



Q: I found the book very uplifting and hopeful. How do you find the drive to write about the climate when everything we hear from scientists is so bleak?

Hawken: What I'm trying to do in my own life, certainly, but also in communication, is to create the context in which people can see the world. Because what you see and receive really determines your mindset, your consciousness, your awareness and your sense of stress, anxiety and equanimity in the face of events that are troubling. Rather than going to the trouble and staying with that, I'm looking for a conversation that makes sense. That's where change needs to happen.

We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends."

Q: Could you give an example of where the current conversation does not make sense to you? 

Hawken: People talk about "net zero." I'm not a physicist, but I can tell you that "net zero" does not exist in terms of carbon. "Carbon neutrality" does not exist.

If you look at the proposals to really shift away from fossil fuels, what we're talking about is renewable energies to energize an economy that's skyrocketing in consumption, which is destruction. Renewable energy doesn't really take a step back to ask: "Energizing yes, but what?" And if we don't look at that, then we're just in a gerbil wheel. We may have the illusion that the faster we go, the faster we're getting somewhere, but actually we're not — it's almost the opposite.

Q: A few chapters of the book focus on health and the food industry. How do those topics relate to carbon and why was it important to include them?

Hawken: The book is about life and about carbon as an element. The flow of carbon is, in a sense, the flow of life. I began to look at the food system and what was being sold, what was being promoted. One thing led to another in terms of looking at health and self and food and agriculture as a system that is inseparable from the rest. That goes back to carbon, because if you look at a healthy agricultural system, it's full of carbon. That whole systemic understanding of food and health and farming and soil and agricultural practices and chemistry is also a way of looking at the other systems we have and that we take for granted.

Q: This leads nicely into the "spaceship Earth" you mention in the book. Spaceship Earth is a concept that encourages us to think of the planet as a closed system with limited resources. Humanity is the crew, and every passenger should work toward the greater good of this crew. Why do you like this metaphor?

Hawken: Earth is so big, we don't even understand our own cities. It leads to ways of thinking where [we don't consider where] our trash and sewage go. The spaceship is an imaginative exercise, where you imagine that a group of you is going on a spaceship for 10, 50, 100 years and you ask yourselves what is allowed on board and what is not. There's no spatial limit — it's more about the system, its inputs and outputs. It's just to bring it down to a scale where people can understand what happens on Earth without being a scientist.

—Michael Mann: Yes, we can still stop the worst effects of climate change. Here's why.

Q: The central message in "Carbon" is that we need to reconnect with the world around us to shape a better future than what we're currently headed for. One of your previous books is called "Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation" (Penguin, 2021) — and I was wondering what regeneration means to you. How do we end the climate crisis?

Hawken: Regeneration for me is pretty simple. It means that your life, your being, your presence here is about creating more life — not in the sense of making children, but in every sense of life. That means you start thinking about consumption, about what to buy and what you take, and the implications of that.

The purpose of "Carbon" is to suggest there is this beautiful flow of wonder and majesty that is inseparable from us. The purpose is to ask: What if we truly believed that Earth is our home? And what if we acted that way? Because we don't.

South African officials say a member of a research team at an isolated Antarctica base has been put under psychological evaluation after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues

Fear at Isolated Antarctica Base as a Man Is Accused of Attacking a Colleague and Making Threats

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.

The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.

The email pleaded for help.

“His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the email said, according to The Sunday Times. “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.

South Africa's Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely “to mediate and restore relationships at the base.” They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.

“The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,” the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.

The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.

The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.

The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.

Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.

The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.

“It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said.

Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.

In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.

The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they'd experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.

Satellite images taken more than three decades apart show the disappearance of Iceland's Okjökull, the first glacier to be officially declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change.

Where is it? Ok volcano, Iceland [64.60038686, -20.87986624]

What's in the photos? A comparison of Okjökull, a glacier atop Ok volcano, before and after it was declared dead

Which satellites took the photos? Landsat 5 and Landsat 8

When were they taken? Sept. 14, 1986, and Aug. 1, 2019

Two satellite photos taken 33 years apart show the disappearance of a glacier in Iceland that was the first ice mass to be declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change.

Okjökull was a dome-shaped glacier situated around the summit crater on Ok (pronounced Auk), a 3,940-foot-tall (1,200 meters) shield volcano located 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Reykjavík. (The name Okjökull translates to "Ok glacier" in Icelandic.)

In 1901, Okjökull's ice covered an area of around 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), but when the first of the two satellite photos was taken in 1986, there was less than 1 square mile (2.6 square km) of ice left. By the time the second image was captured in 2019, the ice covered less than 0.4 square miles (1 square km), according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

The glacier was declared dead in 2014, when Icelandic glaciologists revealed that the ice had become so thin that it was no longer being slowly pulled down the mountain by gravity, meaning it had stopped moving for the first time in tens of thousands of years, according to a 2024 paper summarizing Okjökull's demise.

The glacier's death was showcased and explored in a 2018 short film titled "Not Ok," which was made by researchers from Rice University in Texas.

In August 2019, around 100 people, including researchers and politicians, attended a funeral for Okjökull near the summit of Ok, according to The Guardian. During this ceremony, a commemorative plaque, inscribed with a message titled "A letter to the future," was placed near the summit.

It reads as follows: "Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it."

The plaque also listed the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which was 415 parts per million at the time. As of March 2025, the concentration is over 428 ppm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

This list includes the Anderson Glacier in Washington state, which, in 2015, became the first U.S. glacier to be declared dead.

Because of inconsistent monitoring and debates about the true sizes of glaciers, it is unclear exactly how many glaciers have been lost due to climate change, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. However, some researchers estimate that up to 10,000 glaciers of various sizes may have already been lost to climate change, The Washington Post reported in 2024.

A novel genetic model suggests that the ancestors of modern humans came from two distinct populations that split and reconnected during our evolutionary history.

The ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago, a new genetic model suggests. The unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function.

"The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined," study co-author Aylwyn Scally, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement.

In a study published Tuesday (March 18) in the journal Nature Genetics, researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called "cobraa," that has allowed them to trace the evolution of modern humans (Homo sapiens).

By applying their new method to modern human DNA data published in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project, the researchers discovered that there were two main ancestral groups that split around 1.5 million years ago, which they called Population A and Population B.

Just after that split, Population A experienced a bottleneck when the population plummeted and likely lost a significant amount of genetic diversity. But Population A grew over time, and Neanderthals and Denisovans branched off from it.

Then, around 300,000 years ago, Population A mixed with Population B, the researchers found. Their genetic analysis suggests that 80% of the genome of all present-day humans comes from Population A, while 20% of our genome comes from Population B.

Some of the genes from Population B, "particularly those related to brain function and neural processing, may have played a crucial role in human evolution," study co-author Trevor Cousins, a postgraduate student in genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. In general, the genetic material from Population B reduced the ability of individuals to have children, Cousins told Live Science in an email, but "the genome is a complicated place, and regions outside of genes can still do important things."

The new model suggests that, around 300,000 years ago, Population A, which eventually gave rise to humans, had "deep structure," Cousins said, meaning it was formed from "two or more genetically distinct populations that mixed with each other."

Who those populations were, however, is not clear. In the study, the researchers noted that "various Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis populations that are potential candidates for lineages A and B existed both in Africa and elsewhere in the relevant period."

But "the genetic model cannot indicate which fossils should be assigned to Population A or B," Cousins said. "We can only speculate."

Some experts use the term "ghost populations" to talk about groups that branched off and then reconnected later through interbreeding resulting in gene flow, John Hawks, a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email.

"What is interesting about this paper is that the pattern in the model is a deep African structure that is shared by everyone living today," Hawks said. "It is not 'ghost populations' contributing to one particular group, it is one big ghost that merged in with the African source population for all modern humans."

—1.5 million-year-old bone tools crafted by human ancestors in Tanzania are oldest of their kind

—Neanderthal 'population bottleneck' around 110,000 years ago may have contributed to their extinction

But one of the drawbacks to the new model, according to Hawks, is that it is based on the 1000 Genomes Project, which has a low representation of African populations. "So I see this as more a proof of principle than a real guide to what ancient humans were doing," Hawks said.

The origin of modern humans is a long-standing question in paleoanthropology, and improvements in DNA and genomic analysis in the past two decades have provided new insights and raised new questions.

"What's becoming clear is that the idea of species evolving in clean, distinct lineages is too simplistic," Cousins said in the statement. "Interbreeding and genetic exchange have likely played a major role in the emergence of new species repeatedly across the animal kingdom."

PLYMOUTH MEETING, PA [March 17, 2025] The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) is sharing a webinar today that answers critical patient questions about cancer clinical trials. The newly released, on-demand webinar is titled “Why Should I Consider a Clinical Trial?” It is available for free at NCCN.org/patientwebinars thanks to funding from the NCCN Foundation®, along with a handout summarizing the key information.

Cancer clinical trials play a critical role in advancing treatment and improving patient outcomes. However, confusion about their purpose, benefits, and accessibility keeps many people from enrolling. This free webinar features leading experts in oncology and patient advocacy, who break down the complex concepts, making them accessible to all.

“Every standard treatment we have today was found by the intellect of science and the courage of patients who participated in clinical trials,” said Ann Fish-Steagall, RN, BSN, SVP Patient Services and Health Care Delivery, LUNGevity, who was one of the presenters. “Clinical trials provide the medical community with important building blocks to further research and improve treatment options for all.”

“Clinical trials are a cornerstone of cancer research, but many patients are unsure how to approach them,” said Patrick Delaney, Executive Director, NCCN Foundation. “Our goal with this webinar is to empower individuals with knowledge, address misconceptions, and make the whole process feel less daunting.”

“Diversity in clinical trial participation is essential to ensuring that new treatments work for everyone, regardless of their background,” Delaney continued. “This session emphasizes the importance of inclusive participation and explores how to make that easier across every demographic.”

The webinar addressed key questions:

Tiffany Colvin, CCRP Sr. Director Clinical Trial Operations, Fred Hutch Cancer Center— another presenter—emphasized the dedication of the people involved in running a clinical trial, spanning various areas of healthcare: “Without collaboration, we couldn't offer the latest and greatest treatment options. We hold ourselves accountable to transparency, quality, safety, and integrity in conducting these clinical trials. Trials offer patients early access to promising new therapies under strict supervision and comprehensive support from a dedicated research team."

The newly posted on-demand webinar occurred live on February 28. Support was provided by AstraZeneca; Daiichi Sankyo; Genentech, Inc; and GSK.

NCCN has long advocated for clinical trial participation through the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)—evidence-based, expert consensus-driven recommendations used to guide cancer care decisions around the world. On every guideline, the front cover includes the statement: “NCCN recognizes the importance of clinical trials and encourages participation when applicable and available. Trials should be designed to maximize inclusiveness and broad representative enrollment.”
