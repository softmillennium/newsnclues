                <p>When Chia is offered a book deal in the US, she thinks it’s for her “light, funny takes on travel”, but it turns out the publisher wants her to go to the Congo to write about violence against women.

Chia is a rich Nigerian immigrant, who freelances as a travel writer, and is interested in romance, restaurants, and “the comforting ordinariness” of people elsewhere. Devastated to be seen only through the lens of “struggle”, she tells her fiancé, Chuka, about the offer. “The problem is that many of these White people don’t think we also dream,” he replies.

In this moment, Chia feels seen by Chuka – she describes the “rapture of being known” – and used by the publisher, who does not care who she is.

Review: Dream Count – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (HarperCollins)

As is clear from the title, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s latest novel is about dreams and desires. At the same time, it’s about inhabiting a global world shaped by the dominance of a particularly American imaginary, which seeks to determine who dreams, and about what, and whose inner being can possibly be known.

This is Adichie’s first full-length novel since the much loved and acclaimed Americanah (2013). Before Americanah, her Nigeria-Biafra war epic Half of a Yellow Sun (2006) won the Orange Prize for women’s fiction. She has since written feminist manifestos, essays, short stories and a children’s book.

She has two wildly influential TED talks: We should all be feminists (which featured in Beyoncé’s 2013 Flawless track); and The danger of a single story, used in classrooms around the world, including mine, for an accessible look at how power shapes storytelling

Dream Count is told through the eyes of four women, in interconnected but discrete parts. It moves between Nigeria, Guinea, America (and elsewhere), shifting perspective and place to reveal moralities that “circle and thin and change with circumstance”.

Along with the romantic Chiamaka (or Chia), who is the most “American”, there’s Chia’s cousin, the fearless Omelogor, (who quits banking to move to the US to do a masters degree in porn as an “educational tool”), her old friend Zikora, a corporate lawyer, pragmatic and traditional, and Kadiatou, the only working class and non-Nigerian voice. Kadiatou came to America from Guinea on an asylum claim, works as Chia’s housekeeper, and wants a good life for her daughter.

The novel begins and ends in Covid times, but feels like a sweeping saga, since the characters look back and reckon with what ifs. Adichie explains, in an author’s note, the book is really “about losing my mother”, and we get an unflinching look at loss and love and joy.

For many of the women, the reminiscing is about past loves, men who got away; for Kadiatou, there’s deeper loss. Ever the expert storyteller, Adichie works with gaps, re-evaluation, and a building sense of forewarning: Kadiatou thinks “she should have known something was wrong”.

Wanting without pretence

Dream Count is first and foremost about women looking for romantic love. And it by no means treats this pursuit as superficial (as pursuits deemed “feminine” frequently are). Instead, romantic love is understood to be fundamental to life, meaning, status, relationships with family and friends.

Adichie astutely and poetically renders the difficult gender dynamics that can sometimes define heterosexual relationships and desires, especially in a world where post-feminist expectations about gender equality and individual agency create disconnects between what women feel, tell themselves, and tell others. Such as:

Don’t be needy.

For a while, Chia dates a stereotypically reasonable and casual man, with an intellectual take on emotion. Darnell, an African American academic, finds Chia’s neediness “boring” and squashes her pleasures. “Whenever I laid intimacies before him,” Chia explains, “he responded in detached tones, or with a breezy mockery that stung”. Chia softens the worst parts about him to her friends, and to herself, only saying in hindsight: “Do we need another name” – not love – “for this state of queasy dysphoria?”

Don’t desire marriage.

Where Chia wants “incandescent love”, Zikora wants stability and children, and is happy to admit that “her truest longing, for marriage, depended on someone else”. Still, Zikora gets a hard time for being insufficiently happy on her own.

Do get married though. Or at least have children!

Child-free in her forties, full of self-love (where self means African and community love too), and developing intimacy with a woman, Omelogor is suspected of pretence. A call from a nosy aunt comes with unsolicited information on adoption centres and cutting advice: “Don’t pretend that you like the life you’re living”.

The novel maps out the cultural norms and social structures that inform individual possibilities and desires, and the pressure to deny they are there. At the same time, it shows the impact of too much pretending. It is heartbreaking, for example, when Zikora sees beneath her mother’s cold exterior and learns what she lived with in return for respect.

While Dream Count sometimes goes over well-trodden ground in its depiction of individual relationships and binary dynamics, it’s full of highlightable lines and funny quips, and the wider web of voices keeps it fresh. As the narrative voice changes, and a friend/cousin/housekeeper becomes storyteller, the layers seem to hold the answers to love and knowing.

More than a victim

When Chia is reflecting on her relationship with Darnell, the feisty Omelogor says: “You’re allowed to be victim and something else, not just victim.” Dream Count does not victim blame, but neither does it let its characters be seen through a homogenous and solely subordinated femininity.

Enter Kadiatou. Kadi’s character is inspired by Nafissatou Diallo, the Guinean immigrant working as a cleaner in a prestigious New York City hotel, who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the head of the International Monetary Fund, of sexually assaulting her in 2011. (A criminal case against Strauss-Kahn, who was indicted on charges including attempted rape and sexual abuse, was dropped in August 2011 when questions arose about Diallo’s credibility. Diallo also filed a civil case against him, reaching a confidential settlement.) Adichie wrote about the case later that same year, and the way Diallo was depicted in the press as a liar and prostitute.

Dream Count fictionalises the assault and aftermath. Kadi is similarly stereotyped in the media – there are “mournful articles listing the dreams” the accused will lose – but is a subject, with a full backstory, in Adichie’s novel.

In her author’s note, Adichie says she wanted to write a curious and human portrait not an ideological one, saying “ideology blocks different ways of seeing and art requires many eyes”. While Kadi seems almost too good, the perfect docile immigrant, we can forgive Adichie this, in what she describes as an effort to “‘write’ a wrong in the balance of stories”.

HarperCollins

Kadi’s interiority is also revealing. The odd one out in this quartet, her story offers a new layer through which Adichie lends her sharp observational eye to class.

Omelogor has created a “Robin Hood” account to illegally funnel money into grants for women’s small businesses; when she asks Kadi what her dream is, wanting to help, Kadiatou thinks “this question the kind of thing only idle people could conceive”. She has dreams, but securing her apartment, a job, her daughter’s education, even a warm shower, come first.

Similarly, when Kadiatou is in the news, she feels alone and misunderstood. She doesn’t see why Chia and Zikora are complaining about her being called a “maid”. The elites bicker over representation; people like Kadi want their circumstances to change.

Art and curiosity

Goodreads

Dream Count tackles some of the same themes as Americanah – including “mutual misunderstanding between African immigrants and Black Americans” – but comes at a different time. In the intervening years, Adichie has been involved in highly publicised disagreements, especially over trans identities, and has been outspoken about the dangers of cancel culture.

In Dream Count, the characters are sick of – and hurt by – people describing things as “problematic” and policing language and feeling. The satisfyingly rendered Darnell is the biggest culprit: his talk leads to no action to shift hierarchies, but plenty of action that’s unpleasant.

He agrees, for example, to go on a holiday paid for by Chia, but sulks the whole time, and icily ignores the driver who, in his view, is unnecessarily chauffeuring them around. “It was problematic,” Chia says, ventriloquising him, “to like luxurious trips and now the least he could do was not enjoy it.”

Adichie said in a recent interview that she was interested in “intra-black dialogues and differences”. Dream Count takes pleasure in showing the blind spots of established “diversity” talk, and centres (a word Omelogor hates!) relationships between Africans.

The fallout of its critique of US liberal arts discourse, though, is that any African American characters are largely caricatures of a particular way of thinking: Darnell is a bad seed and others are “heedlessly drunk on certainties” in the background.

“Slimy slippery words”, like Darnell’s, are depicted here in stark opposition to a Nigerian approach, which says it like it is. The main characters throw around a lot of stereotypes, which are often very funny. Sometimes, the book deftly adds nuance through multiple perspectives, or offers real illumination when confronting honesty’s challenges. “His honesty moved me and his honesty disgusted me,” Chia muses, when a boyfriend hints at his ex’s racism.

Other times, stereotypes go unchallenged, and we don’t quite get the “many eyes” that Adichie is aiming for. When Omelogor says, for example, that arrogance in women “is subversive, but in men it is always reactionary”, the book demonstrates an element of the “female complaint”; heterosexual relationships are doomed, but there is comfort in falling back on established roles and terms. Within the confines of Adichie’s novel, even Chuka, who looks to be the perfect antidote to Darnell, cannot give Chia her “incandescent love”.

Dream Count is another bold and honest endeavour from Adichie to cut through hackneyed schema to really see people. It’s a wonderful read, in large part for its warmth. The book made me cry, laugh, think and feel shamefully seen for my own “politically correct” blunders, frustrated at times – yet still heart warmed.

Where misery is described in its pages as “small and slow-dripping”, Dream Count is big, and filled mostly with a deep curiosity about other ordinary people.</p></b>

                <p>Filmed in a one-take style, Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham’s new crime drama Adolescence is being hailed by critics as a technical masterpiece.

Out now on Netflix, the four-part series follows the fallout surrounding 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) after he is arrested and later charged for the murder of his classmate, Katie. Co-creator Stephen Graham stars as Jamie’s father, Eddie.

Adolescence draws inspiration from the United Kingdom’s knife crime epidemic, the rise of incel culture and the brutality of online bullying. These malignant forces combine to create every parent’s worst nightmare.

However, unlike true crime, where there is often a resolution, there is no escape from the horror.

The show’s continuous filming style offers no reprieve, and the story itself provides no easy outs – refusing to provide a simple explanation for why an intelligent boy from an “ordinary” loving family would borrow a knife from a friend and, on a casual Sunday evening, stab another child to death.

While Jamie’s motives remain murky, the show makes one thing clear: today’s teens inhabit an online world that adults, however well-intentioned, are incapable of understanding if they do not listen.

Anxieties distorted by algorithms

At the centre of the show’s broken heart is a devastating truth: the most dangerous place in the world for a teenager is alone in their bedroom.

Trapped in the dark mirror of social media, Jamie – like a growing number of teenage boys – turns to the digital “manosphere” and the grim logic of online misogynists.

He subscribes to the “red pills” of incel culture, so-called truth groups and the 80/20 rule (the theory that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men, and that women only seek out men who are physically and socially desirable).

While Jamie is, for the most part, an outwardly “normal” and well-adjusted teen, his explosive rage and aggrieved entitlement is revealed in a climatic scene in episode three, when he intimidates and shouts down a female psychologist (Erin Doherty).

“You do not control what I do!” he yells. “Get that in that fucking little head of yours!”

Jamie is quick to apologise when a guard intervenes. “I shouted,” he says. “I’m sorry. Can I have another hot chocolate, please?”

In one particularly unnerving moment, Jamie recalls his decision to ask Katie out after receiving a topless photo of her on Snapchat.

“I thought she might be weak cause everyone was calling her a slag,” he says. “I just thought that when she was that weak, she might like me. It’s clever, don’t you think?”

While the sinister child-teen killer trope has been a mainstay of horror, from Child’s Play (1988) to The Exorcist (1973), Adolescence out-scares its predecessors in its unflinching portrayal of a radicalised misogynist-turned murderer.

A nightmare with no end

The show’s most stunning achievement is without a doubt its one-take style. Each hour-long episode is filmed in a single take which, as director Philip Barantini explains, “basically means that we press record on the camera, and we don’t stop until the very end of the hour”.

Tapping into today’s true crime zeitgeist, the series renders Jamie’s story more real than it actually is by imitating the cinéma vérité style of documentary filmmaking.

Each episode creates an immersive fly-on-the wall experience that is deeply compelling and uncomfortable. The lack of breaks forces viewers to feel as trapped as the characters, in an unfathomable spiral through confusion, guilt and shame.

This unease is heightened when the action is shot in claustrophobic spaces, such as inside the family van or a police interrogation room.

Netflix

The soundtrack adds another layer of gritty true crime trauma, with random sirens, slamming doors and thumping discordant notes designed to mirror the inner turmoil of the characters.

As the story unfolds, it charts the devastating impact of Jamie’s crime on those around him. While Katie’s school friends struggle to process their unfathomable grief, Jamie’s parents must also confront their son’s capacity for cruelty.

“We made him,” despairs Jamie’s mother (Manda Miller).

The unbroken style, in this regard, is important for understanding how broken this family is. Because there are no cuts, there is no escape from the nightmare.

Indeed, Jamie seems to have fallen through the cracks of the social institutions we relied on in the pre-internet age: the schooling system, the judiciary and the family itself.

Netflix

The generational chasm

The show’s true sympathy lies not with its cast of troubled teens but with the baffled adults around them. Like Jamie’s parents, viewers must surrender to the sorrow and disbelief of never truly understanding what went wrong.

Adolescence is a convincing portrayal of the widening chasm between parents and their teenage children in a savage, unregulated digital age.

It is also a social commentary on how little we know about how to communicate with teens effectively.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>In the first few months of 2025, there’s been a flurry of private venture space missions. Some have been successful, such as American company Firefly Aerospace landing its spacecraft Blue Ghost Mission 1 on the Moon. This was the first successful lunar landing of a privately owned spacecraft.

But there have also been several recent failures. None have been more spectacular than the repeated explosions of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starship rockets in January and March.

In theory, there are a range of international laws governing these activities. However, most were established roughly half a century ago, before space was within reach of private companies eager to explore it and exploit its untapped resources.

With this development, there is an urgent need to update laws governing what happens in space, in order to prevent it becoming a kind of “wild west” where tech billionaires and the companies they own can do as they please with little to no accountability, consequence or regard for the public good.

Laws as old as the Cold War

Space activities are mainly governed by United Nations treaties. These include the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, the 1972 Liability Convention, and the 1979 Moon Agreement.

But these agreements were created during the Cold War, when space exploration was shaped by military sensitivities and mainly conducted by nation states.

Yet private companies are now major players in space. They can bring the allure of space to the masses, for a pretty penny. For example, most of the roughly 11,000 active satellites orbiting Earth are privately owned.

NASA now relies on partnerships with companies to combine expertise and save costs. The European Space Agency does the same, as do many of the 77 countries with space programs

Elon Musk has expertly tapped into this trend, securing US$22.6 billion in United States government funding for SpaceX.

Private spacecraft journeys may combine commercial and national goals. For example, the Blue Ghost Mission 1 was contracted by NASA through its Commercial Lunar Payloads initiative. It carried a suite of NASA science and technology instruments.

Just days later, another company put a spacecraft on the Moon. Yet the Intuitive Machines Athena spacecraft landed awkwardly. It toppled over and was soon declared dead. It too was carrying expensive NASA cargo.

National space agencies will continue to rely on company partners in more ambitious ventures. But what happens when things go wrong? How can private companies be held accountable if they damage the property of others, or cause environmental harm on celestial bodies?

Space traffic

There is an increasing risk of collisions among satellites, spacecrafts and space debris. And while there are some mechanisms for collision warnings, there is no global approach to assess the risk of collisions.

The 1972 Liability Convention provides guidance about addressing liability after satellite collisions. However, it only directly applies to states, not private companies.

If a private company’s spacecraft causes damage, the affected party can only initiate a claim via diplomatic channels against the launching state, not the company itself. The claims pathway can be complex, slow and subject to diplomatic negotiations.

Also, some satellite operators purchase insurance to cover damage from collisions, wisely bypassing the convention. Insurance creates an efficient private mechanism to address damages, avoiding the need to involve states or navigate the diplomatic processes required under the Convention.

But space insurance is incredibly expensive, so most satellites are not insured.

The Outer Space Treaty says countries must avoid contamination of space. But it does not specifically address the problem of accumulated space debris.

The long-term sustainablity of space activities, including the build up of debris, was not the pressing issue for the treaty’s drafters. Moreover, the treaty’s language is vague, requiring states to act with “due regard” for others’ interests and conduct “appropriate” consultation before undertaking potentially harmful activities. However, it does not define what these terms mean.

Who owns the resources in space?

The prospect that humans will be able to collect and sell mineral resources from astronomical objects is edging closer to reality. Initial focus is on the Moon. But who owns the resources on the Moon?

There is no internationally agreed-upon property rights regime beyond Earth. The US is trying to achieve private ownership of space resources through its 2020 “Artemis Accords”.

This effort is a big boost to the privatisation of space. But it contrasts with the “common heritage of mankind” concept – the cornerstone of the 1979 Moon Agreement.

So far 53 countries have signed the Artemis Accords. But only 17 countries are parties to the Moon Agreement. Without clear rules applicable to all space players, lunar exploration and mining by private entities may run into trouble.

There are many worrying scenarios. A private spacecraft might crash into a country’s lunar accommodation facility due to a lack of “rules of the road” on the Moon. Lunar traffic and mining might cause damage to the Moon’s surface.

Can private entities be held accountable for this damage? The current space law regime does not address such hypothetical problems that may become real in coming years.

Safe and sustainable space exploration

Space law must evolve to ensure safe and sustainable commercial space travel and lunar exploration. This can only be achieved by building international consensus on new rules for space missions.

This requires many challenging discussions.

What types of damage to the Moon should be remediated, and by who? What is the most suitable avenue for affected entities to apply for compensation? What rules should be in place to manage the increased traffic volume in outer space? How can countries be incentivised to strengthen their oversight of their private entity partners in joint missions?

Perhaps the easiest issue to solve is which side of future lunar highways to drive on. With the US and China leading the way at the moment, it would be on the right side.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Australia is often called the allergy capital of the world. Allergic diseases – such as allergic asthma, hay fever, eczema and food allergies – affect almost one in five people. And this figure is expected to rise in the years to come.

An allergy happens when the body’s immune system mistakenly reacts to certain foods or other substances as if they were dangerous.

But do allergies affect all Australians equally?

In a recent study, we looked at emergency department (ED) presentations related to asthma and other allergic diseases in central Queensland. The region has a population of 228,246 according to the most recent Census data, and 7.2% of residents identify as First Nations.

We found First Nations Australians were almost twice as likely to present to hospital with asthma or other allergy-related illnesses compared to other Australians.

What we did and found

We analysed 813,112 ED presentations from 12 public hospitals in central Queensland from 2018 to 2023. The hospitals were spread across regional and remote areas.

Of the conditions we looked at, asthma was the most likely to bring patients to the ED. This was followed by unspecified allergies, atopic dermatitis (or eczema) and anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction). First Nations people were more likely than other Australians to present with each of these conditions.

Overall, we found First Nations people were almost twice as likely to visit an ED for asthma or allergic diseases compared to other Australians. It should be noted that asthma is not always caused by allergies, and in this study we looked at all presentations for asthma, regardless of the cause.

Our study also found ED visits for allergic diseases among First Nations people increased over time. They were around 1.5 times more common in 2023 compared to 2018.

Further, we found a notable peak in asthma-related visits to the ED among First Nations people in 2019. This increase may have been partly due to Australia’s Black Summer bushfires during 2019–20.

Other research has shown ED visits and hospitalisations for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased during the Black Summer bushfires. Exposure to bushfire smoke significantly increases the risk of breathing problems and other health issues.

The increase in asthma-related ED visits could also be linked to the severe flu season in 2019, as flu is known to trigger asthma attacks.

Are these findings surprising?

National data shows asthma is one of the most commonly reported chronic illnesses for First Nations Australians. More than 16% of First Nations Australians reported they had asthma in 2022–23 compared to 10.8% of the general Australian population.

So it’s not entirely surprising that hospital presentations for asthma were higher among First Nations people.

However, we were surprised to find First Nations people visited the ED more often for other allergic diseases. Allergies have not necessarily been recognised as an important concern among First Nations people, particularly in remote areas.

That said, international studies have reported a higher burden of allergic and atopic diseases (eczema, hay fever and asthma) among the Indigenous peoples of Canada.

How about food allergies?

Interestingly, we didn’t find any food allergy cases in our data. But some of the “unspecified” allergies could be linked to food allergies, as could some of the cases of anaphylaxis.

Australian researchers have found differences in the prevalence of food allergies among different groups, but they lacked specific data on First Nations populations. We know little about how common food allergies are in First Nations Australians.

In a recent national survey, 12% of First Nations people self-reported an allergy to a food, drug, or other substance (compared to 14% in the overall population). But some cases might go unrecognised or unreported, and these data were not broken down into different types of allergies.

Some limitations

This is the first comprehensive study, to our knowledge, that looks at asthma and allergic disease-related ED visits among both First Nations people and other Australians in an under-researched part of Australia.

However, we only looked at asthma and allergic diseases treated in the ED, which doesn’t encompass all cases. For example, some people might visit other health services such as GPs when they’re having a less severe allergic episode.

Ultimately, we need more research to better understand how common allergies and allergic diseases are among First Nations Australians.

Why do these gaps exist?

We don’t know exactly why there are disparities in ED presentations for allergic diseases between First Nations people and other Australians.

One possibility is that asthma and allergic diseases might be more severe in First Nations people, leading to more hospital visits, even if they’re not more common.

Another reason could be limited access to specialists, especially in rural and remote First Nations communities. Long wait lists to see allergy doctors and their limited availability in some areas could lead to delays in care and make it harder to get the right treatment. This can worsen asthma and allergic disease symptoms, causing patients to seek ED care instead.

We want to learn more about how allergies affect First Nations people, especially in regional and remote areas, and whether people have unmet needs. In initial conversations with First Nations Australians living with a food allergy, we’ve heard allergies might not be well understood in rural areas. This could be because they’re rare or because traditional lifestyles offer some protection.

We’re interested in finding out more, especially whether allergies are a concern for First Nations people, and, if so, how we can support communities to develop targeted and culturally respectful strategies to address them.</p></b>

                <p>We’re roughly half way through this parliamentary term, and it looks as though the 2026 election could deliver “Christopher vs Chris: the sequel”.

Neither leader is currently riding high, though. National’s Christopher Luxon and Labour’s Chris Hipkins are both scoring in the low 20s in the most recent preferred prime minister polls.

Most voters, it seems, are ambivalent or unimpressed with them. And Luxon has been the subject of media speculation about a possible leadership change.

But it pays to be cautious, especially this far from an election. Leadership is a complex mix of individual ability, career stage and political context.

We can think of political leaders having a “stock” of leadership “capital” that fluctuates over time. They build up credit or authority, but they have to spend it. Former supporters can become bored, disappointed or disillusioned.

Any assessment of a leader will involve some subjective judgements. But the Leadership Capital Index (LCI) was developed by three British and European political scientists as a framework for scoring leadership on a range of sliding measures.

As this example using former British prime minister Tony Blair shows, the LCI accounts for a leader’s skills, support and reputation based on their performance, polling and prospects over time.

I applied the LCI to Hipkins and Luxon. Ideally, this would be conducted by a panel, and more than once over a career. But readers are welcome to examine and comment below on my assessments – a virtual panel, if you like. You can see more detail about my reasoning here.

The LCI’s ten factors are a mixture of the objective and subjective, adding up to an overall ranking of a leader’s political capital on a five-point scale:

depleted – “lame duck”

low – “politically weakened”

medium – “muddling through”

high – “momentum”

exceptional – “political weather maker”.

Neither Luxon nor Hipkins performed very well: Luxon came out on the low-capital range looking “politically weakened”, while Hipkins was “muddling through” on medium capital.

Leadership capital changes over time, and the LCI takes account of that. This assessment relates to mid-March 2025.

The Leadership Capital Index

1. Political/policy vision: (1. Completely absent. 2. Unclear/inconsistent. 3. Moderately clear/consistent. 4. Clear/consistent. 5. Very clear/consistent.)

I’ve given both leaders 4 out of 5 here. Both have presented clear and consistent political and policy visions. Readers who disagree will see I take some relevant issues into account in the items below.

2. Communication performance: (1. Very poor. 2. Poor. 3. Average. 4. Good. 5. Very good.)

Luxon has been struggling here. His failure to give broadcaster Mike Hosking a straight answer about a cabinet sacking didn’t help, and he has been criticised for his corporate speaking style. Hipkins has performed better as a communicator (regardless of your views on his values). I’ve given Luxon 2/5 and Hipkins 4/5.

3. Personal poll rating relative to the most recent election: (1. Very low (–15% or less), 2. Low (–5 to –15%), 3. Moderate (–5% to 5%), 4. High (5-15%), 5. Very High (15% or more).)

This is an objective numerical measure based on preferred prime minister polls just before the 2023 election compared with the most recent ones. Both Luxon and Hipkins score 3/5.

4. Longevity (time in office as prime minister): (1. less than 1 year. 2. 1-2 years. 3. 2-3 years. 4. 3-4 years. 5. More than 4.)

At March 2025, Luxon gets 2/5 and Hipkins gets 1/5. If we included time in office as party leaders, the numbers would be higher.

5. Selection margin for party leadership: (1. Very small (less than 1%). 2. Small (1-5%). 3. Moderate (5-10%). 4. Large (10-15%). 5. Very large (more than 15%).)

Both leaders were elected as party leader by their respective caucuses. These votes are private, but it’s known Hipkins’ selection was unanimous. I believe Luxon also won by a large margin (greater than 15%). So they both get 5/5.

6. Party polling relative to most recent election result: (1. –10% or lower. 2. –10% to –2.5%. 3. –2.5% to +2.5%. 4. +2.5% to 10%. 5. More than 10%.)

In early March, Labour was polling in the low 30s, up from an election result of 26.9%. So Hipkins gets 4/5. National was also polling in the low 30s, down from 38.1%. So Luxon gets 2/5.

7. Levels of public trust: (1. 0-20%. 2. 20-40%. 3. 40-60%. 4. 60-80%. 5. 80-100%.)

Going back to a “trust” poll in early 2023 and a similar one in May that year, Luxon scored a lower trust level (37%) than Hipkins (53%). So Luxon gets 2/5 and Hipkins gets 3/5.

8. Likelihood of credible leadership challenge within next 6 months: (1. Very high. 2. High. 3. Moderate. 4. Low. 5. Very low.)

This relies on predictions, but Luxon is in greater danger than Hipkins. National’s polling is down, with some predicting a leadership change (although others acknowledge this could carry more costs than benefits). Hipkins lost the 2023 election but seems secure as Labour leader. Luxon gets 3/5 (moderate risk) and Hipkins gets 4/5 (low risk).

9. Perceived ability to shape party’s policy platform: (1. Very low. 2. Low. 3. Moderate. 4. High. 5. Very high.)

This is subjective but not about liking or disliking the policies. Both leaders perform moderately well here on 3/5. Luxon has put his own managerial style on policymaking, notably with quarterly targets. When Jacinda Ardern resigned as prime minister, Hipkins lit a “policy bonfire” to begin afresh. But he is taking time to announce new ones. We’d expect to see improvements for both leaders closer to the election.

10. Perceived parliamentary effectiveness: (1. Very low. 2. Low. 3. Moderate. 4. High. 5. Very high.)

Hipkins has an advantage, given his greater parliamentary experience. Luxon hasn’t dealt decisively with two attention-grabbing coalition partners, especially over ACT’s Treaty Principles Bill. Hipkins gets 4/5, Luxon 2/5.

Final scores – now have your say

The results add up to a ranking on the leadership capital index. Out of a possible 50, Luxon scores 28 and Hipkins 35. Neither is a great score; both careers look stalled.

On the index, this defines Luxon as “politically weakened”. This could improve through better communication, sounder leadership of an ambitious team, and greater control over coalition dynamics.

But Luxon’s leadership capital has never been particularly high. He didn’t enjoy a post-election “honeymoon” and may have peaked early – and low. More low polls may see National remove him, but there is also still time for his policies to pay off.

The index has Hipkins “muddling through”. He needs to connect with voters, boost his reputation as a future leader (rather than election loser) and sharpen Labour’s policy platform.

Hipkins’ leadership capital might have peaked in early 2023 when he became prime minister. Labour party polls are up a bit since the election, but his own preferred prime minister polling has stayed relatively low.

Finally, neither leader has performed well compared with their predecessors John Key and Jacinda Ardern at their heights. But political fortunes can be unpredictable, and crises can even boost them, so the future remains unwritten.

Is this assessment fair or unfair? Readers are welcome to critique my analysis and offer alternative ratings in the (moderated) comments section below.</p></b>

                <p>View of Mount Spurr on March 11 during an AVO overflight. The summit crater is present in the lower center, Crater Peak is in the center left.

A huge volcano in Alaska appears to be "moving closer to an eruption," scientists monitoring it have said.

Mount Spurr, which sits 81 miles (130 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is now releasing unusual levels of volcanic gases near its summit and from a flank vent that last erupted in 1992.

The 11,000-foot (3,370-meter) volcano has been undergoing an uptick in earthquakes and snow and ice melt on its slopes in the past year, indicating magma movement under the surface. Now, according to scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), it's most likely that this unrest will end in an eruption.

That's an increase in risk from the observatory's last assessment in February, which gauged that Mount Spurr was equally likely to simmer down as it was to erupt. Now, observations of increased carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from the volcano have tipped the balance toward an eruption, said Matt Haney , the scientist-in-charge of the AVO at the U.S. Geological Survey.

"This time period of unrest will eventually most likely end in an explosive eruption like the ones that happened in 1953 and 1992," Haney told Live Science.

Those eruptions both took place at Crater Peak, a flank vent about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the stratovolcano's summit. The last time the mountain's peak erupted was likely more than 5,000 years ago, Haney said, so scientists don't expect an eruption there — most likely, the rock between the eruptible magma and the summit crater is well-solidified and would be hard for any magma to burst through.

Any eruption will probably occur at Crater Peak, which has been more recently active and which probably has easier pathways to the surface for magma to move.

Crater Peak exploded three times over several months in 1992 and once in 1953. In both cases, ash erupted at least 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) in the atmosphere, Haney said. One of the explosions in 1992 sent the cloud drifting over Anchorage, blanketing the city in an eighth an inch (3.1 millimeters) of dust. In 1953, Anchorage experienced a quarter-inch (6.4 mm) ashfall.

If the magma movement beneath the volcano doesn't settle down, the next sign of an eruption will likely be volcanic tremor, Haney said.

Unlike the brief, small earthquakes that have been shuddering the volcano over the last year, volcanic tremor is a long, ongoing shaking that can last for minutes, hours, or days. It indicates that magma is rising and that an eruption is likely imminent.

In 1992, volcanic tremor started about three weeks before Mount Spurr erupted. Another nearby volcano that erupted in 2009, Mount Readout, showed volcanic tremor for two months before it blew its top.

"If we see [tremor]," Haney said, "that will be the next sign that Spurr is further progressing toward an eruption."

                <p>Some skiers experience lightheadedness and disorientation while skiing downhill. Common symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, and in more severe cases, vomiting. This little-known condition, known as ski sickness, is akin to motion sickness and seasickness. Here’s what we know.

At the start of this year’s ski season, the weather conditions were poor. It was a “white day”–thick fog blanketed the slopes, reducing visibility to just a few yards. The flat light and fog made it nearly impossible to distinguish shapes, apart from the occasional gate pole. The boundary between snow and sky had vanished, disrupting my spatial awareness and making it difficult to gauge my direction, speed, and angle to the ground.

As we continued our descent, my ski companions developed nausea, while I felt faint and repeatedly lost my balance. Even after leaving the slopes, my dizziness and fatigue persisted for several hours. We had all experienced ski sickness, a physiological reaction similar to motion sickness. Why do some skiers experience these symptoms?

Ski sickness: a form of motion sickness

It is important to distinguish ski sickness from acute mountain sickness, a condition caused by reduced oxygen availability at high elevation, regardless of weather conditions.

Ski sickness is a variant of kinetosis, the medical term for motion sickness and seasickness. Its symptoms include dizziness, drowsiness, and pallor (so-called “neurovegetative” symptoms), which can escalate to nausea and, in severe cases, vomiting.

Susceptibility to kinetosis–and by extension to ski sickness–varies greatly from person to person.

The causes of ski sickness

Two main theories help explain the phenomenon: sensory mismatch and postural instability.

The first theory suggests kinetosis results from a neural mismatch. The central nervous system continuously integrates and processes sensory information from the eyes, inner ear, and proprioceptive tissues (which help detect body position and movement). By processing this data and comparing it with past experiences, the brain estimates the body’s position, movement, and orientation in space.

However, when sensory information is limited or unusual, the brain’s internal estimate of movement may not align with the actual forces acting on the body. This sensory conflict causes the brain to struggle to interpret movement accurately. If the conflict persists, it can lead to symptoms of kinetosis.

Over time, as the brain adapts to the mismatch, motion sickness symptoms typically subside.

The second theory suggests that repeated postural instability triggers kinetosis. When balance is thrown off, the body makes rapid reflexive adjustments–such as extending a leg to prevent a fall–to regain stability. However, if balance is repeatedly lost, for example when skiing or sailing, the brain may perceive these strategies as ineffective, leading to motion sickness symptoms.

Although clinical research on ski sickness is limited, both theories offer valuable insights and both suggest that impaired motion perception is the root of the cause, making orientation and balance more difficult.

Distorted perceptual feedback while skiing causes a mismatch between expected and actual sensory inputs, increasing the risk of kinetosis and potential loss of balance.

Skiing on unpredictable terrain, such as moguls or uneven slopes, exacerbates the difficulties–especially in foggy conditions where poor visibility further distorts perception. Skiers with visual impairments (such as myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism) may be particularly susceptible to ski sickness.

Additionally, immobilizing the feet and ankles in ski boots reduces somatosensory awareness (the perception of body movements).

At the same time, repeated changes in atmospheric pressure from continuous ascents and descents can disrupt the inner ear’s perception of movement.

Aggravating ski sickness factors

However, not everyone experiences kinetosis equally. People prone to seasickness or carsickness are more likely to suffer from ski sickness, as are individuals with a history of migraines, vertigo or inner ear disorders.

External factors are also liable to worsen ski sickness symptoms. For instance, visibility conditions (terrain relief, slope steepness and obstacles) play a crucial role in helping skiers orient themselves in space and adjust their posture to maintain balance. Reduced oxygen levels at high altitudes may also impair sensory perception, resulting in reduced spatial awareness and difficulties adapting to visual cues.

Skiing technique too can contribute to motion sickness: gliding with minimal body movement may send mixed signals to the brain, and slaloming can make the symptoms even worse. When repeated turns (occurring every 0.5 to 5 seconds) fall within a certain frequency range (0.2 to 2 Hz), the brain struggles to differentiate between translational and rotational movement based on inner ear signals. In some cases, the brain misinterprets these movements as the Coriolis effect–the sensation of spinning uncontrollably. This phenomenon occurs when the head moves in one direction while the body turns in another–a common posture during ski turns–making it difficult for the brain to accurately interpret body rotation.

Psychological factors can also increase susceptibility to ski sickness. Skiers who feel uneasy, stressed, afraid of falling, or who suffer from a fear of heights, may be more prone to symptoms. In such cases, maintaining confidence and a positive mindset is crucial. Additionally, it is important to recognize that adverse weather conditions can contribute to the onset of symptoms.

There is some speculation that alcohol consumption and smoking may worsen ski sickness, as well, by dilating blood vessels, which can interfere with inner ear function.

Treatments for ski sickness

While many remedies for kinetosis are known to help, there is no universal solution. Each individual responds differently to treatments, and while most people gradually adapt over time, some may need to consider additional interventions to mitigate the effects.

Ski sickness can be alleviated through improved proprioception, also known as “sensory cueing”. Vision correction, addressing myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism with prescription glasses or contact lenses can enhance depth perception, while specialized ski goggle lenses can improve terrain visibility in foggy conditions.

Somatosensory perception (awareness of body movements) can be improved with acupressure wristbands, similar to those used for other forms of kinetosis, which help enhance proprioception.

While few solutions exist for vestibular motion perception (inner ear balance), research suggests that bone-conductive vibration to the inner ear can slow the onset of other types of motion sickness.

Some people may turn to medication for symptom management. Vestibular suppressants, such as scopolamine, can help reduce inner ear dizziness and migraines. Additionally, antihistamines like dimenhydrinate and cinnarizine may alleviate nausea but can cause side effects such as drowsiness or blurred vision.</p></b>

                <p>Current discussions of climate change often vilify carbon, but the element is the very basis of life on Earth, says Paul Hawken.

The element carbon, in its oxidized form, is at the center of discussions about climate change . Carbon is often vilified and cast as the culprit for global warming, destruction and loss.

But what we tend to forget is that carbon is the main ingredient for life. And we are the only species on Earth that disrupts the natural flow of carbon, says environmentalist and author Paul Hawken .

Hawken's new book, "Carbon: The Book of Life" (Viking, 2025), shines a spotlight on the countless flows of carbon that power life, from individual cells to vast underground fungal networks and entire human societies. Through the lens of carbon, the author takes the reader on a journey through corporate retreats, the pharmaceutical sector, the food industry and the realms of plants, insects and fungi.

Live Science sat down with Hawken before the book's publication on March 18 to discuss the language we use to talk about the climate and the paradigm shift needed to start valuing, restoring and protecting the natural flow of carbon on Earth.

Q: "Carbon" is about showing that carbon is not just a problem we need to neutralize, but also a vital force that flows through every living being and Earth system. How does this encourage us to think differently about climate change?

Hawken: The narrative [around global warming] is really screwed up, frankly, because it has objectified carbon, the atmosphere, climate change, etcetera. It's the same mindset that caused the problem: We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends.

When people say we're going to "fix" the climate, or "tackle" or "combat" climate change, to me it's just so emblematic of this profound disconnection between self and other. We don't have a climate crisis; the climate cannot have a crisis. We are the crisis. That's what I want to explore. [I want] to go to a place that's not just insular and about self, but actually [gives rise to] a sense of being in the world that can create a sensibility that forms community. Because all of life as we know it exists in a community.

Q: I found the book very uplifting and hopeful. How do you find the drive to write about the climate when everything we hear from scientists is so bleak?

Hawken: What I'm trying to do in my own life, certainly, but also in communication, is to create the context in which people can see the world. Because what you see and receive really determines your mindset, your consciousness, your awareness and your sense of stress, anxiety and equanimity in the face of events that are troubling. Rather than going to the trouble and staying with that, I'm looking for a conversation that makes sense. That's where change needs to happen.

We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends." Paul Hawken, environmentalist and author of "Carbon: The Book of Life" (Viking, 2025)

Q: Could you give an example of where the current conversation does not make sense to you?

Hawken: People talk about "net zero." I'm not a physicist, but I can tell you that "net zero" does not exist in terms of carbon. "Carbon neutrality" does not exist.

If you look at the proposals to really shift away from fossil fuels, what we're talking about is renewable energies to energize an economy that's skyrocketing in consumption, which is destruction. Renewable energy doesn't really take a step back to ask: "Energizing yes, but what?" And if we don't look at that, then we're just in a gerbil wheel. We may have the illusion that the faster we go, the faster we're getting somewhere, but actually we're not — it's almost the opposite.

Q: A few chapters of the book focus on health and the food industry. How do those topics relate to carbon and why was it important to include them?

Hawken: The book is about life and about carbon as an element. The flow of carbon is, in a sense, the flow of life. I began to look at the food system and what was being sold, what was being promoted. One thing led to another in terms of looking at health and self and food and agriculture as a system that is inseparable from the rest. That goes back to carbon, because if you look at a healthy agricultural system, it's full of carbon. That whole systemic understanding of food and health and farming and soil and agricultural practices and chemistry is also a way of looking at the other systems we have and that we take for granted.

Q: This leads nicely into the "spaceship Earth" you mention in the book. Spaceship Earth is a concept that encourages us to think of the planet as a closed system with limited resources. Humanity is the crew, and every passenger should work toward the greater good of this crew. Why do you like this metaphor?

Hawken: Earth is so big, we don't even understand our own cities. It leads to ways of thinking where [we don't consider where] our trash and sewage go. The spaceship is an imaginative exercise, where you imagine that a group of you is going on a spaceship for 10, 50, 100 years and you ask yourselves what is allowed on board and what is not. There's no spatial limit — it's more about the system, its inputs and outputs. It's just to bring it down to a scale where people can understand what happens on Earth without being a scientist.

Q: The central message in "Carbon" is that we need to reconnect with the world around us to shape a better future than what we're currently headed for. One of your previous books is called " Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation " (Penguin, 2021) — and I was wondering what regeneration means to you. How do we end the climate crisis?

Hawken: Regeneration for me is pretty simple. It means that your life, your being, your presence here is about creating more life — not in the sense of making children, but in every sense of life. That means you start thinking about consumption, about what to buy and what you take, and the implications of that.

The purpose of "Carbon" is to suggest there is this beautiful flow of wonder and majesty that is inseparable from us. The purpose is to ask: What if we truly believed that Earth is our home? And what if we acted that way? Because we don't.

                <p>Two sets of iron ankle shackles found at an archaeological site in Egypt are revealing the "significant human cost" of gold mining undertaken to fund Ptolemy I's military campaigns, according to new research.

"The shackles complement an ancient text that describes the living conditions of miners in Egypt and mentions the presence of prisoners of war and common criminals in the mines," study author Bérangère Redon , an archaeologist at the History and Sources of the Ancient Worlds ( HiSoMA ) Laboratory in France, told Live Science in an email.

After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, dozens of mines were opened under the Ptolemaic dynasty (305 to 30 B.C.). Many of these mines included housing for the workers, but the living accommodations tended to be highly controlled and guarded. Historical and archaeological information suggests that a range of people worked as miners, including both paid laborers and people who were enslaved.

In a study published March 13 in the journal Antiquity , Redon detailed the rare discovery of shackles at Ghozza, the northernmost Ptolemaic gold mine, which was in use from around 250 to 200 B.C. The shackles are among the oldest ever found in the Mediterranean region.

The Ghozza mine complex included a village with residential areas, streets and baths. Hundreds of ostraca — pottery fragments used as "scrap paper" — that were found at the site provided clues to the daily activities of the miners. Some received wages for their work, which involved processing natural ore with handheld grinding stones.

"We thought that the work of the miners must have included free people, as we found no guarded dormitories at Ghozza," Redon said. In contrast, dormitories at other ancient Egyptian mines "were guarded by a gatehouse near their narrow entrances," Redon wrote in a 2021 study .

But the discovery of two sets of shackles designed to restrict the movement of miners working on the surface revealed that there was at least some forced labor at Ghozza.

One set of shackles consisted of seven ankle rings and two links, and the other included four links and two ankle-ring fragments. Archaeologists discovered the shackles, along with a large amount of discarded slag and many iron objects, in an ancient storage building at Ghozza.

The Ghozza shackles closely resemble ones found in the silver mines of Laurion in Greece, Redon wrote in her study, suggesting the Greeks brought their technical knowledge of mine engineering to Egypt during the Ptolemaic period. The mined Egyptian gold would have helped fund Ptolemy I's military campaigns at the expense of the workers.

"These objects give us irrefutable proof of the miners' status, which we did not have until now," Redon said.

                <p>The clearest pictures yet of the newborn cosmos strengthen the prevailing model of the universe but deepen a mystery about its expansion rate.

Measurements of this rate, known as the Hubble constant, have produced conflicting results. Cosmologists hoped that new data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile, which examines the oldest light in the universe, would clear things up and possibly reveal physics that diverges from the standard model of cosmology. But those results, announced March 18 in a webinar, only affirmed that model.

“If you’d asked me to put a bet beforehand, I would have maybe put even money on seeing something new,” says cosmologist Colin Hill of Columbia University, a member of the telescope team. “But the standard model appears to reign supreme.”

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope, or ACT, measured properties of the Big Bang’s thermal afterglow, known as the cosmic microwave background, with unprecedented sensitivity — particularly in the orientation of that light’s electromagnetic waves, or its polarization.

While previous telescopes mapped temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, indicating where matter was starting to clump together and foreshadowing the universe’s present-day structure, polarization maps put those clumps in motion.

“The polarization tells you how the gas and other matter that’s present in the early universe is actually moving around,” Hill says. That information allows cosmologists to project forward and see if it matches the current distribution of matter in the universe. “It gives us a much firmer prediction for what should happen in the next 13 billion years afterwards.”

The European Space Agency’s Planck satellite also measured polarization, but the larger ACT has five times the resolution, Hill says.

This tiny portion of the cosmic microwave background, created by combining new data from ACT and previous data from the Planck satellite, shows minuscule temperature variations in the very early universe (blue is cooler, red is warmer). The black lines are used to work out how much of two types of polarization there is at any spot in the sky. ACT Collaboration

The newborn universe aligns with the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter model, a relatively simple picture of the universe, the ACT team reports in three papers to appear on arXiv.org and a March 19 talk at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, Calif.

Combined with previous results, the new ACT measurements, gathered from 2017 to 2022, confirm and refine many of the universe’s vital stats. It’s 13.77 billion years old and comprises 5 percent ordinary matter, 25 percent dark matter — which exerts gravitational attraction but otherwise doesn’t interact with regular matter — and 70 percent dark energy, a mysterious force pushing the universe to expand at an ever-accelerating rate.

The current expansion rate is 68.22 kilometers per second for each megaparsec (about 3 million light-years) of space, the team reports. That number agrees with previous measurements of the cosmic microwave background, such as those from the Planck satellite. But it disagrees with estimates based on closer objects, such as supernovas and the bright hearts of galaxies known as quasars, which have suggested a rate around 73 km/s/Mpc.

The discrepancy between the two types of measurements has been tightening for over five years. The ACT measurement turns the screws tighter.

Looking for a solution, the researchers examined several possible deviations from the standard model such as new particles, new interactions between dark matter and regular matter or itself, variations in fundamental constants or extra dark energy in the early universe. Nothing turned up.

“It just blew me away that we didn’t see even, like, a hint of one of these new physics extensions,” Hill says. “It indicates that we might need to go back really to some of the foundational assumptions of our understanding of cosmology.”

Other cosmologists may not have had such optimism about finding new physics, says physicist Daniel Scolnic of Duke University, who was not involved in the new work. “I think people expected that ACT wouldn’t see anything. But I did have a hope, so I was pretty disappointed,” he says. “But it’s okay. Nature will tell us the story.”

There’s still room for hope. The Simons Observatory, an even more sensitive telescope in Chile, started taking data in late February, which might find hidden deviations from the standard model.

“It could be the case that in a few years we will get some detection of new physics,” Hill says. “If we don’t keep looking, we won’t give ourselves a chance.”

Progress could also come from relaxing some of the standard model’s assumptions. Scientists have assumed, for example, that dark energy’s density has remained constant. But a recent survey using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument suggested that dark energy changes over time.

“If they confirm that at high significance, then we would really need to revisit a lot of our investigations,” Hill says. “It could open up avenues in the early universe that previously the data would not have allowed.”

                <p>A specialized photograph known as a Schlieren image produced during a test flight of Boom Supersonic XB-1 jet on Feb. 10, 2025.

NASA and Boom Supersonic just released an incredible photo capturing a shockwave emanating from the dark silhouette of the supersonic XB-1 aircraft while it traveled in front of the sun during a Feb. 10 test flight during which it broke the sound barrier three times.

"This image makes the invisible visible — the first American made civil supersonic jet breaking the sound barrier," Blake Scholl, Boom Supersonic founder and CEO, said in a statement .

The photo was no accident. It required ideal conditions and perfect timing. Chief test pilot Tristan "Geppetto" Brandenburg cut a path to a precise spot over the Mojave Desert while NASA snapped the shot.

"Thanks to Geppetto's exceptional flying and our partnership with NASA, we were able to capture this iconic image," Scholl continued.

The photo is a Schlieren image . Developed in 1864 by German physicist August Toepler to study supersonic motion, Schlieren photography is used in today's aeronautical engineering. The method can reveal how light bends around differences in air pressure during supersonic flight.

The XB-1 team made software using NASA data to guide the pilot on a path where the aircraft could eclipse the sun. When the XB-1 entered the right spot, NASA got the photograph using ground telescopes with special filters that detect air distortions. That's why the shockwaves around the aircraft are visible in the photograph.

NASA also gathered sound data from the test flight. Boom Supersonic analyzed the data and found that no audible sonic boom reached the ground. This is notable, because supersonic flights that make sonic booms over populated areas in the U.S. are prohibited.

Boom Supersonic plans to make a supersonic airplane with a sonic boom that won't disturb people on the ground. This airplane would reduce cross-country flight times. "We confirmed that XB-1 made no audible sonic boom," Scholl said in the same statement, "which paves the way for coast to coast flights up to 50% faster."

The Feb. 10 test flight was the final one for XB-1. Now Boom Supersonic will take what they learned from the tests and start building a supersonic airliner called Overture.

Last year, Boom Supersonic finished building its super factory in Greensboro, North Carolina which will eventually pump out 66 Overture aircraft per year, starting with half that initially. United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines already have orders and pre-orders in for the supersonic airliner.</p></b>

                <p>Satellite photos from 1986 and 2019 show how the "Ok glacier" almost completely disappeared from the summit of and Icelandic volcano.

QUICK FACTS Where is it? Ok volcano, Iceland [64.60038686, -20.87986624] What's in the photos? A comparison of Okjökull, a glacier atop Ok volcano, before and after it was declared dead Which satellites took the photos? Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 When were they taken? Sept. 14, 1986, and Aug. 1, 2019

Two satellite photos taken 33 years apart show the disappearance of a glacier in Iceland that was the first ice mass to be declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change .

Okjökull was a dome-shaped glacier situated around the summit crater on Ok (pronounced Auk), a 3,940-foot-tall (1,200 meters) shield volcano located 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Reykjavík. (The name Okjökull translates to "Ok glacier" in Icelandic.)

In 1901, Okjökull's ice covered an area of around 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), but when the first of the two satellite photos was taken in 1986, there was less than 1 square mile (2.6 square km) of ice left. By the time the second image was captured in 2019, the ice covered less than 0.4 square miles (1 square km), according to NASA's Earth Observatory .

The glacier was declared dead in 2014, when Icelandic glaciologists revealed that the ice had become so thin that it was no longer being slowly pulled down the mountain by gravity, meaning it had stopped moving for the first time in tens of thousands of years, according to a 2024 paper summarizing Okjökull's demise.

The glacier's death was showcased and explored in a 2018 short film titled " Not Ok ," which was made by researchers from Rice University in Texas.

In August 2019, around 100 people, including researchers and politicians, attended a funeral for Okjökull near the summit of Ok, according to The Guardian . During this ceremony, a commemorative plaque, inscribed with a message titled "A letter to the future," was placed near the summit.

It reads as follows: "Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it."

The plaque also listed the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which was 415 parts per million at the time. As of March 2025, the concentration is over 428 ppm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

In 2023, Iceland also created the world's first iceberg graveyard, where ice-like headstones were constructed for the 15 major glaciers listed on the Global Glacier Casualty List , all of which are either dead or critically endangered, according to the United Nations . This list includes the Anderson Glacier in Washington state, which, in 2015, became the first U.S. glacier to be declared dead.</p></b>

                <p>The constellation Leo contains one of the three stars of the Spring Triangle — an asterism that appears for several months beginning near the vernal equinox.

Spring is coming to the Northern Hemisphere, but how can you tell when it will start? No need to Google the vernal equinox ; to work out when the season officially begins, you only need to look at the stars.

The beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere is marked by the vernal equinox — the point when Earth's axis is side-on to the sun, spreading light and heat equally around the globe. This year it occurs on March 20.

This moment in Earth's annual journey around the sun marks the end of one season and the beginning of the next, and stargazers can spot the change because the springtime night sky, as seen from the Northern Hemisphere, is full of stars and constellations only ever seen at this time of the year.

The easiest way for stargazers to observe this seasonal transition on the equinox is to look southwest after sunset and bid farewell to the bright stars of winter. Find the three unmistakable stars in Orion's Belt — Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka — and begin to identify the bright stars around them.

Above the belt is Betelgeuse, one of the brightest stars in the night sky , which appears slightly reddish to the naked eye if you squint. Below the belt is Rigel, while to its left and slightly below is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Use these three stars to form an equilateral shape — the Winter Triangle.

For celestial confirmation of spring, gaze north, and you'll see the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper/Plough riding high in the sky — as in the memory aid, "spring up, fall down." As this asterism climbs higher in the sky, use its stars to find the Spring Triangle: an equilateral triangle made of the springtime stars Arcturus, Spica, and Denebola. All three stars are visible with the naked eye, but a good backyard telescope or pair of stargazing binoculars can enhance the view.

Trace the curve of the Big Dipper's handle to "arc to Arcturus," identifying a bright reddish star above due east. Now "spike to Spica," traveling a short distance to identify that bluish star rising in the east-southeast. Directly above it will be Denebola in Leo, a classic spring constellation. (Some skywatching guides may replace Denebola with Regulus, another star in Leo that appears slightly further east near the lion’s front paw; Regulus is a brighter star, but using it as a waymarker stretches out the Spring Triangle considerably).

The Spring Triangle will remain visible in the night sky until August, when summer begins shifting into fall.</p></b>

                <p>The ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago, a new genetic model suggests. The unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function.

"The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined," study co-author Aylwyn Scally , a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement .

In a study published Tuesday (March 18) in the journal Nature Genetics , researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called "cobraa," that has allowed them to trace the evolution of modern humans ( Homo sapiens ).

By applying their new method to modern human DNA data published in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project, the researchers discovered that there were two main ancestral groups that split around 1.5 million years ago, which they called Population A and Population B.

Just after that split, Population A experienced a bottleneck when the population plummeted and likely lost a significant amount of genetic diversity. But Population A grew over time, and Neanderthals and Denisovans branched off from it.

Then, around 300,000 years ago, Population A mixed with Population B, the researchers found. Their genetic analysis suggests that 80% of the genome of all present-day humans comes from Population A, while 20% of our genome comes from Population B.

Some of the genes from Population B, "particularly those related to brain function and neural processing, may have played a crucial role in human evolution," study co-author Trevor Cousins , a postgraduate student in genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. In general, the genetic material from Population B reduced the ability of individuals to have children, Cousins told Live Science in an email, but "the genome is a complicated place, and regions outside of genes can still do important things."

The new model suggests that, around 300,000 years ago, Population A, which eventually gave rise to humans, had "deep structure," Cousins said, meaning it was formed from "two or more genetically distinct populations that mixed with each other."

Who those populations were, however, is not clear. In the study, the researchers noted that "various Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis populations that are potential candidates for lineages A and B existed both in Africa and elsewhere in the relevant period."

But "the genetic model cannot indicate which fossils should be assigned to Population A or B," Cousins said. "We can only speculate."

Some experts use the term "ghost populations" to talk about groups that branched off and then reconnected later through interbreeding resulting in gene flow, John Hawks , a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email.

"What is interesting about this paper is that the pattern in the model is a deep African structure that is shared by everyone living today," Hawks said. "It is not 'ghost populations' contributing to one particular group, it is one big ghost that merged in with the African source population for all modern humans."

But one of the drawbacks to the new model, according to Hawks, is that it is based on the 1000 Genomes Project, which has a low representation of African populations. "So I see this as more a proof of principle than a real guide to what ancient humans were doing," Hawks said.

The origin of modern humans is a long-standing question in paleoanthropology, and improvements in DNA and genomic analysis in the past two decades have provided new insights and raised new questions.

"What's becoming clear is that the idea of species evolving in clean, distinct lineages is too simplistic," Cousins said in the statement. "Interbreeding and genetic exchange have likely played a major role in the emergence of new species repeatedly across the animal kingdom."

                <p>Peter Dutton, when he gets on his favoured ground of security, too often goes for the quick hit, and frequently over-reaches.

His suggestion of running a possible referendum to facilitate the removal of bad eggs who are dual citizens is a prime example.

Apart from the substance of the proposal, why would an aspiring prime minister be talking about a referendum after the experience of the Voice?

As Dutton knows very well – and to his advantage in that case – referendums don’t succeed without bipartisan support, and this one certainly wouldn’t get backing from a Labor opposition. They cost a fortune, and they distract prime ministers. Dutton would have enough to do in government without going down this side track to a predictable dead end.

Although this focus on booting people out of the country sounds Trumpian, it has long been a preoccupation of Dutton’s – something he pushed in the Coalition years.

The Coalition amended the Citizenship Act, enabling a minister to revoke the Australian citizenship of dual nationals (so depriving them of the protection from removal that citizenship affords).

But the High Court in 2022 struck this down, so a minister has to apply to a court in the course of a trial relating to a listed offence. The court makes the decision on citizenship as part of sentencing the person.

Fast forward to the present, and Dutton sees advantage in any issues that go to security, of individuals or the country. Hence his talk of attempted constitutional change if the objective can’t be achieved by legislation.

On morning TV on Tuesday he kept repeating that he wanted to keep people safe.

He told Seven, “I want to keep our country safe […] it’s the first responsibility of any prime minister, and at the moment we’ve got people in our country who hate our country, who want to cause terrorist attacks. My argument is that if you betray your allegiance to our country in that way, you should expect to lose your citizenship.”

“What we’re proposing here is a discussion about whether we’ve got adequate laws, whether the Constitution is restrictive, and ultimately, what I want to do is keep our country safe and keep communities safe. I think there are a lot of Australians at the moment who are worried about the rise of antisemitism and what we’ve seen in our country, and elsewhere, which just doesn’t reflect the values that we’ve fought for over many generations.”

Apart from the fact a referendum would fail, the proposal itself has no obvious benefit. It is out of proportion to the problem it is supposed to be addressing, would be unlikely to act as a deterrent, and would stir a divisive debate. On Tuesday Dutton’s senior colleagues Michaelia Cash, who is shadow attorney-general, and Angus Taylor sounded less then enthusiastic about the move.

For Dutton’s campaign, it carries a special danger. It gives the impression of a leader who comes up with extreme proposals. If he is suggesting this today, what will be think of tomorrow? More to the point, what might he suddenly propose when in government?

This close to an election, Dutton needs to give voters the feeling he is predictable, that they know him, not that he produces ideas out of left field (or right field, in this case).

Former Liberal attorney-general George Brandis, who was around for the earlier debate, summed up the situation succinctly, when he wrote in the Nine papers, “An unwanted referendum, without bipartisan support, to overturn the High Court? It is as mad an idea as I have heard in a long time.”</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Some of Sydney’s koalas are facing an uncompromising dilemma.

The koalas living in one corner of Australia’s largest city are perilously inbred, researchers report February 26 in Conservation Genetics. But the solution — interbreeding with neighboring koala populations — risks introducing the koalas to a deadly sexually transmitted disease.

In 2021 and 2022, University of Sydney conservation biologist Carolyn Hogg and her colleagues determined that koalas in the southwestern Sydney metro area had the lowest genetic diversity anywhere in the state of New South Wales. To investigate further, the researchers caught 111 wild koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) from seven sites across the forested region south of Sydney and collected ear tissue before releasing them.

DNA analysis revealed that some neighborhoods — including Campbelltown, Heathcote and Liverpool — had koala populations with high genetic similarity, on average resembling that of half-siblings. Other nearby populations showed interrelatedness akin to first cousins or first cousins once removed.

The heavy inbreeding may stem from the isolation of these koalas, Hogg says, as their forested habitat is bound by urban areas to the north, east and west.

That same isolation may be why these sites are also among the few neighborhoods in New South Wales without reported infections of the bacteria Chlamydia. The sexually transmitted pathogen has decimated koala populations across Australia, leading to infertility, blindness and death. In at least one Queensland population, chlamydia accounted for 18 percent of koala deaths between 2013 and 2017, and some populations have a chlamydia prevalence of around 100 percent.

Southwestern Sydney is one of the few chlamydia-free areas in New South Wales. But its isolation also makes its koalas evolutionarily vulnerable, with less variation in their genetic tool kit for adapting to new threats, including bacteria like chlamydia. And the marsupials’ resilience may be tested sooner rather than later. Hogg and her colleagues’ analyses revealed substantial crossbreeding between koalas farther south and southwest in Wollondilly and the chlamydia-free site of Campbelltown.

“The likelihood that the disease will eventually arrive in the disease-free area is quite high,” Hogg says.

If the koalas are mating, they’re swapping not only genes but also bacteria. Such crossbreeding might increase genetic diversity, but it could cause a potentially catastrophic outbreak of chlamydia.

“Usually the quickest way to inject new diversity is by bringing in individuals from another population or structuring environments in a way to ensure that different populations are connected and don’t become geographically isolated — like building corridors,” says Chloé Schmidt, an evolutionary ecologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. “But here, corridors wouldn’t be a great idea!”

Rebecca Taylor, a conservation genomicist with Environment and Climate Change Canada in Ottawa, says an alternative solution would be selectively moving uninfected animals from other populations into the chlamydia-free areas to safely boost genetic diversity.

“However, this approach would be very intensive and costly and would need to be repeated every couple of years,” Taylor says.

The study researchers see this as something of an intractable catch-22.

“The population is large, so introducing new genetic diversity and having it taken up into the population is complex and difficult to achieve,” says Hogg, adding that being pinched between urban isolation and disease threats is not unique to koalas. “This conundrum is found all over the world where urban areas are growing.”

The researchers suggest that the findings show how important it is to keep koala populations interconnected from the get-go. Habitat loss and human-made barriers can fragment populations into inbred enclaves that are far more susceptible to disease and other threats.

Hogg and her colleagues plan to continue monitoring the genetics of these and other koala populations to understand disease patterns and their relationship to koala immune system genes.

“We need to understand the genetic drivers that make individuals susceptible to disease so we can manage the species in the long term and ensure they have enough genetic diversity to be able to adapt to a changing world.”</p></b>

                <p>We usually think of workplace deviance as linked to “bad apples”–the troublemakers who egregiously slack off, steal from the company or openly clash with coworkers. But what if deviant behaviour was also more subtle–daydreaming, taking long coffee breaks or cracking an edgy joke in a meeting? It turns out most employees engage in quieter patterns of minor misbehaviours, and it’s changing how we think about deviance on the job.

Traditionally, research has kept deviance in neat boxes: bad behaviours are either interpersonal (aimed at coworkers) or organisational (targeted against the company). But most employees don’t fall into rigid categories of “good” or “bad”, nor do they engage only in one type of misbehaviour. Instead, many show a mix of minor, less disruptive behaviours that don’t seem to fit the bad-apple narrative.

Breaking down misconduct

Our research explored different patterns or “classes” of workplace misbehaviours. We meta-analysed responses from more than 6,000 employees across 20 primary studies in the US and elsewhere, and conducted multiple follow-up studies across different countries and industries.

Using statistical modelling techniques, our analysis of previous studies found evidence for five unique classes of “deviants” at work, with several of these falling clearly outside the traditional good/bad or person/organisation dichotomies. We then conducted a second study with 553 participants that found similar evidence, and showed how behaviours linked to these classes related to job satisfaction, turnover intentions and other work outcomes.

Here’s a breakdown of the five types of workplace “troublemakers” we identified in our follow-up studies:

Withdrawn workers (39% of the participants in the study)

You won’t see these workers causing a big scene, but then again, you might not see them much at all. Far from classic troublemakers, these workers act out by withholding effort, coming in late and withdrawing from the action in sometimes remarkable ways. The prevalence of this class, which is not well captured in prior deviance research, supports the phenomenon of “quiet quitting” that was popularized in recent years.

Slacking jerks (9%)

This group exhibits the low productivity and withdrawal of the previous class, but with an edge. They avoid tasks, work slowly, take long breaks and are often rude to coworkers.

Stagnant workers (21%)

Disengaged but not overtly harmful, these employees daydream and occasionally show up late without causing obvious disruptions. They don’t stand out on a typical day, but when things get rough you might notice they aren’t pulling their weight. These workers can stifle efforts at organisational change and slowly erode a positive culture.

Elevated deviants (4%)

The classic “bad apples”, people in this group engage in all the various disruptive behaviours described above, likely due to high job dissatisfaction.

Minimal deviants (27%)

Members of this group avoid most deviant behaviour and are generally good citizens at work. Even if this percentage is inflated–social desirability bias, or the inclination people have to present themselves well, may have affected study participants’ willingness to admit every act of deviance–its relatively modest size is still telling: a vast majority of workers in our sample say they are misbehaving in some way.

Our data show that workplace deviance isn’t always about major rule-breaking; in fact, it rarely is! While serious actions like theft (e.g., stealing property or falsifying a receipt) and overt aggression are rare, smaller things like daydreaming, taking extra breaks and making snarky remarks happen rather frequently. These mundane forms of deviance can be written off because they fail to evoke visceral reactions from managers or peers. But they can also add up, eroding positive cultures in ways that aren’t seen until a major event occurs.

What drives these behaviours?

People often act out at work because they feel wronged by a person or situation, or because they have deeper motivations, linked to their personality traits, that are more conducive to deviance. Our study backs up this idea and offers some additional clarity. As expected, when employees feel wronged–by a demanding boss, unhelpful coworkers or a lack of support from the organisation–they’re more likely to push back with some type of misconduct. Having an abusive supervisor makes it more likely that employees will be members of the “elevated deviant” class, whereas experiencing ostracism makes membership in the “stagnant worker” class more likely.

One could argue about which comes first–being abused or being the abuser–but the pattern we found aligns with prior work that shows causality between injustice and deviance.

Looking beyond the work environment, we also found that certain personality traits can predict what type of “deviant” a worker is most likely to be. Agreeableness, for example, is associated with less overt deviance classes such as “stagnant workers” and “withdrawn workers”. Interestingly, while conscientiousness was predictive of belonging to the “minimal deviant” class, our data suggest that highly conscientious people do occasionally act out, usually with a mix of withdrawal and rudeness (like the “slacking jerks”).

In short, highly conscientious people have high expectations for their own and others’ work, and they may sometimes react to stress or slights in ways that make their unmet expectations known.

Impacts on performance

Deviant behaviour impacts team performance and turnover. Our study shows that employees in the “minimal deviants” group generally perform well, are supportive of their teammates and are satisfied with their work, whereas those in high-deviance groups are often poorer performers who do not often behave supportively toward their coworkers. Yet, while our findings support the idea of a “bad apple” dragging down an entire team, deviance and its effects can be more complicated in some cases.

Consider the relatively mild deviance classes of “stagnant workers” and “withdrawn workers”, whose members express relatively high intentions to quit and, accordingly, perform lower than those of other classes. These employees may fly under the radar while silently eroding an organisation’s potential.

Workers in the “slacking jerks” class exhibit contradictory behavioural patterns: they are willing to withdraw from some parts of their job and act out rudely toward some coworkers, while also maintaining relatively higher levels of performance and even going out of their way to help other colleagues. As a result, managers are frequently navigating grey zones: what trade-offs are palatable, and where is the line between reasonable expression and outright violation?

Our findings show that most employees engage in minor misdemeanors, like taking extra-long breaks or daydreaming, rather than major actions like theft. Many don’t just dabble in one or two types of deviance, but exhibit complex patterns in their behaviour at work that can be reliably predicted by personality-based factors and situational attributes. Without careful attention, their minor acts, which often emerge as a response to burn-out or low morale, may go unnoticed or untreated, and can accumulate into big problems for organisations.

Beyond bad intentions

Our findings also challenge the belief that rule-breaking is driven by a few “bad apples” intent on causing trouble, and contribute to a growing line of inquiry that shifts from asking merely “who acts out at work?” to “why do people engage in these behaviours?” For many employees, minor slip-ups are likely less about causing harm and more about coping with everyday stress.

Motives for breaking rules can differ substantially. For instance, some workers who are withdrawn might be stepping back quietly to deal with health issues, while others stepping back may be evincing a low level of commitment. Understanding their different reasons could open the door to better ways of addressing their behaviours.

While deviance has traditionally been viewed as something rare, our study shows a more complicated picture. On the one hand, only 4% of respondents reported high levels of all forms of deviance, which, on the surface, would support the rarity of workplace deviance. However, on the other hand, only about a quarter (27%) of employees reported that they steer clear of deviance entirely. That leaves more than two thirds (69%) of employees exhibiting milder and more nuanced patterns of misbehavior.

This helps us understand deviance as a more common part of work life. It also complicates how managers think about, penalise and discourage it. Without levers that help employees reduce stress or make up for uncontrollable work factors (such as company-wide salary freezes), managers may feel pressure to accept some forms of deviance as “the cost of doing business” while remaining vigilant toward the most egregious and overt infractions.</p></b>

                <p>Since returning to the White House in 2025, US President Donald Trump has dramatically reshaped US policy toward Russia, adopting a markedly softer stance on Vladimir Putin and the ongoing war in Ukraine. This approach has included cutting military aid to Ukraine, and pressuring Kyiv to accept unfavourable terms to end the fighting.

Trump is also weakening America’s negotiating position by repeatedly and prematurely signalling the concessions the US is willing to make.

Historically, Russia has responded to strength, not appeasement. As US diplomat and historian George Kennan famously stated in his 1946 Long Telegram, the Soviet Union understood only the language of power. He was proven right – throughout and since the Cold War, Western concessions have often invigorated rather than calmed Russian aggression.

Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy is reinforcing this established pattern, emboldening Moscow, and diminishing any prospect of a just resolution to the Russo-Ukrainian war.

Undermining US leverage

Since February, President Trump has taken several actions that align with Russian strategic interests. These have included:

Cutting military aid to Ukraine, despite bipartisan warnings that reducing support could shift battlefield momentum in Russia’s favor

Blocking Nato membership and refusing security guarantees for Ukraine, signalling that territorial expansion can be rewarded rather than deterred

Blaming Kyiv for the war while downplaying Russia’s responsibility and ignoring the indisputable reality that Russia invaded Ukraine, a stance that echoes Kremlin propaganda narratives

Criticising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for postponing elections under martial law, despite Ukraine’s constitutional justification

Siding with Russia, North Korea and Belarus to vote against a UN resolution condemning Moscow’s actions and supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

This approach mirrors historical examples of Western appeasement, from Neville Chamberlain’s 1938 Munich Agreement to the weak enforcement of President Obama’s “red line” in Syria in 2013. By preemptively offering concessions, Trump has weakened US leverage, removing any incentive for Putin to negotiate in good faith.

Unlike Western democracies, Putin’s Russia operates on power dynamics rather than diplomatic courtesies. Trump’s early giveaways – such as suggesting the recognition of Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories – will therefore be seen in Moscow as a show of weakness, not goodwill. This weakens the US’ leverage in negotiations, and by extension that of its allies too.

20th century history confirms that Russia only responds to forceful deterrence. The Reagan administration’s Cold War military buildup undeniably contributed to the Soviet Union’s economic collapse, and Nato expansion in the 1990s and early 2000s deterred Russian ambitions in Eastern Europe. More recently, the weak US response to the 2014 annexation of Crimea paved the way for Russia to launch its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Trump’s diplomatic overtures, unaccompanied by credible enforcement mechanisms, project weakness rather than pragmatism. This only encourages Moscow to escalate rather than compromise.

Alienating America’s allies

While Trump attempts to broker a deal with Putin, European allies are growing increasingly wary of US commitment to transatlantic security.

His administration downplayed Russia’s threat at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, shocking European leaders. US disengagement has now pushed the continent toward urgently building an independent defence strategy, potentially weakening Nato cohesion.

The aforementioned voting alongside Russia at the UN on a Ukraine-related resolution will have further fractured America’s alliances.

Trump’s policies risk creating a strategic vacuum, forcing Europe to act alone while simultaneously emboldening Russia and China to expand their geopolitical ambitions.

Putin will not compromise

Recent peace talks in Saudi Arabia illustrate Russia’s strategic approach to negotiations. Moscow actively blocked the participation of US special envoy Keith Kellogg, showcasing its attempt to manipulate the diplomatic process.

This follows a classic Russian negotiating tactic of prolonging talks while making unrealistic demands. In Saudi Arabia, these included keeping occupied Ukrainian territories, limiting Ukraine’s military capabilities, and forbidding foreign peacekeepers.

As analysts have pointed out, Putin does not intend to stop the war, only to reshape the battlefield on his terms. Trump’s miscalculations therefore leave Russia free to continue its offensive in the knowledge that US pressure on Ukraine will weaken any resistance.

A fragile ceasefire, as is currently under negotiation, will allow Russia to regroup and launch new attacks, and could be broken at any time.

China will also be watching closely. If Trump hands Putin a win, Beijing may feel emboldened to escalate its military efforts in Taiwan and the South China Sea.

Trump’s credibility crisis

A recent poll found that over half of Americans believe Trump is too close to Russia. His willingness to publicly signal diplomatic compromises, such as preventing Ukraine from joining Nato, reveals a weak negotiating style that undermines US credibility on the global stage.

Trump’s approach echoes his past diplomatic missteps, which some have described as “cowboy diplomacy” – a strategy that prioritises personal deal-making over structured policy, ultimately leading to strategic blunders. Far from strengthening US leverage, his premature openness about concessions gives Putin room to dictate the terms of engagement.

Trump’s misreading of Putin’s playbook is leading to a weaker US position, a more vulnerable Ukraine, and a divided Nato. History clearly shows that Russia only respects power, not appeasement, yet Trump’s diplomacy appears to offer unilateral concessions with little strategic gain.

Unless the US reverses course and reasserts its leadership in defending Ukraine and deterring Russia, Trump’s policies will not end the war but ensure that it drags on, only with Moscow instead of Europe or the US dictating its terms.</p></b>

                <p>When a ceasefire in the war between Hamas and Israel finally came into effect on January 19, the world breathed a collective sigh of relief.

However, that ceasefire agreement, and its associated negotiations, have now been cast aside by new Israeli attacks on Gaza.

A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the strikes came after Hamas’ “repeated refusals” to “release our hostages”, and the group’s rejection of all proposals presented by US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

Even before Israel cut off all humanitarian aid and electricity to Gaza in the past two weeks, Hamas claimed it had not met the levels of humanitarian aid, shelter and fuel it agreed to provide in the terms of the ceasefire. However, this is a distraction from a larger issue.

This ceasefire was always more like a strangle contract than a negotiated agreement between equal parties. Israel, as the party with far greater military and political power, has always had the upper hand.

And while the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasted 42 days, saw the successful release of 33 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, the ceasefire also enabled Israel to use it for its own political and military ends.

Buying time

The most common conventional concern about ceasefires is that the parties to a conflict will use them for their own ends.

Typically, the worry is that non-state armed groups, such as Hamas, will use the halt in violence to buy time to regroup, rearm and rebuild their strength to continue fighting.

But states such as Israel have this ability, too. Even though they have standing armies that might not need to regroup and rearm in the same way, states can use this time to manoeuvre in the international arena – a space largely denied to non-state actors.

Trump’s rise to power in the US has seemingly given the Israeli government carte blanche to proceed in ways that were arguably off limits to previous US presidents who were also largely supportive of Israel’s actions.

This includes the plan of forcing Gaza’s population out of the strip. This plan was raised earlier in the war by Trump advisor Jared Kushner and Israeli officials as a supposed humanitarian initiative.

Trump has now repeated the call to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan – or possibly other parts of Africa – and for the US to take “ownership” of the coastal strip and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.

On the face of it, this plan would be a war crime. But even if it is never fully implemented, the fact it is being promoted by Trump after many years of domestic Israeli and international opprobrium shows how political ideas once thought unacceptable can take on a life of their own.

Political and military maneouvering

Israel has also used the ceasefire to pursue larger political and military goals in Gaza, the West Bank, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Even though the ceasefire did reduce overall levels of violence in Gaza, Israel has continued to carry out attacks on targets in the strip.

It has also escalated the construction of settlements and carried out increasingly violent operations in the West Bank. In addition, there have been egregious attacks on Palestinian residents in Israel.

And though nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners were released during the ceasefire, Israel was holding more than 9,600 Palestinians in detention on “security grounds” at the end of 2024. Thousands more Palestinians are being held by Israel in administrative detention, which means without trial or charge.

During the ceasefire, Israel also accelerated efforts to evict the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, from its headquarters in East Jerusalem. And the Israeli government has also proposed increasingly draconian laws aimed at restraining the work of Israeli human rights organisations.

On the military front, the ceasefire arguably alleviated some pressure on Israel, giving it time to consolidate its territorial and security gains against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and in Syria.

In the past two months, two deadlines for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon passed. Israel has instead proposed establishing a buffer zone on Lebanese territory and has begun destroying villages, uprooting olive trees and building semi-permanent outposts along the border.

In a speech in February, Netanyahu also demanded the “complete demilitarisation of southern Syria” following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. And Defence Minister Israel Katz said this month Israel would keep its troops in southern Syria to “protect” residents from any threats from the new Syrian regime.

Be careful what you wish for

While Palestinians are known for their sumud – usually translated as steadfastness or tenacity – there is a limit to what humans can endure. The war, and subsequent ceasefires, have created a situation in which Gazans may have to put the survival and wellbeing of themselves and their families above their desire to stay in Palestine.

There is a general assumption that ceasefires are positive and humanitarian in nature. But ceasefires are not panaceas. In reality, they are a least-worst option for stopping the violence of war for often just a brief period.

A ceasefire was never going to be the solution to the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Instead, it has turned out to be part of the problem.</p></b>

In a Tuesday speech framing the budget Chalmers said, “it will be a responsible budget which helps with the cost of living, builds our future, and makes our economy more resilient in the new world of global uncertainty”.

He said the budget would have five major priorities:

helping the recovery and rebuild following Cyclone Alfred, for which it will provide $1.2 billion

helping with the cost of living and finishing the fight against inflation

strengthening Medicare and funding more urgent care clinics

putting money into every stage of education

making the economy more competitive and productive.

In the question-and-answer part of his appearance at the Queensland Media Club Chalmers refused to be drawn on whether the cost-of-living relief would include more help on power bills, as is widely expected.

He was also put on the spot about his future leadership ambitions, initially being asked whether, given federal Labor’s poor showing in Queensland, it would do better with a leader from that state.

After diverting the question with a joke and a vigorous defence of Anthony Albanese’s “practical pragmatism” and his appreciation of Queensland, he was asked directly, “So you don’t have aspirations to become leader one day yourself?” “No”, he replied.

Chalmers is lowering expectations of extensive new initiatives being announced next Tuesday, because big spending measures in health, education and infrastructure have been announced.

The budget will project deficits throughout the forward estimates. But Chalmers said Treasury did not expect the bottom line this year or the coming years to be substantially changed from the mid year update.

In the mid-year update release in December, Treasury said it expected the deficit this financial year to be $26.9 billion. The deficit was forecast to increase further next year to $46.9 billion, compared with $42.8 billion forecast in last year’s budget.

Chalmers sought to scotch incorrect predictions he said had been made.

“For example, some commentators have made wild and wide-of-the-mark predictions about big surges in revenue.

"Some wrongly predict the tax-to-GDP ratio will go up this year, when Treasury expects it to be stable or even a bit down.

"Revenue upgrades have actually come off very significantly since the highs of October 2022.”

Chalmers argued the Australian economy “has turned a corner” but acknowledged “a new world of uncertainty” in which it was operating.

“The global economy is volatile and unpredictable.

"There’s a new US administration disrupting trade, a slowdown in China, war in eastern Europe and a fragile ceasefire in the Middle East, division and dissatisfaction around the world.

"Overnight, the OECD downgraded its growth expectations for next year and the year after.”

The OECD cut its forecasts for GDP growth to just 1.8% in 2026, down from an earlier forecast of 2.5%.

“Treasury forecasts in the Budget will have Chinese and American growth slowing to around 4.5 and 2 per cent next year, respectively.

"The forecasts for the US are the same as the mid-year update but the downside risks are weighing more heavily now.

"Unemployment is rising overseas from higher interest rates, and in the UK inflation is going up again.

"This is the global backdrop for the Budget.”

Chalmers repeated the government’s criticism of the US failure to grant an exemption from the steel and aluminium tariffs.

He said Treasury had modelled the impact of tariffs on our economy, both before the US election, and after the inauguration.

“Treasury estimates the direct hit to GDP from steel and aluminium tariffs would be less than 0.02 per cent by 2030. So the direct overall impacts on Australia should be manageable.

"But when you add in the indirect effects, the hit to GDP could be more like 0.1 per cent by 2030.

"In fact, over a range of scenarios, Treasury found the indirect GDP impacts of a trade war could be up to four times larger than the direct effects of tariffs on our economy.

"In a world of retaliation and escalation, the impacts of tariffs are amplified, they linger for longer, resulting in a bigger reduction in GDP and a bigger increase in prices.”</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>On Monday, an ABC’s Four Corners investigation reported shocking cases of abuse and neglect in Australian childcare centres. This included examples of children being sexually abused, restrained for hours in high chairs, and fed nutritionally substandard meals such as pasta with ketchup.

While acknowledging there are high-quality services operating in the community, the program also showed how centre-based childcare is big business, dominated by for-profit providers, who may not be meeting regulatory standards.

What is going wrong with childcare in Australia?

Differing levels of quality

Data from Australia’s childcare regulator consistently shows for-profit childcare services are, on average, rated as lower quality than not-for-profit services.

Of those rated by regulators, 11% of for-profit long daycare centres are not meeting national minimum quality standards (they are just “working towards”). This compares with 7% of not-for-profit centres not meeting minimum standards.

There are 13% of for-profit centres exceeding the standards, compared to 28% of not-for-profits.

Inquiries suggest this divergence is due to staffing levels, qualifications and pay. In 2023, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) found large for-profit providers spend significantly less on staffing than not-for-profit providers.

Large for-profit providers have a higher proportion of part-time and casual staff than not-for-profits. They also employ less experienced early childhood teachers. On top of this, they are more likely to use award rates of pay, which are typically lower than enterprise agreement rates.

Lower pay and less job security is related to higher turnover of staff, which makes it difficult for educators to establish and maintain the trusting relationships with children and families that underpin high quality.

Despite this, the federal government continues to support for-profit services through childcare subsidies.

These subsidies are designed to help families with the costs of childcare. But they do not stop some providers increasing their fees. The ACCC found a consistent pattern of increased government subsidies leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses for families, due to subsequent fee increases.

It hasn’t always been like this

Childcare subsidies haven’t always worked in this way. “Operational subsidies” were introduced in 1972 through the historic Child Care Act, which set the precedent for Australian governments to fund childcare.

This aimed to support women’s workforce participation through an expanded, high-quality childcare sector. Subsidies at the time were only available to not-for-profit services and required the employment of qualified staff, including teachers. In these ways, Commonwealth funding positioned childcare as a public good, like school education.

Then, in 1991, federal government subsidies were extended to for-profit providers. This prompted dramatic changes in the childcare landscape, leading to a dominance of for-profit centres.

Today, more than 70% of all long day-care centres are operated by private providers. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of for-profit long daycare services jumped by 60%, while not-for-profits only grew by 4%.

Quality concerns

There are 25 large long daycare providers in Australia and of these, 21 are run for profit. Large for-profit providers impact sector quality in several ways.

Many have disproportionately high numbers of staffing waivers, granted by regulators, permitting them to operate centres without the required number of qualified staff.

According to unpublished research by Gabrielle Meagher, as of October 2024, 11 large for-profit providers held waivers for a quarter or more of their services and five held waivers for more than a third. This compares to 15% of the sector overall.

Large for-profit providers also serve investors as well as families. So there are extra incentives to cut costs and maximise profits.

The dominance of for-profit providers also makes them powerful players in policy-making circles, as governments depend on them to provide an essential service.

Why isn’t the system working?

Given Australia has a regulatory and quality assurance system for childcare services, why do we have these quality issues?

As the Productivity Commission found, regulators are under-resourced, and inspections are infrequent. Services that repeatedly fail to meet the minimum standards are still allowed to operate, sometimes for more than a decade.

Services are notified about upcoming inspections, potentially giving them time to give a false impression of their quality and safety standards.

As Four Corners highlighted, poor-quality services, with bad pay and working conditions are driving good educators away from the sector.

What next?

The Albanese government recently passed legislation to “guarantee” eligible families three days of subsidised childcare per week from January 2026.

But families need more than access. They also require a guarantee this childcare will be high-quality and keep children safe.

Even without the extra spending on the three-day guarantee, government spending on childcare subsidies is due to reach nearly A$15 billion by 2026–27. Thus there is also a corresponding duty to taxpayers to ensure these funds are going to high-quality providers.

In the wake of the Four Corners report, the Greens are calling for a royal commission into childcare. But we do not need this level of inquiry to tell us the current system needs fundamental change.

Stronger regulatory powers, while important, will not be enough on their own. High-quality services need well-educated and well-supported staff. They also need governance and leadership that value educators’ expertise and enable consistently high standards.</p></b>

                <p>The Greens have heaped a lot of pressure on the government during this term, from issues of the environment, housing, and Medicare, to the war in the Middle East.

With the polls close to a dead heat and minority government appearing a real possibility, would the Greens push a minority Labor government even harder in pursuit of their agenda?

To talk about the Greens’ policies and prospects, we’re joined by South Australian Greens senator Barbara Pocock, who is the party’s spokeswoman on employment, the public sector and finance.

After their efforts in this term, Pocock says the Greens would be just as tough in pushing a possible Labor minority government next term:

People can judge us on our record in the last few years. People saw us really fight hard on housing – we wanted to see something meaningful. It is the most significant post-war crisis in housing that is affecting millions of Australians’ lives and certainly an intergenerational crisis. So we held out for a long time to try and push Labor to improve its offering on public housing [and] on housing spending and we achieved some real wins there. We will fight hard for the things that matter. We will push very hard on those core issues of a better health system, putting dental into Medicare. We pushed very hard on that in the last time there was a minority government and won it for kids. We want to see everyone be able to get to the dentist, and we really want to see reductions in student debt.

However, Pocock stresses that keeping Peter Dutton out of government remains a key focus:

We are very focused on preventing a Dutton Coalition government, because everything we hear from that stable sends a shiver down my spine.

Pocock did a lot of work during the Senate inquiry investigating consulting services and she warns Dutton’s policy to cut 36,000 public servants would lead to a return to consultants:

In that last year of the Morrison government, we saw a spend of $20 billion on consulting and labour hire and a hollowing out in the public sector. We are still seeing a slow regrowth of the capability of the federal public sector following the scandals relating to the consulting industry and the way it worked with government. I am very worried about the Coalition’s proposals for a 36,000 cut in the public sector. That’s one in five public sector workers gone and that means services like Centrelink, Veterans Affairs, services that Australians depend on cannot deliver on what they suggest. And we also need to remember that a very significant number – something like two-thirds of our public service, federal public service – actually live outside Canberra. All they would be doing is taking that money, which pays for public servants, doing a whole range of many different things and taking it across to, in many cases, their supporters and buddies and donors in the consulting and labour hire industry and it’s a very bad value-for-money proposition for the Australian voter.

As spokeswoman on employment, Pocock is a strong advocate for the Greens policies on a four-day work week:

If we go right back to 1856 when Australia led the world on reducing working hours, and the eight-hour day, now we were the first to adopt that internationally for stonemasons in Melbourne. And in the last 40 years, [we] have not seen any reduction in average working time. It’s been 38 hours now since 1983. In that 40 years, we’ve seen massive changes in technology. We have seen increases in productivity. And in the last 10 years, we’ve seen private profit increase by 97% while wages have gone up by 50%. And what we’re saying is, let’s look at the length of the average full-time working week and let’s see how we can move the dial on that. We’d certainly like to see a wide range of pilots, diverse experimentation, real change, working with those who are ready for it, who are up for it, but making sure we collect the evidence and then move over time towards a national test case, which is the way in which over decades we have slowly ratcheted back the length of the working week.

On the attack from the opposition and others that the Greens are anti-Semitic, Pocock defends the Greens as an anti-racist party.</p></b>

                <p>Power prices are set to go up again even though renewables now account for 40% of the electricity in Australia’s main grid – close to quadruple the clean power we had just 15 years ago. How can that be, given renewables are the cheapest form of newly built power generation?

This is a fair question. As Australia heads for a federal election campaign likely to focus on the rising cost of living, many of us are wondering when, exactly, cheap renewables will bring cheap power.

The simple answer is – not yet. While solar and wind farms produce power at remarkably low cost, they need to be built where it’s sunny or windy. Our existing transmission lines link gas and coal power stations to cities. Connecting renewables to the grid requires expensive new transmission lines, as well as storage for when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining.

Notably, Victoria’s mooted price increase of 0.7% was much lower than other states, which would be as high as 8.9% in parts of New South Wales. This is due to Victoria’s influx of renewables – and good connections to other states. Because Victoria can draw cheap wind from South Australia, hydroelectricity from Tasmania or coal power from New South Wales through a good transmission line network, it has kept wholesale prices the lowest in the national energy market since 2020.

While it was foolish for the Albanese government to promise more renewables would lower power bills by a specific amount, the path we are on is still the right one.

That’s because most of our coal plants are near the end of their life. Breakdowns are more common and reliability is dropping. Building new coal plants would be expensive too. New gas would be pricier still. And the Coalition’s nuclear plan would be both very expensive and arrive sometime in the 2040s, far too late to help.

Renewables are cheap, building a better grid is not

The reason solar is so cheap and wind not too far behind is because there is no fuel. There’s no need to keep pipelines of gas flowing or trainloads of coal arriving to be burned.

But sun and wind are intermittent. During clear sunny days, the National Energy Market can get so much solar that power prices actually turn negative. Similarly, long windy periods can drive down power prices. But when the sun goes down and the wind stops, we still need power.

This is why grid planners want to be able to draw on renewable sources from a wide range of locations. If it’s not windy on land, there will always be wind at sea. To connect these new sources to the grid, though, requires another 10,000 kilometres of high voltage transmission lines to add to our existing 40,000 km. These are expensive and cost blowouts have become common. In some areas, strong objections from rural residents are adding years of delay and extra cost.

So while the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, we have underestimated the cost of getting this power to markets as well as ensuring the power can be “firmed”. Firming is when electricity from variable renewable sources is turned into a commodity able to be turned on or off as needed and is generally done by storing power in pumped hydro schemes or in grid-scale batteries.

In fact, the cost of transmission and firming is broadly offsetting the lower input costs from renewables.

Does this mean the renewable path was wrong?

At both federal and state levels, Labor ministers have made an error in claiming renewables would directly translate to lower power prices.

But consider the counterpoint. Let’s say the Coalition gets in, rips up plans for offshore wind zones and puts the renewable transition on ice. What happens then?

Our coal plants would continue to age, leading to more frequent breakdowns and unreliable power, especially during summer peak demand. Gas is so expensive as to be a last resort. Nuclear would be far in the future. What would be left? Quite likely, expensive retrofits of existing coal plants.

If we stick to the path of the green energy transition, we should expect power price rises to moderate. With more interconnections and transmission lines, we can accommodate more clean power from more sources, reducing the chance of price spikes and adding vital resilience to the grid. If an extreme weather event takes out one transmission line, power can still flow from others.

Storing electricity will be a game-changer

Until now, storing electricity at scale for later use hasn’t been possible. That means grid operators have to constantly match supply and demand. To cope with peak demand, such as a heatwave over summer, we have very expensive gas peaking plants which sit idle nearly all the time.

Solar has only made the challenge harder, as we get floods of solar at peak times and nothing in the evening when we use most of our power. Our coal plants do not deal well with being turned off and on to accommodate solar floods.

The good news is, storage is solving most of these problems. Being able to keep hours or even days of power stored in batteries or in elevated reservoirs at hydroelectric plants gives authorities much more flexibility in how they match supply and demand.

We will never see power “too cheap to meter”, as advocates once said of the nuclear industry. But over time, we should see price rises ease.

For our leaders and energy authorities, this is a tricky time. They must ensure our large-scale transmission line interconnectors actually get built, juggle the flood of renewables, ensure storage comes online, manage the exit of coal plants and try not to affect power prices. Pretty straightforward.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>On April 2 the United States is set to implement a new wave of tariffs under its Fair and Reciprocal Trade Plan. Details of the plan that will impact all US trading partners are not yet known, but the US administration has suggested these tariffs will target any rules it considers “unfair”.

This means the April 2 tariffs may take aim at a range of Australian domestic policies, such as biosecurity rules that govern food imports, and the government’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

The size of the hit is uncertain. One report indicates a relatively modest tariff between 2% and 8% is being considered, below the 25% rate imposed on steel and aluminium on March 12. But it will apply to a much larger set of exports.

Australia and the US have been allies for over a century. The two nations celebrated a “century of mateship” in 2018. More formally, the two countries have a current free trade agreement, Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).

The agreement was negotiated in good faith, and entered into force on January 1, 2005. It called for the elimination of tariffs between the two nations over time, and until now both parties have upheld their respective bargains. The so-called “reciprocal” tariff plan would breach that agreement.

What sectors are likely to be targeted?

The Trump reference to non-tariff barriers raises two main concerns for Australian products: meat and pharmaceuticals.

These exports to the US are worth about A$3.3 billion and $1.6 billion a year respectively. That’s about five times the total value of our steel and aluminium exports to the US.

In Australia, domestic beef products are subject to strict traceability rules. Similarly, imported beef has rigid biosecurity requirements as it is classified as a high-risk food.

This is because of the potential risk of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy). This disease was detected in the US in 2002 and triggered an Australian ban on US beef products.

The ban was partially lifted in 2018, but some restrictions remain, which the US says are a barrier to trade. This was also raised by the Biden administration in a 2024 report on trade barriers.

The US cannot force Australia to change its laws on the basis of tariffs – but they can make products coming from Australian suppliers more expensive and therefore restrict market access to the US, which many Australian producers rely on.

A tariff on Australian-sourced beef products would also push up prices for American consumers. Trade Minister Don Farrell has warned the price of a McDonald’s burger may increase.

Medicines are also in the line of fire

Turning to pharmaceuticals, the Australian PBS has been a sticking point between US and Australian trade negotiators for the past 20 years.

The PBS, which has been in place since 1948, ensures Australians have affordable access to essential medicines. It formed part of discussions during the free-trade negotiations and has been raised as a potential barrier to trade.

The US argues innovation and unfettered market access for American drug companies should be prioritised over Australia’s reference pricing arrangements. Reference pricing means medicines with similar outcomes should have similar pricing.

The reason the US has a problem with this scheme is because some of their companies are not able to charge higher prices for medicines.

Although these are the categories of most concern, there is no assurance the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” will be limited to beef and pharmaceuticals.

For instance, there are no barriers imposed on the import of wine into Australia. But there has been some concern tariffs could be introduced regardless.

Wine is often the target of trade wars and President Donald Trump has threatened the European Union with a 200% tariff on all wine and spirits entering the US. As Australian wine makers have only recently recovered from Chinese and Canadian tariffs, any US tariffs would deal a harsh blow to the industry.

An old clip of the former Republican President Ronald Reagan went viral this week, highlighting his quite different view:

Is there any avenue for appeal?

There is one thing that is clear about these tariffs. Their imposition will be in violation of both the WTO rules and the free-trade agreement.

Both have provisions to settle disputes and Australia does have options for filing complaints. However, the rule of law and existing norms of the international order do not appear to be persuasive to the Trump administration.

Despite this, it is important to note the US cannot force Australia to change its longstanding laws that protect consumers and ensure accessibility to medicines. This remains the choice of the Australian government.

If the tariffs are introduced in the range of 2% to 8%, there may not be a significant direct economic impact. But they will have other consequences. Trade negotiations, and international agreements, are largely based on goodwill. These acts of the US will erode much of what has been built up over the past century.

The downturn we are seeing in financial markets has so far been dismissed by the Trump administration as necessary. But if the correction turns into a crash, it may give President Trump pause. Given his lack of interest in negotiating, this may be the only thing that could change his mind.</p></b>

                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>From May 1, the oral contraceptive Slinda (drospirenone) will be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). This means the price will drop for the more than 100,000 Australian women who currently use it – from around $A320 a year to around $94.

It’s the third contraceptive pill the federal government has added to the PBS this year, after Yaz and Yasmine. But these two are combined oral contraceptives – meaning they contain both the hormones oestrogen and progestogen – whereas Slinda is progestogen-only.

So, Slinda is a little bit different – here’s how it works and what it will cost.

What is Slinda and how does it work?

Oral contraceptive pills contain active ingredients based on the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone to prevent pregnancy.

Contraceptive pills with both hormones are known as combined-contraceptive pills. Progesterone only pills are often referred to as mini-pills.

The active ingredient in Slinda is a progestogen, which is a synthetic derivative of progesterone, which makes the medication a mini-pill.

Slinda works by stopping ovulation (the ovary doesn’t release an egg) and making the mucus in the cervix thicker so sperm cannot get into the uterus from the vagina.

Both combined contraceptive pills and mini pills effectively prevent pregnancy, but their suitability varies for different women. Mini-pills, including Slinda, can be 99% effective if used perfectly – but with typical day-to-day use, they provide only around 93% protection.

Who will find Slinda useful?

Slinda may be a particularly beneficial alternative for people who can’t use contraceptives containing oestrogen.

This may include women who are older, overweight, or prone to migraines. This is because oestrogen is known to increase the risk of blood clots which lead to deep vein thrombosis – already a higher risk for older and overweight women.

Similarly, combined pills containing oestrogen aren’t appropriate for those who’ve had a baby in the last 21 days or are breastfeeding. Lower levels of oestrogen are needed in a woman’s body post-birth as it stimulates prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. Taking an oestrogen-based pill can potentially interfere with that.

Slinda can be taken at any time after childbirth, including while breastfeeding, and generally remains a safer option for people with a history of blood clots or migraines.

Slinda also has advantages over other, older generations of progestogen-based contraceptive pills. Mini-pills such as Microlut and Noriday have no pill-free days, whichs means if a woman misses taking the pill by even a few hours it can increase her chance of becoming pregnant.

The pill-free window for Slinda is 24 hours. This means if you are less than 24 hours late it’s considered a late pill, not a missed pill. If you take the late pill as soon as you remember, and then the next pill at the normal time, you should have effective protection from unwanted pregnancy.

What are the risks or potential side effects?

The potential side effects for Slinda are similar to other contraceptive pills. Women may find that their period may stop altogether, or they may experience bleeding irregularities or spotting, as well as breast tenderness.

It is not currently recommended for those with breast cancer, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or severe liver disease, in line with recommendations for all mini-pills.

The pill may also not work effectively if it’s not taken correctly every day, or if it is taken with other drugs, such as the anti-viral ritonavir and anti-seizure medication phenytoin.

If a woman is suffering from vomiting or severe diarrhoea, Slinda may not be effective and she should use back-up contraception such as condoms.

There are other progesterone-only contraceptive options available on the PBS, such as levonorgestrel pills and implants, including the intrauterine devices, Mirena and Kyleena.

Why was Slinda added to the PBS?

Slinda has been available in Australia since at least 2004, but not at a subsidised price.

In November 2024, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended Slinda’s listing on the PBS. The committee cited several reasons, including advice from doctors, the need to provide women with more contraceptive options and Slinda’s longer pill-free window.

At a stakeholder meeting in October 2024, doctors stressed the need for more choice for women, when choosing a pill.

They highlighted women starting an oral contraceptive pill for the first time will often first use PBS-subsidised medications, even though a non-PBS product may be more suitable for them. Slinda’s listing makes it a more accessible first choice for women.

As Slinda is a prescription-only medication, if you wish to change pills or start on the drug you will need to consult your doctor. If you do change, from May 1 and based on similar PBS medications, you can expect to pay around $31 for a four-month supply.</p></b>

                <p>The reality of shorter working hours could be one step closer for many Australians, pending the outcome of the federal election.

The Greens, who could control crucial cross bench votes in a hung parliament, have announced plans for a four-day working week, with no loss of pay. They say the policy would alleviate stress and burn out, and increase women’s participation in the workforce.

Earning the same money for fewer hours would appeal to most workers. But is it too good to be true? Could it really be rolled out cost free to all workplaces, especially to “client facing” companies and service providers?

Or does research suggest the Greens could be onto something?

The Greens’ plan

The Greens’ policy would involve a new National Institute for the Four Day Work Week and a test case through the Fair Work Commission.

A series of national trials would be set up in a number of different industries, whereby workers would work 80% of their normal hours, while maintaining 100% of their pay.

According to Greens Senator Barbara Pocock, it’s a win-win for everyone:

It can increase productivity, reduce absenteeism, improve recruitment and retention and give employees more time to manage their home life. This change will allow workers to create a working week that works for them.

The 100:80:100 model

The four-day work week being proposed in this instance is commonly regarded as the 100:80:100 model.

It delivers 100% of the pay, for 80% of the hours, in return for maintaining 100% of productivity.

This is unlike other forms of shorter working weeks, which compress five days’ worth of work into four longer days. This obviously disadvantages some employees.

Recent research conducted by Swinburne University of Technology involved interviews with ten Australian firms that have already adopted the 100:80:100 model.

They were a mixture of small and medium sized private sector businesses, including management consulting firms, a shipping and logistics company, and recruitment and marketing agencies.

The research underlined the potential for a range of positive outcomes for both employers and employees.

Workers reported having better work-life balance, more time to complete “life administration” tasks, and more time to invest in hobbies, exercise, wellness and self-care. Bosses cited productivity gains, reduced sick days, and significant improvements in recruitment and retention rates.

However, the 100:80:100 model is viewed with scepticism in some quarters. There is still doubt that productivity and output would be maintained, or in some cases improved, when workers are working one day fewer per week.

Also, there could be costs associated with the implementation of this work model for front-line roles, such as retail, schools, hospitals and nursing homes. Additional workers may need to be hired, at extra expense, to cover the hours dropped by the existing workforce.

100 years of working 5 days a week

The year 2026 will mark the 100th anniversary of the five-day work week.

It was car maker Henry Ford who reduced the working week in the United States from six days to five. Other sectors and countries followed suit. This was at a time when the average life expectancy of Australian workers was just 55 and households typically only had one bread-winner.

Despite the time saved by the many technological breakthroughs in the past 100 years – from the photocopier, desktop computer and fax machine, to the internet, mobile phones and AI – the average Australian is now working longer hours in paid and unpaid labour than ever before.

The Greens point out Australian society is changing. More women and carers are either in the workforce or would be encouraged into the workforce by more flexible arrangements:

yet we are constrained by archaic labour laws that see the fruits of our efforts swallowed up in profits for bosses and shareholders.

The role of generative AI technologies in the workplace may also deliver benefits to workers. Separate Swinburne research has revealed an increasing expectation among workers that they will receive a share in the time saved by future technologies in the form of improved work-life balance and wellbeing gains.

Time to enter the 21st century

Earlier this year, 200 UK companies signed up to the 100:80:100 model, as part of a campaign to “reinvent Britain’s working week”. Large scale trials are also underway in Canada and several European countries.

The global interest in a shorter working week is not surprising, and has likely been fuelled by the COVID pandemic, which has caused workers and employers to re-imagine their working lives.

If the Greens are in a position to leverage any balance of power after the coming election, it could be Australia’s turn to recognise the conventional five-day working week is no longer fit for purpose.</p></b>

                <p>The 72 hours after the sexual assault of a child can be a crucial window for police to collect biological evidence and document signs of bruising or injury.

But this procedure – known as a forensic medical examination – can be scary and invasive.

In new research published with colleagues, I interviewed ten children (aged 4-16) and their parents about their experiences attending a Melbourne paediatric hospital in the hours after an alleged assault.

This was a small group, but their stories shed light on wider concerns. Addressing them can help put children first in what may be the most traumatic time of their lives.

What is a forensic medical examination?

A forensic medical examination can be done in the 72 hours following a child sexual assault.

Its purpose is to gather biological evidence from the victim to help police identify an offender and prosecute them.

At a hospital crisis care suite, the child will speak to a specialist doctor (a forensic paediatrician) alongside another clinician, usually a psychologist or social worker. Police also attend.

The doctor will take the child’s medical history, as well as asking for an account of the assault.

The doctor swabs relevant areas – such as the child’s vulva, vagina or anus – to collect biological materials that may be present, including saliva or semen. They will also look for injuries or bruising.

This examination can be uncomfortable and can take hours. It may also be emotionally harrowing, for the child as well as their carer.

In the following days, children often need to give another statement to police and are referred for counselling.

Understanding how to avoid retraumatisation

A decade ago, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard from survivors the importance of trauma-informed responses.

A trauma-informed approach means prioritising a sense of safety for children who have experienced trauma, building trust and sharing control, to avoid retraumatisation.

This means explaining to children and their carers what is going to happen next, gaining their consent and giving them some control over the timing and pace of any interventions (such as being swabbed).

Children and families have different – sometimes traumatic – experiences of dealing with health services and police. So considering a child’s personal history and culture is important.

However there is still little research examining children and young people’s experience of crisis care.

My study involved seven girls, two boys and one non-binary child, aged between four and 16. In the days or weeks after their examination, I interviewed the child and the parent who attended hospital with them, both individually and together (in child-parent pairs).

The interviews uncovered four areas that were important to children and their parents.

1. Repeating their story but not feeling heard

After they first report their experience, children need to tell their story several times to various strangers.

This means sharing highly personal details while distressed to people who often don’t have the time to get to know them, their context, family, previous trauma history or culture.

Fiona* (16) found this aspect of the process “very, very, very stressful.”

Some said repeating their story felt like they had to convince professionals it was true.

Layla (14) commented:

I felt like I was the one in trouble.

2. Being treated with care matters

Several young participants discussed feeling “traumatised,” “intimidated” and “ashamed” during the examination itself.

Seven-year-old Sasha told us about the doctor who examined her:

She kept saying, ‘Lie still,’ and it was hard for me to just lie still. Then she just, when she did the examination […] I was crying on the bed, and it hurt me […]. And she just looked at me. Because she’s seen me crying and she just looked at me.

But when the doctor, or the clinician was caring – and took time to understand them and their individual needs – it helped ease some of the distress.

One parent, Kaye, felt the clinician “had this incredible demeanour and heart about her” and helped her child “understand what was going to happen.”

Other young people appreciated the clinician helped them with panic attacks and “made us feel relaxed.”

The youngest participant Ava (4) said she liked that she was given a teddy bear.

3. Unpleasant surroundings made the experience worse

Some participants described the space where the forensic medical examination took place as small and unwelcoming.

Dylan (16) felt it was “unsafe”, while Ava said it was “a bit scary”.

Examination spaces need to be kept forensically clean. In the hospital where these examinations took place, that meant there were no windows, pictures on the walls or soft furnishings.

Several young participants felt it showed what had happened to them was somehow shameful. As Felicity explained:

it was frightening. […] You’re just walking down a really long corridor, all these white […] ceilings and walls. And it was kind of just like a bit […] not welcoming, not nice and hidden away.

4. Parents need care too

Parents often felt sidelined or unheard before, during and after the examination.

Samira (a parent) said she didn’t feel like her concerns were understood:

I come from a different background, I don’t know what is happening and I don’t know what to ask. I’m not very trusting of police.

Children themselves worried about their parent. As Layla said:

it’s not just me that’s going through this, it’s my mum. […] I feel like she should be able to have that support too. None of it was offered to her.

One parent said they’d been “sent home without any support”. Another had a sense of being “just left there and wondering what to do”.

Responding to the whole child

The children and adults I interviewed made clear they wanted a holistic approach.

They wanted professionals (including doctors, clinicians and police) to not only pursue justice on their behalf, but also listen and respond to their physical, emotional and social needs and take into account their particular context and culture.

The response needs to make children and their families feel safer – not more scared.

It also needs to help them recover from the trauma, including counselling for both parents and children without long waitlists.

Existing services in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom show an evidence-based, trauma-informed model is possible.

The National Sexual Assault, Family and Domestic Violence Counselling Line – 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) – is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for any Australian who has experienced, or is at risk of, family and domestic violence and/or sexual assault.

                <p>The Removalists was first performed in 1971 at La Mama Theatre, Carlton, by the Australian Performing Group, an ensemble of young graduates, artists and friends.

A beacon of the New Wave of Australian drama, David Williamson was part of a new generation of theatre artists who were interested in reflecting Australia back to its audiences. Now one of Australia’s most prolific playwrights, Williamson’s early plays are part of the repertoire of modern Australian classics.

The Removalists was just his fourth play. A brutal commentary on Australian masculinity, it was a dark turn for the young artist.

A crooked cop, an easily corruptible young constable, a boozy husband and father who beats his wife and demands his dinner, and a removalist who sees no evil, does no evil. A new production by the Melbourne Theatre Company, directed by Anne-Louise Sarks, celebrates the enduring appeal of the play.

A suburban police station

We begin in a police station. Young constable Neville Ross (William McKenna) is being inducted into the force by a bitter, manipulative, rule-bending sergeant, Dan Simmons (played with menace by the moustachioed Steve Mouzakis).

When middle class sisters Kate (Jessica Clarke) and Fiona (Eloise Mignon) enter to report domestic violence, Simmonds asks invasive questions about Fiona’s relationship to her beer-swilling loudmouth husband Kenny (Michael Whalley).

Fiona initially expressed uncertainty about making the complaint. Kate insisted on going to the police. The action that follows exposes the humiliation that accompanies reports of domestic violence.

Pia Johnson/MTC

In an excruciating moment, Kate stands by watching while Simmonds asks Fiona to show him the bruises on her back and upper thigh. Fiona is unsure as she turns her back to the auditorium, slowly pulls up her jumper and exposes the bruises on her bare back.

Under Sarks’ direction, it is a moment filled with empathy.

Enter the removalist

The action shifts in act two to Fiona’s place. Expecting Kenny to be out drinking, Simmonds – who is expecting sexual favours from Kate – and Ross arrive to help Fiona move into her new flat. But Kenny is home, and sprays a string of obscenities at the policemen. Simmonds cuffs him – and lands a few quiet punches.

The removalist (Martin Blum) interrupts the action, while turning a blind eye to the mayhem. The entrances and exits of the removalist and Ross and the moving of furniture, punctuate the drama with comic effect, injecting a light touch in the midst of the play’s violence.

Pia Johnson/MTC

When the sisters and the removalist leave, the cops beat Kenny in an orgy of violence that is so relentless and brutal, it descends into farce.

The bloody ending has something of the Grand Guignol to it – the 19th century theatre of revenge that descends into comic horror but also raises serious questions about violence in the contemporary real life world.

Critiquing white Australia

Clever balancing of humour and social commentary is the key to Williamson’s critique of the law in relation to violence against women.

In an era of diverse casting, Sarks has cast The Removalists with an all white cast, laying the violence of the play at the feet of white Australian culture.

Matilda Woodroofe’s costumes contribute to the play’s critique of Australian culture. Kenny wears a pair of footy shorts and a t-shirt, Blundstone boots and short black socks, evoking the unoffical uniform of the ocker male Australian.

Pia Johnson/MTC

In a novel touch, Dale Ferguson’s set adds rows of onstage seating for those who would like a much closer view of the action. Not only do they get a stronger sense of the onstage actors’ energy and presence, they experience the play as the original audience did in the tiny La Mama theatre.

Just as playwright Williamson targeted a conservative macho ocker culture in the early 1970s, this revival can be understood as its contemporary counterpart. Sarks highlights the particular kinds of violence that is systemic within Australian culture that continues today.

Sarks accords the female characters more dignity and independence than earlier versions. They deliver the same lines, but with confidence that speaks of their self-assurance. Kate uses her gaze to put Simmonds, the disgusting older cop, in his place. After her humiliation at the police station, Fiona rejects Kenny’s appeals.

Pia Johnson/MTC

These subtle and not so subtle changes in the delivery of the women’s lines show how directing an historical play can resist the ideologies that determined more passive roles for women in the past.

The Removalists is at Melbourne Theatre Company until April 17.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>It’s annoying to open your dishwasher after the cycle is finished only to find half of the dishes still wet. Instead of being able to stack them away, you end up with a full drying rack.

And you’ve probably noticed it’s always plastic items that end up the most wet. What’s going on?

The answer is a bit convoluted and requires some materials and physics knowledge, but bear with me.

Plastics have very different properties to ceramics and metals – the stuff your plates and cutlery are most likely made out of. Two key things play a role: one is how the materials store heat, and the other is what happens on their surfaces.

How dishes store heat

If you take your dishes out of the dishwasher promptly after the cycle ends, you’ve likely noticed that plates, glasses and ceramic mugs are still hot, while plastic containers don’t feel warm at all.

This relates to their heat capacity, sometimes also referred to as the “thermal mass” of these materials. Ceramics, glass and metals can store more heat, and it takes longer for them to give it away to their surroundings than it does for plastics. In other words, ceramics and metals cool down more slowly.

Since evaporating water takes energy and cools the surface – which is also how your body cools down on a hot day as you sweat – plastics cool down faster, leaving much of the water on the surface.

How water behaves on different surfaces

The other part of the problem is in surface energy, which tells us how water wets different surfaces.

You’ve probably seen water droplets bead up on things like high-end rain jackets or non-stick frying pans. These surfaces are called hydrophobic, meaning they “fear” water. This is also the case for most plastics, although not always to such a dramatic effect.

On the other end of the spectrum, surfaces like many ceramics and metals are coated with water easily. That’s because they are more hydrophilic or “water-loving”.

But there’s another factor here – and it has to do with dishwashers, in particular. Dishwasher detergent contains a mixture of chemicals, mainly surfactants – substances that lower the surface tension of water.

Surface tension is the property of the material’s interface (for example, between solid and liquid, or liquid and gas) that tells us how much energy it takes to create a larger surface. By adding detergent to water, we reduce its surface tension. This makes it easier for the water to spread over surfaces it encounters (even over these hydrophobic plastics), in turn making it easier to wash your dishes.

More importantly, the surfactants in detergent are molecules that have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical groups. This makes them a kind of link between water and fats. Since oil and water don’t like to mix, a surfactant helps to “blend” the latter and have it float in water, helping remove any oily residues from your dishes.

This happens in the main washing cycle. After rinsing, the chemicals get removed and your dishes are sprayed with clean water so you don’t have to taste the detergent in your tea.

So, at the end, water beads up on your hydrophobic plastic dishes and spreads all over your more hydrophilic ceramic plates, cups and metal pots. A large bead of water evaporates more slowly than when the same amount of water is spread more thinly over your plates and pots.

On top of that, ceramic dishes retain more heat, which makes them dry more quickly – the water that’s already spread more thinly just evaporates faster.

Is there anything I can do to make plastics dry faster?

You’ve probably heard about rinse aids that are added to the rinse cycle. Their key ingredients are different types of low-foaming surfactants and chemicals that make water softer. Some “all in one” dishwasher tablets may already contain a small amount of rinse aid and the makers provide instructions on how to use them in a safe and efficient way.

Rinse aids also lower the surface tension of water, making it easier for water to wet and run off the surfaces, preventing it from beading up and reducing streaks.

This also works on plastic dishes, leaving much less water behind. Some dishwasher manufacturers recommend using rinse aids because in addition to drying dishes faster, they can prevent corrosion of dishwasher parts from detergent residues.

Is there anything else you can do to dry the dishes faster?

There is one thing that is really simple: just crack the door open as soon as the cycle is finished and it’s safe to do so, so that water vapour can escape. If hot air and moisture instead remain trapped in the dishwasher, the water vapour will condense on all surfaces, like dew before dawn.

At the end, you have a way to make most of your dishes drier after the cycle, although you may still end up with a first-world problem in the form of some wet plasticware. There will be less water on it if you use a rinse aid according to instructions, and open the dishwasher when safe, after the cycle is completed.</p></b>

                <p>In mid-February, President Donald Trump’s administration leaders received a desperate warning from their diplomats posted in Vietnam, one of the most important American partners in Asia.

Workers were in the middle of cleaning up the site of an enormous chemical spill, the Bien Hoa Air Base, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio abruptly halted all foreign aid funding. The shutdown left exposed open pits of soil contaminated with dioxin, the deadly byproduct of Agent Orange, which the American military sprayed across large swaths of the country during the Vietnam War. After Rubio’s orders to stop work, the cleanup crews were forced to abandon the site, and, for weeks, all that was covering the contaminated dirt were tarps, which at one point blew off in the wind.

And even more pressing, the officials warned in a Feb. 14 letter obtained by ProPublica, Vietnam is on the verge of its rainy season, when torrential downpours are common. With enough rain, they said, soil contaminated with dioxin could flood into nearby communities, poisoning their food supplies.

Hundreds of thousands of people live around the Bien Hoa Air Base, and some of their homes abut the site’s perimeter fence, just yards from the contaminated areas. And less than 1,500 feet away is a major river that flows into Ho Chi Minh City, population 9 million.

“Simply put,” the officials added, “we are quickly heading toward an environmental and life-threatening catastrophe.”

They received no response from Washington, according to three people familiar with the situation.

Instead, Rubio and Peter Marocco, another top Trump appointee, have not only ordered the work to stop, but they also have frozen more than $1 million in payments for work already completed by the contractors the U.S. hired. The company overseeing the project is Tetra Tech, a publicly traded consulting and engineering firm based in the U.S., and a Vietnamese construction firm has been tasked with the excavation work.

Then, on Feb. 26, Rubio and Marocco canceled both companies’ contracts altogether before apparently reversing that decision about a week later, agency records show. As of Thursday, the companies had not been paid.

The Trump administration has told the courts repeatedly that its process to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which manages the project’s funds, has been careful and considered. But the botched situation at Bien Hoa is a stark example of the whiplash, conflicting messages, and dire consequences that aid organizations worldwide have faced since early February.

“Simply put, we are quickly heading toward an environmental and life-threatening catastrophe.”

Now, after losing several weeks because of the administration’s orders, the companies are scrambling — at their own expense — to secure the Bien Hoa site before it starts raining, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and several people familiar with the current situation.

The USAID officials who would typically travel to the air base to provide oversight have been placed on administrative leave or prevented from traveling to check on the work. They’ve also been forbidden from communicating with the Vietnamese government or the companies working at the base, sources say, though they believe that directive was lifted after the contracts were recently reinstated. The confusion has left many at both the embassy and in Washington in the dark about where the situation stands.

To ascertain the current status of the work, ProPublica hired a reporter to visit the air base on Friday.

Workers at Bien Hoa are laboring in 95 degree heat, surrounded by toxic soil. The site has a skeleton crew of less than half of what they previously had, according to workers and documents reviewed by ProPublica. Some staffers found new jobs during the suspension. People working at the site told the reporter they are worried about completing the work before the rainy season descends and are terrified the U.S. will pause the work again.

Since 2019, the U.S. government has collaborated with Vietnam’s Ministry of Defense to clean up the Bien Hoa Air Base and agreed to spend more than $430 million for the project. Unlike other foreign aid programs, addressing Agent Orange is more akin to restitution than charity because the U.S. brought the deadly substance there in the first place. “The dioxin remediation program is one of the core reasons why we have an extraordinary relationship with Vietnam today,” a State Department official told ProPublica, “a country that should by all rights hate us.”

With enough contaminated soil to fill about 40,000 dump trucks, the Bien Hoa Air Base is the largest deposit of postwar pesticides remaining in Vietnam after a decadeslong cleanup campaign. Human rights groups, environmentalists, and diplomats consider the cleanup work — along with disability assistance that the U.S. has provided to Agent Orange victims across the country — to be one of the most successful foreign aid initiatives of all time.

In March 2023, then-USAID Administrator Samantha Power toured Bien Hoa Air Base where the agency was working jointly with Vietnam’s Ministry of Defense to remediate contaminated soil at the largest remaining dioxin hotspot in the country.

All of that was now in peril, the officials wrote in their Feb. 14 letter to USAID officials in Washington. “What immediate actions can be taken to avert a potential life-threatening incident while still maintaining compliance with the Executive Order and the suspension directives?” the officials wrote.

U.S. officials in Vietnam grew increasingly panicked. The ambassador sent a diplomatic cable to Washington, and Congress and USAID’s inspector general each received a whistleblower complaint, multiple people told ProPublica.

“Halting a project like that in the middle of the work, that’s an environmental crime,” said Jan Haemers, CEO of another organization that previously worked in Vietnam to clean up Agent Orange in the soil. “If you stop in the middle, it’s worse than if you never started.”

The State Department said in a statement that the contracts at Bien Hoa are “active and running” but did not respond to detailed follow-up questions. Tetra Tech and the Vietnamese construction firm did not respond to questions for this story. The Vietnamese Embassy and Ministry of Defense did not return requests for comment. But the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Feb. 13 that it was “deeply concerned” about USAID program suspensions, specifically mentioning the Bien Hoa project.

The botched situation at Bien Hoa is a stark example of the whiplash, conflicting messages, and dire consequences that aid organizations worldwide have faced since early February.

Trump’s aides, including billionaire Elon Musk, began dismantling the U.S. foreign assistance system almost immediately after the inauguration. They dismissed USAID staff en masse, issued sweeping stop-work orders, froze funds, and eventually canceled most of the agency’s contracts with aid organizations around the world, leaving countless children, refugees, and other desperately vulnerable people without critical services.

On Monday, Rubio boasted on X that they had cut 83 percent of USAID’s programs because they didn’t align with Trump’s agenda.

After terminating the contracts, Rubio, Musk, and Marocco reversed several of their decisions in Vietnam, designating the Bien Hoa project as one of the few programs to survive, at least for now.

Every president since George W. Bush — including Trump — has made good on the American promise to repair relations with Vietnam by cleaning up Agent Orange and helping those sick or disabled from dioxin poisoning. In 2017, Trump landed at Danang Airport, a prior cleanup site, ahead of a free-trade meeting with Asia-Pacific countries. The U.S. now conducts $160 billion in annual commerce with Vietnam, which has also become a key partner against China’s growing influence in the South China Sea. The Pentagon and Vietnamese military now work together as well, including efforts to locate the remains of soldiers missing in action from the war 50 years ago.

“All of this is underpinned by the cooperation on Agent Orange,” said Charles Bailey, a former Ford Foundation representative in Vietnam who co-wrote a book on the country’s relations with the U.S. in the wake of the war. “It’s like pulling out one or two legs of the stool.”

“If you stop in the middle, it’s worse than if you never started.”

The Bien Hoa project was formally launched and initial contracts signed during Trump’s first presidency. In another example of the administration’s confusing stance toward the project, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told his Vietnamese counterpart on a Feb. 7 phone call that Trump wanted to enhance defense ties by addressing war legacy issues, which include Agent Orange remediation. About half of the project’s funding comes from the Pentagon’s budget, though it’s funneled through USAID, so it was also caught up in the foreign aid freeze.

Environmental consultants, foreign policy experts, and government officials said the episode in Bien Hoa shows the administration did not do a thoughtful audit. “One might imagine a less reckless government looking at what we’re doing carefully and then deciding what’s in our interest,” David Shear, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam under Barack Obama, told ProPublica.

“But,” he said, “this is government reform by meat cleaver.”

The mixture known as Agent Orange is a combination of two herbicides that the U.S. brought to Vietnam in huge volumes to kill off jungles and mangroves that hid opposition forces during the Vietnam war. The mixture contained dioxin, a deadly substance that not only causes a range of cancers and other illnesses, but is also linked to birth defects for babies exposed in utero. During the war, the U.S. sprayed more than 10 million gallons of the herbicides across vast swaths of the country, exposing U.S. soldiers as well as millions of Vietnamese people and their future children to the deadly toxic substance.

Storage sites like the air bases of Danang and Bien Hoa were heavily contaminated as barrels leaked, broke or were otherwise mishandled. Over the decades, dust has blown the contaminated soil off the bases and abundant rains have pushed the dioxin into waterways and the densely packed surrounding neighborhoods, contaminating fish as well as ducks and chicken that people raise for food. Soil samples at the Bien Hoa base have shown dioxin at levels as high as 800 times the allowed amount in Vietnam.

For decades since the war, and despite extensive documentation of higher rates of cancers and birth defects among people who had been exposed to the chemicals, the U.S. denied the mass toll Agent Orange had taken on Vietnamese people — as well as on American veterans, as ProPublica has previously reported. But starting in the mid-2000s under President George W. Bush, the U.S. began earmarking federal dollars for dioxin remediation in Vietnam to clean up the contamination sites and the two nations’ troubled relationship.

The cleanup work is dangerous and laborious. People hired by the contractors wear extensive protective equipment in the sweltering humidity and must have their blood tested regularly for dioxin. When levels get too high, they are no longer allowed to work at the site. There are supposed to be extensive safety checks in place to ensure the dirt doesn’t poison military officials or the surrounding community.

The plan at Bien Hoa is to excavate a half-million cubic meters of the most contaminated soil and enclose it underground or cook it in an enormous furnace, which hasn’t been built yet, until the dioxin no longer poses a threat. The work requires extensive pumping and management of dioxin-contaminated water. Contractors are halfway through a 10-year project set to happen in stages, and the bulk of the excavation work must be done between December and April when there is less rain.

After Rubio first issued sweeping stop-work orders to aid organizations and contractors around the world in late January, workers from the site were told to stay home for weeks. The companies stopped receiving money to cover payroll and their past invoices. Huge mounds of tarp-covered dirt dotted sections of the base.

USAID and State Department staff scrambled to get the project back online through the State Department’s confusing waiver process and appealed to counterparts in the U.S. A group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Hegseth and Rubio urging them to pay the contractors. “It would be difficult to overstate the damage to the relationship that would result if the U.S. were to walk away from these war legacy programs,” they wrote. They got no response.

Even off-season rains pushed the sites to the brink, two sources said, with water pooling up to the edge of protective aprons, threatening to spill out onto an active military runway after recent rainstorms.

One of the senators who signed the letter, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told ProPublica that abandoning the Bien Hoa cleanup is “a betrayal of the goodwill our two nations built over 30 years” and a “gift to our adversaries.”

Even off-season rains pushed the sites to the brink, two sources said, with water pooling up to the edge of protective aprons, threatening to spill out onto an active military runway after recent rainstorms.

Heavier rains typically start in April before the downpours of the rainy season in May.

The contractors are desperately trying to secure the contaminated dirt and pits before then, according to interviews this week with several people working there. But they are two months behind schedule.

“The problem is that the Trump administration has destroyed USAID, so it’s very unclear how we’re going to complete this project,” said Tim Rieser, a longtime aide to former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who led a bipartisan delegation to break ground in Bien Hoa in 2019. “The people making the decisions probably know the least.”
