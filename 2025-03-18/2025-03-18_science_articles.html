When Chia is offered a book deal in the US, she thinks it’s for her “light, funny takes on travel”, but it turns out the publisher wants her to go to the Congo to write about violence against women. Chia is a rich Nigerian immigrant, who freelances as a travel writer, and is interested in romance, restaurants, and “the comforting ordinariness” of people elsewhere. “The problem is that many of these White people don’t think we also dream,” he replies. In this moment, Chia feels seen by Chuka – she describes the “rapture of being known” – and used by the publisher, who does not care who she is. At the same time, it’s about inhabiting a global world shaped by the dominance of a particularly American imaginary, which seeks to determine who dreams, and about what, and whose inner being can possibly be known. This is Adichie’s first full-length novel since the much loved and acclaimed Americanah (2013). Before Americanah, her Nigeria-Biafra war epic Half of a Yellow Sun (2006) won the Orange Prize for women’s fiction. She has since written feminist manifestos, essays, short stories and a children’s book. She has two wildly influential TED talks: We should all be feminists (which featured in Beyoncé’s 2013 Flawless track); and The danger of a single story, used in classrooms around the world, including mine, for an accessible look at how power shapes storytelling Dream Count is told through the eyes of four women, in interconnected but discrete parts. Kadiatou came to America from Guinea on an asylum claim, works as Chia’s housekeeper, and wants a good life for her daughter. Ever the expert storyteller, Adichie works with gaps, re-evaluation, and a building sense of forewarning: Kadiatou thinks “she should have known something was wrong”. Dream Count is first and foremost about women looking for romantic love. Darnell, an African American academic, finds Chia’s neediness “boring” and squashes her pleasures. “Whenever I laid intimacies before him,” Chia explains, “he responded in detached tones, or with a breezy mockery that stung”. Chia softens the worst parts about him to her friends, and to herself, only saying in hindsight: “Do we need another name” – not love – “for this state of queasy dysphoria?” Still, Zikora gets a hard time for being insufficiently happy on her own. Child-free in her forties, full of self-love (where self means African and community love too), and developing intimacy with a woman, Omelogor is suspected of pretence. A call from a nosy aunt comes with unsolicited information on adoption centres and cutting advice: “Don’t pretend that you like the life you’re living”. When Chia is reflecting on her relationship with Darnell, the feisty Omelogor says: “You’re allowed to be victim and something else, not just victim.” Dream Count does not victim blame, but neither does it let its characters be seen through a homogenous and solely subordinated femininity. (A criminal case against Strauss-Kahn, who was indicted on charges including attempted rape and sexual abuse, was dropped in August 2011 when questions arose about Diallo’s credibility. In her author’s note, Adichie says she wanted to write a curious and human portrait not an ideological one, saying “ideology blocks different ways of seeing and art requires many eyes”. While Kadi seems almost too good, the perfect docile immigrant, we can forgive Adichie this, in what she describes as an effort to “‘write’ a wrong in the balance of stories”. Omelogor has created a “Robin Hood” account to illegally funnel money into grants for women’s small businesses; when she asks Kadi what her dream is, wanting to help, Kadiatou thinks “this question the kind of thing only idle people could conceive”. Similarly, when Kadiatou is in the news, she feels alone and misunderstood. She doesn’t see why Chia and Zikora are complaining about her being called a “maid”. The elites bicker over representation; people like Kadi want their circumstances to change. Dream Count tackles some of the same themes as Americanah – including “mutual misunderstanding between African immigrants and Black Americans” – but comes at a different time. In the intervening years, Adichie has been involved in highly publicised disagreements, especially over trans identities, and has been outspoken about the dangers of cancel culture. He agrees, for example, to go on a holiday paid for by Chia, but sulks the whole time, and icily ignores the driver who, in his view, is unnecessarily chauffeuring them around. Dream Count takes pleasure in showing the blind spots of established “diversity” talk, and centres (a word Omelogor hates!) The main characters throw around a lot of stereotypes, which are often very funny. Sometimes, the book deftly adds nuance through multiple perspectives, or offers real illumination when confronting honesty’s challenges. Other times, stereotypes go unchallenged, and we don’t quite get the “many eyes” that Adichie is aiming for. When Omelogor says, for example, that arrogance in women “is subversive, but in men it is always reactionary”, the book demonstrates an element of the “female complaint”; heterosexual relationships are doomed, but there is comfort in falling back on established roles and terms. It’s a wonderful read, in large part for its warmth. The book made me cry, laugh, think and feel shamefully seen for my own “politically correct” blunders, frustrated at times – yet still heart warmed. Where misery is described in its pages as “small and slow-dripping”, Dream Count is big, and filled mostly with a deep curiosity about other ordinary people.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Filmed in a one-take style, Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham’s new crime drama Adolescence is being hailed by critics as a technical masterpiece. Co-creator Stephen Graham stars as Jamie’s father, Eddie. These malignant forces combine to create every parent’s worst nightmare. The show’s continuous filming style offers no reprieve, and the story itself provides no easy outs – refusing to provide a simple explanation for why an intelligent boy from an “ordinary” loving family would borrow a knife from a friend and, on a casual Sunday evening, stab another child to death. While Jamie’s motives remain murky, the show makes one thing clear: today’s teens inhabit an online world that adults, however well-intentioned, are incapable of understanding if they do not listen. He subscribes to the “red pills” of incel culture, so-called truth groups and the 80/20 rule (the theory that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men, and that women only seek out men who are physically and socially desirable). While Jamie is, for the most part, an outwardly “normal” and well-adjusted teen, his explosive rage and aggrieved entitlement is revealed in a climatic scene in episode three, when he intimidates and shouts down a female psychologist (Erin Doherty). Jamie is quick to apologise when a guard intervenes. In one particularly unnerving moment, Jamie recalls his decision to ask Katie out after receiving a topless photo of her on Snapchat. “I thought she might be weak cause everyone was calling her a slag,” he says. While the sinister child-teen killer trope has been a mainstay of horror, from Child’s Play (1988) to The Exorcist (1973), Adolescence out-scares its predecessors in its unflinching portrayal of a radicalised misogynist-turned murderer. The show’s most stunning achievement is without a doubt its one-take style. Tapping into today’s true crime zeitgeist, the series renders Jamie’s story more real than it actually is by imitating the cinéma vérité style of documentary filmmaking. Each episode creates an immersive fly-on-the wall experience that is deeply compelling and uncomfortable. The lack of breaks forces viewers to feel as trapped as the characters, in an unfathomable spiral through confusion, guilt and shame. This unease is heightened when the action is shot in claustrophobic spaces, such as inside the family van or a police interrogation room. “We made him,” despairs Jamie’s mother (Manda Miller). Like Jamie’s parents, viewers must surrender to the sorrow and disbelief of never truly understanding what went wrong.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

New ones are needed to prevent it becoming a ‘wild west’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 19:07:28 <p>
Some have been successful, such as American company Firefly Aerospace landing its spacecraft Blue Ghost Mission 1 on the Moon. This was the first successful lunar landing of a privately owned spacecraft. None have been more spectacular than the repeated explosions of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starship rockets in January and March. In theory, there are a range of international laws governing these activities. However, most were established roughly half a century ago, before space was within reach of private companies eager to explore it and exploit its untapped resources. With this development, there is an urgent need to update laws governing what happens in space, in order to prevent it becoming a kind of “wild west” where tech billionaires and the companies they own can do as they please with little to no accountability, consequence or regard for the public good. But these agreements were created during the Cold War, when space exploration was shaped by military sensitivities and mainly conducted by nation states. For example, most of the roughly 11,000 active satellites orbiting Earth are privately owned. NASA now relies on partnerships with companies to combine expertise and save costs. Elon Musk has expertly tapped into this trend, securing US$22.6 billion in United States government funding for SpaceX. Private spacecraft journeys may combine commercial and national goals. For example, the Blue Ghost Mission 1 was contracted by NASA through its Commercial Lunar Payloads initiative. It carried a suite of NASA science and technology instruments. Just days later, another company put a spacecraft on the Moon. National space agencies will continue to rely on company partners in more ambitious ventures. How can private companies be held accountable if they damage the property of others, or cause environmental harm on celestial bodies? There is an increasing risk of collisions among satellites, spacecrafts and space debris. However, it only directly applies to states, not private companies. The claims pathway can be complex, slow and subject to diplomatic negotiations. Also, some satellite operators purchase insurance to cover damage from collisions, wisely bypassing the convention. But space insurance is incredibly expensive, so most satellites are not insured. But it does not specifically address the problem of accumulated space debris. Moreover, the treaty’s language is vague, requiring states to act with “due regard” for others’ interests and conduct “appropriate” consultation before undertaking potentially harmful activities. There is no internationally agreed-upon property rights regime beyond Earth. The US is trying to achieve private ownership of space resources through its 2020 “Artemis Accords”. This effort is a big boost to the privatisation of space. But only 17 countries are parties to the Moon Agreement. Without clear rules applicable to all space players, lunar exploration and mining by private entities may run into trouble. Lunar traffic and mining might cause damage to the Moon’s surface. The current space law regime does not address such hypothetical problems that may become real in coming years. This can only be achieved by building international consensus on new rules for space missions. What types of damage to the Moon should be remediated, and by who?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/first-nations-australians-are-more-likely-to-present-to-hospital-with-asthma-and-allergies-new-research-251720'>First Nations Australians are more likely to present to hospital with asthma and allergies – new research</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 19:07:14 <p>
An allergy happens when the body’s immune system mistakenly reacts to certain foods or other substances as if they were dangerous. This was followed by unspecified allergies, atopic dermatitis (or eczema) and anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction). First Nations people were more likely than other Australians to present with each of these conditions. It should be noted that asthma is not always caused by allergies, and in this study we looked at all presentations for asthma, regardless of the cause. Our study also found ED visits for allergic diseases among First Nations people increased over time. This increase may have been partly due to Australia’s Black Summer bushfires during 2019–20. Exposure to bushfire smoke significantly increases the risk of breathing problems and other health issues. The increase in asthma-related ED visits could also be linked to the severe flu season in 2019, as flu is known to trigger asthma attacks. National data shows asthma is one of the most commonly reported chronic illnesses for First Nations Australians. So it’s not entirely surprising that hospital presentations for asthma were higher among First Nations people. However, we were surprised to find First Nations people visited the ED more often for other allergic diseases. Allergies have not necessarily been recognised as an important concern among First Nations people, particularly in remote areas. Interestingly, we didn’t find any food allergy cases in our data. Australian researchers have found differences in the prevalence of food allergies among different groups, but they lacked specific data on First Nations populations. We know little about how common food allergies are in First Nations Australians. In a recent national survey, 12% of First Nations people self-reported an allergy to a food, drug, or other substance (compared to 14% in the overall population). But some cases might go unrecognised or unreported, and these data were not broken down into different types of allergies. This is the first comprehensive study, to our knowledge, that looks at asthma and allergic disease-related ED visits among both First Nations people and other Australians in an under-researched part of Australia. However, we only looked at asthma and allergic diseases treated in the ED, which doesn’t encompass all cases. For example, some people might visit other health services such as GPs when they’re having a less severe allergic episode. Ultimately, we need more research to better understand how common allergies and allergic diseases are among First Nations Australians. We don’t know exactly why there are disparities in ED presentations for allergic diseases between First Nations people and other Australians. Another reason could be limited access to specialists, especially in rural and remote First Nations communities. This can worsen asthma and allergic disease symptoms, causing patients to seek ED care instead. We’re interested in finding out more, especially whether allergies are a concern for First Nations people, and, if so, how we can support communities to develop targeted and culturally respectful strategies to address them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/politically-weakened-or-muddling-through-luxon-and-hipkins-ranked-on-their-mid-term-prospects-252483'>‘Politically weakened’ or ‘muddling through’ – Luxon and Hipkins ranked on their mid-term prospects</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 17:40:23 <p>
We’re roughly half way through this parliamentary term, and it looks as though the 2026 election could deliver “Christopher vs Chris: the sequel”. Neither leader is currently riding high, though. National’s Christopher Luxon and Labour’s Chris Hipkins are both scoring in the low 20s in the most recent preferred prime minister polls. Most voters, it seems, are ambivalent or unimpressed with them. And Luxon has been the subject of media speculation about a possible leadership change. But it pays to be cautious, especially this far from an election. Leadership is a complex mix of individual ability, career stage and political context. We can think of political leaders having a “stock” of leadership “capital” that fluctuates over time. They build up credit or authority, but they have to spend it. Former supporters can become bored, disappointed or disillusioned. Any assessment of a leader will involve some subjective judgements. But the Leadership Capital Index (LCI) was developed by three British and European political scientists as a framework for scoring leadership on a range of sliding measures. As this example using former British prime minister Tony Blair shows, the LCI accounts for a leader’s skills, support and reputation based on their performance, polling and prospects over time. I applied the LCI to Hipkins and Luxon. Ideally, this would be conducted by a panel, and more than once over a career. But readers are welcome to examine and comment below on my assessments – a virtual panel, if you like. You can see more detail about my reasoning here. The LCI’s ten factors are a mixture of the objective and subjective, adding up to an overall ranking of a leader’s political capital on a five-point scale: depleted – “lame duck” low – “politically weakened” medium – “muddling through” exceptional – “political weather maker”. Neither Luxon nor Hipkins performed very well: Luxon came out on the low-capital range looking “politically weakened”, while Hipkins was “muddling through” on medium capital. Leadership capital changes over time, and the LCI takes account of that. This assessment relates to mid-March 2025. The Leadership Capital Index I’ve given both leaders 4 out of 5 here. Both have presented clear and consistent political and policy visions. Readers who disagree will see I take some relevant issues into account in the items below. Luxon has been struggling here. His failure to give broadcaster Mike Hosking a straight answer about a cabinet sacking didn’t help, and he has been criticised for his corporate speaking style. Hipkins has performed better as a communicator (regardless of your views on his values). I’ve given Luxon 2/5 and Hipkins 4/5. Personal poll rating relative to the most recent election: (1. Very low (–15% or less), 2. Very High (15% or more).) This is an objective numerical measure based on preferred prime minister polls just before the 2023 election compared with the most recent ones. Both Luxon and Hipkins score 3/5. Longevity (time in office as prime minister): (1. less than 1 year. At March 2025, Luxon gets 2/5 and Hipkins gets 1/5. If we included time in office as party leaders, the numbers would be higher. Selection margin for party leadership: (1. Very small (less than 1%). Very large (more than 15%).) Both leaders were elected as party leader by their respective caucuses. These votes are private, but it’s known Hipkins’ selection was unanimous. I believe Luxon also won by a large margin (greater than 15%). So they both get 5/5. Party polling relative to most recent election result: (1. In early March, Labour was polling in the low 30s, up from an election result of 26.9%. So Hipkins gets 4/5. National was also polling in the low 30s, down from 38.1%. So Luxon gets 2/5. Levels of public trust: (1. Going back to a “trust” poll in early 2023 and a similar one in May that year, Luxon scored a lower trust level (37%) than Hipkins (53%). Likelihood of credible leadership challenge within next 6 months: (1. This relies on predictions, but Luxon is in greater danger than Hipkins. National’s polling is down, with some predicting a leadership change (although others acknowledge this could carry more costs than benefits). Hipkins lost the 2023 election but seems secure as Labour leader. Luxon gets 3/5 (moderate risk) and Hipkins gets 4/5 (low risk). Perceived ability to shape party’s policy platform: (1. This is subjective but not about liking or disliking the policies. Both leaders perform moderately well here on 3/5. Luxon has put his own managerial style on policymaking, notably with quarterly targets. When Jacinda Ardern resigned as prime minister, Hipkins lit a “policy bonfire” to begin afresh. But he is taking time to announce new ones. We’d expect to see improvements for both leaders closer to the election. Perceived parliamentary effectiveness: (1. Hipkins has an advantage, given his greater parliamentary experience. Luxon hasn’t dealt decisively with two attention-grabbing coalition partners, especially over ACT’s Treaty Principles Bill. Hipkins gets 4/5, Luxon 2/5. Final scores – now have your say The results add up to a ranking on the leadership capital index. Out of a possible 50, Luxon scores 28 and Hipkins 35. Neither is a great score; both careers look stalled. On the index, this defines Luxon as “politically weakened”. This could improve through better communication, sounder leadership of an ambitious team, and greater control over coalition dynamics. But Luxon’s leadership capital has never been particularly high. He didn’t enjoy a post-election “honeymoon” and may have peaked early – and low. More low polls may see National remove him, but there is also still time for his policies to pay off. The index has Hipkins “muddling through”. He needs to connect with voters, boost his reputation as a future leader (rather than election loser) and sharpen Labour’s policy platform. Hipkins’ leadership capital might have peaked in early 2023 when he became prime minister. Labour party polls are up a bit since the election, but his own preferred prime minister polling has stayed relatively low. Finally, neither leader has performed well compared with their predecessors John Key and Jacinda Ardern at their heights. But political fortunes can be unpredictable, and crises can even boost them, so the future remains unwritten. Is this assessment fair or unfair? Readers are welcome to critique my analysis and offer alternative ratings in the (moderated) comments section below.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

View of Mount Spurr on March 11 during an AVO overflight. Mount Spurr, which sits 81 miles (130 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is now releasing unusual levels of volcanic gases near its summit and from a flank vent that last erupted in 1992. Now, according to scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), it's most likely that this unrest will end in an eruption. That's an increase in risk from the observatory's last assessment in February, which gauged that Mount Spurr was equally likely to simmer down as it was to erupt. "This time period of unrest will eventually most likely end in an explosive eruption like the ones that happened in 1953 and 1992," Haney told Live Science.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/feeling-dizzy-and-nauseous-on-the-slopes-you-might-have-ski-sickness-250841'>Feeling dizzy and nauseous on the slopes? You might have ski sickness</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 13:25:36 <p>
Common symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, and in more severe cases, vomiting. Even after leaving the slopes, my dizziness and fatigue persisted for several hours. It is important to distinguish ski sickness from acute mountain sickness, a condition caused by reduced oxygen availability at high elevation, regardless of weather conditions. A weekly email in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers. Two main theories help explain the phenomenon: sensory mismatch and postural instability. The first theory suggests kinetosis results from a neural mismatch. By processing this data and comparing it with past experiences, the brain estimates the body’s position, movement, and orientation in space. If the conflict persists, it can lead to symptoms of kinetosis. The second theory suggests that repeated postural instability triggers kinetosis. However, if balance is repeatedly lost, for example when skiing or sailing, the brain may perceive these strategies as ineffective, leading to motion sickness symptoms. Although clinical research on ski sickness is limited, both theories offer valuable insights and both suggest that impaired motion perception is the root of the cause, making orientation and balance more difficult. Distorted perceptual feedback while skiing causes a mismatch between expected and actual sensory inputs, increasing the risk of kinetosis and potential loss of balance. Skiing on unpredictable terrain, such as moguls or uneven slopes, exacerbates the difficulties–especially in foggy conditions where poor visibility further distorts perception. Skiers with visual impairments (such as myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism) may be particularly susceptible to ski sickness. At the same time, repeated changes in atmospheric pressure from continuous ascents and descents can disrupt the inner ear’s perception of movement. People prone to seasickness or carsickness are more likely to suffer from ski sickness, as are individuals with a history of migraines, vertigo or inner ear disorders. External factors are also liable to worsen ski sickness symptoms. For instance, visibility conditions (terrain relief, slope steepness and obstacles) play a crucial role in helping skiers orient themselves in space and adjust their posture to maintain balance. Skiing technique too can contribute to motion sickness: gliding with minimal body movement may send mixed signals to the brain, and slaloming can make the symptoms even worse. Skiers who feel uneasy, stressed, afraid of falling, or who suffer from a fear of heights, may be more prone to symptoms. In such cases, maintaining confidence and a positive mindset is crucial. There is some speculation that alcohol consumption and smoking may worsen ski sickness, as well, by dilating blood vessels, which can interfere with inner ear function. While many remedies for kinetosis are known to help, there is no universal solution. Ski sickness can be alleviated through improved proprioception, also known as “sensory cueing”. Vision correction, addressing myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism with prescription glasses or contact lenses can enhance depth perception, while specialized ski goggle lenses can improve terrain visibility in foggy conditions. Somatosensory perception (awareness of body movements) can be improved with acupressure wristbands, similar to those used for other forms of kinetosis, which help enhance proprioception. While few solutions exist for vestibular motion perception (inner ear balance), research suggests that bone-conductive vibration to the inner ear can slow the onset of other types of motion sickness. Some people may turn to medication for symptom management. Vestibular suppressants, such as scopolamine, can help reduce inner ear dizziness and migraines. Additionally, antihistamines like dimenhydrinate and cinnarizine may alleviate nausea but can cause side effects such as drowsiness or blurred vision.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Current discussions of climate change often vilify carbon, but the element is the very basis of life on Earth, says Paul Hawken. And we are the only species on Earth that disrupts the natural flow of carbon, says environmentalist and author Paul Hawken . Hawken's new book, "Carbon: The Book of Life" (Viking, 2025), shines a spotlight on the countless flows of carbon that power life, from individual cells to vast underground fungal networks and entire human societies. Related: Bear hair and fish weirs: Meet the Indigenous people combining modern science with ancestral principles to protect the land Q: "Carbon" is about showing that carbon is not just a problem we need to neutralize, but also a vital force that flows through every living being and Earth system. How does this encourage us to think differently about climate change? Hawken: The narrative [around global warming] is really screwed up, frankly, because it has objectified carbon, the atmosphere, climate change, etcetera. It's the same mindset that caused the problem: We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends. When people say we're going to "fix" the climate, or "tackle" or "combat" climate change, to me it's just so emblematic of this profound disconnection between self and other. [I want] to go to a place that's not just insular and about self, but actually [gives rise to] a sense of being in the world that can create a sensibility that forms community. Because all of life as we know it exists in a community. Paul Hawken is an author, environmentalist and entrepreneur. Q: I found the book very uplifting and hopeful. How do you find the drive to write about the climate when everything we hear from scientists is so bleak? Rather than going to the trouble and staying with that, I'm looking for a conversation that makes sense. We objectify the living world and see ourselves as distinct and separate from a world that we can exploit, extract from and use to our own ends." I'm not a physicist, but I can tell you that "net zero" does not exist in terms of carbon. If you look at the proposals to really shift away from fossil fuels, what we're talking about is renewable energies to energize an economy that's skyrocketing in consumption, which is destruction. Renewable energy doesn't really take a step back to ask: "Energizing yes, but what?" I began to look at the food system and what was being sold, what was being promoted. That goes back to carbon, because if you look at a healthy agricultural system, it's full of carbon. Spaceship Earth is a concept that encourages us to think of the planet as a closed system with limited resources. Hawken: Earth is so big, we don't even understand our own cities. There's no spatial limit — it's more about the system, its inputs and outputs. It's just to bring it down to a scale where people can understand what happens on Earth without being a scientist. Q: The central message in "Carbon" is that we need to reconnect with the world around us to shape a better future than what we're currently headed for. One of your previous books is called " Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation " (Penguin, 2021) — and I was wondering what regeneration means to you. How do we end the climate crisis? It means that your life, your being, your presence here is about creating more life — not in the sense of making children, but in every sense of life. That means you start thinking about consumption, about what to buy and what you take, and the implications of that.

Historical and archaeological information suggests that a range of people worked as miners, including both paid laborers and people who were enslaved. Related: Shackled skeleton may be first direct evidence of slavery in Roman Britain The Ghozza mine complex included a village with residential areas, streets and baths. Some received wages for their work, which involved processing natural ore with handheld grinding stones. "We thought that the work of the miners must have included free people, as we found no guarded dormitories at Ghozza," Redon said. Iron shackles being excavated at the Ghozza mine in Egypt.

Measurements of this rate, known as the Hubble constant, have produced conflicting results. But those results, announced March 18 in a webinar, only affirmed that model. “If you’d asked me to put a bet beforehand, I would have maybe put even money on seeing something new,” says cosmologist Colin Hill of Columbia University, a member of the telescope team. While previous telescopes mapped temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, indicating where matter was starting to clump together and foreshadowing the universe’s present-day structure, polarization maps put those clumps in motion. “It gives us a much firmer prediction for what should happen in the next 13 billion years afterwards.” This tiny portion of the cosmic microwave background, created by combining new data from ACT and previous data from the Planck satellite, shows minuscule temperature variations in the very early universe (blue is cooler, red is warmer). The black lines are used to work out how much of two types of polarization there is at any spot in the sky. It’s 13.77 billion years old and comprises 5 percent ordinary matter, 25 percent dark matter — which exerts gravitational attraction but otherwise doesn’t interact with regular matter — and 70 percent dark energy, a mysterious force pushing the universe to expand at an ever-accelerating rate. But it disagrees with estimates based on closer objects, such as supernovas and the bright hearts of galaxies known as quasars, which have suggested a rate around 73 km/s/Mpc. Looking for a solution, the researchers examined several possible deviations from the standard model such as new particles, new interactions between dark matter and regular matter or itself, variations in fundamental constants or extra dark energy in the early universe. “It just blew me away that we didn’t see even, like, a hint of one of these new physics extensions,” Hill says. Other cosmologists may not have had such optimism about finding new physics, says physicist Daniel Scolnic of Duke University, who was not involved in the new work. “I think people expected that ACT wouldn’t see anything. The Simons Observatory, an even more sensitive telescope in Chile, started taking data in late February, which might find hidden deviations from the standard model. “It could be the case that in a few years we will get some detection of new physics,” Hill says. Progress could also come from relaxing some of the standard model’s assumptions. Scientists have assumed, for example, that dark energy’s density has remained constant. “If they confirm that at high significance, then we would really need to revisit a lot of our investigations,” Hill says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A comparison of Okjökull, a glacier atop Ok volcano, before and after it was declared dead Which satellites took the photos? Two satellite photos taken 33 years apart show the disappearance of a glacier in Iceland that was the first ice mass to be declared dead as a result of human-caused climate change . Okjökull was a dome-shaped glacier situated around the summit crater on Ok (pronounced Auk), a 3,940-foot-tall (1,200 meters) shield volcano located 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Reykjavík. (The name Okjökull translates to "Ok glacier" in Icelandic.) The glacier was declared dead in 2014, when Icelandic glaciologists revealed that the ice had become so thin that it was no longer being slowly pulled down the mountain by gravity, meaning it had stopped moving for the first time in tens of thousands of years, according to a 2024 paper summarizing Okjökull's demise. The glacier's death was showcased and explored in a 2018 short film titled " Not Ok ," which was made by researchers from Rice University in Texas. Related: See all the best images of Earth from space This 2003 photo shows Okjökull as it begins to fracture and break apart. Just over 10 years later, researchers determined that it was no longer a proper glacier.

The ancestors of all modern humans split off from a mystery population 1.5 million years ago and then reconnected with them 300,000 years ago, a new genetic model suggests. The unknown population contributed 20% of our DNA and may have boosted humans' brain function. "The fact that we can reconstruct events from hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago just by looking at DNA today is astonishing, and it tells us that our history is far richer and more complex than we imagined," study co-author Aylwyn Scally , a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement . In a study published Tuesday (March 18) in the journal Nature Genetics , researchers presented a new method of modeling genomic data, called "cobraa," that has allowed them to trace the evolution of modern humans ( Homo sapiens ). By applying their new method to modern human DNA data published in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project, the researchers discovered that there were two main ancestral groups that split around 1.5 million years ago, which they called Population A and Population B. Related: Human ancestors arrived in Western Europe much earlier than previously thought, fossil face fragments reveal Some of the genes from Population B, "particularly those related to brain function and neural processing, may have played a crucial role in human evolution," study co-author Trevor Cousins , a postgraduate student in genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. In general, the genetic material from Population B reduced the ability of individuals to have children, Cousins told Live Science in an email, but "the genome is a complicated place, and regions outside of genes can still do important things." The new model suggests that, around 300,000 years ago, Population A, which eventually gave rise to humans, had "deep structure," Cousins said, meaning it was formed from "two or more genetically distinct populations that mixed with each other." But "the genetic model cannot indicate which fossils should be assigned to Population A or B," Cousins said. Some experts use the term "ghost populations" to talk about groups that branched off and then reconnected later through interbreeding resulting in gene flow, John Hawks , a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, told Live Science by email. "It is not 'ghost populations' contributing to one particular group, it is one big ghost that merged in with the African source population for all modern humans."

Peter Dutton, when he gets on his favoured ground of security, too often goes for the quick hit, and frequently over-reaches. As Dutton knows very well – and to his advantage in that case – referendums don’t succeed without bipartisan support, and this one certainly wouldn’t get backing from a Labor opposition. Although this focus on booting people out of the country sounds Trumpian, it has long been a preoccupation of Dutton’s – something he pushed in the Coalition years. Hence his talk of attempted constitutional change if the objective can’t be achieved by legislation. He told Seven, “I want to keep our country safe […] it’s the first responsibility of any prime minister, and at the moment we’ve got people in our country who hate our country, who want to cause terrorist attacks. My argument is that if you betray your allegiance to our country in that way, you should expect to lose your citizenship.” I think there are a lot of Australians at the moment who are worried about the rise of antisemitism and what we’ve seen in our country, and elsewhere, which just doesn’t reflect the values that we’ve fought for over many generations.” On Tuesday Dutton’s senior colleagues Michaelia Cash, who is shadow attorney-general, and Angus Taylor sounded less then enthusiastic about the move. It gives the impression of a leader who comes up with extreme proposals. If he is suggesting this today, what will be think of tomorrow? More to the point, what might he suddenly propose when in government? This close to an election, Dutton needs to give voters the feeling he is predictable, that they know him, not that he produces ideas out of left field (or right field, in this case).</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sydney-koalas-chlamydia-at-risk'>Some of Sydney’s koalas are chlamydia-free, but still at risk</a></h2><b>Source:</b> sciencenews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 09:00:00 <p>
To investigate further, the researchers caught 111 wild koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) from seven sites across the forested region south of Sydney and collected ear tissue before releasing them. That same isolation may be why these sites are also among the few neighborhoods in New South Wales without reported infections of the bacteria Chlamydia. The sexually transmitted pathogen has decimated koala populations across Australia, leading to infertility, blindness and death. In at least one Queensland population, chlamydia accounted for 18 percent of koala deaths between 2013 and 2017, and some populations have a chlamydia prevalence of around 100 percent. Southwestern Sydney is one of the few chlamydia-free areas in New South Wales. But its isolation also makes its koalas evolutionarily vulnerable, with less variation in their genetic tool kit for adapting to new threats, including bacteria like chlamydia. And the marsupials’ resilience may be tested sooner rather than later. If the koalas are mating, they’re swapping not only genes but also bacteria. Such crossbreeding might increase genetic diversity, but it could cause a potentially catastrophic outbreak of chlamydia. “Usually the quickest way to inject new diversity is by bringing in individuals from another population or structuring environments in a way to ensure that different populations are connected and don’t become geographically isolated — like building corridors,” says Chloé Schmidt, an evolutionary ecologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Rebecca Taylor, a conservation genomicist with Environment and Climate Change Canada in Ottawa, says an alternative solution would be selectively moving uninfected animals from other populations into the chlamydia-free areas to safely boost genetic diversity. The study researchers see this as something of an intractable catch-22. “The population is large, so introducing new genetic diversity and having it taken up into the population is complex and difficult to achieve,” says Hogg, adding that being pinched between urban isolation and disease threats is not unique to koalas. “This conundrum is found all over the world where urban areas are growing.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/theft-daydreaming-and-everything-in-between-most-of-us-are-a-bit-deviant-at-work-247936'>Theft, daydreaming and everything in between: most of us are a bit ‘deviant’ at work</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 08:29:50 <p>
We usually think of workplace deviance as linked to “bad apples”–the troublemakers who egregiously slack off, steal from the company or openly clash with coworkers. But what if deviant behaviour was also more subtle–daydreaming, taking long coffee breaks or cracking an edgy joke in a meeting? Traditionally, research has kept deviance in neat boxes: bad behaviours are either interpersonal (aimed at coworkers) or organisational (targeted against the company). Instead, many show a mix of minor, less disruptive behaviours that don’t seem to fit the bad-apple narrative. We then conducted a second study with 553 participants that found similar evidence, and showed how behaviours linked to these classes related to job satisfaction, turnover intentions and other work outcomes. They avoid tasks, work slowly, take long breaks and are often rude to coworkers. Disengaged but not overtly harmful, these employees daydream and occasionally show up late without causing obvious disruptions. These workers can stifle efforts at organisational change and slowly erode a positive culture. Members of this group avoid most deviant behaviour and are generally good citizens at work. Even if this percentage is inflated–social desirability bias, or the inclination people have to present themselves well, may have affected study participants’ willingness to admit every act of deviance–its relatively modest size is still telling: a vast majority of workers in our sample say they are misbehaving in some way. Our data show that workplace deviance isn’t always about major rule-breaking; in fact, it rarely is! While serious actions like theft (e.g., stealing property or falsifying a receipt) and overt aggression are rare, smaller things like daydreaming, taking extra breaks and making snarky remarks happen rather frequently. These mundane forms of deviance can be written off because they fail to evoke visceral reactions from managers or peers. But they can also add up, eroding positive cultures in ways that aren’t seen until a major event occurs. People often act out at work because they feel wronged by a person or situation, or because they have deeper motivations, linked to their personality traits, that are more conducive to deviance. Having an abusive supervisor makes it more likely that employees will be members of the “elevated deviant” class, whereas experiencing ostracism makes membership in the “stagnant worker” class more likely. Looking beyond the work environment, we also found that certain personality traits can predict what type of “deviant” a worker is most likely to be. Interestingly, while conscientiousness was predictive of belonging to the “minimal deviant” class, our data suggest that highly conscientious people do occasionally act out, usually with a mix of withdrawal and rudeness (like the “slacking jerks”). In short, highly conscientious people have high expectations for their own and others’ work, and they may sometimes react to stress or slights in ways that make their unmet expectations known. Yet, while our findings support the idea of a “bad apple” dragging down an entire team, deviance and its effects can be more complicated in some cases. Consider the relatively mild deviance classes of “stagnant workers” and “withdrawn workers”, whose members express relatively high intentions to quit and, accordingly, perform lower than those of other classes. These employees may fly under the radar while silently eroding an organisation’s potential. Many don’t just dabble in one or two types of deviance, but exhibit complex patterns in their behaviour at work that can be reliably predicted by personality-based factors and situational attributes. Our findings also challenge the belief that rule-breaking is driven by a few “bad apples” intent on causing trouble, and contribute to a growing line of inquiry that shifts from asking merely “who acts out at work?” to “why do people engage in these behaviours?” For many employees, minor slip-ups are likely less about causing harm and more about coping with everyday stress. For instance, some workers who are withdrawn might be stepping back quietly to deal with health issues, while others stepping back may be evincing a low level of commitment. While deviance has traditionally been viewed as something rare, our study shows a more complicated picture. This helps us understand deviance as a more common part of work life. Without levers that help employees reduce stress or make up for uncontrollable work factors (such as company-wide salary freezes), managers may feel pressure to accept some forms of deviance as “the cost of doing business” while remaining vigilant toward the most egregious and overt infractions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Read more: Putin mulls over US-Ukrainian ceasefire proposal – but the initial signs aren't positive This weakens the US’ leverage in negotiations, and by extension that of its allies too. Trump’s diplomatic overtures, unaccompanied by credible enforcement mechanisms, project weakness rather than pragmatism. His administration downplayed Russia’s threat at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, shocking European leaders. US disengagement has now pushed the continent toward urgently building an independent defence strategy, potentially weakening Nato cohesion. This follows a classic Russian negotiating tactic of prolonging talks while making unrealistic demands. In Saudi Arabia, these included keeping occupied Ukrainian territories, limiting Ukraine’s military capabilities, and forbidding foreign peacekeepers. Trump’s miscalculations therefore leave Russia free to continue its offensive in the knowledge that US pressure on Ukraine will weaken any resistance. If Trump hands Putin a win, Beijing may feel emboldened to escalate its military efforts in Taiwan and the South China Sea. A recent poll found that over half of Americans believe Trump is too close to Russia. His willingness to publicly signal diplomatic compromises, such as preventing Ukraine from joining Nato, reveals a weak negotiating style that undermines US credibility on the global stage. Trump’s approach echoes his past diplomatic missteps, which some have described as “cowboy diplomacy” – a strategy that prioritises personal deal-making over structured policy, ultimately leading to strategic blunders. Far from strengthening US leverage, his premature openness about concessions gives Putin room to dictate the terms of engagement. History clearly shows that Russia only respects power, not appeasement, yet Trump’s diplomacy appears to offer unilateral concessions with little strategic gain.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When a ceasefire in the war between Hamas and Israel finally came into effect on January 19, the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. However, that ceasefire agreement, and its associated negotiations, have now been cast aside by new Israeli attacks on Gaza. A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the strikes came after Hamas’ “repeated refusals” to “release our hostages”, and the group’s rejection of all proposals presented by US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Even though they have standing armies that might not need to regroup and rearm in the same way, states can use this time to manoeuvre in the international arena – a space largely denied to non-state actors. Trump’s rise to power in the US has seemingly given the Israeli government carte blanche to proceed in ways that were arguably off limits to previous US presidents who were also largely supportive of Israel’s actions. This plan was raised earlier in the war by Trump advisor Jared Kushner and Israeli officials as a supposed humanitarian initiative. On the face of it, this plan would be a war crime. But even if it is never fully implemented, the fact it is being promoted by Trump after many years of domestic Israeli and international opprobrium shows how political ideas once thought unacceptable can take on a life of their own. Israel has also used the ceasefire to pursue larger political and military goals in Gaza, the West Bank, southern Lebanon and Syria. Even though the ceasefire did reduce overall levels of violence in Gaza, Israel has continued to carry out attacks on targets in the strip. And though nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners were released during the ceasefire, Israel was holding more than 9,600 Palestinians in detention on “security grounds” at the end of 2024. Thousands more Palestinians are being held by Israel in administrative detention, which means without trial or charge. On the military front, the ceasefire arguably alleviated some pressure on Israel, giving it time to consolidate its territorial and security gains against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and in Syria. Israel has instead proposed establishing a buffer zone on Lebanese territory and has begun destroying villages, uprooting olive trees and building semi-permanent outposts along the border. In a speech in February, Netanyahu also demanded the “complete demilitarisation of southern Syria” following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. And Defence Minister Israel Katz said this month Israel would keep its troops in southern Syria to “protect” residents from any threats from the new Syrian regime. While Palestinians are known for their sumud – usually translated as steadfastness or tenacity – there is a limit to what humans can endure. There is a general assumption that ceasefires are positive and humanitarian in nature. Instead, it has turned out to be part of the problem.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In a Tuesday speech framing the budget Chalmers said, “it will be a responsible budget which helps with the cost of living, builds our future, and makes our economy more resilient in the new world of global uncertainty”. He said the budget would have five major priorities: helping the recovery and rebuild following Cyclone Alfred, for which it will provide $1.2 billion He was also put on the spot about his future leadership ambitions, initially being asked whether, given federal Labor’s poor showing in Queensland, it would do better with a leader from that state. After diverting the question with a joke and a vigorous defence of Anthony Albanese’s “practical pragmatism” and his appreciation of Queensland, he was asked directly, “So you don’t have aspirations to become leader one day yourself?” “No”, he replied. Chalmers is lowering expectations of extensive new initiatives being announced next Tuesday, because big spending measures in health, education and infrastructure have been announced. The deficit was forecast to increase further next year to $46.9 billion, compared with $42.8 billion forecast in last year’s budget. Chalmers sought to scotch incorrect predictions he said had been made. “For example, some commentators have made wild and wide-of-the-mark predictions about big surges in revenue. "Some wrongly predict the tax-to-GDP ratio will go up this year, when Treasury expects it to be stable or even a bit down. "Revenue upgrades have actually come off very significantly since the highs of October 2022.” The OECD cut its forecasts for GDP growth to just 1.8% in 2026, down from an earlier forecast of 2.5%. “Treasury estimates the direct hit to GDP from steel and aluminium tariffs would be less than 0.02 per cent by 2030.

On Monday, an ABC’s Four Corners investigation reported shocking cases of abuse and neglect in Australian childcare centres. This included examples of children being sexually abused, restrained for hours in high chairs, and fed nutritionally substandard meals such as pasta with ketchup. While acknowledging there are high-quality services operating in the community, the program also showed how centre-based childcare is big business, dominated by for-profit providers, who may not be meeting regulatory standards. This compares with 7% of not-for-profit centres not meeting minimum standards. Inquiries suggest this divergence is due to staffing levels, qualifications and pay. Large for-profit providers have a higher proportion of part-time and casual staff than not-for-profits. On top of this, they are more likely to use award rates of pay, which are typically lower than enterprise agreement rates. Despite this, the federal government continues to support for-profit services through childcare subsidies. These subsidies are designed to help families with the costs of childcare. But they do not stop some providers increasing their fees. This aimed to support women’s workforce participation through an expanded, high-quality childcare sector. In these ways, Commonwealth funding positioned childcare as a public good, like school education. Then, in 1991, federal government subsidies were extended to for-profit providers. This prompted dramatic changes in the childcare landscape, leading to a dominance of for-profit centres. Today, more than 70% of all long day-care centres are operated by private providers. Many have disproportionately high numbers of staffing waivers, granted by regulators, permitting them to operate centres without the required number of qualified staff. According to unpublished research by Gabrielle Meagher, as of October 2024, 11 large for-profit providers held waivers for a quarter or more of their services and five held waivers for more than a third. So there are extra incentives to cut costs and maximise profits. The dominance of for-profit providers also makes them powerful players in policy-making circles, as governments depend on them to provide an essential service. Services are notified about upcoming inspections, potentially giving them time to give a false impression of their quality and safety standards. As Four Corners highlighted, poor-quality services, with bad pay and working conditions are driving good educators away from the sector. The Albanese government recently passed legislation to “guarantee” eligible families three days of subsidised childcare per week from January 2026. They also require a guarantee this childcare will be high-quality and keep children safe. Even without the extra spending on the three-day guarantee, government spending on childcare subsidies is due to reach nearly A$15 billion by 2026–27. But we do not need this level of inquiry to tell us the current system needs fundamental change. Stronger regulatory powers, while important, will not be enough on their own.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

So we held out for a long time to try and push Labor to improve its offering on public housing [and] on housing spending and we achieved some real wins there. We will fight hard for the things that matter. We will push very hard on those core issues of a better health system, putting dental into Medicare. We pushed very hard on that in the last time there was a minority government and won it for kids. However, Pocock stresses that keeping Peter Dutton out of government remains a key focus: We are very focused on preventing a Dutton Coalition government, because everything we hear from that stable sends a shiver down my spine. In that last year of the Morrison government, we saw a spend of $20 billion on consulting and labour hire and a hollowing out in the public sector. And we also need to remember that a very significant number – something like two-thirds of our public service, federal public service – actually live outside Canberra. If we go right back to 1856 when Australia led the world on reducing working hours, and the eight-hour day, now we were the first to adopt that internationally for stonemasons in Melbourne. We’d certainly like to see a wide range of pilots, diverse experimentation, real change, working with those who are ready for it, who are up for it, but making sure we collect the evidence and then move over time towards a national test case, which is the way in which over decades we have slowly ratcheted back the length of the working week.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/renewables-are-cheap-so-why-isnt-your-power-bill-falling-252391'>Renewables are cheap. So why isn’t your power bill falling?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 05:48:51 <p>
Power prices are set to go up again even though renewables now account for 40% of the electricity in Australia’s main grid – close to quadruple the clean power we had just 15 years ago. How can that be, given renewables are the cheapest form of newly built power generation? As Australia heads for a federal election campaign likely to focus on the rising cost of living, many of us are wondering when, exactly, cheap renewables will bring cheap power. While solar and wind farms produce power at remarkably low cost, they need to be built where it’s sunny or windy. Our existing transmission lines link gas and coal power stations to cities. Notably, Victoria’s mooted price increase of 0.7% was much lower than other states, which would be as high as 8.9% in parts of New South Wales. Because Victoria can draw cheap wind from South Australia, hydroelectricity from Tasmania or coal power from New South Wales through a good transmission line network, it has kept wholesale prices the lowest in the national energy market since 2020. And the Coalition’s nuclear plan would be both very expensive and arrive sometime in the 2040s, far too late to help. Renewables are cheap, building a better grid is not During clear sunny days, the National Energy Market can get so much solar that power prices actually turn negative. Similarly, long windy periods can drive down power prices. If it’s not windy on land, there will always be wind at sea. These are expensive and cost blowouts have become common. In some areas, strong objections from rural residents are adding years of delay and extra cost. So while the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, we have underestimated the cost of getting this power to markets as well as ensuring the power can be “firmed”. Firming is when electricity from variable renewable sources is turned into a commodity able to be turned on or off as needed and is generally done by storing power in pumped hydro schemes or in grid-scale batteries. At both federal and state levels, Labor ministers have made an error in claiming renewables would directly translate to lower power prices. Gas is so expensive as to be a last resort. If an extreme weather event takes out one transmission line, power can still flow from others. Until now, storing electricity at scale for later use hasn’t been possible. That means grid operators have to constantly match supply and demand. To cope with peak demand, such as a heatwave over summer, we have very expensive gas peaking plants which sit idle nearly all the time. Solar has only made the challenge harder, as we get floods of solar at peak times and nothing in the evening when we use most of our power. Our coal plants do not deal well with being turned off and on to accommodate solar floods. We will never see power “too cheap to meter”, as advocates once said of the nuclear industry. But over time, we should see price rises ease. For our leaders and energy authorities, this is a tricky time. They must ensure our large-scale transmission line interconnectors actually get built, juggle the flood of renewables, ensure storage comes online, manage the exit of coal plants and try not to affect power prices.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On April 2 the United States is set to implement a new wave of tariffs under its Fair and Reciprocal Trade Plan. Details of the plan that will impact all US trading partners are not yet known, but the US administration has suggested these tariffs will target any rules it considers “unfair”. This means the April 2 tariffs may take aim at a range of Australian domestic policies, such as biosecurity rules that govern food imports, and the government’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). But it will apply to a much larger set of exports. Read more: With Australian steel and aluminium set to incur US tariffs, global uncertainty will be our next challenge Australia and the US have been allies for over a century. The agreement was negotiated in good faith, and entered into force on January 1, 2005. It called for the elimination of tariffs between the two nations over time, and until now both parties have upheld their respective bargains. The Trump reference to non-tariff barriers raises two main concerns for Australian products: meat and pharmaceuticals. In Australia, domestic beef products are subject to strict traceability rules. This was also raised by the Biden administration in a 2024 report on trade barriers. The US cannot force Australia to change its laws on the basis of tariffs – but they can make products coming from Australian suppliers more expensive and therefore restrict market access to the US, which many Australian producers rely on. A tariff on Australian-sourced beef products would also push up prices for American consumers. Trade Minister Don Farrell has warned the price of a McDonald’s burger may increase. The PBS, which has been in place since 1948, ensures Australians have affordable access to essential medicines. It formed part of discussions during the free-trade negotiations and has been raised as a potential barrier to trade. The US argues innovation and unfettered market access for American drug companies should be prioritised over Australia’s reference pricing arrangements. The reason the US has a problem with this scheme is because some of their companies are not able to charge higher prices for medicines. Although these are the categories of most concern, there is no assurance the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” will be limited to beef and pharmaceuticals. For instance, there are no barriers imposed on the import of wine into Australia. But there has been some concern tariffs could be introduced regardless. As Australian wine makers have only recently recovered from Chinese and Canadian tariffs, any US tariffs would deal a harsh blow to the industry. An old clip of the former Republican President Ronald Reagan went viral this week, highlighting his quite different view: Trade negotiations, and international agreements, are largely based on goodwill. But if the correction turns into a crash, it may give President Trump pause.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This means the price will drop for the more than 100,000 Australian women who currently use it – from around $A320 a year to around $94. But these two are combined oral contraceptives – meaning they contain both the hormones oestrogen and progestogen – whereas Slinda is progestogen-only. Oral contraceptive pills contain active ingredients based on the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone to prevent pregnancy. Mini-pills, including Slinda, can be 99% effective if used perfectly – but with typical day-to-day use, they provide only around 93% protection. Slinda may be a particularly beneficial alternative for people who can’t use contraceptives containing oestrogen. This may include women who are older, overweight, or prone to migraines. This is because oestrogen is known to increase the risk of blood clots which lead to deep vein thrombosis – already a higher risk for older and overweight women. Similarly, combined pills containing oestrogen aren’t appropriate for those who’ve had a baby in the last 21 days or are breastfeeding. Lower levels of oestrogen are needed in a woman’s body post-birth as it stimulates prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. Slinda can be taken at any time after childbirth, including while breastfeeding, and generally remains a safer option for people with a history of blood clots or migraines. Slinda also has advantages over other, older generations of progestogen-based contraceptive pills. Mini-pills such as Microlut and Noriday have no pill-free days, whichs means if a woman misses taking the pill by even a few hours it can increase her chance of becoming pregnant. The potential side effects for Slinda are similar to other contraceptive pills. It is not currently recommended for those with breast cancer, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or severe liver disease, in line with recommendations for all mini-pills. The pill may also not work effectively if it’s not taken correctly every day, or if it is taken with other drugs, such as the anti-viral ritonavir and anti-seizure medication phenytoin. If a woman is suffering from vomiting or severe diarrhoea, Slinda may not be effective and she should use back-up contraception such as condoms. There are other progesterone-only contraceptive options available on the PBS, such as levonorgestrel pills and implants, including the intrauterine devices, Mirena and Kyleena. The committee cited several reasons, including advice from doctors, the need to provide women with more contraceptive options and Slinda’s longer pill-free window. They highlighted women starting an oral contraceptive pill for the first time will often first use PBS-subsidised medications, even though a non-PBS product may be more suitable for them. Slinda’s listing makes it a more accessible first choice for women. As Slinda is a prescription-only medication, if you wish to change pills or start on the drug you will need to consult your doctor.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Greens, who could control crucial cross bench votes in a hung parliament, have announced plans for a four-day working week, with no loss of pay. Earning the same money for fewer hours would appeal to most workers. Or does research suggest the Greens could be onto something? According to Greens Senator Barbara Pocock, it’s a win-win for everyone: This change will allow workers to create a working week that works for them. Recent research conducted by Swinburne University of Technology involved interviews with ten Australian firms that have already adopted the 100:80:100 model. Workers reported having better work-life balance, more time to complete “life administration” tasks, and more time to invest in hobbies, exercise, wellness and self-care. However, the 100:80:100 model is viewed with scepticism in some quarters. There is still doubt that productivity and output would be maintained, or in some cases improved, when workers are working one day fewer per week. Also, there could be costs associated with the implementation of this work model for front-line roles, such as retail, schools, hospitals and nursing homes. This was at a time when the average life expectancy of Australian workers was just 55 and households typically only had one bread-winner. More women and carers are either in the workforce or would be encouraged into the workforce by more flexible arrangements: yet we are constrained by archaic labour laws that see the fruits of our efforts swallowed up in profits for bosses and shareholders. Separate Swinburne research has revealed an increasing expectation among workers that they will receive a share in the time saved by future technologies in the form of improved work-life balance and wellbeing gains. Earlier this year, 200 UK companies signed up to the 100:80:100 model, as part of a campaign to “reinvent Britain’s working week”. Large scale trials are also underway in Canada and several European countries. The global interest in a shorter working week is not surprising, and has likely been fuelled by the COVID pandemic, which has caused workers and employers to re-imagine their working lives. If the Greens are in a position to leverage any balance of power after the coming election, it could be Australia’s turn to recognise the conventional five-day working week is no longer fit for purpose.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The 72 hours after the sexual assault of a child can be a crucial window for police to collect biological evidence and document signs of bruising or injury. But this procedure – known as a forensic medical examination – can be scary and invasive. In new research published with colleagues, I interviewed ten children (aged 4-16) and their parents about their experiences attending a Melbourne paediatric hospital in the hours after an alleged assault. This was a small group, but their stories shed light on wider concerns. Addressing them can help put children first in what may be the most traumatic time of their lives. Its purpose is to gather biological evidence from the victim to help police identify an offender and prosecute them. The doctor swabs relevant areas – such as the child’s vulva, vagina or anus – to collect biological materials that may be present, including saliva or semen. They will also look for injuries or bruising. A decade ago, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard from survivors the importance of trauma-informed responses. A trauma-informed approach means prioritising a sense of safety for children who have experienced trauma, building trust and sharing control, to avoid retraumatisation. This means explaining to children and their carers what is going to happen next, gaining their consent and giving them some control over the timing and pace of any interventions (such as being swabbed). So considering a child’s personal history and culture is important. However there is still little research examining children and young people’s experience of crisis care. The interviews uncovered four areas that were important to children and their parents. Some said repeating their story felt like they had to convince professionals it was true. Several young participants discussed feeling “traumatised,” “intimidated” and “ashamed” during the examination itself. Seven-year-old Sasha told us about the doctor who examined her: One parent, Kaye, felt the clinician “had this incredible demeanour and heart about her” and helped her child “understand what was going to happen.” Other young people appreciated the clinician helped them with panic attacks and “made us feel relaxed.” Examination spaces need to be kept forensically clean. In the hospital where these examinations took place, that meant there were no windows, pictures on the walls or soft furnishings. Several young participants felt it showed what had happened to them was somehow shameful. […] You’re just walking down a really long corridor, all these white […] ceilings and walls. Parents often felt sidelined or unheard before, during and after the examination. Samira (a parent) said she didn’t feel like her concerns were understood: […] I feel like she should be able to have that support too. One parent said they’d been “sent home without any support”. Another had a sense of being “just left there and wondering what to do”. The children and adults I interviewed made clear they wanted a holistic approach. The response needs to make children and their families feel safer – not more scared. It also needs to help them recover from the trauma, including counselling for both parents and children without long waitlists. The National Sexual Assault, Family and Domestic Violence Counselling Line – 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) – is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for any Australian who has experienced, or is at risk of, family and domestic violence and/or sexual assault.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This new production treats women with empathy</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 00:59:59 <p>
The Removalists was first performed in 1971 at La Mama Theatre, Carlton, by the Australian Performing Group, an ensemble of young graduates, artists and friends. A crooked cop, an easily corruptible young constable, a boozy husband and father who beats his wife and demands his dinner, and a removalist who sees no evil, does no evil. Young constable Neville Ross (William McKenna) is being inducted into the force by a bitter, manipulative, rule-bending sergeant, Dan Simmons (played with menace by the moustachioed Steve Mouzakis). When middle class sisters Kate (Jessica Clarke) and Fiona (Eloise Mignon) enter to report domestic violence, Simmonds asks invasive questions about Fiona’s relationship to her beer-swilling loudmouth husband Kenny (Michael Whalley). In an excruciating moment, Kate stands by watching while Simmonds asks Fiona to show him the bruises on her back and upper thigh. Under Sarks’ direction, it is a moment filled with empathy. The action shifts in act two to Fiona’s place. Expecting Kenny to be out drinking, Simmonds – who is expecting sexual favours from Kate – and Ross arrive to help Fiona move into her new flat. But Kenny is home, and sprays a string of obscenities at the policemen. Simmonds cuffs him – and lands a few quiet punches. Clever balancing of humour and social commentary is the key to Williamson’s critique of the law in relation to violence against women. Kenny wears a pair of footy shorts and a t-shirt, Blundstone boots and short black socks, evoking the unoffical uniform of the ocker male Australian. In a novel touch, Dale Ferguson’s set adds rows of onstage seating for those who would like a much closer view of the action. Just as playwright Williamson targeted a conservative macho ocker culture in the early 1970s, this revival can be understood as its contemporary counterpart. Sarks accords the female characters more dignity and independence than earlier versions. They deliver the same lines, but with confidence that speaks of their self-assurance. Kate uses her gaze to put Simmonds, the disgusting older cop, in his place. After her humiliation at the police station, Fiona rejects Kenny’s appeals. The Removalists is at Melbourne Theatre Company until April 17.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Science has the answer</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 00:28:52 <p>
Instead of being able to stack them away, you end up with a full drying rack. And you’ve probably noticed it’s always plastic items that end up the most wet. If you take your dishes out of the dishwasher promptly after the cycle ends, you’ve likely noticed that plates, glasses and ceramic mugs are still hot, while plastic containers don’t feel warm at all. In other words, ceramics and metals cool down more slowly. You’ve probably seen water droplets bead up on things like high-end rain jackets or non-stick frying pans. This is also the case for most plastics, although not always to such a dramatic effect. But there’s another factor here – and it has to do with dishwashers, in particular. Surface tension is the property of the material’s interface (for example, between solid and liquid, or liquid and gas) that tells us how much energy it takes to create a larger surface. By adding detergent to water, we reduce its surface tension. More importantly, the surfactants in detergent are molecules that have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical groups. This makes them a kind of link between water and fats. Since oil and water don’t like to mix, a surfactant helps to “blend” the latter and have it float in water, helping remove any oily residues from your dishes. After rinsing, the chemicals get removed and your dishes are sprayed with clean water so you don’t have to taste the detergent in your tea. So, at the end, water beads up on your hydrophobic plastic dishes and spreads all over your more hydrophilic ceramic plates, cups and metal pots. A large bead of water evaporates more slowly than when the same amount of water is spread more thinly over your plates and pots. Is there anything I can do to make plastics dry faster? Their key ingredients are different types of low-foaming surfactants and chemicals that make water softer. Some “all in one” dishwasher tablets may already contain a small amount of rinse aid and the makers provide instructions on how to use them in a safe and efficient way. Rinse aids also lower the surface tension of water, making it easier for water to wet and run off the surfaces, preventing it from beading up and reducing streaks. This also works on plastic dishes, leaving much less water behind. Is there anything else you can do to dry the dishes faster? There will be less water on it if you use a rinse aid according to instructions, and open the dishwasher when safe, after the cycle is completed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Sign up for ProPublica’s The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. And even more pressing, the officials warned in a Feb. 14 letter obtained by ProPublica, Vietnam is on the verge of its rainy season, when torrential downpours are common. And less than 1,500 feet away is a major river that flows into Ho Chi Minh City, population 9 million. “Simply put,” the officials added, “we are quickly heading toward an environmental and life-threatening catastrophe.” They received no response from Washington, according to three people familiar with the situation. Instead, Rubio and Peter Marocco, another top Trump appointee, have not only ordered the work to stop, but they also have frozen more than $1 million in payments for work already completed by the contractors the U.S. hired. Then, on Feb. 26, Rubio and Marocco canceled both companies’ contracts altogether before apparently reversing that decision about a week later, agency records show. But the botched situation at Bien Hoa is a stark example of the whiplash, conflicting messages, and dire consequences that aid organizations worldwide have faced since early February. “Simply put, we are quickly heading toward an environmental and life-threatening catastrophe.” Workers at Bien Hoa are laboring in 95 degree heat, surrounded by toxic soil. The site has a skeleton crew of less than half of what they previously had, according to workers and documents reviewed by ProPublica. “The dioxin remediation program is one of the core reasons why we have an extraordinary relationship with Vietnam today,” a State Department official told ProPublica, “a country that should by all rights hate us.” With enough contaminated soil to fill about 40,000 dump trucks, the Bien Hoa Air Base is the largest deposit of postwar pesticides remaining in Vietnam after a decadeslong cleanup campaign. The ambassador sent a diplomatic cable to Washington, and Congress and USAID’s inspector general each received a whistleblower complaint, multiple people told ProPublica. “Halting a project like that in the middle of the work, that’s an environmental crime,” said Jan Haemers, CEO of another organization that previously worked in Vietnam to clean up Agent Orange in the soil. The State Department said in a statement that the contracts at Bien Hoa are “active and running” but did not respond to detailed follow-up questions. Tetra Tech and the Vietnamese construction firm did not respond to questions for this story. The Vietnamese Embassy and Ministry of Defense did not return requests for comment. But the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Feb. 13 that it was “deeply concerned” about USAID program suspensions, specifically mentioning the Bien Hoa project. The botched situation at Bien Hoa is a stark example of the whiplash, conflicting messages, and dire consequences that aid organizations worldwide have faced since early February. They dismissed USAID staff en masse, issued sweeping stop-work orders, froze funds, and eventually canceled most of the agency’s contracts with aid organizations around the world, leaving countless children, refugees, and other desperately vulnerable people without critical services. On Monday, Rubio boasted on X that they had cut 83 percent of USAID’s programs because they didn’t align with Trump’s agenda. Every president since George W. Bush — including Trump — has made good on the American promise to repair relations with Vietnam by cleaning up Agent Orange and helping those sick or disabled from dioxin poisoning. The U.S. now conducts $160 billion in annual commerce with Vietnam, which has also become a key partner against China’s growing influence in the South China Sea. “It’s like pulling out one or two legs of the stool.” The Bien Hoa project was formally launched and initial contracts signed during Trump’s first presidency. In another example of the administration’s confusing stance toward the project, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told his Vietnamese counterpart on a Feb. 7 phone call that Trump wanted to enhance defense ties by addressing war legacy issues, which include Agent Orange remediation. Environmental consultants, foreign policy experts, and government officials said the episode in Bien Hoa shows the administration did not do a thoughtful audit. “One might imagine a less reckless government looking at what we’re doing carefully and then deciding what’s in our interest,” David Shear, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam under Barack Obama, told ProPublica. “But,” he said, “this is government reform by meat cleaver.” The mixture contained dioxin, a deadly substance that not only causes a range of cancers and other illnesses, but is also linked to birth defects for babies exposed in utero. For decades since the war, and despite extensive documentation of higher rates of cancers and birth defects among people who had been exposed to the chemicals, the U.S. denied the mass toll Agent Orange had taken on Vietnamese people — as well as on American veterans, as ProPublica has previously reported. When levels get too high, they are no longer allowed to work at the site. There are supposed to be extensive safety checks in place to ensure the dirt doesn’t poison military officials or the surrounding community. The plan at Bien Hoa is to excavate a half-million cubic meters of the most contaminated soil and enclose it underground or cook it in an enormous furnace, which hasn’t been built yet, until the dioxin no longer poses a threat. The work requires extensive pumping and management of dioxin-contaminated water. Contractors are halfway through a 10-year project set to happen in stages, and the bulk of the excavation work must be done between December and April when there is less rain. After Rubio first issued sweeping stop-work orders to aid organizations and contractors around the world in late January, workers from the site were told to stay home for weeks. The companies stopped receiving money to cover payroll and their past invoices. The contractors are desperately trying to secure the contaminated dirt and pits before then, according to interviews this week with several people working there. “The problem is that the Trump administration has destroyed USAID, so it’s very unclear how we’re going to complete this project,” said Tim Rieser, a longtime aide to former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who led a bipartisan delegation to break ground in Bien Hoa in 2019. Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on global public health for ProPublica.
