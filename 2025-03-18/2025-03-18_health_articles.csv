As someone who’s lived with HIV since birth and worked in HIV care for years, I want to break it down in a way that’s easy to understand.

What Does Undetectable Mean?

Being undetectable means the amount of HIV in your blood is so low it can’t be detected by blood tests. This doesn’t mean the virus is gone from your body completely, but it does mean:

The virus is under control.

Your immune system isn’t being attacked. This helps keep you healthy and able to live a normal life.

You can’t transmit HIV! This is known as U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable), the best thing to ever happen to the HIV world .

Get enough sleep.

Simply put, if you’re undetectable, you can’t pass HIV to someone else through your blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or breast milk.",webmd

Discovery of the non-incretin peptide hormone

Mechanism of action

Comparative analysis with ozempic

Future research and potential applications

Conclusion

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that more than 40% of adults worldwide are overweight or obese — a statistic that has nearly tripled since 1975.1,2 However, sustainable weight loss remains one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine.

The rising prevalence of obesity has provided impetus for the development of effective weight loss treatments. Furthermore, excess body weight is also linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic disorders, making obesity a significant public health concern.3

Introduction

Dietary and herbal supplements, including taxifolin, green tea extract, chromium picolinate, ephedra, guarana, caffeine, and hydroxycitric acid, have been studied for weight loss due to their effects on metabolism, appetite suppression, and fat oxidation.2,4 However, their long-term safety remains unclear, with some linked to liver and kidney damage.4

Systematic reviews on herbal preparations like ephedra, green tea, Garcinia cambogia, and Bofutsushosan indicate mechanisms such as appetite suppression and thermogenesis.5 While some trials show modest weight loss, others highlight serious risks, such as ephedra’s cardiovascular effects, leading to its ban in multiple countries.5 Garcinia cambogia and green tea extract show inconsistent results, with safety concerns often poorly documented.5

Given these uncertainties, pharmacological interventions like GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide (Ozempic), have gained attention for weight loss.6 Semaglutide mimics incretin hormones, enhancing insulin secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and suppressing appetite, leading to approximately 12% weight loss in clinical trials.6 However, it carries risks like nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, and high costs, limiting accessibility.7

To address these issues, researchers are investigating naturally occurring peptides. Computational peptide discovery has led to BRINP2-related peptide (BRP), a non-incretin hormone identified through prohormone cleavage prediction.8

This article explores BRP’s discovery, mechanism, efficacy, and potential as a natural alternative to GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Discovery of the non-incretin peptide hormone

A recently published study by a team of scientists from Stanford University identified BRP using Peptide Predictor, a computational tool that the team developed to systematically map the proteolytic peptide fragments formed through cleavage by prohormone convertases.

This method allowed the researchers to screen over 2,600 previously uncharacterized peptides, ultimately leading to the identification of BRP. Unlike GLP-1 analogs, BRP does not interact with the GLP-1 receptor, making it mechanistically distinct from existing weight loss medications.8

Preclinical studies revealed that BRP administration significantly reduced food intake and promoted weight loss in mice and pigs. Importantly, these effects occurred independently of leptin, GLP-1, or melanocortin 4 receptor signaling, indicating a unique appetite-regulation mechanism.8

Additionally, BRP did not induce nausea or aversion in animal models, suggesting a potentially improved tolerability profile compared to Ozempic and other GLP-1-based therapies.

Mechanism of action

BRP exerts its effects through central and peripheral pathways that modulate energy homeostasis. Unlike GLP-1 agonists, which primarily act by delaying gastric emptying and enhancing insulin secretion, BRP operates via the following mechanisms:

Hypothalamic activation: BRP triggers the expression of the FOS gene, a key marker of neuronal activation associated with appetite suppression, in the hypothalamus.8 This suggests that BRP directly influences brain circuits regulating hunger and satiety.

Increased lipid oxidation and energy expenditure: Unlike incretin-based therapies, which primarily affect insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, BRP enhances lipid oxidation, leading to increased fat burning and metabolic activity without causing glycemic instability.

Absence of gastrointestinal side effects: One of the most significant advantages of BRP over semaglutide in animal studies is its lack of nausea and aversion. The researchers believe that this improved tolerability may enhance long-term adherence among individuals seeking sustained weight loss.8

Adipose metabolism: Additionally, BRP has been observed to influence adipose tissue metabolism, increasing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue.8 This suggests that BRP not only reduces food intake but also enhances energy expenditure, making it a dual-action weight loss agent.

Are GLP-1 Drugs the Future of Alcohol Addiction Treatment?

Comparative analysis with ozempic

While both BRP and semaglutide demonstrate potent weight loss effects, their mechanisms of action, efficacy, and tolerability differ significantly. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics incretin hormones to enhance insulin secretion, delay gastric emptying, and suppress appetite.6

In contrast, BRP operates through a non-incretin pathway, targeting the hypothalamus to regulate energy balance independently of GLP-1 receptor activation.8

In terms of appetite suppression, both agents are highly effective. Semaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor to reduce hunger, while BRP suppresses appetite through direct hypothalamic activation. Preclinical studies have shown that BRP administration reduced food intake by up to 50% in mice within an hour.8

Semaglutide has been rigorously tested in human clinical trials, demonstrating an average placebo-corrected weight loss of approximately 12% over 68 weeks.7 Although BRP is still in the preclinical stage, it has shown significant fat loss in animal studies, suggesting strong potential for human application.8

Where the two agents differ markedly is in the risk of adverse reactions. Semaglutide is known to frequently cause gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can limit its tolerability for some patients.7

Furthermore, loss of muscle mass has also been associated with Ozempic use, with even popular media reporting drastic changes in appearance in Ozempic users. In contrast, BRP has not demonstrated any noticeable adverse effects in animal models, suggesting a potentially superior safety profile.8

However, while semaglutide improves insulin secretion and glycemic control, making it particularly beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes, BRP’s effects on glucose metabolism remain unclear and require further investigation.6,8

Who Should Take Weight Loss Injections, and Who Shouldn’t?

Future research and potential applications

Although BRP presents a promising candidate for obesity treatment, additional research is needed to translate preclinical findings into clinical applications. Laetitia Coassolo, the lead researcher on the study that discovered BRP, and her team believe that future investigation on the efficacy, safety, and long-term impacts of BRP should consist of large-scale clinical trials to validate BRP’s safety and effectiveness across diverse populations.8

Evaluating BRP’s impact on metabolic markers, cardiovascular health, and sustained weight maintenance will be essential for regulatory approval and clinical adoption. Additionally, understanding the bioavailability, metabolic stability, and optimal dosing strategies for BRP will be crucial for its therapeutic success.

Furthermore, given its distinct mechanism of action, BRP could be explored as a complementary therapy alongside existing weight loss medications, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Conclusions

The discovery of BRP through prohormone cleavage prediction represents a significant breakthrough in obesity research. By functioning independently of the incretin pathway, BRP offers a novel therapeutic approach with fewer side effects compared to GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic.

While further research is needed to validate its safety and efficacy in humans, BRP has the potential to emerge as a viable, naturally derived alternative for effective and well-tolerated weight management.

In 2019, the Canadian Pain Task Force report found chronic pain is more common among females of all ages, including children, when compared to males.

Both males and females develop pain, but each sex develops it through different means. This study identifies a very unique type of biological process through a specific immune cell that is distinctive to each sex."" Dr. Tuan Trang, PhD, Professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and Cumming School of Medicine (CSM)

The study, published in Neuron, focused on neuropathic pain, which is caused by injury to a nerve or the nervous system. A debilitating symptom of this is allodynia which is experienced when someone feels pain from a stimulus that does not typically cause pain. This condition can be very hard to treat; for instance, things like a light touch, temperature changes, and clothing against the skin can be agonizing. The study, conducted in rats and mice, found that in both sexes pain signals can be communicated by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels but through different types of immune cells. However, in female rodents, activation of Panx1 releases leptin, a hormone which has been associated with heightened pain sensitivity.

""Injury to a nerve can be debilitating,"" says Trang. ""We know that a lot of preclinical research has been in male subjects. Consequently, treatments were often developed from a male-based understanding and may not be very effective in females.""

Heightened levels of leptin in females experiencing chronic pain have been recorded in studies before. Trang notes that as far back as the 1980s, researchers who were working with human blood samples found that female patients experiencing chronic pain had higher levels of leptin in their blood than those who did not have chronic pain.

""In the clinic, we've known for many years that women are more likely than men to suffer from chronic pain, and it's often hard to know why some people respond to treatment and others don't,"" says Dr. Lori Montgomery, MD '03, pain clinician and clinical associate professor at the CSM. ""Both sex and gender are important factors that need a lot more investigation, but this latest research might prove to be one of the ways that we can personalize treatment for patients so that it's more likely to be effective.

Researchers also found that 4.8% of people reported having Long Covid, with higher rates among people living in deprived areas, people with particular ethnic backgrounds, parents or carers, and those with another long-term condition.

The findings are published today [18 March] in the journal Health Expectations.

Professor Nisreen A Alwan, who has pioneered research into Long Covid since 2020 and who co-authored the study, said: ""This analysis adds further evidence of the unfairness of Long Covid, with people who are already disadvantaged in society more likely to be affected.

""It also shows us that many people aren't sure if they have it, and may need diagnosis, treatment and support.

""Long Covid is still a very significant issue impacting individuals, families, the economy and wider society. We need to do more to prevent it, diagnose it, and properly support people who are affected by it.""

Long Covid is a chronic condition induced by COVID-19 infection that can have a significant impact on people's daily lives. Symptoms include fatigue, feeling short of breath, 'brain fog', and heart palpitations, amongst many others.

University of Southampton researchers analysed over 750,000 responses to the GP Patient Survey (England) 2023 to explore the prevalence of Long Covid, and the factors associated with both having the condition and being uncertain of having it.

They found that people aged under 25yrs, males, people from particular ethnic minorities, and people without long-term conditions were more likely to be unsure if they had Long Covid.

Men are generally less likely to seek medical advice than women, which could partly explain their higher level of uncertainty. The team also say stigma and self-doubt could discourage people from seeking a diagnosis.

Mirembe Woodrow, who is studying for a PhD at Southampton and who carried out the analysis, said: ""We were really surprised to find so many people weren't sure whether they had Long Covid or not, and the study shows there is still work to do to increase awareness of the condition and remove barriers to accessing diagnosis, treatment and support.

""We don't want Long Covid to be another factor that contributes to the widening health gap in the UK.""

The most recent data from the 2024 GP Patient Survey indicates Long Covid prevalence and uncertainty are not declining (5.0% and 9.0%). Professor Alwan's team intends to carry out further work using the survey to understand what could be driving inequality in prevalence, impact and support for Long Covid.",news-medical

The infection frequently involves the skin and soft tissue, but it can also cause other life-threatening systemic illnesses including endocarditis, meningitis, and toxic shock syndrome.

The known antibiotic resistance determinants, mecA and mecC, detected in MRSA isolates exhibit a broad spectrum of cross-antibiotic resistance. This study identified three functional protein families, through sequencing, that confer extensive antibiotic resistance independent of mecA and mecC. Twenty-six isolates had their DNA sequenced for mepR, mepA, mepB, and sapep genes for correlation with their antimicrobial phenotypes.

Transcriptional profiling revealed that both animal and human MRSA isolates exhibited a gene cluster mepRAB (multidrug export protein gene), encoding a MarR-like transcriptional regulator (mepR), a M20/M25/M40 metallo-hydrolase protein gene (sapep) encoding resistance to biocides and carbapenems, and a hypothetical protein gene of unknown function (mepB).

Immature platelet fraction (IPF) is recognized as a marker for thrombopoiesis, but its role in dengue has been underexplored.

This finding indicates that IPF% can be utilized as a predictor of platelet increase in patients with dengue infection. Additionally, IPF has been used as a marker to determine the etiology of thrombocytopenia, whether it is caused by excessive platelet destruction or decreased platelet production in the bone marrow, as observed in patients with dengue infection.

These findings suggest that IPF can be utilized as an additional predictive tool to monitor platelet recovery and identify the etiology of thrombocytopenia. However, it is important to note that recovery from dengue infection is not solely determined by platelet count. The restoration of platelet levels is merely one of the indicators of the recovery phase in dengue.

Led by Oncotarget Editor-in-Chief Dr. Wafik S. El-Deiry and a global team of researchers, this special publication highlights the groundbreaking work of the Worldwide Innovative Network (WIN) Consortium, a global collaboration dedicated to transforming cancer care through personalized medicine. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), molecular profiling, and innovative clinical trials, WIN is helping clinicians tailor treatments to each patient's unique cancer profile-moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.



The WIN Consortium is a fast-moving, non-profit organization bringing together nearly 40 academic, industry, and research institutions, along with patient advocacy groups, across 18 countries and five continents. Founded in 2010 in France by Dr. John Mendelsohn (MD Anderson Cancer Center) and Dr. Thomas Tursz (Gustave Roussy), WIN has been led by different renowned experts. Currently under Dr. El-Deiry's leadership, WIN continues to break barriers in cancer research, ensuring cutting-edge treatments reach patients worldwide.

""The WIN global consortium is ready to take up the challenge by bringing the best possible Precision Oncology trial to patients.""

One of WIN's most significant contributions is the development of N-of-1 clinical trials, a revolutionary approach that personalizes cancer treatment based on a patient's specific tumor characteristics. Unlike traditional trials that test drugs on large groups, N-of-1 trials focus on finding the best therapy for an individual patient using AI-driven algorithms, genomic analysis, and real-world data. WIN's WINTHER trial was one of the first to use both DNA and RNA analysis to match patients with the most effective therapies, while the WINGPO trial builds on this approach by integrating AI and liquid biopsies to refine treatment selection. These innovations are helping clinicians make more precise treatment decisions and improving outcomes for cancer patients.



While advancing research, the WIN Consortium is also addressing major challenges in precision oncology, including drug accessibility, regulatory barriers, and disparities in global healthcare. By working closely with governments, pharmaceutical companies, and advocacy organizations, WIN is aiming to ensure that life-saving treatments are accessible to all patients, regardless of location or financial status.



WIN's mission is clear: to accelerate the future of precision oncology by delivering the latest scientific advancements into real-world cancer care. As the field continues to evolve, WIN remains at the forefront, developing next-generation trials and leveraging AI-driven insights to improve patient outcomes.

Led by first author Cong Wang and corresponding author Xiao-Ou Shu from Vanderbilt University, this study examines how breast cancer and its treatments contribute to accelerated aging in survivors. Their study revealed that breast cancer patients show signs of faster biological aging compared to cancer-free individuals, with long-term effects lasting up to ten years post-diagnosis. This finding raises concerns about the potential lasting impact of cancer therapies on aging and overall health.



Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, with improved treatments leading to longer survival rates. However, emerging evidence suggests that these treatments may also accelerate aging. The study used Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PAA), a biological marker that estimates a person's aging rate based on blood tests. Researchers compared data from 1,264 breast cancer patients and 429 cancer-free controls. The results indicated that breast cancer survivors had significantly higher PAA at diagnosis and continued to show signs of accelerated aging up to ten years later.

""This is the first large study with 10 years of follow-up to evaluate PAA among BC survivors.""

The study found that tumor severity played a role in aging acceleration. Women with advanced-stage (Stage III/IV) or high-grade tumors showed the highest levels of aging acceleration. Additionally, treatments such as chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were linked to increased biological aging. One year after diagnosis, chemotherapy was associated with the most significant rise in PAA, while endocrine therapy had long-term effects, increasing aging markers even ten years after treatment.



Interestingly, not all cancer treatments had the same effect. Surgery and radiation therapy were associated with lower aging acceleration over time. These findings suggest that systemic therapies, which affect the whole body, may contribute more to aging-related changes than localized treatments.



The findings highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of breast cancer survivors beyond their initial recovery. Understanding how cancer treatments influence aging can help improve post-treatment care and potentially lead to strategies that reduce these effects. Further research is needed to explore whether lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions could slow down aging in cancer survivors.



As the number of breast cancer survivors continues to grow, addressing the long-term health consequences of cancer treatment is crucial. This study provides valuable insights into how different factors contribute to accelerated aging, helping to shape future research and healthcare approaches for breast cancer survivors.",news-medical

Key drivers behind the CDMO surge

Case studies and industry examples

Future of CDMO Partnerships

Preclinical research is crucial for the development of any novel drug. It demands significant resources that are often expensive and inaccessible to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes.

Federal regulations like the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGAMPs) enforced by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other international organizations also set specific requirements that these companies must follow for the manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product, which may further constrain companies’ operational capabilities.

To overcome these challenges, both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies often leverage the experience of strategic partners like contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) to bring new drugs to the marketplace.

Some of the key advantages of CDMOs include their cost efficiency, particularly when compared to the time and investment required to build this type of infrastructure in-house, as well as their supply chain resilience and regulatory compliance.

What are CDMOs and why are they important?

A full-service CDMO needs to provide comprehensive end-to-end capabilities that support the entire pharmaceutical development and manufacturing process.1”

Recent estimates suggest that the CDMO market in the United States will reach over $278 billion by 2026, with oncology drugs accounting for about 35% of CDMO activity. Rising investments in the CDMO sector are largely attributed to greater complexity associated with the development of novel drugs and medical devices, as well as globalization and emerging markets.

Some key services offered by CDMO include formulation development, regulatory support, clinical trial services, commercial product packaging, supply chain management, quality assurance, and technology transfer solutions2.

One of the key advantages of CDMOs is that all of these services can be offered in a comprehensive package from a single organization, thereby simplifying the drug development and manufacturing process into a “one-stop shop.”

The effective delivery of these services is achieved through a team of staffed and highly experienced scientists and engineers who are actively involved in the development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products.

CDMO facilities are also equipped with highly specialized equipment and facilities that prevent companies from making large capital investments in developing this infrastructure.

How Process Development Enhances Drug Discovery Outcomes

Key drivers behind the CDMO surge

By serving as strategic partners and providing comprehensive drug development and manufacturing services, CDMOs can help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on the journey from discovery to commercialization and beyond.2”

Bringing a new drug to market is a time-consuming process that typically takes between 10 and 15 years, with a total investment of about $2.6 billion USD. CDMOs can reduce costs by accelerating drug production timelines through the use of their expertise to solve formulation challenges and meet regulatory requirements.

The quality of a pharmaceutical product is determined by the safety and efficacy of its active ingredients and formulation, which requires appropriate manufacturing processes that produce the least amount of waste.

Various factors may negatively impact the quality of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, which can lead to wasted materials, discarded product batches, supply disruptions, and product recalls, all of which are associated with significant financial losses.

Every dollar spent in preventing poor quality is equal to $10 if the problem is taken to production without being addressed and $100 dollars if it moves to the distribution stage.3”

The investment in a reliable CDMO is crucial for ensuring high-quality outcomes and reducing unnecessary costs throughout the entire pharmaceutical manufacturing process.

Partnering with CDMOs at the beginning of the manufacturing process allows pharmaceutical companies to immediately identify and resolve any issue that could lead to significant problems later.

Market Report 2025: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing

Case studies and industry examples

In addition to the direct savings associated with CDMOs, these organizations have also been shown to meet growing demands for pharmaceutical products during emergencies.

For example, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Moderna relied on both internal expertise and third-party CDMOs to establish production lines of their novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology in different regions throughout the world to ensure widespread vaccination against this highly contagious disease.

For example, a 2021 expansion in the partnership between Moderna and Rovi in Granada, Spain, facilitated the production of an additional 600 million vaccine doses every year4.

Likewise, ThermoFisher served as a critical partner for supplying raw materials and assisting in vaccine manufacturing of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to increase production capabilities.

Future of CDMO Partnerships

As science continues to advance, CDMOs are also expanding their capabilities by investing in new technologies while simultaneously increasing their capacity to produce even more products.

For example, a recent partnership between Samsung Biologics CDMO and Pfizer will involve the investment of almost $900 million USD to accelerate the production of biosimilars for oncology, inflammation, and immunotherapy indications.

Likewise, both ABL Bio and the Lonza Group CDMO have recently announced their plans to develop and manufacture a novel bispecific antibody that will be used to treat both immune-oncology and neurodegenerative diseases5.

Technological improvements in molecule stability and bioavailability enhancements enable CDMOs and their developer partners to unlock new potential medications, making treatments easier to absorb and more accessible to a broader patient base.6”

Please can you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your research and professional background?

Hi, I’m Olivier Negre, Chief Scientific Officer at Smart Immune since 2020. I now have over 20 years of experience in biotherapy and gene therapy. My journey began working on recombinant vaccines at Bioprotein Technologies. In 2000, I joined bluebird bio, where I worked for 14 years on the development of the first approved gene therapy for beta-thalassemia.

Throughout my career, I've transitioned from a Senior Scientist in France to Director of Translational Research in the USA. I then returned to France to found Biotherapy Partners and lead Smart Immune’s ProTcell platform preclinical development as Chief Scientific Officer. I am also a board member of the French Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

You will be presenting a seminar at the 7th Annual Allogeneic Cell Therapies Summit later this year. Can you give us a sneak peek at what you’ll be discussing during your talk?

I’m looking forward to introducing our ProTcell therapy platform’s recent advances and, more precisely, our efforts to maintain effective and diverse T-cell receptors (TCR) while ensuring safety. Our research has shown that our allogeneic T-cell progenitors, once educated in the host thymus, restore a polyclonal T-cell compartment. TCR diversity is critical to fighting infections and eliminating cancer cells expressing neoantigens.

What are some key insights from your preclinical studies on the safety of ProTcells?

Without spoiling the presentation, I can say that we have not observed any product-related toxicity such as GvHD. A protective effect against tumor challenge has been observed in our preclinical models.

Why is the thymus an important factor in this therapy, and how does it impact T-cell development?

Our cell therapy SMART101 (allogeneic blood stem cell-derived T-cell progenitors) is designed to be empowered and personalized by the patient’s thymus. The thymus selects and educates immature T-cells, turning only the best candidates into fully functional naive T-cells, ready to defend the body against malignant and infected cells. Interestingly, the thymus naturally expands ProTcell-derived T-cell populations by approximately 1,000-fold. We like to say that in the thymus we trust!

What are the potential medical applications of ProTcells, and what makes them particularly promising?

There are numerous reasons why our approach can address medical needs related to T-cell dysfunction. Our strategy is to use allogeneic ProTcells and harness thymic education to restore the immune system with a new, competent, and long-lasting T-cell force. It has huge potential for applications in hematology post-transplant, as we are doing now in high-risk acute leukemia, but also in other cancers, immune aging, and infectious diseases like AIDS. We are working to genetically engineer our ProTcells, to generate long-lasting, self-tolerant, and targeted therapies like HIV-resistant T-cells or CAR ProTcells.

Why have we been seeing headwinds in the allogeneic cell therapies space for the past several years?

The field is faced with obstacles that are tending to be resolved partly and progressively: safety, long-term efficacy (vs cell exhaustion), rejection, and manufacturing complexity. Smart Immune is one of the players in the field aiming at solving all these hurdles to offer off-the-shelf, accessible T-cell therapies.

What are the most exciting advancements you’re seeing in the allogeneic cell therapies space that are turning the field around?

An increasing number of cellular immunotherapies is reaching the market (CAR-T, TCR-T, TILs) but they are mostly autologous and are facing several limitations such as the need to manufacture a batch for each patient, the complexity of a circular supply chain, the cost per dose and the poor quality of patient cells when harvested after several rounds of chemotherapy ...

The allogeneic approach can circumvent those limitations and is made more feasible by several improvements:

1) New methods of gene editing reducing the risk of off-target effect and genomic instability

2) The development of iPS cell lines for the virtually illimited amount of starting material

3) The refined selection of donor cells

4) Epigenetic and metabolic considerations

5) The use of T-cell progenitors to maintain the TCR while avoiding GvHD

Where do you see the allogeneic cell therapy space in the next 5 years?

The approval of Ebvallo, the first authorized allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy, paved the way for new products. Poseida Therapeutics showed that allogeneic CAR-T therapies can have strong traction for pharma with the agreement to be acquired by Roche Holdings for $1.5 billion. In the coming years, the field of cellular immunotherapy should become mature, and large-scale production of high-quality, affordable products should allow the treatment of more patients in the first line. Cell banks of allogeneic off-the-shelf products should participate in this new area for cellular therapies.

What are you looking forward to most at the 7th Annual Allogeneic Cell Therapies Summit?

The Annual Allogeneic Cell Therapies summit is the place to be to meet with experts in the field and learn about the most recent advances in allogeneic therapies. I am looking forward to attending the industry leaders’ fireside chat, which will discuss how to achieve allogeneic product success by aligning innovation with investor expectations. The panel discussion scheduled for the second day will be particularly interesting since ensuring long-lasting therapeutic responses is challenging for allogeneic therapies. I will be keen to discuss strategic patient selection by HLA matching.

What are the next steps for you and your research? Do you have any exciting projects coming up?

I will be able to say more about the evolution of our ProTcell programs during the conference. Our focus in the coming months will be the engineering of CAR ProTcells and the experiments supporting future clinical trials in solid tumors.

What is the process of oral drug absorption, and how has the Fa equation evolved?

Oral drug absorption begins with administering a drug product, followed by a rapid disintegration process. The drug substance is then released from the formulation, dissolves in the intestinal fluid, and permeates the intestinal membrane.

The Noyes-Whitney equation describes the dissolution process, while the permeation process follows first-order kinetics. The fraction of the dose absorbed (Fa) can be calculated by integrating these equations.

The development of the Fa equation has a long history. The Noyes-Whitney equation was introduced in 1897, followed by the concept of absorption potential in 1985. In 1993, the plug-flow model was introduced by Professor Amidon's group, and in 1995, the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) was developed.

Around the same time, concepts such as maximum absorbable dose and the compartmental absorption transit model were proposed. In 1999, the absorption-limiting step classification was introduced. The Fa equation was finally established in 2009, leading to the Fa classification system in 2010, now known as FaRLS.

What is the three-bucket model of oral drug absorption, and how do dissolution rate, permeability, and solubility influence absorption?

The three-bucket model explains oral drug absorption based on different limiting factors. The first case is dissolution rate-limited absorption, where the dissolution rate is very slow while the permeation rate is fast. In this situation, oral absorption is determined by how quickly the drug dissolves.

The second case is permeability-limited absorption, where the dissolution process happens rapidly, but the permeation process is slow. As a result, drug molecules accumulate in the intestinal fluid and are gradually absorbed into the body.

The third and most important case in modern drug discovery and development is solubility-permeability limited absorption. In this case, the maximum amount of drug that can dissolve in intestinal fluid depends on its solubility, which includes both the crystalline and amorphous forms.

When a solid dispersion formulation is administered, the phase separation concentration determines the maximum drug concentration. When a crystalline drug is administered, the drug concentration is dictated by crystalline solubility.

In this case, oral drug absorption is determined by the product of solubility and permeability. Understanding the permeability component is essential for analyzing the particle drifting effect, which is key to drug absorption efficiency.

What is the Peff equation, and how does it help understand oral drug absorption?

The Peff equation describes the effective permeability of drug molecules across the intestinal wall. After dissolving in the bulk phase, drug molecules first permeate through the unstirred water layer, which is about 300 micrometers thick and located on the surface of the intestinal wall. Following this, they pass through the epithelial membrane.

Since the permeation process occurs sequentially through the unstirred water layer and the epithelial membrane, the Peff equation mathematically represents this process. It includes terms for the permeability of the unstirred water layer and the epithelial membrane, as well as Fu, the free fraction of the drug in intestinal fluids. Because intestinal fluids contain bile micelles, only the free fraction of the drug is available for permeation across the epithelial membrane.

The Peff equation is essential for understanding oral drug absorption. Combined with the Fa equation, it helps derive a decision tree to identify the rate-limiting step in drug absorption. The Fa equation incorporates the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), categorizing drugs based on their dose and permeation numbers. If the dissolution rate is very slow, absorption is considered dissolution rate-limited.

In permeability-limited absorption, the process can be further classified as either epithelial membrane-limited or unstirred water-layer-limited. Similarly, solubility-permeability limited absorption can be divided into cases where epithelial membrane permeability or unstirred water layer permeability is the limiting factor. In the latter case, the particle-drifting effect significantly influences drug absorption.

What is the particle drifting effect, and how was it discovered in drug development?

I first proposed the concept of the particle drifting effect in 2010 based on my real-world experience in drug discovery and development, particularly while working at Pfizer. I noticed an unexpected trend during dose titration studies, where we analyzed how different dose strengths affect absorption.

Theoretically, when we increase the dose, the absorbed dose should plateau at a value known as the maximum absorbable dose. However, in actual clinical and toxicokinetics (TK) data, the absorbed dose increased beyond this theoretical ceiling, especially when the particle size was reduced. This suggested that something was missing in our theoretical understanding of drug absorption.

In solubility-limited absorption, the absorption flux is typically determined by the drug's solubility multiplied by its permeability. However, in real in vivo studies, increasing the dose strength and reducing particle size led to a higher absorption flux, even though solubility remained unchanged.

This effect was only seen when absorption was limited by the permeability of the unstirred water layer and not when it was limited by epithelial membrane permeability. This led me to conclude that the permeability of the unstirred water layer must have increased, contradicting the assumption that drug particles only exist in the bulk phase.

The key realization was that microscale drug particles could penetrate the unstirred water layer, increasing its mass transport rate. To confirm this, I looked into the literature. I found multiple studies showing that a significant portion of drug particles exist within the intervillous space, proving that microscale particles do not just stay in the bulk phase but actively move into the unstirred water layer.

How does the Peff equation predict Fa, and what role does the particle drifting effect play in improving its accuracy?

The Peff equation predicts Fa (the fraction of a dose absorbed in humans) based on key physicochemical properties such as pKa, intrinsic solubility, bile micelle binding partition coefficient, and intrinsic passive transcellular permeability (Ptrans0). The Ptrans0 value itself is predicted from the log P of compounds.

When plotting clinical Fa percentages on the horizontal axis and predicted Fa values on the vertical axis, I initially observed many underpredictions, particularly for cases involving high doses and fine particles. These discrepancies suggested that the standard model was missing an important factor.

By incorporating the particle drifting effect into the model, the accuracy of the predictions improved significantly. I published these findings in 2011 and continued to collect additional clinical data afterward. When comparing these new data points with the predicted values, the predictability remained consistent, strengthening my confidence in both the Fa and Peff equations.

However, these equations apply to simple, non-supersaturation cases. Predicting Fa in supersaturation cases—such as those involving solid-dispersion formulations, solid-form APIs, or amorphous APIs—is much more challenging. Currently, efforts are being made to improve these predictions using in vitro data, but accurate modeling of supersaturation is still difficult.

How does particle size affect solubility, and why is it important to carefully interpret solubility measurements?

Contrary to common assumptions, reducing particle size does not significantly increase solubility. Experimental data show that even when the particle size is reduced to below 200 nanometers, the relative solubility increases by only about 10%. Several well-documented studies confirm that solubility remains largely unaffected by particle size reduction, at least down to this nanometer scale.

When measuring solubility using filtration methods, careful interpretation of the data is necessary. Filtration membranes typically have pore sizes around 0.2 micrometers (200 nanometers). If only a portion of the drug particles pass through the filter, the drug concentration in the filtrate can appear artificially high, leading to an overestimation of solubility. The same caution applies when using centrifugation-based methods for solubility measurement.

Another common question is whether microscale drug particles can penetrate the unstirred water layer despite a mucus layer. A literature review on mucus structure reveals that the mucus layer's pore size is much larger than one micrometer, meaning that even microscale particles can move through it. Several experimental papers provide strong evidence supporting this conclusion, reinforcing the validity of the particle drifting effect in real biological environments.

How can the Pion MicroFlux data be extrapolated to predict human Fa while considering the particle drifting effect?

To accurately extrapolate Pion's MicroFlux data to human Fa while considering the particle drifting effect, several key structural differences between the Pion MicroFlux system and the human intestine must be accounted for. In humans, the intestinal membrane has a plicae structure (folds) and villi, significantly increasing the surface area for absorption. In contrast, the Pion microFlux membrane is flat and lacks these structural features.

The thickness of the unstirred water layer in the Pion MicroFlux system may also differ from that in the human intestine. Since the particle drifting effect influences absorption by affecting the permeability of this layer, it is crucial to adjust for any differences in unstirred water layer thickness when predicting human Fa.

It can potentially pinpoint where personalized treatments could be most effective for conditions such as cancer.

NicheCompass leverages the power of generative AI to create a visual database combining spatial genomic data on cell types, where they are found, and how they communicate. Created by researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Institute of AI for Health at Helmholtz Munich, the University of Würzburg, and their collaborators as part of the wider Human Cell Atlas Initiative, this is the first AI method capable of measuring and interpreting a range of data from a cell's social network to recognize and analyze different cellular neighborhoods.

A new paper, published today (18 March) in Nature Genetics, introduces NicheCompass and details how it can uncover tissue changes across breast and lung cancer patients. Researchers show how NicheCompass can identify how certain people may respond differently to treatment - all in one hour, through the power of AI. Ultimately, it will help develop personalized therapy plans, highlighting specific changes that could be targeted in conditions such as cancer.

Every cell in the human body communicates with its environment and is involved in a larger network of interactions. Cells all have features that allow them to be recognized as part of their communication networks, such as which proteins they have on their surface. It is possible to connect similar cells through their features.

Single-cell and spatial genomic technologies have revolutionised our understanding of the human body, and enabled the creation of multiple in-depth cell atlases of different tissues and organs.

These atlases contain information on the multitude of cell types, where they are, and how genetic changes can impact how they interact with each other. By understanding how the human body works at a cellular level, it can inform our understanding of what happens in disease, and highlight new targets for drug development.

While these atlases include information about where cells are found and how they interact within their specific neighborhoods or networks, it is difficult to quantify and interpret these neighborhoods and understand what drives the social interactions of cells.

In a new study, Sanger Institute researchers and their collaborators present NicheCompass, a deep-learning AI model that is based on cell-to-cell communication. This means that it learns how different cells communicate through their networks and then aligns these with similar networks of cells, creating neighbors within tissues through shared features.

From this, NicheCompass can interpret the data, allowing researchers and clinicians to ask questions about the data and better understand health conditions. For example: 'How do cancer cells communicate with the environment around them in patients with lung cancer?'.

Using NicheCompass, researchers combined data from 10 patients with lung cancer and were able to see the similarities and differences between individuals. The similarities help inform our general understanding of cancer, as well as highlight any transcriptional changes that might be useful to target in new treatments. Comparatively, the differences highlight new possible avenues for personalized medicine.

Further patient data can be included, so clinicians can input their own patient data and in one hour receive in-depth information about an individual condition, helping to guide clinical decisions.

The team also used NicheCompass on breast cancer tissue, showing its effectiveness across different types of cancer.

They also applied this network to a mouse brain spatial atlas with 8.4 million cells, and it was able to rapidly and correctly identify brain sections and create a visual resource of the entire organ. This demonstrates how it can be applied to spatial atlases of whole organs generated by researchers worldwide.

Having a huge amount of data about the human body is crucial to finding new ways to understand, prevent and treat disease. However, we also need tools that allow us to access all the benefits this information could provide. NicheCompass is a significant leap in this field, leveraging the power of AI but also offering interpretability, allowing researchers and clinicians to ask questions about their data and better understand and treat diseases."" Sebastian Birk, first author at the Institute of AI for Health, Helmholtz Munich and the Wellcome Sanger Institute

Dr. Carlos Talavera-López, co-senior author at the University of Würzburg, said: ""Using NicheCompass, we were able to see the differences in how immune cells interact with lung cancer tumours in patients. This real-world application not only uncovered new information that adds to our collective understanding about cancer, it also highlighted one patient whose cancer interacted with the immune system differently. In the future, NicheCompass could help uncover new ways to harness the immune system in certain cancers, creating personalized treatments that empower a patient's immune system to target the cancer mechanisms directly.""

Dr. Mohammad Lotfollahi, co-senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""People often communicate to their networks with a range of different information. They might share developments from work, or pictures of their holidays, and while these might be to different friends, they can all be traced back to one individual. Cell-to-cell communication is similar, cells might use different features to communicate with their social network, creating communities or networks in their local area. NicheCompass is the first AI model of its kind that can interpret these networks and answer questions that could directly impact patient lives, such as highlighting where and how health conditions have started, and predicting how they might respond to certain treatments.""",news-medical

It offers a sustainable - and affordable – alternative to synthesizing important peptide-based pharmaceuticals, thanks to a plant-based production system known as biopharming.

The project, led by fourth-year biotechnology and biomedical science students Victor Boddy and Teagan Thomas, aims to address medication shortages and inflated costs, improving treatment access, worldwide.

Gold medal student ingenuity

Phytogene utilizes Nicotiana benthamiana plants to produce medications such as Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists, a class of drugs that include the popular type-II diabetes, turned weight loss drug, Ozempic. This innovative approach could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and chemical waste associated with traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing methods.

Victor Boddy, team leader, explains: ""Inspired by the recent Ozempic shortage, we built a proof-of-concept model system that expresses functional GLP-1 agonists in plants. We aim to create a future where people can reliably grow their own treatments at home, free from concerns about insurance, cost, or availability.""

The team recently showcased their work at the iGEM Grand Jamboree in Paris, where they competed against over 430 international teams. Their exceptional performance earned them a gold medal and placed them among the top 5 teams within the biomanufacturing stream.

Teagan Thomas, co-leader of the project, highlights the potential impact: ""Phytogene offers a unique, sustainable approach to biotechnology by providing an environmentally friendly solution to the critical crisis of medication access. We're excited to further develop this concept into a commercially viable project with support from venture capitalists and scientific advisors.""

Social entrepreneurship in action

The research team has also published an open-source biopharming toolkit on the iGEM Parts Registry, enabling other researchers to build upon their work. This toolkit includes genetic tools for rapid screening of subcellular localizations in plants and various constructs for expression in multiple cell types.

The project, which began in late 2023, involved a collaborative effort from 23 uOttawa undergraduate students across various faculties, with guidance from Adam Damry, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, and Allyson Maclean, Associate Professor, Department of Biology. The team conducted their research in the bioGARAGE laboratory space and in collaboration with other university labs.

While the project shows great promise, it's important to note that it is still in the testing phase.

""The extract has not been tested on humans,"" adds Boddy. The team is now working on optimizing protocols to be able to test the activity of these compounds.

We are currently analyzing blood glucose and insulin levels to assess response. We also plan to conduct bioactivity assays to test the drug's effectiveness on human cells."" Teagan Thomas, student, University of Ottawa

In contrast to conventional flow cytometry, spectral flow cytometry acquires the full emission spectrum of each antibody-associated fluorophore across all lasers, rather than measuring only the peak of emission. This powerful evolution delivers a more detailed and precise characterization of cellular properties to advance understanding of complex biological systems and diseases within each sample versus legacy approaches.

“As a central feature of the CytoFLEX platform, this innovation is focused on pairing ease-of-use with powerful, sensitive acquisition technology to remove the intimidation encountered in many flow cytometry instruments,” said Product Manager Matthew Goff. “Investigators can now easily switch between their true conventional detection system and this advanced spectral detection system, while maintaining a familiar sample management and user experience, all without having to invest in a separate instrument. Along with experimental continuity and evolution offered by a more flexible approach, this delivers a unique solution for sustainability needed by many institutions.”

The CytoFLEX mosaic spectral detection module is powered by a unique algorithm capable of improving resolution compared to other available methods, along with unmixing accuracy checks to ensure efficiency. CytExpert software for spectral reduces the need for extensive training and can speed up the transition to spectral technology. Additionally, the module comes with tools to ease the full spectral workflow, with access to the FluoroFinder panel builder and a Cytobank premium license to provide all the tools researchers need to go from sample preparation to analysis of complex spectral data in an easy manner.

I found the software very easy to learn and was able to start my first experiments in only a few hours,” Tamar Tak, Coordinator of the Flow Cytometry Facility, Leiden University Medical Center

“A feature I really like is that it allows me to do an extensive QC of the unmixing. You get a plot with all the normalized spectra of your fluorochromes and a table with similarity indices. This allows me to see if a tandem dye has degraded, or perhaps the wrong antibody was added. The autofluorescence settings are another highlight, allowing flexibility depending on your samples – from human tissue to complex samples of microorganisms.”

The new spectral module is now available globally in two product configurations: CytoFLEX mosaic 88 for CytoFLEX LX Flow Cytometer and CytoFLEX mosaic 63 for 4-laser CytoFLEX S Flow Cytometer.",news-medical
