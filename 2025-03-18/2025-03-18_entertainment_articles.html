Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were Hollywood’s “It” couple from 1994 until their split in 1997, but they’ve maintained love and respect for each other since the breakup. “I’m friendly with Brad Pitt,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2020. “I don’t have any really bad blood.” They got engaged in 1996, only a few months before their split. Paltrow talked to Howard Stern about falling for the Ocean’s Eleven star during a 2015 interview. I mean, he was Brad Pitt!” she said at the time, adding that her father, the late director Bruce Paltrow, was “devastated” when they broke up. “I’ll never forget when we were engaged and he [Bruce] came to me one day, his eyes full of tears, and he said, ‘You know, I never really realized what they mean when they say you’re gaining a son. Like, I’m gaining a son,’” Pitt said. She married television writer and director Brad Falchuck in September 2018.

Professional golfer Charley Hull, who went viral last year for smoking on the course, has vowed to give up cigarettes. Hull, 28, made the surprising revelation in a video posted via Instagram on Monday, March 17 — and it comes with high stakes. “Today, I’ve made the decision I’m going to stop smoking,” Hull told her friend and pro golfer, Ryan Evans, in the video.

Sex was a focal point on Sex and the City, but that doesn’t mean Kristin Davis and her costars weren’t taken aback by some of the situations they witnessed. Davis, who played Charlotte York on the HBO series for six seasons, recalled season 1 being full of eye-opening moments. While rewatching season 1, episode 6, for her “Are You a Charlotte?” podcast, Davis, 60, looked back on Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) and Ted’s (David Aaron Baker) brief romance. “She finds a porn magazine about spanking, and she’s kind of, like, a little miffed, which is also kind of funny because she’s Miranda,” Davis told her listeners on the Sunday, March 16, episode, noting, “Spanking kinda seems pretty benign to today’s world [but] she has to go and talk to Carrie [Bradshaw] about it.” Davis explained that during the episode Miranda discovered a spanking video, but she made Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) watch. After The CW began airing a prequel about Sarah Jessica Parker’s fashion icon in 2013, fans began to notice several liberties being taken about Carrie’s upbringing. “Soon we’re gonna have all of us watching the people in the window,” Davis said, asking her guest star Christine Taylor, “Do you remember this when we, like, turn our heads sideways because we’re watching people have sex?” Last year, the two services agreed to a licensing deal that allows some of HBO’s biggest […] That scene, however, stood out for another reason in Davis’ head. While Davis confessed to being “semi-traumatized” watching porn stars in action, she previously revealed that her least favorite SATC story line didn’t even involve sex. During the March 13 episode of her podcast, Davis said that when Charlotte and her husband, Harry (Evan Handler), got food poisoning during season 6 she was not happy. “I think it was based on a story where someone went to France and had a similar experience with their decadent cheeses, which we’re not used to here.” Kristin Davis addressed Kim Cattrall‘s upcoming cameo on And Just Like That — which reportedly wasn’t filmed alongside any of her former Sex and the City costars. I can’t change anybody,” Davis, 58, told The Telegraph on […] Even with a few awkward moments, Davis remained part of SATC throughout its original run from 1998 to 2004. Davis reunited with both Parker, 59, and Nixon, 58, in 2021 for the Max spinoff And Just Like That … but Cattrall, 68, did not return as a full-time cast member.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/how-adolescence-pulls-off-one-take-shots.html'>What the One-Shot Effect Adds to Each ‘Adolescence’ Episode</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 20:12:56 <p>
These shots are undeniably impressive, with actors having to treat their on-camera work as though it were onstage, to say nothing of weaving in and around one another as sets, rooms, and circumstances change in an instant. All of which is to say the one-take can get a little one-note. That’s not to say all are like that, but increasingly, this is the one formal trick that makes any scene more stressful than it ought to be, with the audience distracted and left wondering if the show can really pull it off. In Adolescence, the four-episode limited series created by His Dark Materials’s Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham (who also stars), 13-year-old Jamie (Owen Cooper) is accused of murdering one of his classmates, and each episode was filmed in a single take — a process explored in this Twitter thread — from a scene as straightforward as two characters speaking in a row to some complicated aerial drone magic. While Boiling Point might have pushed the possibilities for just how manic a single take could be, Adolescence opts to use the technique for a greater range of emotional realities. Rather than each episode being filled with heart-pounding action, the series establishes itself with a frantic, stressful raid on Jamie’s house and his subsequent arrest, then dissolves into a crime show that’s much more meticulous and robust beyond the thrills at the top. Rather than use a lone shot to compound time, Thorne and Graham, working with cinematographer Matthew Lewis, broaden the show’s scope to examine the ways young people communicate — or, as Thorne puts it, it’s “not a whodunit, but a why-dunit.” Rather than move the audience from pillar to post, Thorne and Graham clear the stage for long, unbroken conversations between Jamie and psychologist Briony (Erin Doherty) ahead of his trial. What remains so potent about the third and fourth episodes — about Jamie’s dad, Eddie, trying to celebrate his birthday as his son’s trial nears — is that they don’t follow a clear emotional line because grief and processing it aren’t necessarily linear. The sensation of the one-shot doesn’t build tension during these last two episodes so much as it shows how life is often composed of contradictions. An hour can contain a multitude of sensations: You can go from laughing to fearing for your life as Briony briefly does during her chat with Jamie. While a number of one-takes are about either setting a stage or building stress, these wallow in Adolescence’s central questions about how and why someone so young could do something so awful. Sitting with that discomfort is a more intense experience than the trapeze act of most television one-take feats — these characters can’t walk away from their situation, and neither can the viewer. They don’t understand how this happened to their son — and we don’t necessarily see the full extent of it either — but knowing is not the point. In a landscape where so many shows foreground reveals and plots, Adolescence centers an emotional reality, one that can’t be cut around or spliced to create something coherent or streamlined. Sometimes, one hour can feel miserable, boring, intense, bizarre, overwhelming, frightening, or some combination of those.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Zegler, who is now starring as the titular princess in “Snow White,” told Allure that her breakout turn as María in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” had some “confusion” in the casting process. Spielberg wanted the role of María to be played by a Latina actress. “There’s confusion because I don’t have a single ounce of Latin in my name,” Zegler said. “Having a bunch of white executives have you prove your identity to them…It’s an interesting experience being part of that diaspora in the current climate we live in. She added, “When I was in the running for María in ‘West Side Story,’ they kept calling to ask if I was legit. Zegler’s casting in “Snow White” was later criticized due to her being of Latina descent. Zegler now told Allure that she hopes the “Snow White” role will help the next generation with racially blind casting. “My only prayer for the future of diversity and inclusion is that we invest in and nurture talent no matter what they look like. That’s why it’s so important for the next generation to see movies like ‘Snow White,’ to realize there’s nothing wrong with choosing to do what’s right and that it doesn’t have to be with anger or a clenched fist.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/walton-goggins-white-lotus-righteous-gemstones-characters-performance.html'>Thank You God for All This Goggins</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 19:30:25 <p>
Every Sunday night on HBO for the next few weeks, you can watch The White Lotus, which this season features Walton Goggins as a very stressed-out man who is on vacation in Thailand. After that, you can leave your television on the same channel and watch The Righteous Gemstones, which continues to feature Walton Goggins, here as a white-haired televangelist and game-show host. We have a double-Goggins situation on our hands. HBO has taken one of the last remaining appointment-ish windows for scripted television and said, “Let’s give the people two scoops of Goggins.” The only thing that I find even a little upsetting about this Goggins confluence is the sudden realization that it has been a possibility all along, this idea of filling up our HBO Sunday night with shows that feature Walton Goggins in some way. Think of what he could have done with a season of recurring guest spots on The Sopranos and Entourage in the incredibly weird handful of years when those two shows aired back-to-back. I could keep putting hypothetical Goggins characters into HBO Sunday night shows for hours. Game of Thrones is probably my favorite, but only on the condition he kept his Southern accent and it was never addressed; I thought about this for two seconds and immediately heard him say, “Well now, Daenerys, it appears you got yourself some dragons.” Now you’re hearing it, too. What’s most telling about the two characters he’s playing right now is that they’re such different people and yet both squarely inside Goggins’ particular wheelhouse. On paper, the two men have very little common ground other than their affinity for much younger romantic partners who have unconventional smiles and a willingness to put up with world-class narcissists. Both of them are guided by a similar motivation, a feeling that something was denied to them — for Rick, the happiness he could have had; for Baby Billy, the success he felt entitled to — and a burning desire to get their hands on it, even if it means coloring outside the lines. His character on Justified, Boyd, was a Kentucky criminal who saw running schemes and drugs as his best shot at upward mobility. Rick and Baby Billy are different, sure, but they’re really just at opposite ends of the Goggins spectrum. And he’s giving them both to us in one night of television. We are getting the Full Goggins in more than one way, too. Baby Billy showed up in the second episode of The Righteous Gemstones’s final season — we had to go on a little detour to the Civil War with Bradley Cooper first — and promptly pulled his pants down to reveal his own little Baby Billy in order to impress upon his nephews and niece “what a fuckin’ man looks like.” There is a long history of actors on this show, to use Danny McBride’s term, “hanging dong,” and even though Goggins has confirmed that said dong was, to use his term, a “dick double,” just watching him gleefully take part in that grand Gemstones tradition is a wonderful treat. He does this thing with his arms and hands during the scene that I’m not sure I can even describe, a kind of peacocking via gesticulation that has burned itself into my brain. As an onscreen comedic bit, it’s a textbook example of an actor committing so wholeheartedly to something so silly that he manages to sell it. On this week’s episode, his character took a trip to Bangkok to meet up with an old acquaintance played by Sam Rockwell and, as Rockwell’s character delivered a wild monologue for the ages, Goggins sat there giving a series of facial reactions that you will see in memes for years. A few weeks before that, his character smoked some laced weed, went to a Thai snake show, and proceeded to absolutely freak out and release all the snakes as he had the cathartic wild-eyed realization that he too was a snake trapped in the glass cage of life. And thank God he was because it gave some genius on HBO’s social media team the opportunity to mash up the scene with the audio of Walton Goggins performing his Gemstones earworm, “Misbehavin’.” Do you see why all of this is so incredible? And right now, for the next month or so, our Sunday nights will be filled with Walton Goggins playing miscreants on HBO, complete with dick doubles and snake shenanigans and whatever else he can get himself up to. We are getting the Full Goggins, every dangling inch of it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ever since he directed Robert Redford to one of his richest, most compelling performances in “The Natural,” Barry Levinson has had a knack for bringing out the best in iconic movie stars. Warren Beatty (“Bugsy”), Dustin Hoffman (“Rain Man,” “Sleepers,” “Wag the Dog”), Robin Williams (“Good Morning, Vietnam”), and Michael Douglas and Demi Moore (“Disclosure”), among many others, have done some of their finest work for Levinson in movies that capitalize on their strengths but provide opportunities to deepen and broaden their personas. Even in this company, the relationship between Levinson and Robert De Niro is special. In “The Alto Knights,” De Niro plays both Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, crime bosses who grew up as friends but ended as rivals whose conflicts reshaped organized crime in the 1950s. Levinson credits producer Irwin Winkler with the idea of casting De Niro in both roles, but notes that it felt like an organic outgrowth of the true story screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi (returning to the milieu he immortalized in “GoodFellas”) was telling. “I thought the idea of Bob playing both parts was intriguing, and certainly challenging,” Levinson told IndieWire. Bob was very meticulous about shaping those rhythms and ultimately finding two distinctive looks.” For each scene in which Costello and Genovese interact, Levinson had to plan his shots so that they would feel credible to an audience — in other words, to present the action the same way he would if it were two actors, neither employing showy tricks nor avoiding shots with both characters sharing the frame for logistical ease. “You shoot one side and then you shoot the other side, and Bob had an actor that he worked with anytime he had one of those scenes, because he didn’t just want a script supervisor feeding him lines. Bob and I will go in with certain ideas but you explore and you go, wait a minute, there’s something interesting here — let’s explore that. Throughout the process, Levinson was struck by how committed De Niro was to those possibilities, and by the actor’s refusal to rest on his laurels. “He’s got every imaginable accolade that you can have as one of the great actors, but he does not just let up and go through the motions,” Levinson said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Natalie “Nadya” Suleman retreated from the public eye in 2013, but now she’s back — and sharing her side of the story. Suleman rose to fame in 2009 after getting pregnant with octuplets via IVF. As she prepares for the release of her Lifetime film, I Was Octomom (Saturday, March 8), and docuseries, Confessions of Octomom (Monday, March 10), Suleman is reflecting on her life. “I wasn’t happy as an only child, and clearly I projected my dream onto my kids and wanting a big, well, not this big of a family, but I did want seven kids,” she told People. So then of course, I projected onto my future family.” Suleman had multiple back-to-back rounds of IVF administered by Dr. Michael Kamrava. While the recommended standard practice is to implant two embryos, Kamrava implanted her with 12. Suleman, who wanted “just one more” baby, was told by Kamrava that he had only implanted six embryos. He later admitted to planting 12 and his professional medical license was revoked. No one else in the world did this type of procedure so I didn’t have it in my heart to sue him,” she said.

Suleman is setting the record straight on her financial situation after rising to fame. Despite being accused of receiving and using government assistance to conceive her children, Suleman said, “That was a lie.” Instead of buying a house I bought in vitros. Suleman’s financial situation became more dire after welcoming her octuplets, leading her to participate in paid interviews, photo opportunities and a solo adult film. It was the antithesis of who I am as a person.” For years I was typecast as the welfare recipient, unemployed mother, all of which is wrong.” Five years later, Suleman left her job when son Aidan’s “needs were becoming overwhelming.” “I’ve always been his only provider, but I never got paid,” she said of her son, who is autistic. “So in 2018, that’s when I started to get actually paid. Before welcoming her octuplets, Suleman was married to Marcos Gutierrez. The pair separated in 2000 and officially divorced six years later. Looking back, Suleman told People that it “wasn’t a real marriage.” He was just a donor and I only tried to pacify my very, very old-fashioned Middle Eastern family on my dad’s side, where some of the marriages are still pre-arranged,” she said. And he had feelings, but I didn’t really reciprocate them. I was never hiding the fact that I just wanted a child and he tried to help me, but it didn’t work out.” Suleman later revealed that she has been celibate for 25 years. “I’m not a romantic person whatsoever,” she said.

One of Suleman’s sons also sat down with producers, sharing his experience of having people approach him to ask about his mom’s past. (Aside from her adult film, she previously worked as a stripper in men’s clubs.) “It was that professor, that manager, that was trying to protect me who confiscated my phone,” Suleman said, noting she opted for a professor to help her since she was in grad school at the time.

The Sex Lives of College Girls’s semester at Essex College has come to an early end. The show, which was created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, was canceled by Max on March 18, about two months after the finale of its third season on January 23. The most recent season was notable for its cast shake-up — former main-cast member Reneé Rapp (Leighton) left the show, and both Gracie Lawrence’s Kacey and Mia Rodgers’s Taylor were added to the full-time cast. Deadline reports that Warner Bros. Television, which produces Sex Lives, is currently shopping the show to Netflix, where Kaling just scored a hit with Running Point. Vulture has reached out to Kaling for comment. Maybe the show will follow in Leighton’s footsteps and do a transfer instead of dropping out.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After dealing with whales and black swans and two of every creature on Noah’s Ark, Darren Aronofsky is going back to the animal kingdom for his next film.

Aronofsky is circling a new adaptation of Stephen King’s “Cujo,” the horror story about a friendly St. Bernard dog that turns killer and unleashes havoc on a small town. The project is in development at Netflix, and according to THR, which first reported the news, the project could be on the fast track after news of an adaptation was reported just last week.

Aronofsky would direct the film should a deal materialize, but no writer is attached. Roy Lee — who has most recently produced “Companion” but is also behind adaptations of other King projects such as “Salem’s Lot,” the “It” films, and Francis Lawrence’s upcoming “The Long Walk” — is attached to produce.

“Cujo” was a 1981 King novel and was shortly thereafter turned into a 1983 film as directed by Lewis Teague. The film grossed $21 million for Warner Bros.

Up next for Aronofsky is “Caught Stealing,” which is in post-production and is a crime thriller based on books by Charlie Huston about a burned out former baseball player who gets caught up in a world of underground crime in 1990s New York City. The film stars Austin Butler and is being released by Sony.

Back in 2023, Aronofsky was set to direct a biopic on Elon Musk for A24, which is based on a biography by Walter Isaacson, who also wrote the biography about Steve Jobs that Danny Boyle later turned into his 2015 film starring Michael Fassbender. He also directed a film for The Sphere in Las Vegas called “Postcard from Earth.” His last narrative feature film was “The Whale” in 2022, also for A24 and which won an Oscar for Brendan Fraser.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We’ve got them in spades. While SXSW is best known for its bombastic crowdpleasers that, alas, already have a home (we’re looking at you, “Another Simple Favor,” “Drop,” and “The Accountant 2”), for every one of those big names, there are a wealth of other titles worthy of their own cinematic homes. From Matthew McConaughey’s first starring role in years to searing documentaries, new offerings from some of our favorite filmmakers and calling cards from rising stars, this year’s batch of undistributed titles is big, and we’ve got a few favorites we’re dying to spotlight. If you’re looking for more of our SXSW coverage, you can find it all right here, including a look at some of our early favorites and awards winners, both from the juries and the fest’s audience members.

Rachel Zegler said in an interview with Allure magazine that white studio executives repeatedly questioned her during the casting process for Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story,” which served as her acting breakthrough in Hollywood. Spielberg cast Zegler as the musical’s female lead, María, and it was of utmost importance to him that the film’s Latina protagonist be played by a Latina actor. “There’s confusion because I don’t have a single ounce of Latin in my name,” Zegler told the magazine. Zegler added, “Having a bunch of white executives have you prove your identity to them…It’s an interesting experience being part of that diaspora in the current climate we live in. Spielberg’s “West Side Story” earned critical acclaim and scored Zegler a win at the Golden Globes for best actress in a musical or comedy film. Her career had effectively taken off, but “West Side Story” was far from release when the call came in for her to audition for the lead role in Disney’s live-action “Snow White” remake. Spielberg personally advocated for her casting to “Snow White” director Marc Webb. Cut to years later and Zegler is now headlining the Disney remake, opening in theaters March 21. “My only prayer for the future of diversity and inclusion is that we invest in and nurture talent no matter what they look like.” Anger can be a powerful emotion, but it doesn’t bring the brightest future.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Outside of film business circles (and even sometimes in them), the acronym NATO refers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the transnational military alliance between 32 countries committed to maintaining the post-WWII world order. But for that niche group of people who make a big deal of going to CinemaCon in Vegas every April, NATO is the National Association of Theatre Owners. But now no one needs to be confused. NATO, the cinema trade group which represents movie theaters across the country, is changing its name to Cinema United, NATO…er…Cinema United president Michael O’Leary told the Associated Press on Tuesday. O’Leary, who took over the post last year after former president John Fithian stepped down, said the trade group was in need of a rebrand and also conceded that getting phone calls about Ukraine was getting a little old. The rebrand also comes with a new tagline: Moviegoing Is Our Mission. Beginning March 31, Cinema United is bringing together the folks who represent all those screens for CinemaCon, which is the annual convention in which the studios show off their upcoming theatrical slates to entice those theater owners to book their movies on their screens. O’Leary and company will surely take the occasion to echo the rallying cry of Sean Baker during the Oscars about putting movies into theaters (“Anora” is one of the lowest-grossing Best Picture winners ever), but it will also raise awareness about ways in which to help theaters recover. After a few weak weekends in a row and a disappointing run for some major tentpoles like “Captain America: Brave New World,” the domestic box office for the year is now slightly off pace from where it was last year. To combat that, Cinema United will tout some of its recent promotions, including a commitment of $2.2 billion among cinemas to upgrade tech and install improvements and other amenities, as well as specialty weekends nationwide that will offer discounts on concessions to certain groups like families or couples celebrating date night.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Oh, he’s fully loaded with this one. Herbie Hancock is using his octogenarian years to relay some sage advice to other musicians, telling the BBC in a new interview the best lesson he’s learned throughout his career. No, it has nothing to do with the keyboards. How about some trumpet innuendo instead? “If all you see are dudes in the audience,” he explained, “that means your music is dead.” Hancock, in turn, was told this by his old friend Miles Davis back in the ’60s — although he was a bit feistier about it. “He used more expletives than I just did,” Hancock added, “but you get the idea.” The jazz cat is now gearing up for the release of his first album in 15 years, the delay of which, he admits, was caused by the internet becoming its own bandleader. “I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube.

Of the spate of New MILF Cinema films that have come out recently, perhaps nothing holds more allure than the prospect of Boy King Timothée Chalamet getting it on onscreen with Super Mom Gwyneth Paltrow in the Josh Safdie–directed Marty Supreme. Offscreen, Chalamet is a beast at modern promotion, as natural on Jimmy Kimmel as he is with Theo Von, and Paltrow is … herself. For starters, there’s the revelation that the Goop founder has never seen a Chalamet movie (or Safdie’s Uncut Gems). “He’s such a thinking man’s sex symbol,” Paltrow says to Vanity Fair, comparing Chalamet to other movie stars. She also brags that the two have “a lot of sex in this movie.” “I was like, ‘Okay, great. I’m 109 years old. You’re 14,’” she jokes.

“He’s just a very polite, properly raised, I was going to say kid,” Paltrow tells VF before correcting herself. “He’s a man who takes his work really seriously and is a fun partner.” That’ll get them through Hot Ones Versus.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

No one wants to be a teen again. It’s an unnerving, seemingly never-ending time of immense social pressure, roller-coaster hormones, and incredible self-doubt. You feel simultaneously alone and under constant supervision, and the littlest slight or kindness can send you into a mental spiral. And, God, to be in a school full of teens? It seemed bad enough when I went in the late ’90s, when there were parties and cliques and whatever else. With phones, social media, backbiting, and “Are you even my friend if you don’t comment on my Story” stuff? It’s not something that DIs Bascombe and Frank are thinking when they go to visit Jamie and Katie’s school, even though it also happens to be the school that Bascombe’s son, Adam, attends. Thankfully, Adam’s there to help his dad, finding him to explain the intricate and hairy world of emoji codes. Katie thought Adam was an incel, a red-pilled member of the internet misogynist Andrew Tate’s manosphere. The cops take that to mean she was bullying him, and while that’s certainly possible — calling someone out on social media, via emoji or not, is pretty shitty — I get the feeling we haven’t truthfully discovered the whole story yet. What did Jamie do to make Katie think that about him? (Side note: Asking “Did you help him get the knife?” is a weird question considering it’s a kitchen knife. I’ve got eight in my knife block right now.) Or maybe they should have protected the boys and educated them about adult social relationships rather than leaving it to their parents, most of which have to be just as clueless as Bascombe and Frank. What goes on in our kids’ schools while we’re not watching? At the end of the episode, we see Bascombe trying to reestablish a relationship with his son, who he says barely talks to him. Adolescence wants us to think that these types of problems can be solved by really, openly talking to our kids. • Two things that I thought were well said in this episode. First, Bascombe tells Ryan, “It’s crazy what your brain tells you to do when you’re a kid.” Second was Frank’s assertion that kids just need one person — a teacher, a parent, a friend — to tell them that they’re normal and they’re supported. (And that’s why I’m also incredibly worried about Jade now.) • I love how Adam knows about red pills and blue pills but has no idea that they’re from The Matrix. • While the British criminal-justice system seemed pretty all right in episode one, this school failed to make me jealous of the British educational system.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After decades in Hollywood, Gwyneth Paltrow had her first encounter with an intimacy coordinator during “Marty Supreme.” Paltrow, who returns to acting with the Josh Safdie-helmed film after five years away from the screen, told Vanity Fair that she actually had no idea what an intimacy coordinator even was prior to working on the A24 film. “There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator, which I did not know existed,” she said, adding that she told the coordinator at one point, “I was like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on.’” As Paltrow teased, there were a slew of scenes that did warrant one, though. “I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie,” Paltrow said, citing her onscreen time with “Marty Supreme” co-star Timothée Chalamet. Paltrow added that at times, though, she and Chalamet also asked the coordinator to “step a little bit back” for certain sequences. “I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but…if someone is like, ‘OK, and then he’s going to put his hand here,’ I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.” As VF included, Paltrow shrugged at simulating sex with Chalamet, and quipped, “I was like, ‘OK, great. Paltrow also couldn’t help but praise the talent of Chalamet, as well as his charismatic charms: She dubbed Oscar-nominated Chalamet a modern day icon. Paltrow previously said during the “Drew Barrymore Show” that Chalamet was an ideal co-star that also helped ease her nerves about returning to the screen.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

You probably know the iconic “A Man and a Woman” main theme written by Francis Lai, but when was the last time you actually saw the movie? Claude Lelouch‘s 1966 Cannes Palme d’Or (and double) Oscar winner is led by French cinema icons Anouk Aimée (who died last year and strangely was not included in the Oscars’ 2025 In Memoriam segment) and Jean-Louis Trintignant (who died in 2022). The classic romance is now coming back to theaters, in a new restoration, courtesy of Rialto Pictures this April. As IndieWire previously wrote in our ranking of all Cannes Palme d’Or winners: “From director Claude Lelouch comes this 1966 classic — a tender, visually stirring film of rejuvenating love between a widow and a widower: a race-car driver (Jean-Louis Trinignant) and a movie script girl (Anouk Aimee) share a candid romance while balancing the demands of career and parenthood. It’s a touching, realistic look at a burgeoning adult romance, with each participant encumbered by a past tragedy, causing them to proceed delicately. The film is also famous for Francis Lai’s gorgeous, swooning score. Winner of Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay, it’s quite possibly one of the sweetest love stories ever captured on screen.” In the film, Trintignant plays a widower and racecar driver who is now single after his wife’s suicide. They meet at their children’s boarding school in Deauville and form a nervous friendship that eventually turns into romance, all leading to an iconic finale in which Claude Lelouch’s camera (he did the cinematography himself) swirls around the lovers. The new restoration of “A Man and a Woman” opens April 4 at New York’s Film Forum and April 18 in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Royal.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rare is it that we get a new cinematic feast from Academy Award-winning writer/director Spike Jonze and while today’s offerings may not be a new feature film, his new Apple Air Pods 4 commercial starring Pedro Pascal is sure to satiate fans for the time being. Set along a lively city block, the advertisement sees Pascal whisked from the cold doldrums of his winter existence and dropped into a music-filled fantasia bursting with bright red and yellow flowers. Highlighting the power of these new Air Pods to help escape everyday life, Pascal is seen dancing through the streets and mouthing along to the lyrics, as if part of his own musical. Though many are aware of Jonze’s films, including “Being John Malkovich,” “Adaptation,” and “Her,” for which he won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, even more people are likely to have seen his work on the small screen with advertisements that feature talent like Margaret Qualley (Kenzo World), Idris Elba (Squarepace), and FKA Twigs (Apple Homepod). Jonze also recently directed a short music video for Coldplay’s “All My Love” featuring Chris Martin singing alongside a dancing Dick Van Dyke. Upon release of his 2018 commercial with Twigs, titled “Welcome Home,” Jonze also unveiled a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the short film in AdWeek. Jonze worked on the ad with famed cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, currently busy shooting Christopher Nolan’s latest project, “The Odyssey.” Dancer Ryan Heffington also took part, choreographing Twigs in “Welcome Home,” as well as Qualley in “Kenzo World.” Movement coach Theo Lowe was also involved in the former project too. “Spike had a great insight to what he wanted in terms of when this movement would play into what was happening in the scene, so it was pretty much blocked out,” said Heffington during the “Welcome Home” behind-the-scenes video, “but we extended some sections, just so we can let the choreography settle a bit more and let the character within that choreography develop and settle and make sense within the story.” Jonze is a member of the commercial production company MJZ, which also boasts work from directors Craig Gillespie, Harmony Korine, Mike Mills, and Halina Reijn. His new ad, “Someday,” promotes the release of Apple Air Pods 4, featuring active noise cancelling technology.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/playboi-carti-music-review.html'>Playboi Carti Gets Lost in the Music</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 15:04:41 <p>
Playboi Carti wears his flows like he wears his clothes: Ensembles designed to wow and confound are tossed to the side with the same zest and vigor that brought them together. The 29-year-old Atlanta rapper’s shifting sound and persona were first cultivated as a member of the Awful Records crew and, later, Harlem’s A$AP Mob. Early works like 2017’s Playboi Carti and 2018’s Die Lit documented the birth of an increasingly bit-crushed mutation of southern hip-hop. Carti became the crown prince of rage rap, which swiped the forbiddingly DIY sonics, ominous iconography, and barely contained aggression from punk and metal. These ideas weren’t foreign to hip-hop — Geto Boys’ records touched most of the same points — but Carti’s eye was always further afield. His persona teetered on a razor’s edge: He must look magisterial but seem nonchalant. Rage, to the extent that the microgenre is distinguished from its fountainheads in trap and emo rap, is about ritual and release. Music does nothing to reconcile any of its conundrums. The unpredictability fueling these triumphs is just as often a cause for concern. Allegations of violence surrounding high-profile artists — a 2022 domestic-abuse charge levied against Lil Uzi Vert met with a plea of no contest, and a 2023 felony-aggravated-assault charge against Carti was later reported as dismissed — imply that abrasive views on these records come from somewhere real and worrying. Iggy Azalea, mother of Carti’s son, saying “We haven’t heard from that man in … six months” lends disconcerting credibility to rhymes about not giving a shit about women. Scott and Kendrick Lamar, who both guest on Music, offer a thermostat reading for how much the industry even cares about these issues. It’s a fear of debasement of rap’s perceived core values — painstaking originality, lyrical depth and dexterity, distinctive diction — bucking against a bumpy evolution. Purists see the rise of almost defiantly unlaborious music as proof that fast fashion floats, but this wave is kin to everything that came before it. Methodological quibbles aside, the story’s what it always was: Black 20-somethings knowingly strip-mining movements that ripped off and marginalized their grandparents. Tentpole rage-rap releases like Uzi’s Luv Is Rage and Scott’s Rodeo will turn ten this year, and their authors are cruising into their 30s seeking to bottle and reproduce the old lightning. Uzi’s curt Eternal Atake 2 dragged, as did Scott’s “Hot 100” shooting star “4x4.” While Carti fans pestered him for a follow-up, the vocal theatrics and synth saturation he favors trickled into the topsoil, feeding mainstream rap. Four Atlanta heralds — Destroy Lonely, Ken Carson, and the duo Homixide Gang — wield aspects of their benefactor’s power, priming the planet for conquest.) The shape of Music — 30 songs spanning 76 minutes — feels like an apology for years of false leads and starts to a hungry fandom. He is a massive inspiration for pitched-up vocals and swarming ad-libs in mainstream hip-hop, though he gets the latter from Jeezy. Two exceedingly strange noises Playboi Carti makes on the new album are as follows: A long and guttural howl undergirding rousing choir vocals in the gospel-tinged “Crush,” like a demon exorcised in Pentecostal Sunday service. This is an artist obsessed with the marriage of high- and lowbrow. Carti is, as oldheads assessed, somewhat enthralled by pissing on tradition. It’s almost entirely horny buildup, echoing grunts occupying spaces where a series of verses usually goes. Music regroups the way many works by artists a decade into their careers tend to nowadays: It reaffirms foundations. The video-game-y topline of “Crush” brings to mind a similar sequence in Whole Lotta Red’s “Sky.” But the twist is that the artist’s point of nostalgia sits further back in time than fans looking for another hit of Die Lit. Not content to fully retreat into the self-parodic zoomer nostalgia routines Carti’s rage-elder peers have, Music engages in a jarringly convincing array of impressions. “Walk” and “Dis 1 Got it” sell self-destructive chants like Future’s drug jams. But “Charge Dem Hoes a Fee” with actual Nayvadius makes the Carti deep voice all over Music feel small. Music is saying that Carti can’t be pinned down. Audience and industry seem relatively nonplussed about this, more concerned with the questions of authenticity raised by tributary vocal delivery. It is a distinguishing trait, impossible to pry off the music like the darkness threading in and out of rage and drill scenes. Music does nothing to reconcile any of its conundrums. Carti is here to facilitate people ramming into one another.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/reputation-taylors-version-release-timeline.html'>Reputation (Taylor’s Version) Teases: An Endless Timeline</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 15:01:26 <p>
Taylor Swift might have sung, “I swear I don’t love the drama, it loves me,” on her 2017 album Reputation, but the fanfare leading up to its loooong-awaited rerelease seems to indicate otherwise. Ever since Swift’s sixth studio record became eligible for rerecording way back in November 2022 — the same long-ago month that saw Ron DeSantis topping polls and the end of The Walking Dead — fans have eagerly lapped up any clue that Reputation (Taylor’s Version) is ready for release. But if the date comes and passes without so much as a hiss? Well, take comfort in knowing it would be far from the first time we were all fooled by Swift’s Rep teases. And while some of the examples on the list below may seem like unintentional red herrings, remember Swift’s own warning to listeners on “Mastermind” off 2022’s Midnights: “What if I told you none of this was accidental?” a potential February release, duh), there were a good amount of clues that indicated Rep (TV) would soon be on its way. Toward the end of summer 2023, Swifties were surprised with not one but two clips of songs from Rep (TV) featured on TV shows: “Delicate” on The Summer I Turned Pretty and “Look What You Made Me Do” on Wilderness. What felt like celebratory gifts were probably more like consolation prizes as we still haven’t heard full versions of either track. Also in August, Swift’s close pal and frequent collaborator Ed Sheeran revealed he had not yet recorded the new version of “End Game,” which was disappointing only if you miss the sound of Sheeran rapping. October 2023: Shout-outs in Swift’s Eras Tour Movie Post “Getaway Car”) and “look what you genuinely made me do” (which, like her reputation, needs no further explanation). Perhaps the film would contain an announcement about Rep (TV)’s release date, we thought! December 2023: Time’s “Person of the Year” Has “tRuSt iSSues” ), supported by a few seeming teases in the year’s first month. In addition to Swift sporting some very Rep-like looks at the Golden Globes and on the street, she and some of her A-list friends changed their social-media profile pictures to black-and-white, which fans took to be a hint that the album was forthcoming. Well, an album was forthcoming, but it turned out to be The Tortured Poets Department, which also features a black-and-white photo of Swift on the cover. Viewers of The Dynasty: The New England Patriots on Apple TV+ got to hear “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor’s Version)” during one episode. Perhaps Swift was lured in by the “TV” similarities? June 2024: “This Is What You Came For” Hits Eras On June 14, the lucky attendees of Swift’s second Liverpool stop on the Eras Tour got to hear her perform “This Is What You Came For,” the 2016 Calvin Harris–Rihanna hit later revealed to be written by Harris’s own ex. Many theorized the rarely heard track was bound to be a Rep (TV) vault track, especially since Swift’s breakup with Harris occurred while the original album was being recorded. During a London tour stop, Swift played Rep’s “I Did Something Bad” (one of her self-proclaimed favorite songs) for the first time, giving fans hope, but ultimately nothing came of it. Oh boy, October was a ride when it came to Rep (TV) teases. Also, both Joe Jonas and Shawn Mendes delayed their planned October 18 album releases, moves many fans took to be made out of caution over Swift’s incoming album. November 2024: The End of an Era But Still No Rep (TV) It was a solid theory strengthened by the singer’s continued love of green outfits and an astute fan noticing Swift’s recent Instagram posts seemed to indicate a countdown. In all likelihood, it was probably just a glitch — and not the cool Midnights version. From Swift presenting at the Grammys, to boyfriend Travis Kelce saying he “can neither confirm nor deny” the Rep (TV) release date, to news that the album’s trademarks would be valid only until August, February brought some solid teases but no actual news. It was rumored the two pop idols had collaborated on a Rep-coded song. Alas, the rumors proved false and fans were left with their hopes once again dashed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

That’s because both films are formally bold, mind-bending tales about the search for identity. “Anomalisa” explores Fregoli syndrome, where people appear as the same person in disguise, by marrying distinctive stop-motion designs with stylized action; “The Actor,” by contrast, tackles a variation of amnesia, where people appear as a troupe of actors playing multiple roles, with more dream-like theatricality. Based on Donald E. Westlake’s surreal novel, “Memory,” Johnson’s newest film focuses on André Holland as a man who suffers from both long-term and short-term memory loss; he’s trying to get back to New York from a ’50s Midwestern town, but his only anchor in a shifting reality is the woman he befriends played by Gemma Chan. Holland’s continually refreshing blank slate is the story motivation for Passarelli and his team to wrap “The Actor” in a picturesque fog of soft but heightened imagery. “And it was really cool when we have the sky so close to the back wall on main street, and we were playing with forced perspective. Johnson and Passarelli looked at many other black-and-white films from the same period, too, in part because Johnson wanted to explore the things that make people feel like they’re in a period film. “ It started with discussions of our memories in certain places and the further back they go, the more distant and heightened they become,” Passarelli said. We didn’t ever want the audience to forget that fact as well.” “The thing that kept it balanced and focused was the journey home, and then, all of a sudden, he’s back in rewind,” Passarelli added. While there are obvious differences between the tannery town that Holland is stuck in and his bohemian Greenwich Village home, the director wanted everything to appear whimsical and detached from reality. “After we shot everything at Budapest, we went back to [the animated Starburns studio] for just a few pickup shots for the titles with these ‘Anomalisa’ buildings,” said Passarelli. It was fun to take them out of storage for one last hurrah.” “We had watched a bunch of different people watching movies in theaters,” Passarelli said. It’s a good beam of light, changing colors, but not too distracting.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Amid Kanye West‘s controversial public and social media behavior, Kim Kardashian might take legal action to get full custody of their kids.

West, 47, previously sparked concern when he posted antisemitic rants and now has continued to raise eyebrows by sharing a song with disgraced music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, which featured vocals from his and Kardashian’s eldest child, North. So stop,” Kardashian reportedly wrote, according to screenshots shared via TMZ. “I sent paperwork over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song to protect her.” West, meanwhile, allegedly replied: “And neither of us will recover from the public fallout. She previously opened up about the challenges of coparenting with her ex after their divorce was finalized in November 2022. I don’t want to get emotional, but it’s just been a day for me. Coparenting is really f—ing hard,” Kardashian shared on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast in December 2022.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-recap-episode-1-netflix.html'>Adolescence Series-Premiere Recap: We Need to Talk About Jamie</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 14:11:07 <p>
What you hope you never, ever, ever have to worry about is the subject of Netflix’s new series, Adolescence. Created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham — who also plays Jamie’s dad, Eddie — the show is an emotional gut punch, aided by the fact that each episode is shot in real time in one take. When the premiere opens, it’s with idle cop chitchat. It’s about their kids and their lives, and it makes things extra jarring when, a minute or so later, we follow them as they burst into the Miller family home. It’s 6 a.m., and they’ve taken the family by surprise. Mom and Dad are more confused than anything, wondering why their barely teenage son, a kid who still has a space-themed bedroom, is being charged with murder. Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, is perfectly cast. With a smattering of freckles across a face that you know has never seen the sharp side of a razor, Cooper looks barely old enough to have armpit hair. He’s stuck somewhere between childhood and adulthood; if you let yourself, you can remember how weird that time felt. This cell just across from some very belligerent grown-ass man? There must have been a reason, or maybe the cops got it wrong. Maybe this is a story about how some kid gets railroaded. Except, as we learn when Jamie sits for an interview, fresh off a medical exam and meeting with his lawyer and “appropriate adult” father, he seems to have very much committed the crime he’s accused of, following and then stabbing a classmate named Katie with a kitchen knife. The sweet boy we knew, who’s wearing a sweatshirt that’s much too big and who just learned about the Industrial Revolution, has killed some other parent’s sweet, sweet kid. We’re not sure why yet — even Jamie doesn’t seem like he knows, considering he’s still denying the whole thing or at least asserting that he “didn’t do anything wrong” — but it’s clear that’s to come. It’s tough to want to push forward from here, except in search of the “why.” But Adolescence is so well-made and compelling that it’s hard not to go on. There probably won’t be good answers, ultimately, but there will be good TV, and maybe that’s enough for now. • The cops in Adolescence keep their lives so insanely compartmentalized that it’s downright disturbing. They’re borderline aggressive and awful to Jamie, which seems harsh, but then you realize that they were also the ones who had to break the news to Katie’s parents. • Eddie says he thinks he’s a good dad but the lack of physical contact between him and Jamie gives me pause. I’m sure that it’s a sort of “you’re a man” type thing, but when your son is clearly shaken to the core, you’d think you could give him a hug. Appreciate him yelling for Jamie to “eat [his] cornies,” but I would have liked a little softness even more. • Prior to Adolescence, the last show I reviewed for Vulture was Missing You, which also came out on Netflix, stars Ashley Walters, and is insanely depressing.

She is an advocate for change in the industry, with a focus on creating healthy on-set environments. “Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna” is streaming now on Hulu. As an industry, we have yet to fully acknowledge the pervasiveness of unsafe working conditions because we’ve normalized the idea that suffering is an essential part of filmmaking. Our “battle-tested” cameras have names like Rocket, Weapon, and Arsenal. We use terms like “run n’ gun,” “lock it up,” and “shoot.” Our toxic production culture frames suffering as “paying your dues.” In a 2024 survey by IPC, 79 percent of film workers reported being injured on the job, and 69 percent believed that creative vision was prioritized over safety. In a study by The UK Film and TV Charity, 77 percent of respondents said the film and TV industry is a mentally unhealthy place to work, and a shocking 30 percent having considered taking their own life in the past year. Yet since most struggles don’t end in public tragedy, they rarely make headlines. ‘Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna Hutchins’ Hulu More productions are actively prioritzing well-being, proving that a better way is possible. Mental Health Resources : Productions can establish dedicated well-being roles with trained professionals embedded on a project to support crew and proactively address mental health, burnout, and interpersonal challenges before they escalate. Anonymous reporting channels allow workers to speak up without risking their jobs. You may be asking, “How can we do more when budgets and timelines are already stretched to the limit?” Because the best work doesn’t come from exhaustion and fear. A study by Google found that high psychological safety in teams leads to 31 percent more innovation. Prioritizing safety doesn’t just protect people, it elevates the work itself. How many other productions have come close to tragedy without the public ever hearing about it? A producer’s success can’t just be measured in accolades and bottom lines. A true culture shift will require action from those in power who set the tone for how productions operate. By committing to sets that center humanity, where people feel energized, valued, and fulfilled, we do more than improve our individual productions. We raise the standard for how great work gets made.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

She made us enemies in a way that I never understood,” Usher said […] Court documents obtained by Us in April 2024 stated that Quinn was seeking sole legal and physical custody because Richard’s “actions and behavior have put our son’s health and wellbeing at risk.” She has since moved to Texas with her son, which has benefitted them both. “This is something that had been under the surface for a long time. Quinn made the decision to cut ties with Richard after seeing how it affected their son, adding, “There are certain things that I could tolerate, and it got to a point where it was affecting my son, and that wasn’t okay. During the rare interview, Quinn brought up an example of Richard’s alleged behavior.

Quinn famously wore a black wedding dress while the pair exchanged vows. “There were times where my husband, literally, where I had to go to work and he would lay himself under my car,” she claimed. Quinn continued: “It was really hard for me because I look at my parents. While Richard did not respond to Quinn’s recent claims, his lawyer Alexandra Kazarian previously released a statement. “The depths of Ms. Quinn’s delusion are once again on display. Her wild and unsubstantiated allegations have not stopped and her lack of credibility is best understood when read in conjunction with the unprecedented public statement by LAPD that her claims of hotel room bugging and alleged surveillance by Christian were unfounded,” read a 2024 statement after Quinn filed for a restraining order.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

WEST PALM BEACH, FL—Finding himself stopped upon entering a building at the Trump International Golf Club, Vice President JD Vance was reportedly reminded by a staff member Tuesday that caddies are not allowed in the clubhouse. “Sir, sir, you can’t go in there,” said head of guest services Melanie Cole, gently taking the vice president by the elbow and escorting him back out the front door. “We can’t have caddies scrounging for tips around the dining area. If you’re looking for a restroom or somewhere to wash off your shoes, you’ll find everything you need in the caddy shack down the road. And the host stand will radio if you’re needed by a club member, all right? Now I don’t want to see you in here again, or we’ll have to dock your pay.” Cole added privately that she suspected Vance was the one stealing golf pencils.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

NORFOLK, VA—Rolling their eyes at her mindless embrace of that which brings her happiness in life, sources confirmed Tuesday that basic woman Madison Derry’s entire personality revolves around things she enjoys. “I honestly kind of cringe seeing how Maddy just goes along with what naturally appeals to her,” said local woman Kelly Olsen, who scoffed at how Derry’s taste in everything from clothing to movies and music appears to be dictated not by a need to project a certain image of herself but by how much she likes those things. “Imagine being such a normie that you only like things that bring genuine joy to your life. She hasn’t made any effort to look past all this stuff she finds meaning and beauty in to see why she should be embarrassed by it. Doesn’t she ever give a thought to what random strangers might think of her? She should try being a little original and force herself to pretend she hates what she likes. That’s way more authentic.” According to reports, Olsen and some of her friends recently spent an entire hour scrolling through Derry’s Instagram and laughing at the triteness of her loving relationships with her parents and husband.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-bachelor-recap-season-29-fantasy-suites-week.html'>The Bachelor Recap: An Adventurous Wife</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 12:23:51 <p>
This is a pretty gloomy episode of The Bachelor, especially for Fantasy Suites Week! Is anyone getting what they want out of this process? Is this going to turn out well for anyone involved? There’s a lot going wrong here: A lack of any real sexual chemistry between Grant and the ladytestants; Grant saying “I love you” completely unprompted; production giving Zoe the absolute worst date. Now, he’s not objectifying them by talking about their bodies or how sexy they are; and maybe a little bit of that would be helpful, even, to show us chemistry between Grant and the top three. No, I mean that he keeps referring to them as “a wife” or “a mother,” reducing them to the role they’ll play in his life. The most egregious instance is when he says, “When I saw Zoe with her friends and family, I saw a wife.” Zoe was transported to another plane of existence, and she became A Wife. Grant has not said anything meaningful or specific about any of the women except where they rank on the A Wife scale. So let’s see how each woman ranks on the Adventurous-Wife Scale. This episode looks like it was edited by the team behind Fast & Furious! We get a backstory drop on Grant in the first five minutes: He’s part Dominican, his grandma was from there, he played basketball there for three years. It’s like Grant is playing a game of The Traitors called The Wife in which one of the women is secretly his wife and he’s going to banish everyone else. The show is keeping up this “Pairing the women with a former contestant with similar emotional themes” thing, and I would say Juliana’s emotional doppelgänger is Daisy, if Juliana were angling to be the Bachelorette and very ambivalent about the Bachelor. Juliana tells Daisy about the fact that she was cheated on repeatedly in her last relationship and is having trouble opening up or trusting or something. Daisy tells her that she has no regrets. Easy to have no regrets when you ended up with Terrible Herbst the Fourth. There are no run-and-jumps on any of these dates! Instead, Juliana and Grant are going four-wheeling, and Juliana needs a lot of validation that Grant likes her hair after it was in a helmet. I think Juliana is secretly in the lead because neither of them have doubts about each other. So if she needs to be told her bangs still look cute after being in a helmet, that’s fine. You might think there would be some drama about Juliana feeling insecure that the other women are also there. You might think there would be some drama about Juliana feeling insecure that her and Grant haven’t said “I love you” yet. Is there any drama or forward momentum? Part of the reason is we’ve heard some of this information about Juliana’s past relationship before and Grant offers so little about himself or his past relationships that there’s nothing to latch on to. I don’t know how much more ink can be spilled on the amount of inner-child work Grant needs to do, but holy fucking smokes. Grant says that the moment today when her hair was all messed up and she didn’t even know she was beautiful was so important, and he’s ready to take the lead. He totally told her she was making it to the next week, right? Ellis” and says, “Bye, boyfriend!” She’s really trying to get that shit over. She dips her cute little toes in the pool on her balcony and allows the dark thoughts to come flooding back in. This date shouldn’t have happened for so many reasons. Chief among them: They don’t know each other! Also, the filming this season was two weeks shorter, so there is an alternate universe where Zoe got a one-on-one date, and who knows if she would have made it to Fantasy Suites! Which is a disservice to Zoe because she seems cool! And like someone who may just not be made for reality TV. I said during Hometowns that she and Grant looked really good together, and this episode … they look very awkward together. Their daytime date is designed to get into Zoe’s head. I need Zoe to be a bad bitch and take over the date. Instead, it seems like the two of them can’t even maintain eye contact for more than 15 seconds. (She also met with Rachel before the daytime portion of the date, and you can see it dawn on Rachel how not good this is going for Zoe.) Zoe keeps saying she wants “the romance and the softness.” She clearly wants to feel like a viable option and wants Grant (and the show) to treat her like a potential romantic partner. And she keeps reiterating she wants a man to see her as deserving of love and then the love will come. During the nighttime portion of the date, we don’t even get to that because Zoe has more pressing questions, like, “What’s your whole fucking deal, dude?” They’re literally still at the “Tell me about yourself” stage and an engagement is supposed to happen next week. My favorite exchange is when Grant tells her that his favorite color is blue and she asks him, “What’s my favorite color?” and he goes “Is it blue?” This is a man who needs his partner to reflect his values and experiences so much that they definitely have the same favorite color, right? Zoe says that those issues are present in her family as well, and they seem to be starting down a road of some compatibility. Then Grant goes off on his flights of magical thinking and says he wanted to mend his family’s brokenness and be in a family that eats dinner together. He doesn’t really engage with Zoe saying she’s been through similar experiences, and they both pivot into generic TikTok relationship goals: “I’m looking for someone to build an empire with.” Ladies, no you don’t. You want a man who will fold the laundry unprompted. They head to the Fantasy Suite and … where did their chemistry go? Instead of seeing them in bed the next morning, they are heading to a picnic on the beach. The show is giving Litia a conflicted winner’s edit, and I’m very interested to see where this goes. She is racing through several different Fantasy Suite Week tropes and dismisses them until she lands on the one she’s going to work with for the rest of the episode. It seems like Litia might be gearing up for an ultimatum if Grant sleeps with anyone else during Fantasy Suites, but that never materializes. Litia ultimately lands on “no sex in the Fantasy Suite,” and I can’t tell if that’s a hard moral boundary or a result of her wanting to hurl on this zip-line date. The answer is a solid “no,” but Grant mostly ignores that. Litia is about to vomit and/or sue the zip-line company, and Grant is like, “Wow, she’s a trooper!” They head to a cenote and start talking about their future. Grant mentions that his father is in a rehab program in New Jersey, and Litia chimes in, “SO WE CAN MOVE TO NEW YORK?” Listen, my family’s business for basically my entire life has been addiction medicine. My mom ran a treatment center for many years. I don’t think “We’re gonna move to the biggest city near my dad’s rehab” is a thing? I think Litia is treating Grant’s father as if he has a terminal illness and is gearing up for that kind of in-law experience, and while very admirable, it’s not exactly the same as being a full-time caregiver. Grant and Litia just keep saying, “I want you to be happy. There’s going to be a lot of self-sacrifice with these two! Grant asks Litia what the next step is, and she says, “Meet your family and get engaged.” She’s watched this show. Grant is trying to get a read on how quickly she wants to have kids since everyone in her family told him she was an old crone who needs to be with child. Grant seems a little freaked out by this timeline. He mostly seems like a guy who has never really thought about the fact that it gets harder for women to get pregnant as they get older and was really asking if she wanted to go to Japan or Brazil after they get engaged. They get the Fantasy Suite card, and it sounds like Litia is going to say “no,” but she just wants to say “no physical intimacy.” Grant says he respects that and it shows maturity to not build their foundation on sex and then he says, “I do love you.” She says it back, and they head to the Fantasy Suites floating on air. I don’t have time to unpack whatever relationship gibberish Grant was spouting about sex as something that can get in the way of a foundation for a relationship. Because the next morning, Grant looks positively shook. It seems like the reality of telling Litia that he loves her is sinking in, and he says, “Should I stop now and pick Litia? What am I gonna doooo?” And he’s very confused about this. We all know how this is going to go down. Zoe is eliminated, and Grant tells her how hard this has all been on him. The way I have written “AND NOTHING FOR ZOE?” in my notes more than once this episode is depressing. Then I thought my DVR had somehow traveled forward in time and started the finale episode. He says his parents haven’t been together in like seven years and he feels good that his family is supporting him and coming together for this.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview'>Gwyneth Paltrow on Motherhood, MAHA, Meghan Markle, Making Out With Timothée Chalamet—and Much More</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tmz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 12:00:00 <p>
A kitchen that, when Architectural Digest unveiled it in a home tour in 2022, virally eclipsed the entire Nancy Meyers canon as the bougie platonic ideal. The marble-topped island range, where Paltrow lovingly concocts Instagram-famous “boyfriend breakfasts” for her husband of six years, TV producer Brad Falchuk. The room is bathed in natural California light and almost eerily quiet because, as we also know, her children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, 20, and Moses, 18, are off at college. Paltrow wears a greige cardigan, white wide-leg jeans, shearling-lined clogs, and no apparent makeup. (Stealth wealth, which we’ll get to in a bit.) At 52 she looks refreshingly like herself, with flaxen hair and vintage Noxzema-commercial skin. She woke up before 6 and checked her email in the dark. Though she stocks almond, hemp, and macadamia milks for guests (we’ll get to the raw milk of it all too), the wellness maven takes her own coffee with a splash of heavy cream. “Our friend Demi got nominated,” Paltrow beams as a screenshot pops up on her laptop showing her, a bespectacled Demi Moore, podcaster–slash–Nobody Wants This producer Sara Foster, and jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer with mouths agape on FaceTime this morning, which happens to be Oscar nomination day, celebrating Moore’s nod for The Substance. “There’s this weird, deep grief that comes with letting go, saying goodbye, and then calling into question your own purpose,” Paltrow says. She’s emerging from soft retirement with her first substantial film role in 15 years in director Josh Safdie’s period Ping-Pong romp Marty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet as the titular 1950s hustler and Paltrow’s sidepiece, which has been teased in a passionate makeout scene rippling online. Rumors are brewing about a Venice Film Festival premiere late this summer (though studio A24 says the chatter is not accurate). Cinephiles are already frothing over Marty’s Christmas Day release, a marquee date for awards contenders. “I think her absence from acting has lent a vulnerability to her abilities.” It doesn’t seem like posturing when Paltrow tells me she was nervous—really nervous—to return. She counts 2010’s Country Strong as the last movie in which she was “laying it all on the line and accessing a kind of vulnerability.” With all due respect to Pepper Potts and the Marvel universe, “it’s different when you’re reprising an Avengers thing.” Plagued by self-doubt, Paltrow turned to one of the few other Hollywood heavyweights who peaced in her prime. “Cameron Diaz is one of my best friends, sorry to name-drop,” she grins. Paltrow is reentering Hollywood while she juggles being the embattled CEO of her intrepid lifestyle company, Goop, determined to refocus her corporate baby in the wake of layoffs last fall and headlines that seemed to revel in the reorganization. And after dedicating herself to motherhood since Apple’s birth in 2004, she’s contending with the disorienting sadness and newfound freedom of her children leaving their Brentwood nest, a former equestrian estate she listed last June and was in the process of selling before the wildfires ravaged her hometown—the movers are en route to Montecito as we speak. Plus, “I’m going through hard-core perimenopause,” Paltrow notes, “which doesn’t help.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tracy Morgan left last night’s New York Knicks game in a wheelchair after being sick at his courtside seat. The 30 Rock star began vomiting during the third quarter of the game at Madison Square Garden and had a nosebleed. Morgan shared on Instagram the next day that he had food poisoning and is “doing ok now.” The game was delayed for about ten minutes, per CBS Sports, while staff took care of Morgan and cleaned the court. “We hope Tracy feels better soon and look forward to seeing him back courtside,” an MSG spokesperson told Vulture. “Appreciate my MSG family for taking such good care of me and I need to shout out the crew that had to clean that up. Appreciate you!” Morgan added in his post. “More importantly, the Knicks are now 1-0 when I throw up on the court so maybe I’ll have to break it out again in the playoffs 😅” Morgan has diabetes and has dealt with alcoholism, topics that frequently come up in his stand-up and on 30 Rock. He had a kidney transplant in 2010 and has been open in the past few years about taking Ozempic for his diabetes. The comedian, who was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the Bronx, has been a longtime fan of the Knicks and frequently sits courtside for their games.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/mara-wilson-essay-child-actress-michelle-trachtenberg.html'>My Cool Friend Michelle</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 11:09:57 <p>
This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. The moment I knew I was going to get along very well with Michelle Trachtenberg, she was in an ice-cube battle with Jonathan Lipnicki. But it stuck with me for a different reason: She was being nice to him. Jonathan was five years younger than her, but she didn’t treat him like an annoyance. I knew so many older girls who were mean to younger kids, but she wasn’t, even when Jonathan was trying to slip an ice cube down the back of her shirt. “Oh no, you don’t!” she said with a laugh, turning on him with her own ice cubes, and he giggled maniacally. Michelle Trachtenberg seemed to me the epitome of the Cool Older Girl: beautiful, stylish, funny, from New York — so much cooler than my hometown of Burbank, California. But as soon as we were introduced, she gave me a huge, warm smile, then looked at my dress and said “Eurokids, right? Yet she managed not to be condescending and didn’t try to impress with big words, the way other kids (including me) might have. Before we left the awards show, Michelle told me she’d be seeing me again: We were both going to be at the Audrey Hepburn Foundation’s Hollywood for Children charity film festival in New York in a few months. That’s where I would find out it wasn’t just me: Everybody fell in love with Michelle Trachtenberg. When I started acting at 5 years old, my parents made it known that no matter what happened, I would live the most normal childhood possible. As time went on, though, life hardly ever felt normal — except, ironically, when I was with other child actors. Imagine a group of child and teen actors hanging out together, and you probably think the worst: everything from being shitty to wait staff to wrecking hotel rooms like mini rock stars. “We were all in that space as actors, but had it not been for these charities, we probably wouldn’t have been able to bond on the level we were able to,” says Vanessa Lee Chester, who had met Michelle on the set of a Panasonic commercial when they were both 5. At the same time the Pussy Posse was wreaking havoc around New York, my group of child-actor friends were making PSAs about wearing bicycle helmets, walking in fashion shows to support Multiple Sclerosis research, and giving Christmas gifts to children in hospitals. That group included Chester; Ashley Johnson; Andrew Keegan; Jonathan Taylor Thomas; Rider Strong; Lindsay Felton; Mae Whitman; Bryton McClure; Michael Fishman; Raven-Symoné; Miko Hughes; Taran Noah Smith; Zane, Paris, and Reeve Carney; Tia, Tamera, and Tahj Mowry; Adam Wylie; and many more. After, we’d gather at a restaurant — usually Planet Hollywood — or someone’s home. We’d sing Beatles songs and showtunes our parents taught us in the car, and pretend to be secret agents with walkie-talkies borrowed from generous security guards (“Come in, Thunderbird! “We fucking lived for those nights at Planet Hollywood,” Chester says. “We were all too young even to go to teen clubs, so these were our social moments.” Michelle had donated her spy belt from Harriet to Planet Hollywood, and Robin Williams gave one of his Mrs. Doubtfire dresses. For us, it felt less like a kitschy theme restaurant and more like being at a relative’s house, surrounded by family knicknacks. When she told us a set anecdote or a shaggy dog joke, in her slight New York accent — “Harriet” was “Haah-rriet, never “Herr-riet” — everyone would listen. That wasn’t a surprise to Danny Tamberelli, who worked with her on the Nickelodeon sitcom The Adventures of Pete & Pete (she played his best friend, Nona). Her second week on set, he decided to stay in his trailer and play his bass instead of going to lunch. “She hid the auxiliary cord from me,” he says, because she was annoyed that he wasn’t hanging out with her at lunch. “I got the message,” he says with a laugh. A studio teacher on Pete & Pete once taught him how to do a card trick; he was able to trick adults on the set, but he couldn’t fool Michelle. You can’t shuffle it!’ She blew me up.” Michelle can do anything, I remember thinking — until the night someone handed her a mic and said, “Hey, Michelle, freestyle rap for us!” She tried for about ten seconds, but couldn’t think of anything to say besides just the word “rap” over and over again, and dissolved into giggles. Front, left to right: Miko Hughes, Paris Carney, and Mara Wilson. That April of 1997, while we were at the film festival, marked one year since my mother had died. Still, on the anniversary of her death, I burst into tears. This so impressed my normally cold grandmother that she allowed me to have a hotel sleepover with my best friend of the group, Paris Carney, a sweet child actress and singer. And what did we talk about at the sleepover? “Yeah, not even a crush, but in love!” Paris said. This was particularly scandalous to us because she already had a boyfriend. She was dating Paris’s sweet and funny older brother, Zane, a child actor and a regular on the CBS sitcom Dave’s World. It was a very middle-school relationship, no more than sitting next to each other and occasionally holding hands, but everyone knew they were together. “I mean, she belongs to God,” Paris said, laughing. But for me, it felt like love.” He’d developed a huge crush on Michelle after he saw Harriet the Spy; they met when she was cast as his preteen love interest on Dave’s World. A few months after my sleepover with Paris, someone told me there were photos from the Audrey Hepburn Hollywood for Children film festival in a teen fan magazine. Under it was the caption “SCOOP: Michelle Trachtenberg and Zane Carney are an item!” Imagine your middle-school dating life being discussed in a national magazine. Michelle and I did events together all the next year. We went on a charity cruise together, where we sang along to the Grease Megamix, and she assured me that my ’40s-inspired outfit — a sort of half–Rosie the Riveter, half-pinup-model outfit an older girl had dressed me in — for “Retro Night” wasn’t too last-minute, or too mature, like I worried. “You’re like one of those ‘limited edition’ collectible dolls.” We had the kind of closeness that grows between girls who’ve spent a short but intense amount of time together, like summer-camp friends. There were only so many times I could fly out to New York. Then something surprising happened: She moved to where I lived, in Burbank, and we ended up at the same middle school. Surely, I thought, she’d be one of the beloved girls in school. Every time I even heard someone say “Michelle Trachtenberg,” a kid would jump in to say that they’d heard she was mean, full of herself, a total bitch. I couldn’t reconcile it with the Michelle I’d known, the one who was never anything but warm and kind. I’d gotten the feeling she might have a feisty side, but that just made me like her more. I remember wondering if the kids at school were jealous. A lot of students were aspiring actors: One week three people in my class were excused early to audition for the same Nickelodeon TV show. There was always a lot of resentment toward the kids who’d “made it.” We’d both been up for the role of Penny in Inspector Gadget (she got it), and she was just about to be cast as Dawn Summers, Sarah Michelle Gellar’s sister on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I’d see her around school, with a small group of friends, and while she always looked gorgeous, she usually didn’t look happy. She probably won’t want anything to do with me now, I thought, and kept my distance. It was the first time we’d had a one-on-one conversation that wasn’t just a quick “hi” in the hall since I’d started middle school. “Are the kids here mean to you?” she asked. “Because they are to me,” she said, tearing up. I’d never seen her anything other than perfectly composed and confident. It wasn’t just that she was being bullied; it was that there wasn’t any way she could get them not to hate her. So much of being a child actor is about making everyone happy. Photo: Courtesy of Vanessa Lee Chester and Karen Bradford When I started high school a few years later, though, both my friend group at school and my crew of child actors splintered, and I found myself in the same place Michelle had been. I transferred to a different high school, one for the visual and performing arts. I don’t know how she got through it. She always seemed to be working while mostly avoiding being tabloid fodder. Probably because, more than anything, she truly loved acting. Even after I lost contact with her post–middle school, she never failed to surprise me. “Michelle Trachtenberg is so mean on Gossip Girl,” a college acquaintance once told me, “that I feel like she just has to be a bitch in real life.” “Because she’s a good actress,” I said, rolling my eyes. Would she want to be friends with me now? I sat in a chair, and started to sob. I went through my Instagram and was instantly overwhelmed by all the tributes to her. Not only were all of my childhood friends posting about her but so were so many people I never knew had known her. Comedians, musicians, actors, people I’d met as adults. But the next week, I was in New York, and I lost count of how many times people told me they’d seen my post and said, “I am so sorry about Michelle.” Not Michelle Trachtenberg. All the while, I couldn’t stop thinking of my childhood friend group. So many of them I had just recently begun to reconnect with. I started texting and messaging all my friends who’d known Michelle. Zane had stayed in touch with Michelle the longest. His brother, Reeve, ran into her in Ireland while he was filming Penny Dreadful, and finally, the preteen sweethearts reconnected at a New Year’s Eve party in 2015. She cackled when she saw him, and he felt as if he were seeing “the fully realized Michelle Trachtenberg.” They stayed up until four in the morning talking, and because their relationship had been so innocent, it moved easily into a deep, platonic friendship. From then on, she would always try to come see him play music, especially when he was performing with Evan Rachel Wood (who, Zane says, also loved Michelle). “‘Joy’ is the word that comes up when I think of our connection,” he says of his grown-up friendship with Michelle. There was so much of, like, ‘oh my God, what did we go through? He laughed and admitted that once when he was 11, he had collapsed on his bed after a long phone call with Michelle and exclaimed, “I’m so glad she’s mine!” That earned him a gentle lecture from his mom about Michelle, and women in general, not being his property. But I was glad they’d had each other. I noticed a shift happening in the early 2000s, when former friends of mine, like Hilary Duff, suddenly had to be pop stars and actors and entrepreneurs. It only got more complicated when social media came around. And being a kid is complicated enough on its own. I thought about this a lot when, last week, for the first time in years, I sat down to re-watch Harriet the Spy. Though if I could have lived one week of my life over again, I might have chosen the week I spent at the film festival in New York, with Michelle and all of our friends. At one point in the film, Michelle, as Harriet, makes a snide observation about a girl in her class as the camera pans over to the girl at her locker, which was covered in photos of teen idols. That’s when I burst out laughing, through my tears: They were all boys who had been in our group.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/happy-gilmore-2-everything-we-know.html'>‘Happy Gilmore 2’ Trailer, Cast, and Everything We Know</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 10:03:00 <p>
We can keep workshopping the name, but the fact remains that a Happy Gilmore sequel is coming to Netflix. News of the film first broke (if you don’t count Shooter McGavin blabbin’ on the radio) at Netflix’s Upfront presentation in May 2024. Now, we have our first official trailer, featuring a Happy that’s happy to be back golfing, Julie Bowen, and no alligators in the sky (as of yet). Below, everything we know about the upcoming comedy, from trailer to cast. Sandler reps the New England team (amid their terrible, terrible season) by wearing a jersey throughout the trailer. Plus, Ben Stiller takes a break from prestige TV to return as Hal. “Holy shhhhh …” Mr. Gilmore reacts for us all. Who else will be in Happy Gilmore 2? Hmmm… what are Lana Del Rey’s avails? Christopher McDonald and Julie Bowen are both back. New cast members include Margaret Qualley, Travis Kelce, and Bad Bunny. Does that mean Taylor Swift is going to attend the premiere? Margaret Qualley went on the show September 24 to share how her husband lied to get her a spot in HG2. Apparently Adam Sandler has a texting relationship with Jack Antonoff. Does your wife golf at all?” To which Jacko replied “yeah she’s actually good!” Now, Qualley says she does, in fact, golf. But Antonoff’s little white lies secured a small part in the Happy Gilmore sequel for Qualley. Travis Kelce has successfully clawed his way into Happy Gilmore 2. “Travis has… he mentioned it, so we have a nice something for Travis,” Sandler said on The Tonight Show. You guys would love him in real life. Between Qualley and Kelce, that’s 2 of 2 Happy Gilmore 2 casting announcements straight from Taylor Swift’s squad. When is Happy Gilmore 2 coming to Netflix?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s not Opening Day—at least not in the traditional sense—but MLB is starting the season in Japan with a pair of games between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs. Shohei Ohtani‘s rise, the success of the 2023 World Baseball Classic and an influx of other young Japanese stars—many of whom play in Los Angeles and Chicago—have opened the door for larger commercial opportunities for the league in Japan. Does it threaten to lessen the excitement? Before that, the hosts break down a number of business stories related to March Madness. North Carolina snuck into the men’s draw as the final team chosen, a notable decision given that a) UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham is chair of the selection committee, and b) Cunningham earned a $68,000 bonus for the Tar Heels’ selection. One of the teams left out in UNC’s place was West Virginia. The hosts also talk about some business oddities related to the coaches, top seeds and biggest-name players. This is yet another season where there may be more recognizable players in the women’s draw than the men’s tournament. They close by talking about the Cincinnati Bengals, which just committed nearly $300 million to their two star wideouts.

Are Celine Song and her husband just gonna take turns dropping a love-triangle movie every other year? Song, the mind behind 2023’s Past Lives who is married to Justin Kuritzkes, writer of the screenplay for 2024’s Challengers, has a new movie in theaters as the writer-director of A24’s Materialists. Dakota Johnson leads the cast as an ambitious New York City matchmaker who seems torn between (who could’ve guessed!) Maybe the new trailer will help you decide. The trailer introduces an original Japanese Breakfast song … and Johnson as Lucy, a matchmaker who is willing to stop random guys on the street to see if they’re potential customers. Some of her clients have very specific criteria (“nothing over 20 BMI,” “more grown” but still young), while others are a little more open (“I’m trying to settle”). She’s entertaining both connections, but her overall stance on relationships seems to be getting more complicated. “I don’t think I’m very good at my job, anymore,” she says at one point, later musing that people get married “because they’re lonely, and because they’re hopeful.” Johnson, Evans, and Pascal have our main love triangle covered.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-movie-that-led-charli-xcx-to-jeremy-o-harris-and-pete-ohs.html'>The Movie That Led Charli XCX to Jeremy O. Harris & Pete Ohs</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 08:00:08 <p>
Not long before they absconded to Poland to make a movie with Charli XCX at the height of Brat mania, Jeremy O. Harris and director Pete Ohs spent two weeks making a very different movie in the wilderness — upstate Massachusetts, that is. “You’re not supposed to mix Bergman with Beyond Fest,” Ohs jokes. The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick premiered earlier this month at South by Southwest, ushering in what could be a big year for Ohs and Harris. A Play., and Harris was attracted to his fluid Mike Leigh–ish filmmaking process, which he’d also employed on the similarly microbudget indies Jethica and Everything Beautiful Is Far Away (the latter starring Julia Garner). The film runs a lean 80 minutes, dipping into Get Out and Rosemary’s Baby territory as Yvonne begins to doubt — and then reluctantly embrace — the eeriness of her roommates’ rustic nonchalance. When Yvonne discovers a tick bite on her upper back one morning, the others assure her it’s nothing a little clove oil or black walnut can’t fix. Any city dweller knows what it’s like to make a brief escape to greener pastures, but what happens when that exodus becomes an entire doxycycline-agnostic lifestyle? Ohs and his cast originally intended to make a sexier movie, but they were operating under SAG’s Micro-Budget Project Agreement, which prohibits nudity and simulated sex on productions costing less than $20,000. Around that time, Harris had been hanging out with wealthy fashion types who would casually reference their tick-induced Lyme disease — the same condition that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alumna Yolanda Hadid once compared to HIV. Ohs created a loose outline satirizing the sometimes–galaxy-brained wellness industry that’s reportedly worth upwards of $6 billion. “It does match my own writing in some ways because I like to take a bold swing at the start and not know where I’m gonna end up,” Harris told Vulture at the W Austin hotel during SXSW. I wanted it to be like, Where the fuck are they? Harris and Ohs, having encountered Charli XCX around 3 a.m. at the Lower East Side bar Clandestino about a month before Brat came out, made Erupcja that way, too. It’s one of several forthcoming roles for Charli, a cinephile who, according to Harris, bumps Criterion titles left and right. (Her other future club classics include Gregg Araki’s first film in 11 years, a Faces of Death remake, and an A24 pop-star mockumentary that she originated.) But whereas Tick was made in isolation, Erupcja (which does not yet have a release date or distributor) roves through Warsaw, hence why news of the production leaked last August. People who enjoyed Charli’s hyperclubby Grammys performance in February (and pretty much everything she has done in the past year) might be surprised to learn that she wanted to play against type here. What would it be like to play this new person?”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The reality show premiered in September 2024 and became an overnight success as viewers tuned in to see Taylor Frankie Paul, Whitney Leavitt, Jen Affleck, Demi Engemann, Mikayla Matthews, Mayci Neeley, Jessi Ngatikaura and Layla Taylor navigate their personal highs and lows. “There’s so many stories that these women have to share,” Pistotnik told Us Weekly for a September 2024 cover story. Season 1 of hit reality series, which follows a group of Mormon mom influencers, debuted on Hulu in September 2024 following star Taylor Frankie Paul‘s “soft swinging” sex scandal. Keep scrolling for everything that happened to The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives before season 2: During season 1, Whitney found out she was pregnant in the aftermath of a cheating scandal with husband Connor Leavitt. All viewers wanted to discuss after The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives premiered was Jen and Zac’s controversial marriage. Jen defended Zac until filming picked back up, when rumors swirled about their relationship status. In February 2025, Jen confirmed she was expecting her and Zac’s third baby. She later completed an 11-day wellness program to help heal her past trauma. “Not the pregnancy journey I expected, but definitely what baby and I needed,” Jen, who shares daughter Nora and son Luca with Zac, wrote via Instagram in March 2025 before quoting a proverb by an unknown speaker. The couple started dating in 2018 and got married one year later. After expanding their family twice, Jen and Zac joined the cast of Hulu’s […] Taylor’s Split From Dakota After an Unclear Relationship Status That was the question all of Us — including Taylor — were asking when season 1 dropped in September 2025. At the time, Taylor hinted to Us that Dakota wasn’t happy with how he was portrayed on the show and that led to an off-and-on romance. “When I realized I haven’t been in the dating scene since I was 20 and eventually will have to go back to that,” Taylor, who shares two kids with ex-husband Tate Paul and a son with Dakota, wrote via Instagram in February 2025 before answering questions about the next chapter in her life. “The vision for the show never changed in that it is one part very loud and frothy soap opera with a little bit of cheating. But then at the same time, you have this fascinating exploration of a religious faith,” executive producer Jeff Jenkins told Us about keeping the story lines “balanced” on screen. Religion has challenges within it and things that some folks would like to be changed. The reality show premiered in September 2024 and became an overnight success as viewers tuned in to see Taylor Frankie Paul, Whitney Leavitt, Jen Affleck, Demi Engemann, Mikayla […] “I’m a lot better than I was, but I still have my ups and downs, so it’s just frustrating to not get any answers and feel like I’m on my own and then have to navigate being in this really exciting time while not feeling my best,” Mikayla told Us in September 2024 about her health issues. After filming on season 2 wrapped, Mayci revealed in February 2025 that she is expecting baby No. I think when you do IVF, it’s not a fun process. Usually you tell your friends and family that you’re doing it, so there are no secrets or surprises,” she told People at the time. While Taylor’s soft-swinging scandal was mentioned in season 1, it wasn’t until the show aired that Miranda McWhorter and Camille Munday were brought up as potential participants. Taylor didn’t rule out one — or both — of them making appearances in season 2 and Miranda was ultimately confirmed as a new cast member. “It’s out of my control and they have a show to do. At this point it’s just out of my control.” Related: Meet the Women Behind MomTok on ‘The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ Disney/Fred Hayes Mormon “Momtok” has made its way from your phone to your TV with Hulu’s upcoming series The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. The mom influencers took over TikTok in 2022 with their unconventional lifestyles while also “breaking a norm” associated with their religious practices and gender roles. There were several falling outs while the cast filmed season 1 — and after. Gone were the days Demi and Jessi posted TikTok videos poking fun at how similar they looked. Instead, both of them have shared cryptic clips hinting at their friendship coming to an end. From there, Taylor’s friendship status with each cast member was called into question after she claimed they weren’t supporting her. “Not a single one of my girls from MomTok said anything on my CMA post, such a big night for me,” she wrote via Instagram in November 2024. Jessi, Demi, Mikayla and Mayci defended themselves while denying the drama was for a story line. “One thing about me, I’m not playing into anything online or a storyline,” Jessie wrote via her Instagram Story. If only you guys knew what’s really going on behind the scenes. She continued: “Sure you don’t have to like my stuff. For all the girls telling me I should have handled this differently and offline as they’re literally eating me alive online right now, maybe they feel justified but don’t come at me if you’re going to do the exact same thing.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/is-netflix-adolescence-based-on-a-true-story.html'>Is Netflix’s Adolescence Based on Real Adolescents?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 02:27:47 <p>
Adolescence opens with a dramatic arrest: 13-year-old Jamie (Owen Cooper) is accused of stabbing his classmate, Katie, to death. (Every episode of Adolescence is shot in one continuous take.) Many people online are also wondering whether this crime drama is a work of true-crime. Andrew Tate is name-dropped, and he’s real whether we like it or not — but is the main murder plot of this series also based in reality? Below, what co-creator and star Stephen Graham has said about the inspiration behind Adolescence. Jamie’s story itself is not based on a specific person or event, but per Birmingham Live, Graham noted that real reports of knife crime did give him the idea for what the series would be about. “I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, ‘Why is this happening today? Adolescence’s release follows the January sentencing of an 18-year-old to at least 52 years in prison for killing three young girls last summer at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in Southport when he was 17. The series was “conceived and written months before” that attack, according to Entertainment Weekly, but the subject material unfortunately continues to feel timely. As recently as last week, an 18-year-old was sentenced to at least 23 years in prison for fatally stabbing a 15-year-old girl in London when he was 17. Do we know anything about the inspiration for Jamie’s parents? Graham has not named any specific direct inspirations, but he has said that his own reaction to knife attacks shaped the way that Jamie’s parents, played by himself and Christine Tremarco, is portrayed in the series. He told The Hollywood Reporter that people “blame the mom and dad” when they hear this type of news involving kids from “council estates,” or British public housing. However, he told Rolling Stone UK and Drama Quarterly that questioning that initial instinct made him decide to focus on what was happening with Jamie and not have the parents be violent or alcoholics. “I wanted the dad to be a hardworking man,” Graham noted, “the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, six in the morning and not get home till 8 o’clock at night, Monday to Friday.” In GQ, Graham credited co-writer and co-creator Jack Thorne for coming up with the “incel stuff” in the series and doing research about online radicalization. “I was looking online at a workout thing that our [son] Alfie sent me, and it was a good workout,” he told Rolling Stone UK. “Three or four days later, the algorithm — which I don’t understand — showed me the same gentleman again, and he was telling me his misogynistic opinions and views.” In his GQ interview, Graham added that his daughter Grace was the one who then identified Tate and explained who he was. “So what if I was a 13-year-old boy who didn’t have the greatest relationship with my father, didn’t really have that solid connection with a role model, and was finding my feet out there?”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s starting to feel like Groundhog Day on the Katina. At least since episode five, the same “conflicts” have recurred without escalating in any significant way. Adair seems so lost it’s like she wandered onto the boat by accident. Gossip and confrontation are the pillars of good reality television writ large, but what makes a great season of Below Deck is more specific and somewhat counter-intuitive. It’s soothing because it’s a way to exorcize the demons that have been lodged into your soul by a job. At its strongest, Below Deck speaks directly to that instinct. When that appeal starts fizzling out like Bri and Harry’s lukewarm relationship, our engagement also begins to drag. In the morning after their first night out, Johnny says more to her than Harry has over the entire course of his semi-relationship with Bri. With a humble dignity that is rarely demonstrated by any male member of a deck team, he apologizes if his move made Alesia uncomfortable. In a confessional, we learn that Alesia is not officially trained as a chef but is hoping to learn on the job, which is enough to ensure she won’t try to dominate the kitchen like Anthony. For her part, Tzarina is already better at being a head of department: she doesn’t ask Alesia to list her weaknesses, and she clearly communicates her expectations that the sous will take on crew food and help clean up. In the light of morning, the boatmance landscape looks unchanged: Lara facepalms when Wihan tells her that he kissed Tzarina even after telling her that he is interested in Adair. Bri tells Marina that she is reaching her last rope with Harry: if he doesn’t demonstrate more urgency and interest, things could quickly go south. She later tells Lara the same thing, which ends up being great for Harry — Lara warns him that he should step up if he wants things to progress between them, resulting in a nice text exchange that raises the heart rate from 50 to 60 bpm. Tzarina concludes that she and Wihan are nothing more than “flirty friends” who “shouldn’t drink around each other,” knowing full well they will continue to drink around each other for the next several weeks. Taking her tentativeness as encouragement, Wihan leaves his deck team working while he stalks to the nearby hotel to write Adair a love letter, which nearly made me choke on my chicken salad sandwich. As they get ready for the incoming guests to arrive, Lara puts Marina on housekeeping for the third consecutive charter, even though Marina has more experience as a stew than Bri. The crew goes to change into their whites, and as Wihan tells Harry about the letter he wrote for Adair, Lara mentions to Tzarina that she never sees Wihan working — another heroic effort by the editing team to defame Wihan’s reputation. They look like fun gals with enormous potential to be obnoxious. Perhaps unaware that requesting “local cuisine night” is just a more involved way of ordering Tzarina’s World Famous curry, they ask for the first night’s dinner theme to be “Seychelles Islands.” The stews all wear nice floral dresses, and Lara cooks up a scheme for the deck crew in which with every course they will shed another piece of clothing, so that by the end of dinner, they’ll be serving dessert in nothing but a pair of silver hot pants with a palm leaf hot-glued to it. When Lara pushes Wihan on why no one is available to help her set up the sundeck, or why it seems like the deck team relaxes more than they work, he tells her that he’s in a tough spot with Adair, because if she helps interiors too much, the rest of the crew will “start taking the piss out of that.” But isn’t Adair supposed to help both departments? What he doesn’t seem to take into consideration is that other members of his team are harder workers than he is; Johnny tells him simply that he doesn’t mind helping in the interior or anywhere. “Let’s keep the fun going, let’s keep the money flowing,” he proselytizes, in a line more beautiful than anything Wihan came up with. At first Marina is amused by the fact that Adair describes it as “redneck,” but then she’s just concerned. Whatever her type is, it’s definitely not Wihan in hot pants, through which Adair says she can see “inner thigh hair.” Her questionable taste in men notwithstanding, Adair is pretty funny, and it’s kind of bizarre that for someone so central to the season’s dominating plot, we barely know her at all. I wish there was a way to fact-check this, but for my money she has gotten the least amount of screen time out of everyone aboard, Jason’s fish included. His unhappiness is a little confusing, since he was the one rallying Johnny and Harry to degrade themselves in order to increase their tip prospects. I’m of two minds on this because while it’s obvious, as Harry points out, that Wihan’s grumpiness has nothing to do with taking his clothes off — it’s clear to everyone that he loves attention and wearing a speedo in front of guests ranks among the tamest things he’s done to entertain them — I have to agree with him that having the deck crew serve dinner half-naked every charter is getting old and gross. Bottom line, though, Wihan’s annoyance has to do with the fact that he feels bossed around by Lara, who is supposed to be his equal, not his superior. When he slid it under Adair’s cabin door, my whole body cringed so hard it basically folded onto itself in ways I had previously thought unimaginable. Somehow Adair manages to read the whole thing with a straight face, and when Marina comes into the cabin demanding gossip later, Adair doesn’t give away much: she basically only says that the note was sweet. I have a feeling that Adair is probably just a nice person who doesn’t want to embarrass anyone on national television, but if that’s true, Bravo is just not the place for her. In the morning, when she sees Wihan, she thanks him with a tight hug and promises to talk more later, which makes him very happy. Meanwhile, Lara and Tzarina realize that Wihan spent all his time trying to be Rimbaud and no time organizing the guests’ morning excursion. But when Lara and Tzarina ask him difficult questions such as “what time are we leaving” and “what time do you expect they will be ready to have lunch,” Wihan wings the answers. It’s a mystery why they don’t use their cellphones, but either way, it sends a chill down my spine to see all that food cooking in the sun, getting slimy and sweaty and swarmed with flies. In next week’s preview, we see that Lara and Tzarina have taken it upon themselves to talk with Wihan, which probably means the picnic was a disaster. Instead of immediately agreeing to a service that has nothing to do with the guests, or with her job at all, Alesia lays out a line of questioning. Not satisfied, Alesia tells Wihan he can make a cheese board himself if he’d like — she’s busy, not that Wihan can fathom the concept.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

'Last Argument We Had ... I Hurt You' 🕊️

Machine Gun Kelly has turned his sorrow over the death of close pal Luke "The Dingo" Trembath into a song ... with the release of a heartfelt tribute, titled "your name forever."

The music video is shot by MGK's longtime director Sam Cahill and uses splices of scenes from Dingo's funeral, in addition to a rooftop performance of the track.

On the song, MGK admits he went too far during their last argument, and notes Dingo left his coat at his house ... a reminder he'll never return to pick it up.

Dingo died last month and his cause of death is still unknown ... but his community of mourners have been rallying nonstop.

Popular muralist Royyal Dog painted a life-sized portrait of Dingo, and attendees at the funeral posed in front together in solidarity.

The late snowboarder's friends Synyster Gates and M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Oli Sykes of Bring Me The Horizon, Johnny Cappelletty, and Mod Sun all joined MGK in recording the track.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

TMZ has learned. Multiple sources tell us ... Kyle was looking to possibly scoop up the 6-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom Beverly Hills house just feet away from LVP's famous Villa Rosa property. We're told Kyle toured the place a few times, even bringing along her daughters. Lisa and her husband, Ken Todd, have been fixtures in the celebrity enclave since 2011. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan previously owned the house, but sold it for $5.9 million in 2021 following their divorce. When we reached Lisa for comment, she told us, "What on earth. A shame her offer wasn’t accepted because she’d finally be able to move into Beverly Hills." Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media. A rep for Kyle denies LVP's claim she ever made an offer. The rep says she never put in an offer because she decided the area is too much of a fire hazard.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

LaVar Ball is opening up on his recent amputation ... revealing this week complications with his diabetes were what caused him to lose a significant portion of his right leg. LiAngelo, LaMelo and Lonzo's father broke down his medical situation with SLAM on Tuesday ... and explained his health began deteriorating in January. He stated right around the time Gelo's hit single, "Tweaker," was going viral ... he got an infection on his foot "that started spreading through my blood due to not paying attention to my diabetes." "Then they cut off my foot," he said. "Then they said, 'We gotta go almost knee high for another surgery.'" In total, LaVar said he went under the knife three different times to fix the problem ... and then had to get four separate blood transfusions as well. He said it all took a real toll on him -- admitting that at one point, things got so bad, he considered death. Thankfully, Ball told the outlet his three sons encouraged him to keep fighting -- and now, he's doing much better. The 57-year-old was has been seen in recent weeks joking around on TikTok -- and even dancing in his chair to songs that he humorously changed the lyrics to. He's now encouraging everyone to get their routine doctor visits in so they can avoid situations similar to the one he's currently dealing with.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The original Mickey Mouse is out for blood in a new horror film based on Steamboat Willie ... and his targets are a group of princesses who are knockoffs of Disney stars. Sources close to the production of "Screamboat" tell TMZ ... five "Party Princesses" will serve as Steamboat Willie's victims, and they are loosely based on Disney princesses. It doesn't take a genius to figure it out, the princesses are based on Disney classics ... "Cinderella," Jasmine from "Aladdin," Belle from "Beauty and the Beast," Ariel from "Little Mermaid," and Aurora from "Sleeping Beauty." Steamboat Willie -- the OG Mickey Mouse from 1928 -- is now in the public domain ... meaning the beloved Disney IP is up for grabs thanks to an expired copyright. This gives filmmakers free rein to twist Mickey into whichever version they prefer ... and "Screamboat" is a horror comedy. The Disney princesses aren't in the same boat, though, which is why "Screamboat" is getting creative here with a little workaround. Unclear if all five princesses get killed off by Steamboat Willie ... but in one of the images we obtained, the princess based on "Little Mermaid" is tied up and bloodied. As we told you ... the filming location here was a decommissioned Staten Island Ferry owned by "Saturday Night Live" stars Pete Davidson and Colin Jost. Our sources told us so much fake blood was used during filming they had to hire a special cleaning crew for Pete and Colin's orange boat. The unlikely crew must band together to thwart the murderous menace before their relaxing commute turns into a nightmare."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Prosecutors in Diddy's case are revealing the names of the 3 alleged victims in his federal indictment, but only for Diddy's attorneys to see ... for now.

According to a motion filed by Diddy on March 6, the disgraced music mogul requested the names of the three anonymous accusers and witnesses listed in the government's letter outlining the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations case against him.

The judge reviewed Diddy's motion and ordered the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to hand over the names to Diddy's defense by March 10.

Diddy's attorneys argued they needed every day possible to prepare for the trial, which is less than 2 months away now. The federal indictment refers to Victims 1, 2 and 3, but does not reveal their names.

The judge's order says the women's identities are being disclosed "under an Attorney's Eyes Only designation."

Of course, Diddy's attorneys have already referred to Victim 1 as being Cassie. It's clearly her because the indictment includes a reference to the infamous hotel beating video.

Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony served as a battleground for pro-Israel and pro-Palestine protesters ... with demonstrators clashing on the streets as she received her star.

Things got super intense on Hollywood Boulevard as Gal's Walk of Fame ceremony was underway Tuesday ... with protesters getting into a fight just feet away from where the Israeli actress was being honored.

Footage shows the chaos devolving between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine factions ... one altercation happened after a pro-Palestine demonstrator snatched a flag from the pro-Israel faction.

A heavy police presence had officers involved too ... with cops breaking up a fight and slapping handcuffs on a group of demonstrators.

Gal's ceremony was walled off from the protests ... though at times during the presentation the roar of demonstrators could be heard in the background.

Vin Diesel gave Gal major props, and after his speech she took the dais and got emotional accepting her award ... bringing her children over to take photos with her brand new Walk of Fame monument.

The protests across the street didn't disrupt Gal's ceremony, but they did have an effect ... it's unusual for these events to be separated from the public.

Kim Kardashian kept it sweet with some ice cream after a wild day when TMZ dished she was seriously considering taking Kanye West to court to strip him of custody of their kids.

The SKIMS mogul looked every bit the glamorous star during her indulgent pit stop at Handel's Homemade Ice Cream in Calabasas, California ... stepping out with her good pal Natalie Halcro on Monday evening.

Kim was satisfying her sweet tooth, looking like a total showstopper in a furry coat, skintight leather leggings, and heel boots -- strutting along like she doesn’t have a care in the world ... even though we all know she’s got a lot on her mind.

TMZ explained just hours before her outing Kim was seriously considering asking a judge to strip Ye of joint legal custody of their four kids.

The reason? Kanye decided to drop the track "Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine," featuring their daughter North, with disgraced mogul Diddy -- despite initially agreeing in a mediation last week not to release the song.

Kim was vehemently opposed to letting North participate in any way, and Ye flagrantly ignored their custody agreement -- even posting on X, "THE MAN MAKES THE FINAL DECISION."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Denise Womack-Avila stated the department obtained phone records confirming Betsy made three phone calls to a Santa Fe medical center on the morning of February 12 -- the day after New Mexico officials concluded she likely had died ... from hantavirus, a rare and potentially fatal disease.

Womack-Avila told TMZ Tuesday ... "We can now confirm that Mrs. Hackman’s phone was utilized on the morning of February 12 to call a medical center in Santa Fe, Cloudberry Health. A total of three calls were made that morning, all to the medical center."

The sheriff’s office confirmed Betsy missed a call from the same medical center later that day.

Christine Quinn claims her estranged husband Christian Dumontet would shimmy under her car to block her from leaving their home ... and she says it caused her to miss work on "Selling Sunset."

The reality TV star blasted her estranged hubby in a new interview with People, telling the outlet about the great lengths Christian would allegedly go to in order to mess with her.

Christine claimed, "There were times where my husband, literally, where I had to go to work and he would lay himself under my car. I would sit for an hour until I finally missed a meeting and gave up and would go back inside, or he would shut the gates down so I couldn't leave. It was bad."

What's more, Christine also claimed Christian locked her out of her bank accounts, credit cards and email by commandeering her phone number.

She claims he "hacked" her out of her entire life and "stripped" her life down to where she "literally had nothing" ... adding, "And it was dehumanizing."
