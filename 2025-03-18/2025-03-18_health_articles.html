<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/life-sciences/The-CDMO-Surge-Why-Pharma-Is-Outsourcing-More-Than-Ever.aspx'>The CDMO Surge: Why Pharma Is Outsourcing More Than Ever</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 09:19:00 <p>
Preclinical research is crucial for the development of any novel drug. Federal regulations like the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGAMPs) enforced by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other international organizations also set specific requirements that these companies must follow for the manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product, which may further constrain companies’ operational capabilities. Some of the key advantages of CDMOs include their cost efficiency, particularly when compared to the time and investment required to build this type of infrastructure in-house, as well as their supply chain resilience and regulatory compliance. A full-service CDMO needs to provide comprehensive end-to-end capabilities that support the entire pharmaceutical development and manufacturing process.1” Recent estimates suggest that the CDMO market in the United States will reach over $278 billion by 2026, with oncology drugs accounting for about 35% of CDMO activity. Rising investments in the CDMO sector are largely attributed to greater complexity associated with the development of novel drugs and medical devices, as well as globalization and emerging markets. Some key services offered by CDMO include formulation development, regulatory support, clinical trial services, commercial product packaging, supply chain management, quality assurance, and technology transfer solutions2. CDMO facilities are also equipped with highly specialized equipment and facilities that prevent companies from making large capital investments in developing this infrastructure. CDMOs can reduce costs by accelerating drug production timelines through the use of their expertise to solve formulation challenges and meet regulatory requirements. Various factors may negatively impact the quality of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, which can lead to wasted materials, discarded product batches, supply disruptions, and product recalls, all of which are associated with significant financial losses. Partnering with CDMOs at the beginning of the manufacturing process allows pharmaceutical companies to immediately identify and resolve any issue that could lead to significant problems later. In addition to the direct savings associated with CDMOs, these organizations have also been shown to meet growing demands for pharmaceutical products during emergencies. For example, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Moderna relied on both internal expertise and third-party CDMOs to establish production lines of their novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology in different regions throughout the world to ensure widespread vaccination against this highly contagious disease. For example, a 2021 expansion in the partnership between Moderna and Rovi in Granada, Spain, facilitated the production of an additional 600 million vaccine doses every year4. Likewise, ThermoFisher served as a critical partner for supplying raw materials and assisting in vaccine manufacturing of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to increase production capabilities. As science continues to advance, CDMOs are also expanding their capabilities by investing in new technologies while simultaneously increasing their capacity to produce even more products. For example, a recent partnership between Samsung Biologics CDMO and Pfizer will involve the investment of almost $900 million USD to accelerate the production of biosimilars for oncology, inflammation, and immunotherapy indications. “Transforming CDMO partnerships through a holistic understanding of quality” [Online]. “Moderna further expands CDMO partnerships to support COVID vaccine” [Online]. “Building Resilience: CDMO Strategies for Drug Supply Chain Stability” [Online].</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.news-medical.net/health/The-Natural-Molecule-That-Could-Rival-Ozempic-for-Weight-Loss.aspx'>The Natural Molecule That Could Rival Ozempic</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 05:52:00 <p>
Furthermore, excess body weight is also linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic disorders, making obesity a significant public health concern.3 Given these uncertainties, pharmacological interventions like GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide (Ozempic), have gained attention for weight loss.6 Semaglutide mimics incretin hormones, enhancing insulin secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and suppressing appetite, leading to approximately 12% weight loss in clinical trials.6 However, it carries risks like nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, and high costs, limiting accessibility.7 This article explores BRP’s discovery, mechanism, efficacy, and potential as a natural alternative to GLP-1 receptor agonists. Unlike GLP-1 analogs, BRP does not interact with the GLP-1 receptor, making it mechanistically distinct from existing weight loss medications.8 Additionally, BRP did not induce nausea or aversion in animal models, suggesting a potentially improved tolerability profile compared to Ozempic and other GLP-1-based therapies. Unlike GLP-1 agonists, which primarily act by delaying gastric emptying and enhancing insulin secretion, BRP operates via the following mechanisms: The researchers believe that this improved tolerability may enhance long-term adherence among individuals seeking sustained weight loss.8 Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics incretin hormones to enhance insulin secretion, delay gastric emptying, and suppress appetite.6 In contrast, BRP operates through a non-incretin pathway, targeting the hypothalamus to regulate energy balance independently of GLP-1 receptor activation.8 Semaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor to reduce hunger, while BRP suppresses appetite through direct hypothalamic activation. Preclinical studies have shown that BRP administration reduced food intake by up to 50% in mice within an hour.8 Semaglutide is known to frequently cause gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can limit its tolerability for some patients.7 Although BRP presents a promising candidate for obesity treatment, additional research is needed to translate preclinical findings into clinical applications. By functioning independently of the incretin pathway, BRP offers a novel therapeutic approach with fewer side effects compared to GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

If you've heard the term “undetectable” in the context of HIV, you might wonder what it means and why it’s so important. As someone who’s lived with HIV since birth and worked in HIV care for years, I want to break it down in a way that’s easy to understand. Being undetectable means the amount of HIV in your blood is so low it can’t be detected by blood tests. This doesn’t mean the virus is gone from your body completely, but it does mean: The virus is under control. Your immune system isn’t being attacked. This helps keep you healthy and able to live a normal life. You can’t transmit HIV! This is known as U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable), the best thing to ever happen to the HIV world . Simply put, if you’re undetectable, you can’t pass HIV to someone else through your blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or breast milk.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For many people, pain is a constant companion during their workday. Whether you type at a desk for hours, carry heavy loads, or hammer away at a keyboard, physical pain can hinder your productivity, focus, and overall well-being.

Fortunately, through some adjustments and coping mechanisms, your workplace pain can be effectively managed so you feel comfortable and perform your best.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how ergonomics and coping mechanisms can help reduce your pain in the workplace.

What Is Workplace Pain and Why Does It Occur?

Pain at work is caused by various factors, including repetitive movement, poor posture, or improperly set workstations. Some of the most frequent types of pain people endure in the workplace include:

Back pain: Usually caused by sitting for a long period or lifting heavy weights without good form.

Neck and shoulder pain: Usually caused by poor posture or configurations at the workstation.

Hand and wrist pain: Common when you type for extended periods or abuse a mouse.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A new study led by University of Calgary professor Dr. Tuan Trang, PhD, may help to explain why there is an over-representation of women experiencing chronic pain compared to men. Both males and females develop pain, but each sex develops it through different means. This condition can be very hard to treat; for instance, things like a light touch, temperature changes, and clothing against the skin can be agonizing. The study, conducted in rats and mice, found that in both sexes pain signals can be communicated by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels but through different types of immune cells. However, in female rodents, activation of Panx1 releases leptin, a hormone which has been associated with heightened pain sensitivity. "We know that a lot of preclinical research has been in male subjects. Consequently, treatments were often developed from a male-based understanding and may not be very effective in females." Trang notes that as far back as the 1980s, researchers who were working with human blood samples found that female patients experiencing chronic pain had higher levels of leptin in their blood than those who did not have chronic pain. "In the clinic, we've known for many years that women are more likely than men to suffer from chronic pain, and it's often hard to know why some people respond to treatment and others don't," says Dr. Lori Montgomery, MD '03, pain clinician and clinical associate professor at the CSM. "Both sex and gender are important factors that need a lot more investigation, but this latest research might prove to be one of the ways that we can personalize treatment for patients so that it's more likely to be effective.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250318/Study-explores-Long-Covid-prevalence-and-uncertainty-in-England.aspx'>Study explores Long Covid prevalence and uncertainty in England</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 00:00:00 <p>
Almost one in ten people (9.1%) in England think they could have Long Covid but aren't sure, according to a new analysis of NHS England survey data by the University of Southampton. Researchers also found that 4.8% of people reported having Long Covid, with higher rates among people living in deprived areas, people with particular ethnic backgrounds, parents or carers, and those with another long-term condition. Professor Nisreen A Alwan, who has pioneered research into Long Covid since 2020 and who co-authored the study, said: "This analysis adds further evidence of the unfairness of Long Covid, with people who are already disadvantaged in society more likely to be affected. "It also shows us that many people aren't sure if they have it, and may need diagnosis, treatment and support. "Long Covid is still a very significant issue impacting individuals, families, the economy and wider society. Symptoms include fatigue, feeling short of breath, 'brain fog', and heart palpitations, amongst many others. Men are generally less likely to seek medical advice than women, which could partly explain their higher level of uncertainty. The team also say stigma and self-doubt could discourage people from seeking a diagnosis. Mirembe Woodrow, who is studying for a PhD at Southampton and who carried out the analysis, said: "We were really surprised to find so many people weren't sure whether they had Long Covid or not, and the study shows there is still work to do to increase awareness of the condition and remove barriers to accessing diagnosis, treatment and support. Professor Alwan's team intends to carry out further work using the survey to understand what could be driving inequality in prevalence, impact and support for Long Covid.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

With the rising prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (MRSA), a multi drug resistant strain, treatment has become a challenge. The infection frequently involves the skin and soft tissue, but it can also cause other life-threatening systemic illnesses including endocarditis, meningitis, and toxic shock syndrome.

The known antibiotic resistance determinants, mecA and mecC, detected in MRSA isolates exhibit a broad spectrum of cross-antibiotic resistance. This study identified three functional protein families, through sequencing, that confer extensive antibiotic resistance independent of mecA and mecC. Twenty-six isolates had their DNA sequenced for mepR, mepA, mepB, and sapep genes for correlation with their antimicrobial phenotypes.

Transcriptional profiling revealed that both animal and human MRSA isolates exhibited a gene cluster mepRAB (multidrug export protein gene), encoding a MarR-like transcriptional regulator (mepR), a M20/M25/M40 metallo-hydrolase protein gene (sapep) encoding resistance to biocides and carbapenems, and a hypothetical protein gene of unknown function (mepB).

Dengue fever's clinical progression is closely tied to platelet dynamics, yet predicting recovery remains challenging. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) is recognized as a marker for thrombopoiesis, but its role in dengue has been underexplored.

This finding indicates that IPF% can be utilized as a predictor of platelet increase in patients with dengue infection. Additionally, IPF has been used as a marker to determine the etiology of thrombocytopenia, whether it is caused by excessive platelet destruction or decreased platelet production in the bone marrow, as observed in patients with dengue infection.

These findings suggest that IPF can be utilized as an additional predictive tool to monitor platelet recovery and identify the etiology of thrombocytopenia. However, it is important to note that recovery from dengue infection is not solely determined by platelet count. The restoration of platelet levels is merely one of the indicators of the recovery phase in dengue.

El-Deiry and a global team of researchers, this special publication highlights the groundbreaking work of the Worldwide Innovative Network (WIN) Consortium, a global collaboration dedicated to transforming cancer care through personalized medicine. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), molecular profiling, and innovative clinical trials, WIN is helping clinicians tailor treatments to each patient's unique cancer profile-moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach. The WIN Consortium is a fast-moving, non-profit organization bringing together nearly 40 academic, industry, and research institutions, along with patient advocacy groups, across 18 countries and five continents. Currently under Dr. El-Deiry's leadership, WIN continues to break barriers in cancer research, ensuring cutting-edge treatments reach patients worldwide. One of WIN's most significant contributions is the development of N-of-1 clinical trials, a revolutionary approach that personalizes cancer treatment based on a patient's specific tumor characteristics. Unlike traditional trials that test drugs on large groups, N-of-1 trials focus on finding the best therapy for an individual patient using AI-driven algorithms, genomic analysis, and real-world data. WIN's WINTHER trial was one of the first to use both DNA and RNA analysis to match patients with the most effective therapies, while the WINGPO trial builds on this approach by integrating AI and liquid biopsies to refine treatment selection. These innovations are helping clinicians make more precise treatment decisions and improving outcomes for cancer patients. By working closely with governments, pharmaceutical companies, and advocacy organizations, WIN is aiming to ensure that life-saving treatments are accessible to all patients, regardless of location or financial status.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Led by first author Cong Wang and corresponding author Xiao-Ou Shu from Vanderbilt University, this study examines how breast cancer and its treatments contribute to accelerated aging in survivors. This finding raises concerns about the potential lasting impact of cancer therapies on aging and overall health. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, with improved treatments leading to longer survival rates. "This is the first large study with 10 years of follow-up to evaluate PAA among BC survivors." The study found that tumor severity played a role in aging acceleration. Women with advanced-stage (Stage III/IV) or high-grade tumors showed the highest levels of aging acceleration. Additionally, treatments such as chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were linked to increased biological aging. Surgery and radiation therapy were associated with lower aging acceleration over time. These findings suggest that systemic therapies, which affect the whole body, may contribute more to aging-related changes than localized treatments. Understanding how cancer treatments influence aging can help improve post-treatment care and potentially lead to strategies that reduce these effects. Further research is needed to explore whether lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions could slow down aging in cancer survivors.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hi, I’m Olivier Negre, Chief Scientific Officer at Smart Immune since 2020. I now have over 20 years of experience in biotherapy and gene therapy. My journey began working on recombinant vaccines at Bioprotein Technologies. You will be presenting a seminar at the 7th Annual Allogeneic Cell Therapies Summit later this year. I’m looking forward to introducing our ProTcell therapy platform’s recent advances and, more precisely, our efforts to maintain effective and diverse T-cell receptors (TCR) while ensuring safety. TCR diversity is critical to fighting infections and eliminating cancer cells expressing neoantigens. What are some key insights from your preclinical studies on the safety of ProTcells? Without spoiling the presentation, I can say that we have not observed any product-related toxicity such as GvHD. A protective effect against tumor challenge has been observed in our preclinical models. Why is the thymus an important factor in this therapy, and how does it impact T-cell development? Our cell therapy SMART101 (allogeneic blood stem cell-derived T-cell progenitors) is designed to be empowered and personalized by the patient’s thymus. Interestingly, the thymus naturally expands ProTcell-derived T-cell populations by approximately 1,000-fold. There are numerous reasons why our approach can address medical needs related to T-cell dysfunction. Our strategy is to use allogeneic ProTcells and harness thymic education to restore the immune system with a new, competent, and long-lasting T-cell force. The field is faced with obstacles that are tending to be resolved partly and progressively: safety, long-term efficacy (vs cell exhaustion), rejection, and manufacturing complexity. The allogeneic approach can circumvent those limitations and is made more feasible by several improvements: Poseida Therapeutics showed that allogeneic CAR-T therapies can have strong traction for pharma with the agreement to be acquired by Roche Holdings for $1.5 billion. Cell banks of allogeneic off-the-shelf products should participate in this new area for cellular therapies. What are you looking forward to most at the 7th Annual Allogeneic Cell Therapies Summit? I am looking forward to attending the industry leaders’ fireside chat, which will discuss how to achieve allogeneic product success by aligning innovation with investor expectations. The panel discussion scheduled for the second day will be particularly interesting since ensuring long-lasting therapeutic responses is challenging for allogeneic therapies. I will be keen to discuss strategic patient selection by HLA matching. What are the next steps for you and your research? He has been working for more than 20 years in the field of biotherapies including the production of recombinant proteins with BioProtein Technologies and gene therapy programs at bluebird bio both in France and in the USA.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In 1993, the plug-flow model was introduced by Professor Amidon's group, and in 1995, the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) was developed. The three-bucket model explains oral drug absorption based on different limiting factors. In this situation, oral absorption is determined by how quickly the drug dissolves. In this case, the maximum amount of drug that can dissolve in intestinal fluid depends on its solubility, which includes both the crystalline and amorphous forms. In this case, oral drug absorption is determined by the product of solubility and permeability. What is the Peff equation, and how does it help understand oral drug absorption? The Peff equation is essential for understanding oral drug absorption. In permeability-limited absorption, the process can be further classified as either epithelial membrane-limited or unstirred water-layer-limited. Similarly, solubility-permeability limited absorption can be divided into cases where epithelial membrane permeability or unstirred water layer permeability is the limiting factor. What is the particle drifting effect, and how was it discovered in drug development? I first proposed the concept of the particle drifting effect in 2010 based on my real-world experience in drug discovery and development, particularly while working at Pfizer. However, in actual clinical and toxicokinetics (TK) data, the absorbed dose increased beyond this theoretical ceiling, especially when the particle size was reduced. This suggested that something was missing in our theoretical understanding of drug absorption. However, in real in vivo studies, increasing the dose strength and reducing particle size led to a higher absorption flux, even though solubility remained unchanged. I found multiple studies showing that a significant portion of drug particles exist within the intervillous space, proving that microscale particles do not just stay in the bulk phase but actively move into the unstirred water layer. How does the Peff equation predict Fa, and what role does the particle drifting effect play in improving its accuracy? The Peff equation predicts Fa (the fraction of a dose absorbed in humans) based on key physicochemical properties such as pKa, intrinsic solubility, bile micelle binding partition coefficient, and intrinsic passive transcellular permeability (Ptrans0). When plotting clinical Fa percentages on the horizontal axis and predicted Fa values on the vertical axis, I initially observed many underpredictions, particularly for cases involving high doses and fine particles. These discrepancies suggested that the standard model was missing an important factor. I published these findings in 2011 and continued to collect additional clinical data afterward. However, these equations apply to simple, non-supersaturation cases. Predicting Fa in supersaturation cases—such as those involving solid-dispersion formulations, solid-form APIs, or amorphous APIs—is much more challenging. Currently, efforts are being made to improve these predictions using in vitro data, but accurate modeling of supersaturation is still difficult. Contrary to common assumptions, reducing particle size does not significantly increase solubility. Experimental data show that even when the particle size is reduced to below 200 nanometers, the relative solubility increases by only about 10%. Several well-documented studies confirm that solubility remains largely unaffected by particle size reduction, at least down to this nanometer scale. When measuring solubility using filtration methods, careful interpretation of the data is necessary. Filtration membranes typically have pore sizes around 0.2 micrometers (200 nanometers). The same caution applies when using centrifugation-based methods for solubility measurement. A literature review on mucus structure reveals that the mucus layer's pore size is much larger than one micrometer, meaning that even microscale particles can move through it. Several experimental papers provide strong evidence supporting this conclusion, reinforcing the validity of the particle drifting effect in real biological environments. To accurately extrapolate Pion's MicroFlux data to human Fa while considering the particle drifting effect, several key structural differences between the Pion MicroFlux system and the human intestine must be accounted for. In contrast, the Pion microFlux membrane is flat and lacks these structural features. Since the particle drifting effect influences absorption by affecting the permeability of this layer, it is crucial to adjust for any differences in unstirred water layer thickness when predicting human Fa.

A first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence (AI)-based neural network can rapidly analyze and interpret millions of cells from a patient sample, predicting molecular changes in the tissue. It can potentially pinpoint where personalized treatments could be most effective for conditions such as cancer. NicheCompass leverages the power of generative AI to create a visual database combining spatial genomic data on cell types, where they are found, and how they communicate. A new paper, published today (18 March) in Nature Genetics, introduces NicheCompass and details how it can uncover tissue changes across breast and lung cancer patients. Ultimately, it will help develop personalized therapy plans, highlighting specific changes that could be targeted in conditions such as cancer. Cells all have features that allow them to be recognized as part of their communication networks, such as which proteins they have on their surface. These atlases contain information on the multitude of cell types, where they are, and how genetic changes can impact how they interact with each other. By understanding how the human body works at a cellular level, it can inform our understanding of what happens in disease, and highlight new targets for drug development. This means that it learns how different cells communicate through their networks and then aligns these with similar networks of cells, creating neighbors within tissues through shared features. The similarities help inform our general understanding of cancer, as well as highlight any transcriptional changes that might be useful to target in new treatments. Further patient data can be included, so clinicians can input their own patient data and in one hour receive in-depth information about an individual condition, helping to guide clinical decisions. This demonstrates how it can be applied to spatial atlases of whole organs generated by researchers worldwide. However, we also need tools that allow us to access all the benefits this information could provide. Dr. Carlos Talavera-López, co-senior author at the University of Würzburg, said: "Using NicheCompass, we were able to see the differences in how immune cells interact with lung cancer tumours in patients. This real-world application not only uncovered new information that adds to our collective understanding about cancer, it also highlighted one patient whose cancer interacted with the immune system differently. Dr. Mohammad Lotfollahi, co-senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "People often communicate to their networks with a range of different information. They might share developments from work, or pictures of their holidays, and while these might be to different friends, they can all be traced back to one individual. NicheCompass is the first AI model of its kind that can interpret these networks and answer questions that could directly impact patient lives, such as highlighting where and how health conditions have started, and predicting how they might respond to certain treatments."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It offers a sustainable - and affordable – alternative to synthesizing important peptide-based pharmaceuticals, thanks to a plant-based production system known as biopharming. Phytogene utilizes Nicotiana benthamiana plants to produce medications such as Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists, a class of drugs that include the popular type-II diabetes, turned weight loss drug, Ozempic. This innovative approach could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and chemical waste associated with traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing methods. Victor Boddy, team leader, explains: "Inspired by the recent Ozempic shortage, we built a proof-of-concept model system that expresses functional GLP-1 agonists in plants. We aim to create a future where people can reliably grow their own treatments at home, free from concerns about insurance, cost, or availability." We're excited to further develop this concept into a commercially viable project with support from venture capitalists and scientific advisors." The research team has also published an open-source biopharming toolkit on the iGEM Parts Registry, enabling other researchers to build upon their work. This toolkit includes genetic tools for rapid screening of subcellular localizations in plants and various constructs for expression in multiple cell types. The project, which began in late 2023, involved a collaborative effort from 23 uOttawa undergraduate students across various faculties, with guidance from Adam Damry, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, and Allyson Maclean, Associate Professor, Department of Biology. "The extract has not been tested on humans," adds Boddy. We are currently analyzing blood glucose and insulin levels to assess response.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, a global leader in laboratory automation and innovation, and an Operating Company of Danaher Corporation, revolutionizes spectral flow cytometry with the industry’s first modular solution: the CytoFLEX mosaic Spectral Detection Module. When connected to the CytoFLEX LX or S Flow Cytometers, the CytoFLEX mosaic Spectral Detection Module delivers superior fluorescence sensitivity for dim and complex multicolor experiments and can detect nanoparticles as small as 80 nm. The richer data resulting from spectral analysis can help untangle the complexities of biological systems and diseases faster, with a nuanced understanding of immune cell subsets, their functions and interactions, thanks to simultaneously detecting multiple markers. In contrast to conventional flow cytometry, spectral flow cytometry acquires the full emission spectrum of each antibody-associated fluorophore across all lasers, rather than measuring only the peak of emission. “As a central feature of the CytoFLEX platform, this innovation is focused on pairing ease-of-use with powerful, sensitive acquisition technology to remove the intimidation encountered in many flow cytometry instruments,” said Product Manager Matthew Goff. “Investigators can now easily switch between their true conventional detection system and this advanced spectral detection system, while maintaining a familiar sample management and user experience, all without having to invest in a separate instrument. The CytoFLEX mosaic spectral detection module is powered by a unique algorithm capable of improving resolution compared to other available methods, along with unmixing accuracy checks to ensure efficiency. I found the software very easy to learn and was able to start my first experiments in only a few hours,” Tamar Tak, Coordinator of the Flow Cytometry Facility, Leiden University Medical Center “A feature I really like is that it allows me to do an extensive QC of the unmixing. This allows me to see if a tandem dye has degraded, or perhaps the wrong antibody was added.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
