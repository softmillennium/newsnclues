DispatchHealth and Medically Home have entered into a definitive agreement to merge, creating a single provider of medical care at home.

Once the deal closes, Medically Home will become part of DispatchHealth. The combined entity will extend care into the homes of patients across 50 major metropolitan areas in partnership with nearly 40 health systems, as well as most major health plans and value-based care entities, the organizations said.

"This merger unlocks a future where high-acuity care at home is the new standard," said Dr. Mark Prather, co-founder and executive chair of the board for DispatchHealth, in a statement.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

To illustrate patients' increasing preference for receiving care at home, the companies cited Chilmark research showing that the hospital-at-home market is projected to reach $300 billion by 2028, driven by improved patient outcomes and cost efficiency.

The combined entity, they said, will be positioned to deliver services such as same-day medical care for serious health concerns, and complex, hospital-level care in the home. The organizations said they will aim to reduce the total cost of care by up to 30% over a 30-day period.

With expanded capabilities, the combined organization could free up more than 62,000 bed days, easing strain on health systems, the companies said.

"For many patients, the best hospital bed is the one at home," said Medically Home CEO Graham Barnes. "By joining forces with DispatchHealth, we're creating a stronger, more integrated model that will enable more patients, providers, and health systems to embrace high-acuity home-based care with confidence."

The merger is expected to close mid-year. The terms of the definitive agreement were not disclosed.

THE LARGER TREND

The home care and hospice market is growing along with an aging population. 

Reflecting the growing demand for home care services, home health volumes are expected to increase 22% by 2034, according to a November report from Research and Markets.

ON THE RECORD

"Hospital-at-home has consistently demonstrated better outcomes, and we believe every patient – regardless of where they live – deserves access to that level of care," said Pippa Shulman, chief medical officer and chief strategy officer, Medically Home. "This merger allows us to break down barriers, reaching more families in underserved communities with high-quality, advanced medical care in their homes."

Oops, something went wrong

The projected fair value for Acadia Healthcare Company is US$56.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Acadia Healthcare Company is estimated to be 48% undervalued based on current share price of US$29.43

Our fair value estimate is 15% higher than Acadia Healthcare Company's analyst price target of US$49.46

How far off is Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.

Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

 See our latest analysis for Acadia Healthcare Company 

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2b

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$321m× (1 + 2.8%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.8%) = US$7.9b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$4.0b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$5.3b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$29.4, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Acadia Healthcare Company as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.965. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Strength

Debt is well covered by earnings.

Weakness

No major weaknesses identified for ACHC.

Opportunity

Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.

Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.

Threat

Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Acadia Healthcare Company, there are three important factors you should explore:

Lifestyle and health factors that are linked with heart disease appear to have a greater impact on cardiovascular risk in women than men, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25).

While factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and blood pressure have long been linked with heart disease risk, the new study is the first to show that these associations are collectively stronger in women than men. According to the researchers, the findings suggest that sex-specific screening or risk assessment approaches could give a more accurate picture of cardiovascular risk and better motivate people to adopt heart-healthy habits.

For the same level of health, our study shows that the increase in risk [related to each factor] is higher in women than in men—it's not one-size-fits-all. This is novel and something that hasn't been seen in other studies."

Maneesh Sud, MD, PhD, assistant professor in the department of medicine, interventional cardiologist and clinician scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto and the study's lead author

The study focused on eight factors associated with heart disease: diet, sleep, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure. Overall, the results showed that women were more likely to have fewer negative risk factors and more positive ones compared with men. However, women with more negative risk factors faced a more pronounced increase in their chance of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event compared to men with a similar risk factor profile.

"We found that women tend to have better health than men, but the impact on outcomes is different," Sud said. "The combination of these factors has a bigger impact in women than it does in men."

The researchers analyzed data from over 175,000 Canadian adults who enrolled in the Ontario Health Study between 2009-2017. None of the participants had heart disease at baseline and about 60% were women. Each participant was classified as having ideal or poor health in terms of each of the eight risk factors, and these scores were combined to calculate an overall risk factor profile as poor (fewer than five positive factors or more than three negative factors), intermediate (five to seven positive factors) or ideal (ideal across all eight factors).

During a median follow-up period of just over 11 years, researchers tracked the incidence of seven heart disease outcomes—heart attack, stroke, unstable angina (chest pain that results from restricted blood flow to the heart), peripheral arterial disease (narrowed blood vessels in the arms or legs), heart failure, coronary revascularization (procedures to open blocked arteries) and cardiovascular death—among participants in each of the three groupings.

In the study population, significantly more women were categorized as having ideal health, with 9.1% of women and 4.8% of men scoring a perfect 8 out of 8. Women were also less likely to be categorized as having poor health, with 21.9% of women and 30.5% of men falling into this category. In terms of individual risk factors, women were more likely than men to have ideal diet, blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure, while women were slightly less likely than men to have ideal physical activity levels.

After adjusting for age, the results showed that participants of both sexes saw an elevated risk of heart disease if they had poor or intermediate health compared to those with ideal health, but these differences were more extreme in women than men. Women with poor health had nearly five times the risk of heart disease as women with ideal health, while men with poor health had 2.5 times the risk of heart disease as men with ideal health. Women with intermediate health had 2.3 times the risk as those with ideal health, while men with intermediate health had 1.6 times the risk as those with ideal health.

Further study is needed to understand how each factor might be affecting outcomes differently in men and women based on either biological or sociocultural factors, the researchers said.

The researchers plan to conduct additional analyses to determine whether there are any differences in risk factor impacts among people of different racial and ethnic groups or among women before and after menopause.

WTOL 11 Vault on Plus | News of the Week from 1991

TOLEDO, Ohio — Five years after COVID-19 transformed healthcare operations virtually overnight, medical professionals are reflecting on the lasting changes to hospitals, staff and patient care.

In March 2020, healthcare systems were forced to adapt rapidly as the first wave of COVID-19 cases arrived. Hospitals implemented temperature checks at entrances, questionnaires about health history and eventually universal masking policies.

"I think that everyone can probably say that their lives have been changed through COVID," said Dr. Brian Kaminski, vice president of medical affairs for ProMedica's Metro Hospitals.

Hospitals quickly reorganized their facilities to handle the emerging threat. 

"We even had separate areas for our waiting rooms for people who were presenting with COVID or non-COVID-like symptoms," Kaminski said. "We had installed a variety of different ways to provide negative pressure ventilation in our emergency departments and in our rooms."

Dr. James Tita, chief clinical officer for Mercy Health Toledo, recalled the urgent need for isolation protocols. 

"We weren't even sure exactly how contagious it was, but given the fact that we didn't have any effective treatment, given the fact that it seemed to have a high mortality rate, we had to go to great lengths to make sure that we protected the staff, we protected each other, and of course, we protected the patients," Tita said.

Both health systems struggled with critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). 

"We were rationing masks, we were rationing gowns, we were trying to get as much equipment as we could," Tita said.

The pandemic created significant staffing challenges that continue today. 

"There was a big turnover of our bedside workers, so nurses, respiratory therapists, it took a terrible toll on them," Tita explained. "In terms of replenishing those ranks and recruitment for all health care systems, that continues to be a challenge."

Kaminski noted that staffing shortages forced difficult adjustments. 

"What we had to do, as did many other health organizations, is hire agency staffing, which is staff that's not permanent, often not from the area, qualified and competent, but not familiar with our organization, also very costly," Kaminski said.

Healthcare workers also experienced shifting public sentiment throughout the pandemic. Initial community support gave way to anger and mistrust as the crisis dragged on. 

"Suddenly, those heroes that we celebrated taking care of COVID initially turned into villains," Tita said.

The doctors noted that 1.2 million Americans died from the virus, many in isolation, leaving psychological, emotional and spiritual scars. 

"At some point, we will have to deal with this, and I'm sure we are dealing with it, maybe not in the best way," Tita said. "This was a history-changing, a life-changing event for all of us."

Despite ongoing questions about long COVID, both doctors said immunity through prior infection or vaccination has improved the situation. Most pandemic-era precautions like temperature checks and distancing markers have disappeared from hospitals.

"Most people can go out in public, do the activities that they're used to doing, not have to worry about entry into public facilities, and most people aren't masking right now," Kaminski said. "It definitely feels good to me and it's nice to have a normal cadence and routine back again."

Healthcare systems have applied lessons from the pandemic to other challenges. Kaminski said ProMedica used its "COVID playbook" when IV fluids became scarce following Hurricane Helene's impact on Puerto Rico and North Carolina.

Both hospital systems continue to utilize telemedicine services implemented during the pandemic.</p>

The good news is that U.S. hospital organizations are doing relatively well in the first quarter of the year, as rising patient volume has helped to offset the impact of rising operational costs, according to leaders at the Chicago-based consulting and advisory firm Kaufman Hall, a Vizient company.

In January of this year, according to data released by Kaufman Hall on March 17 in its “National Hospital Flash Report,” average monthly operating margins for U.S. hospitals were 4.4 percent, up from 3.7 percent in December, and considerably above the 0.5 percent in November of last year. Indeed, throughout 2024, the average monthly operating margin hovered between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent consistently, except in April, when it reached 2.0 percent, and in December, when it hit 2.1 percent.

Per the stabilized numbers, Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of dataand analytics at Kaufman Hall, said in a statement contained in Monday's press release, that “January was a relatively stable month for hospitals, as more people received care due in part to seasonal challenges like flu and other respiratory diseases. Hospitals are also experiencing more rapid revenue growth from inpatient than outpatient services. Expenses are also rising, driven primarily by drug costs, though the rate of cost growth has slowed.”

The report, which can be accessed here, offered the following “Key Takeaways”;

Ø   Hospital performance remains stable at the start of 2025. This is due to a confluence of greater service volume and rising expenses.

Ø  Expenses continue to be driven primarily by the cost of drugs. However, the rate of cost growth has slowed considerably.

Ø  Inpatient revenue grew more quickly than outpatient revenue in January. More patients were treated in the hospital and emergency room.</p>

Humana Inc.'s HUM senior-focused primary care providers, CenterWell and Conviva, have partnered with Icon Health to enhance access to musculoskeletal care for seniors. This initiative, set to launch in Palm Beach County, will integrate musculoskeletal specialists within primary care centers, ensuring a streamlined and high-quality care experience for elderly patients.

This collaboration is expected to bolster HUM's CenterWell segment, which saw an 8.9% year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. Expanding service offerings under value-based contracts could further drive growth. Musculoskeletal conditions are major contributors to disability among seniors, often requiring multi-specialist care. By embedding advanced practice providers within primary care settings, this initiative aims to simplify access to comprehensive treatment, improving both patient outcomes and convenience. The model provides both in-person and virtual care options to cater to the diverse needs of patients.

For HUM, this partnership reinforces its commitment to value-based care, strengthening its position as an innovator in senior healthcare. By addressing musculoskeletal issues through early intervention and coordinated care, the initiative is expected to reduce emergency room visits and hospital admissions, resulting in improved patient health and increased operational efficiency. These factors could contribute to cost savings and have a positive impact on HUM's financial performance.

By providing seamless access to specialized care, CenterWell is well-positioned to attract more seniors looking for integrated healthcare solutions. As value-based care continues to shape the industry, HUM's investment in comprehensive musculoskeletal services supports its long-term growth strategy and competitive edge in senior healthcare.

Health systems are under increasing pressure to retain their patients – who have a variety of care options to choose from, both in-person and virtual. At the same time, inpatient capacity is limited and hospital care teams face a lot of strain.

By using cardiac data gathered through remote devices, ambulatory care is helping these facilities preserve and care for patients within the health system, but not always in the hospital.

Philips is one company that plays in this arena, and has insights on what facilities should know about leveraging this data to better work within their existing capacity and retain patients.

Healthcare IT News spoke recently with Julia Strandberg, chief business leader for connected care at Philips, to talk about some of the challenges hospitals and health systems face with patient retention. She also discussed capacity issues, how leveraging cardiac data via remote patient monitoring technologies can help overcome them – and what it will take for more healthcare organizations to adopt remote patient monitoring technologies.

Q. What are the challenges hospitals and health systems face regarding patient retention?

A. Impactful patient care in and out of the hospital is a non-negotiable – it's what patients require and desire. In the hospital, they seek high-quality care that is delivered quickly. Once home, they want to remain an active partner in their treatment, looking for timely updates on their health and clear guidance on next steps, including whether their healthcare provider recommends an in-person visit.

However, ongoing clinical staffing shortages and the complexities brought on by siloed hospital data often lead to longer wait times and delays in care.

As patient volumes grow and cases become more complex, fragmented data poses a significant challenge for hospitals and health systems. When clinicians lack a comprehensive, holistic view of a patient's health, it can add unnecessary roadblocks to determining a diagnosis and necessary treatment.

As a result, patients may be subjected to unnecessary tests and specialty visits. Not only can this increase patient stress, cost of care and dissatisfaction, but it can also take time away from patients who actually do require that specialty care.

To improve efficiency and ensure timely, high-quality care, hospitals should prioritize interoperability across all systems and devices, regardless of vendor. With seamless data access, clinicians can quickly review a patient's condition history and current health status, leading to faster, more accurate diagnoses.

These workflow improvements also free up clinicians' time, allowing them to focus more on direct patient care – whether in-person or remote – rather than sifting through disjointed records.

Q. What are the challenges hospitals face regarding capacity?

A. Health systems nationwide continue to struggle with overwhelming patient volumes and staffing shortages. These issues will only worsen as the population ages, and simultaneously, patients have become more complex, their conditions more acute. These factors significantly impact both patients and staff – eroding staff satisfaction and contributing to burnout, while decreasing patient safety and satisfaction.

One of the growing challenges healthcare professionals are facing, however, is they are overwhelmed by the volume of data generated. Almost 4 in 10 healthcare leaders (38%) say staff lose precious time pulling patient data together, leaving less time to care for patients.

Other administrative tasks such as scheduling and reporting also are time-consuming, with nurses spending 15-20 mins per hour on such tasks, taking time away from patients.

Open, interoperable systems will eliminate barriers and turn the vast pools of clinical data into actionable insights. For companies like Philips, it's critical we team up with healthcare providers and ecosystem partners to co-create systems that enhance care pathways and operational workflows, while reducing costs and the burden on staff.

Q. How can leveraging cardiac data via remote patient monitoring technologies help overcome some of these challenges?

A. Remote patient monitoring technologies, paired with advanced data analytics, are game changers when it comes to alleviating capacity bottlenecks.

Consider this scenario: a patient arrives at the ED following syncope, a fainting episode. While historically, this patient may have been admitted for observation, remote monitoring technology – in this case, a mobile cardiac telemetry device – can allow them to safely return home while their cardiac rhythms are monitored in real time.

Meanwhile, their data is shared with care team members, and their cardiologist will have this information in hand before their follow-up appointment, accelerating diagnosis and subsequent care.

This model reduces overcrowding by removing unnecessary admissions, allowing staff to focus more on acute cases. And the patient avoids a hospital stay and can recover comfortably at home.

Q. What will it take for more hospitals and health systems to adopt remote patient monitoring technologies?

A. We need to begin with an industry-wide mindset shift. First, we must recognize how quickly the care delivery model is evolving beyond the walls of the hospital and recognize the potential of this evolution.

Moving forward, we'll continue to see the advancement of home-based care technology, which is proven to improve patient outcomes, minimize acute care setting stay lengths for patients, and reduce the strain on healthcare facilities.

Riding the wave of this shift, we're in a better position to prioritize high-quality care delivery to patients virtually anywhere – and leverage remote patient monitoring tech to do so. Health systems can retain their patients while freeing up capacity by opening doors for more care outside the hospital.

Finally, hospitals and health systems must partner with technology vendors that prioritize interoperability. This approach gives clinicians access to high-quality, real-time patient information for enhanced care delivery.

Having a solid foundation of interoperability creates both clinical efficiencies and sets the stage for AI to empower providers with more timely, informed decision making across the care continuum – ultimately improving patient outcomes, cost savings and resource management.

Not far from the joint police/fire rescue building along Northwest Martin Luther King Ave. is a place that offers health care for those underserved and anyone needing quality care.

Recently, a Star-Banner reporter went to the center and spoke with CEO Levonda Goodson.

Here's what we know:

Estella Byrd Whitman Community Health Center at 819 NW Seventh St., a non-profit primary health care clinic. Ironically, the location is on the grounds that used to be the home of Estella Byrd Whitman.

Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m.-4 p.m., and Friday from 8 a.m.-2 p.m. It's closed on Saturday and Sunday, and is staffed with three nurse practitioners and a medical director.

It was founded in 2009 by Carolyn Adams, Dr. Pamela Lewin and the late Arthur Adams. Estella Byrd Whitman Community Health Center got its name from Carolyn Adams' grandmother, Estella Byrd Whitman. The goal is to fulfill a promise of establishing a medical venue/home for those living in Tucker Hill, an historic Black community that's on the same street as the center. It was established because residents living in the area didn't have easy access to health care. And secondly, it was a way to treat the underserved. The center opened its doors in 2009 at St. Paul AME Church, which is a few yards away. Through donations and support from city officials, the center entered its present building in 2018.

On average, anywhere from 12 to 15 per day. Patients come from Ocala, Summerfield, Belleview and Citrus County. The staff provide services to those who are underserved, in between jobs, can't afford health insurance or people with insurance.

Multiple, to include regular check-ups, vaccinations, health screenings and primary care services.

Yes, along with walk-ins, sliding fee scales based on income and anyone who needs assistance. Goodson said their goal is to be an impact to the community which fuels them to move forward. She said they thrive on patient care, which is most important to the staff. For appointments, call (352) 875-2226.

Several days ago, SMA Healthcare announced they were partnering with the center for primary care services at its main facility in southwest Ocala. The northwest Ocala health center will start the care in April, according to a news release. The center won the non-profit of the year award that came from the Ocala/Marion County Community Foundation at their Inspire Gala held March 8.

Presently, they're working on funding to get another building so they can expand services for patients under one roof. The center is hosting a spring fund raising event on April 6 from 4-8 p.m. at The Reilly Arts Center at 500 NE Ninth St. The theme is a Roaring 20's Gangster and guests can wear clothing that matched the occasion.

Healthcare providers are under immense pressure to deliver high-quality care while managing financial constraints, operational inefficiencies, and an ever-evolving regulatory landscape. Vital to overcoming these challenges is the need for seamless communication and data exchange across systems. Fewer than one in three hospitals can electronically find, send, receive, and integrate patient information from another provider, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving full interoperability.

Legacy systems are often what stands in the way between seamless integration and interoperability. While electronic health records (EHRs) and other modern platforms have transformed aspects of healthcare delivery, traditional fax systems continue to serve as the basis for transmitting critical patient records, authorizations, and referrals. However, these legacy systems often create barriers for healthcare organizations. The key to realizing the full potential of legacy systems in modern healthcare lies in overcoming interoperability challenges — ensuring seamless data exchange between various systems while preserving the trusted reliability and security healthcare providers depend on. This modernization is not just about maintaining outdated legacy systems, it's about building a stronger, scalable foundation for the future of healthcare.

Interoperability: A crucial step toward modernization


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

A significant barrier to digital transformation in the healthcare industry is achieving interoperability — the smooth flow of data between systems that typically operate in isolation. Despite the rising adoption of EHRs and other digital communication platforms, many organizations struggle to integrate their legacy fax systems into modern workflows. This creates silos where vital patient information becomes trapped in outdated formats, further increasing administrative burdens.  

Modern cloud-based fax solutions offer a bridge between traditional and digital systems. By leveraging APIs and technology partnerships, cloud fax can automatically integrate faxed documents into EHRs or other healthcare platforms. This ensures that vital information is accessible in real time while remaining confidential and HIPAA-compliant, enhancing coordination and decision-making. Moreover, interoperability facilitated by cloud fax lays the groundwork for adopting advanced technologies, such as predictive analytics and remote patient monitoring, which rely on seamless data exchange.

In 2023, 70% of hospitals engaged in all four domains of interoperable exchange, compared to 46% in 2018. This growing commitment underscores the importance of modernization efforts that enhance interoperability, allowing healthcare providers to unlock the full potential of their existing systems. 

Rather than eliminating legacy fax systems altogether, modernization efforts can build upon the reliability and trust that these systems have established over time. By enhancing these systems with cloud-based interoperability, healthcare providers can drive significant improvements in efficiency and patient care without the disruption of a complete overhaul. In fact, the global healthcare interoperability solutions market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% from 2024 to 2029, highlighting the increasing demand for seamless integration and innovation in the sector.

Operational advantages & the path to digital transformation  

Healthcare providers face substantial financial and operational pressures, with over $8 billion lost annually due to IT inefficiencies, system downtime, and lack of integration. Interoperability and operational efficiency go hand in hand as seamless data exchange across systems reduces redundancies, minimizes downtime, and ensures that critical resources are utilized to their fullest potential. 

This is where cloud-based solutions come in. By eliminating the need for on-premises equipment, these solutions empower healthcare organizations to scale their communication capabilities without the limitations of traditional hardware. 

This scalability is especially crucial during peak periods, such as open enrollment or public health crises, when legacy servers often struggle to manage increased volumes. When integrated seamlessly with existing systems, cloud fax solutions enhance operational workflows, reduce administrative overhead, and allow IT teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine maintenance. 

These efficiencies not only support day-to-day operations but also provide a solid foundation for broader digital transformation, advancing interoperability and enabling a more connected healthcare ecosystem.

The future of healthcare communication  

As the healthcare landscape evolves, so must its communication systems. Cloud Fax represents the immediate future of healthcare communication: a secure, efficient, and compliant solution that meets the demands of a rapidly changing industry. By modernizing healthcare systems with cloud-based solutions, healthcare providers can preserve the reliability of traditional systems while overcoming their limitations to achieve ongoing growth. For organizations seeking to balance innovation with regulatory requirements, it offers a clear path forward.

Yesterday the Health Impact Investment Platform (HIIP) held its inaugural Steering Committee meeting, marking a significant milestone in advancing innovative financing for global health. As the Platform's highest decision-making body, the Committee – consisting of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank – reviewed progress, endorsed key governance and operational priorities, and provided strategic guidance on HIIP's efforts to expand primary health care (PHC) services in low- and middle-income countries. The meeting represents a significant step forward in advancing sustainable financing solutions for global health.

The HIIP was unveiled during the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris in 2023, and is a landmark partnership between WHO, multilateral development banks and beneficiary countries. Amid a US$ 371 billion annual health financing gap for health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a US$ 31.1 billion annual funding requirement for pandemic preparedness, the Platform innovates multilateral solutions to increase the share of development funding going to the health sector. Integrating technical expertise, financial resources and local knowledge into impactful, country-driven investments in vulnerable communities, the Platform has mobilized over US$ 30 million of investment for WHO to support countries in developing prioritized investment plans for potential support from MDBs and donors.

The Platform aims to use these plans to generate over US$1.5 billion funding for low- and middle-income country governments to build resilience against pandemic threats and the climate crisis.

“Primary health care is the cornerstone of equitable, cost-effective, and inclusive health systems,” said Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General at the World Health Organization. “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a transformative initiative to mobilize financing for climate-adaptive and crisis-resilient primary health care in the countries that need it most. WHO is proud to partner with multilateral development banks and countries to ensure these funds deliver tangible impact for the communities we serve.”

The First Steering Committee builds on months of progress since the Platform's official launch in September 2024, with early-stage engagements in more than 10 countries. During the meeting, Committee members approved key operational documents for the platform, reviewed Concept Notes developed to operationalize primary health care investments in Burundi, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Morocco and Zambia and formally approved the Proposal for Action in Ethiopia, unlocking funding to support the finalization of its national PHC investment plan. Members reinforced the platform's core focus on scaling primary health care investments, accelerating progress toward universal health coverage, and strengthening health system resilience in low- and middle-income countries.

Issa Faye, Director General of Global Practice and Partnerships at the Islamic Development Bank noted, “We are committed to catalyzing impactful, sustainable investments that strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Today's discussions reaffirmed our shared vision and commitment to scaling up investment in primary health care, ensuring that no country is left behind in achieving universal health coverage and pandemic preparedness.”

The next Steering Committee meeting will convene on the margins of the Seventy-Eighth World Health Assembly (19–27 May 2025), where progress on Ethiopia's investment plan and new country engagements will be reviewed.

Thomas Östros, Vice President at the European Investment Bank and the newly appointed Chair of the Steering Committee emphasized, “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a unique opportunity to bridge the health financing gap and drive sustainable investments where they are most needed. As we look ahead to the next Steering Committee, our focus remains on turning commitments into action. We call on all stakeholders to join us in expanding access to quality primary health care, ensuring that investments today translate into stronger, more resilient health systems for the future.”

Going forward, the HIIP will deepen engagements with the first wave of applicants and expand support to other interested countries. Eligible countries for the HIIP include low- and middle-income countries which are a country of operation for at least one of the partner Multilateral Development Banks. Governments seeking to strengthen PHC through tailored technical assistance and investment support are invited to express their interest via an email addressed to hiip_secretariat@who.int.

Oops, something went wrong

Google on Tuesday announced new products and features aimed at healthcare use cases, including improved overviews in Google Search for health queries, medical records APIs, and new health-focused "open" AI models.

In Search, Google says it's using AI and ranking systems to expand "knowledge panel" answers on thousands of health-related topics, and adding support for healthcare queries in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese on mobile. Search already provided knowledge panel answers for ailments such as the flu or the common cold, but the update greatly expands the number of topics the knowledge panels cover, the company said.

Google is also debuting a Search feature it's calling "What People Suggest" on mobile in the U.S. to highlight content from users with shared experiences relating to health conditions. For instance, if someone asks about common exercises for people dealing with arthritis, What People Suggest will collate reports from various forums around the web using AI.

What People Suggest builds on capabilities like Google's personal health stories feature on YouTube, and seems pretty clearly aimed at keeping people from leaving Search for Reddit and other sources of health advice.

"While people come to Search to find reliable medical information from experts, they also value hearing from others who have similar experiences," Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer at Google, wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. "Using AI, we're able to organize different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes, helping you quickly grasp what people are saying."

Google on Tuesday also launched new medical records APIs globally for its Health Connect platform for Android devices. These will help collect data from medical providers and let users see this data across different apps, as well as make it easier to access the info on devices like phones, Google said.

"These APIs enable apps to read and write medical record information like allergies, medications, immunizations, and lab results in standard FHIR format," DeSalvo explained in the blog post. "With these additions, Health Connect supports over 50 data types across activity, sleep, nutrition, vitals, and now medical records — making it easier to connect your everyday health data with data from your doctor's office."

In other product announcements pertaining to health, Google said that the Loss of Pulse Detection feature on its Pixel Watch 3 smartwatch, which has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will launch by the end of March in the U.S. The feature can detect when you've experienced a loss of pulse — for example, due to primary cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning — and automatically prompt a call to emergency services if you're unresponsive.

Google also unveiled new open AI models for drug discovery called TxGemma, following the company's launch of a collection of Gemini AI models for multimodal use cases in healthcare. TxGemma is set to be released in the coming weeks.</p>

The Yukon Party wants to see U.S. doctors set up shop in the Yukon — and they want to see the governing Liberals do everything they can to help facilitate that.

In the legislative assembly on March 13, Lake Laberge MLA Brad Cathers presented a motion urging the government to start taking steps to recruit American healthcare workers, including setting up a marketing campaign, allowing U.S.-certified doctors, surgeons and specialists to practice in the territory, and speeding up the licensing of American nurses and other healthcare workers.

As the News has reported, the territory is experiencing a physician shortage. None of the visiting physicians who practiced in the territory in 2024 put down roots, and a surgeon left the territory, stating the “systemic underfunding” of the territory's surgical services as a reason.

Geraldine Van Bibber, MLA for Porter Creek North, referenced the tumultuous political climate stateside in question period.

“Right now, given what is going on south of the border, there seems to be a unique opportunity to recruit American doctors who wish to leave the U.S.,” said Van Bibber, referencing Nova Scotia's 2023 move to allow American board-certified physicians to practice in the province without extra certification.

“Will the Government of Yukon take steps to quickly allow U.S. board-certified doctors, surgeons, and specialists to practise in the Yukon?”

The B.C. government is currently crafting a similar approach. According to a March 11 press release, that government is working with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. to allow American doctors, certified with the American Board of Medical Specialties to become fully licensed to work in B.C. “without the need for further assessment, examination or training.”

The release also says the province is working with the B.C. College of Nurses and Midwives to hasten the process of getting U.S.-registered nurses working in British Columbian healthcare.

With the new process, the B.C. government said that American nurses can apply directly to the college for licensing.

In answering Van Bibber's question, Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai said that the territorial department of community services is working closely like the health department to recruit healthcare workers.

In his response Pillai also mentioned a collaborative letter of intent about health human resources which signed between the Yukon and Nova Scotia on July 26, 2023.

A press release issued at the time said the two jurisdictions will “share best practices on the recruitment, retention and training of health care providers, including the credentialing and licensing of internationally educated health providers.”

He referenced the territory's newly-launched navigator system for foreign healthcare workers looking to become licensed and practice in the territory.

Health Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee said the government is working with regulators — as well as provinces, territories and the feds — to find ways to get physicians licensed, including internationally-educated ones.

She also said YG's goal is a recruiting system geared towards all sorts of internationally-trained healthcare workers, not just Americans.

Outside the legislature, Cathers told reporters he and his party want to see a marketing campaign promoting the Yukon, directly targeted at healthcare workers in the United States.

“There's a unique opportunity to, to go after them right now, to reach out to those people and to encourage them to come and work here,” Cathers said.

Cathers said YG needs to be competitive with other jurisdictions in terms of offers to attract healthcare workers. He said incentives should target American healthcare workers interested in moving north and providing service to Yukoners.

On March 17, Cathers and Yukon Party leader Currie Dixon asked questions about attracting U.S. healthcare workers in the legislative session, continuing the push from the previous week.

Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, area hospitals and health systems are still reeling from its impact.

In the spring of 2020, hospitals were the first to feel the full force of the pandemic as they scrambled to find enough beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE). And yes, health care providers learned lessons that continue to help them care for the sick and prepare for any future outbreaks.

Anyone can see the impact in the easy availability of hand sanitizer and masks in health care facilities, the absence of salad bars in cafeterias and the prevalence of mental health therapists offering telehealth appointments.

And hospitals no longer struggle with a lack of basic outbreak supplies.

But the pandemic created huge staffing and financial challenges that have not gone away, health officials said.

“Our hospitals are still experiencing vacancy rates more than double pre-pandemic levels,” said Lauren Ford, vice president, strategy and analysis for the Iroquois Healthcare Association, which represents more than 50 hospitals and health systems in 32 upstate counties.

And those vacancies are hitting all departments, she said.

To fill the clinical vacancies, hospitals now rely far more heavily on traveling, or agency, nurses and other staff, driving expenses up. That's one factor that led to 60% of their hospitals ending 2023 in the red, Ford said.

The pandemic also created an atmosphere in which disease prevention has actually gotten harder, Dr. Gary Zimmer, chief medical officer in the Mohawk Valley Health System, argued. Too many people believe health misinformation, which has proliferated, and don't trust the advice coming from public health professionals, he said.

“I think that we'll be better prepared to respond to whatever the next outbreak is from a health system perspective,” Zimmer said.

But the public might be even less willing to follow the advice of public health officials given “such weaponization of information right now”, exacerbating any outbreak, he added.

“It's very interesting to me,” Zimmer said, “how it has been turned into some political agenda, which is a shame.”

One of the biggest benefits of the pandemic lockdown was simply a fortunate side effect. With people staying home when they got sick, with people spending less time together in general and with people wearing masks, almost no one caught the flu during the first and second winter of COVID-19, Zimmer said.

But the discovery that flu really is preventable hasn't changed much or prevented the rampant spread of flu, COVID-19, RSV and norovirus this winter.

Too many people aren't wearing masks when they're sniffling or coughing, or staying home from work when they're sick, Zimmer said. And too many people don't trust vaccines, he said.

“To me, it's mind boggling that we didn't learn our lesson,” he said.

He blamed conspiracy theories and the “politicization of science.”

“People don't trust what they're seeing (from public health officials),” Zimmer said. “I think we do know (best practices). I worry that that information is not being widely adopted.”

Health care providers and public health officials are doing a better job of reacting to outbreaks of illness, he added. But that's not enough.

They need to get better at giving the public proactive messages about, for example, what to do when flu cases are rising: stay home, don't go to the emergency room with sniffles, take a decongestant, stay well hydrated, don't get other people sick, Zimmer said.

“Those, we still have more work to do,” he said, “to be able to get the word out to the community in a way that they believe it's coming from a good place for their own health and welfare.”

Health care providers and public health officials did learn a lot during the country's first pandemic in a century. That knowledge led to new protocols, procedures and data collection in hospitals for infection prevention, treatment and tracking, Zimmer said.

In the Mohawk Valley Health System, the changes were as small as more masks kept at the front desk, ready for visitors with respiratory symptoms, and the end of the salad bar and self-serve soup in the cafeteria, said Caitlin McCann, vice president of marketing and communications.

 Wynn Hospital in Utica also restricted the public to accessing the hospital through its front door and emergency department door to improve security, but also to make it easier to ensure that infection control procedures are followed, McCann said.

The hospital has also put formal visiting hours back in place, no longer allowing visitors to stay past 8 p.m., except in special circumstances, to minimize exposure to infections, said Zimmer, who said he's spoken to colleagues about changes since he did not work at the hospital during the height of the pandemic.

In one sense, the pandemic came along at a fortuitous time for MVHS since it was still designing Wynn Hospital, which opened in October, 2023.

A few things in the hospital's design were changed based on what doctors learned about infection control and dealing with outbreaks during the pandemic, Zimmer said.

One big change was the inclusion of better isolation capabilities, he said. For example, an entire pod with 10 beds in the emergency department can turn into a negative pressure unit, which stops the spread of infection outside the room, if needed.

That's in addition to regular negative pressure rooms in the department, Zimmer said.

And there are more inpatient isolation units than had originally been planned, he said.

On a treatment level, doctors learned a lot about managing an infectious respiratory illness when resources, especially beds and ventilators, were tight, Zimmer said. As the pandemic progressed, they got better at deciding exactly which patients needed to be in the hospital; managing low-oxygen patients when there weren't enough ventilators, treating patients on other oxygen-delivering devices and managing patients on ventilators or other devices outside the intensive care unit, he said.

The pandemic changed “the dynamic about the care of contagious people and people with respiratory illnesses very dramatically,” Zimmer said.

And hospitals also learned about preparation.

 “We have lot of ventilators (now),” Zimmer said.

Rome Health also learned from capacity issues during the pandemic.

“COVID-19 was a catalyst for Rome Health to refocus efforts to ensure access to care was available in Rome,” said Cassie Winter, vice president of communications and marketing. “With regional demand exceeding capacity, we needed to be ale to provide the care locally because of the difficulty of transferring patients due to a lack of capacity at tertiary care facilities and the lack of ambulance availability due to staffing shortages.”

Winter also noted another big change that has done a lot to increase access to care: telehealth. Medicare, Medicaid and insurers wouldn't generally pay for providers for services delivered through telehealth before the pandemic. But that changed during the pandemic and telehealth continues to be used far more frequently.

And now providers all have telehealth infrastructure for smoother transitions during future crises, Winter said.

 “For example, during the snow emergencies this season,” she said, “some in-person visits could be converted to telehealth and some job functions could telecommute.”

One of the biggest impacts of the pandemic on health care has been how difficult it's gotten to hire and retain employees in every department, Zimmer said.

And for workers not involved in direct patient care, commutes have become a major problem, he said.

“People have opportunities to work in a lot of other areas that don't require them to drive to work every day,” he said.

There are even fewer volunteers now than before the pandemic, Winter said.

And burnout and anxiety from the pandemic continue to plague many clinical workers, which has contributed to staffing shortages, she said.

For registered nurses, the job with the highest gap between need and employees, the vacancy rate across the Iroquois Healthcare Association's member hospitals and health systems was 15.4% as of January, Ford said. That translates to over 2,600 unfilled nursing jobs, she said.

And in the long term care facilities run by the association's members, about 20% of positions for R.N.'s, licensed practical nurses and certified nursing assistants are unfilled, limiting facilities' capacity to care for patients just when the demand for services is rising, Ford said.

There's also a big shortage of behavioral health workers and a physician shortage that cuts down on services and leads to lower revenues, Ford said.

Even vacancies among, for example, patient registration clerks, affects operations and patient experience “in really meaningful ways,” she said.

With all the staffing issues, hospitals have been forced to hire workers, particularly nurses, who work for agencies and take on jobs per diem, Ford said. During the pandemic, these nurses made up staffing shortfalls given the surge in patients.

But hospitals have continued to rely on them to make up for unfilled positions, she said. At the height of reliance on them in 2022, some hospitals' costs for contract labor went up as much as 300% to 400%, she said. That year association member hospitals spent close to $1.2 billion on contract labor, Ford said.

By 2024, that had fallen to about $700 million, but that's still considerably more than they spent before the pandemic, she said.

Hospitals are trapped in a vicious cycle in which the cost of travel nurses prevents them from offering the kinds of compensation packages that would help them to hire the permanent staffing they'd prefer, Ford said.

Some hospitals never even used travel nurses before the pandemic, but they now form a consistent percentage of everyone's workforce, she said.

“I think there's just been a fundamental change in staffing models,” she said.

Total labor expenses for area hospitals and health systems have gone up 37% since 2019, Ford said. And other expenses have risen sharply, too, with medication showing the sharpest increase, she said.

And that's all contributed to financial struggles for hospitals and health systems. By the end of 2023, 60% of hospitals in the association had negative operating margins, Ford said. Things improved somewhat in 2024 given strong investments in health care by the federal and state governments, she said.

But some hospitals remained in the red and very few reached the 2.5% operating margins that experts in hospital finance believe to be healthy, Ford said.

And that means that the final state budget and the federal government's decisions on how much to cut health care expenses, Ford said, will play a big role in determining the health and stability of upstate New York's hospitals.</p>

NEW HAVEN, CT – With Medicaid facing unprecedented cuts at the federal level, Connecticut is on the verge of a healthcare crisis that could devastate families, strain hospitals, and upend community health centers already struggling to stay afloat, officials said Monday.





Lawmakers, healthcare administrators, and advocates gathered Monday at Fair Haven Community Health Care for a roundtable discussion to address the potential consequences of these budget reductions, stress the urgency of action, and dispel widespread misconceptions about the program.





“Medicaid is often thought of as a program for people who don't work, but that's simply not true,” said Tiffany Donelson, CEO of the Connecticut Health Foundation. “Sixty-six percent of Medicaid recipients are employed. They're childcare workers, grocery store clerks, and home health aides. When we cut Medicaid, we are cutting the foundation that supports the workforce Connecticut depends on.”


Far from being a program that affects only the most economically disadvantaged, Medicaid serves 1.2 million Connecticut residents – a third of the state's population – including low-income families, people with disabilities, seniors in nursing homes, and even middle-class individuals who lack employer-sponsored insurance.





“There is not a single district in Connecticut without Medicaid recipients,” Donelson continued. “Even in our wealthiest towns, people depend on this program. Yet we are watching a situation unfold that could dismantle that support overnight.”





Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon said that Medicaid is woven into the financial structure of the state's healthcare system.


“Every hospital in Connecticut could not operate as it does without Medicaid,” he said. “Our nursing homes, our intermediate care facilities, all depend on it. If these cuts go through, it will devastate our healthcare infrastructure.”





Connecticut's Medicaid system had been facing challenges long before federal cuts were proposed. Health centers, which provide care for more than 440,000 low-income residents, have already resorted to depleting cash reserves and freezing hiring just to remain operational. Last week, Connecticut's Federally Qualified Health Centers filed a Declaratory Ruling Request with the Department of Social Services, arguing that the agency has failed to comply with both state and federal laws requiring reimbursement rates to reflect actual costs.





Sean Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, addressed the strain that health centers have been under. 


“We are already being forced to cut back on services due to underfunding,” Frick said. “If Medicaid funding is reduced even further, it will devastate healthcare access for the most vulnerable in our state.”





State leaders, including Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, discussed the fiscal constraints Connecticut is already facing. “We're already at our spending cap,” Looney said. “Even a small cut in federal Medicaid reimbursement could throw our state budget into chaos.”





The effects of Medicaid cuts will be widespread, with hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers uncertain about the future. Many Connecticut nursing homes depend on Medicaid funding, and further reductions could force closures, leaving thousands of elderly and disabled residents without care.


“We've already lost nursing homes due to financial pressures,” said Matt Barrett, president of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities. “If these cuts take effect, more will follow.”





Hospitals are also warning that reduced Medicaid reimbursements will push more patients into emergency rooms, further straining a system already struggling with staffing shortages and financial uncertainty.





The lessons learned about preventative health care from the COVID-19 pandemic were still fresh in many healthcare providers' minds as they expressed fear that Medicaid cuts will lead to worsening health outcomes for those who rely on the program.


“When people lose access to primary care, they don't disappear,” said Dr. Suzanne Lagarde, CEO of Fair Haven Community Health Care. “They show up in the emergency room, where hospitals are legally required to treat them. But ERs aren't designed for routine care. That means sicker patients, higher costs, and an overwhelmed healthcare system.”





“Medicaid pays for two in five births,” said US Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. “What happens before and after birth determines the trajectory of a person's health for life. If we start cutting these services, we're setting up entire generations for worse outcomes.”





DeLauro has been one of the most vocal opponents of the federal cuts, warning that the reductions wouldn't just hurt Connecticut but would create ripple effects across the country.


“This isn't a blue-state issue or a red-state issue – this is an American issue,” she said. “Speaker Mike Johnson himself represents a district where nearly half of his constituents rely on Medicaid. Yet here we are, fighting to protect a program that keeps people alive.”





Despite the looming threat, advocates and healthcare providers refuse to back down.





“We are releasing a story every week from a Medicaid recipient,” Donelson said. “We want Connecticut residents to see their neighbors, to understand why this matters. These are real people – not statistics, not abstract figures, but parents, children, workers, and seniors who rely on Medicaid to survive.”





DeLauro ended the roundtable with a warning: “This is not a policy debate. This is about whether people live or die. Every member of Congress who votes for these cuts should look into the eyes of the people they are hurting and explain why their healthcare isn't worth saving.”

Health centers, which provide care for more than 440,000 low-income residents, have already resorted to depleting cash reserves and freezing hiring just to remain operational. Last week, Connecticut's Federally Qualified Health Centers filed a Declaratory Ruling Request with the Department of Social Services, arguing that the agency has failed to comply with both state and federal laws requiring reimbursement rates to reflect actual costs.





Sean Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, addressed the strain that health centers have been under. 


“We are already being forced to cut back on services due to underfunding,” Frick said. “If Medicaid funding is reduced even further, it will devastate healthcare access for the most vulnerable in our state.”





State leaders, including Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, discussed the fiscal constraints Connecticut is already facing. “We're already at our spending cap,” Looney said. “Even a small cut in federal Medicaid reimbursement could throw our state budget into chaos.”





The effects of Medicaid cuts will be widespread, with hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers uncertain about the future. Many Connecticut nursing homes depend on Medicaid funding, and further reductions could force closures, leaving thousands of elderly and disabled residents without care.


“We've already lost nursing homes due to financial pressures,” said Matt Barrett, president of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities. “If these cuts take effect, more will follow.”





Hospitals are also warning that reduced Medicaid reimbursements will push more patients into emergency rooms, further straining a system already struggling with staffing shortages and financial uncertainty.





The lessons learned about preventative health care from the COVID-19 pandemic were still fresh in many healthcare providers' minds as they expressed fear that Medicaid cuts will lead to worsening health outcomes for those who rely on the program.


“When people lose access to primary care, they don't disappear,” said Dr. Suzanne Lagarde, CEO of Fair Haven Community Health Care. “They show up in the emergency room, where hospitals are legally required to treat them. But ERs aren't designed for routine care. That means sicker patients, higher costs, and an overwhelmed healthcare system.”





“Medicaid pays for two in five births,” said US Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. “What happens before and after birth determines the trajectory of a person's health for life. If we start cutting these services, we're setting up entire generations for worse outcomes.”





DeLauro has been one of the most vocal opponents of the federal cuts, warning that the reductions wouldn't just hurt Connecticut but would create ripple effects across the country.


“This isn't a blue-state issue or a red-state issue – this is an American issue,” she said. “Speaker Mike Johnson himself represents a district where nearly half of his constituents rely on Medicaid. Yet here we are, fighting to protect a program that keeps people alive.”





Despite the looming threat, advocates and healthcare providers refuse to back down.





“We are releasing a story every week from a Medicaid recipient,” Donelson said. “We want Connecticut residents to see their neighbors, to understand why this matters. These are real people – not statistics, not abstract figures, but parents, children, workers, and seniors who rely on Medicaid to survive.”





DeLauro ended the roundtable with a warning: “This is not a policy debate. This is about whether people live or die. Every member of Congress who votes for these cuts should look into the eyes of the people they are hurting and explain why their healthcare isn't worth saving.”








Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon said that Medicaid is woven into the financial structure of the state's healthcare system.



“Every hospital in Connecticut could not operate as it does without Medicaid,” he said. “Our nursing homes, our intermediate care facilities, all depend on it. If these cuts go through, it will devastate our healthcare infrastructure.”

March 18, 2025


							Taylor is the current chair of Unite Here Health. Johnson is president of the American Benefits Council.						

As the new Congress and administration are settling in, all eyes in Washington are focused on the trillion-dollar question: whether and how to pay for the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law in President Trump's first term.

Among the various revenue-generating proposals emerging from GOP circles — including some of the president's most trusted advisers — is one that would increase taxes on American workers with employer-provided health care coverage. How to pay for the forthcoming tax bill is a valid debate, but one thing is certain: Burdening hardworking Americans with new taxes on something as fundamental as health care coverage is not the solution voters are looking for.

We have seen proposals and recommendations from the Paragon Health Institute, Heritage Foundation, Republican Study Committee, and the Cato Institute — all of which boast close ties to President Trump — to tax employer-provided health care coverage.  The Bipartisan Policy Center also specifically highlighted a tax on employer-provided health care as an option to pay for extending the TCJA. Given how many identical proposals have surfaced from these conservative and bipartisan thought leaders, coupled with a need for federal revenue, employers and unions alike are understandably concerned workers' benefits could be taxed.

Employer-provided health care coverage is a cornerstone of American employment. More than 178 million Americans have employer-provided health care coverage. That's more people than Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchange marketplaces, TRICARE, and Veterans Affairs health care benefits combined.

Since their inception, these benefits have been “excluded” from income, meaning employees are not taxed on the cost employers pay for their health care coverage. Any proposal to add new taxes to workers' health coverage would undermine this system upon which the majority of Americans and their families rely.

Many American families are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of food, housing, and other essential needs. Health care is no exception. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, annual per-capita health expenditures are expected to exceed $15,700 in 2025 — a 59% increase since 2015 — and rise to nearly $22,000 by 2032.

The soaring cost of health care is one of the fundamental economic challenges of our age. It is a crisis born of multiple problems: inflation, market consolidation, and a lack of price transparency, among many others. It would add insult to injury (and illness) if workers who are at their most vulnerable are forced to pay taxes on the insurance that makes it possible to afford the ever-increasing cost of health care. As demonstrated in 2024 Election Night polling, 93% of voters want employer-provided health care coverage to remain tax-free because it encourages employers to provide high-quality, affordable health care coverage.

Policy proposals to tax health care coverage can vary by design, but one option examined by the Congressional Budget Office could leave a working family making $35,000 paying an additional $1,100 in taxes in 2025 and by 2030, inflation would increase it to an additional $2,325 in taxes, resulting in a 62% higher tax burden.

Some proponents of taxing health coverage assert that they would only impose a tax on those with higher incomes or “Cadillac” plans. But once the concept is enshrined in law, every time Congress needs billions of dollars — perhaps to pay for some initiative completely unrelated to health care — it could turn the dial lower (or let inflation do it for them), subjecting many more people to the tax.

To what end? Perhaps the true goal is to push employers out of their role as sponsors of health care coverage. This would be deeply counterproductive. Not only do employers add value and innovation to the design and operation of health care coverage, but the government's own data shows that employer coverage is a tremendous bargain for the American taxpayer.

According to the White House Office of Management and Budget, $216 billion in forgone taxes on workers and families was attributable to the income tax exclusion for employer-provided health coverage in 2023. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that employer group health insurance funds paid out $1.3 trillion that same year. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of $1.3 trillion divided by $216 billion reveals that each dollar of federal expenditure yielded approximately $6.02 in benefits for covered employees and their families — a more than 6-to-1 return on the government's investment.

Employer-provided health insurance not only brings value to the economy, but of all the health coverage options in the United States it also yields  the best bang for the taxpayer's buck. On a per-patient annual basis, the government (and taxpayers) pay the most for Medicare at nearly $18,000 per enrollee, then the Affordable Care Act's exchange marketplaces at nearly $6,000 per enrollee, then Medicaid at more than $5,500 per enrollee, and lastly employer plans at $2,000 per enrollee. While some of this delta reflects health status and demographic differences, it's safe to say employer plans are still a bargain to taxpayers in comparison. Recent Congressional Budget Office data also indicates that with the ACA's enhanced subsidies, the cost to the federal government of exchange marketplace plans will actually be higher than $6,000 this year and topping $7,000 in 2027. If Congress makes the wrong choice and eliminates the health care tax exclusion, people who leave employer coverage will likely be forced into the more costly markets in our health care system.

Furthermore, if the policy is designed to target the employers, they might cut benefits or drop coverage altogether, potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common reason adults between the ages of 18 and 64 choose to remain uninsured is because coverage is unaffordable. This means more healthy adults are likely to go without coverage than absorb a significant increase to their health care costs. When healthy adults leave the risk pools of large group plans, premiums rise even further for those who remain insured.

In 2019, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act's 40% tax on employer-provided health care coverage — then known as the “Cadillac Tax.” This tax operated like a cap on the exclusion but was designed with a different policy mechanism. The biggest question now is, will President Trump double down on his support for millions of American workers and their families by rejecting proposals to tax health benefits for the first time.  

There is broad bipartisan support for protecting workers' health care coverage and opposing short-sighted and misguided proposals to tax health benefits.  As the current chair of UNITE HERE HEALTH and the president of the American Benefits Council, we recently joined a broad stakeholder group of 70 employer groups, unions, patient groups, and other health care stakeholders who urged Congress not to disrupt the vital employer-provided health coverage that the majority of Americans rely upon for lifesaving care every day.

Congress must wholeheartedly reject any proposal that seeks to undermine the health and financial security of American workers.

D. Taylor is the current chair of Unite Here Health. Katy Johnson is president of the American Benefits Council.

Correction: A previous version of this essay misstated the Bipartian Policy Center's position on taxing health benefits.
