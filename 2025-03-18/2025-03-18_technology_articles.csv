https://techmeme.com,Google acquires cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion,https://www.theverge.com/google/24198766/google-acquires-wiz-cloud-cybersecurity-32-billion,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:36:49 GMT","Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has announced its largest-ever acquisition, entering into a deal to buy New York-based cybersecurity firm Wiz, making it a part of its Google Cloud division. This is the company’s second attempt to buy Wiz after talks stalled last year at a lower $23 billion evaluation.

Wiz is a fast-growing Israeli-founded startup that works with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to provide cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company was valued at $12 billion in May 2024, which reportedly climbed to $16 billion later in the year in an equity offering to employees, and has been working towards an initial public offering (IPO) in the months since the previous acquisition fell through. Should the deal receive regulatory approval, it will easily outsize the $12.5 billion paid by Google for Motorola Mobility in 2012.

“We expect this change to enable us to execute and innovate even faster,” said Wiz cofounder and CEO Assaf Rappaport in a blog post. “Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company.”

Perhaps to head off antitrust concerns, Google has confirmed that Wiz’s products will continue to be available across competitor cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud. “Wiz needs to remain a multicloud platform,” Rappaport adds. The Google Cloud Marketplace will also offer a selection of other security services beyond those provided by Wiz.

Google is currently embroiled in two separate antitrust lawsuits with the Justice Department over its search engine and digital advertising businesses. It lost the first but is appealing the ruling, and a final decision is still awaited on the second.

The Wiz purchase is the latest of several acquisitions that Google has made in recent years as it attempts to bolster security for its cloud computing customers. In 2022, Google purchased two cybersecurity firms — Siemplify and Mandiant — for $500 million and $5.4 billion, respectively, with the latter company best recognized for uncovering the SolarWinds hack. Adding Wiz to that mix feels like a targeted effort to tighten Google’s cloud protections in the face of Microsoft’s less-than-stellar cybersecurity reputation.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Here’s why Google pitched its $32B Wiz acquisition as ‘multicloud’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/heres-why-google-pitched-its-32b-wiz-acquisition-as-multicloud/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Tuesday’s big news that Google is acquiring security startup Wiz for a record-breaking $32 billion comes with a very big qualifier. Google says it will position Wiz as a “multicloud” offering, meaning Wiz will not be a Google-only shop.

The reality is that Google had no choice but to do this, and a closer look at the reasons behind the decision also highlights Google’s weak spots in the months ahead.

Customer retention

Wiz brings a massive customer list to Google. As of today, the startup has already reached an annual revenue rate of $700 million. Before the news broke on Tuesday, it was on track for that to grow to $1 billion.

“Before the news broke” is the operative phrase here. Google and Wiz surely hope the acquisition will create an interesting new funnel of customers and revenue, but first and foremost, both will need to ensure they keep existing customers from shopping around for another security provider.

Many of these customers already use a hybrid cloud arrangement and may not use Google Cloud at all. One of the key reasons some of them chose Wiz in the first place was its ability to support multiple cloud platforms.

If Google cuts off that ability, it risks alienating those users.

That’s why Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport and other senior leaders were calling customers in the hours leading up to the deal, reassuring them that it’s just business as usual.

Antitrust regulation

When news broke last summer that Alphabet/Google was looking to acquire Wiz, speculation quickly followed about the regulatory challenges of pushing such a large deal through. Google has been under intense antitrust scrutiny for years, particularly for its dominance in areas like search, mobile operating systems, and advertising.

The regulatory climate has shifted since. The U.S. under President Trump has yet to hear a major antitrust case, and there are mixed opinions about how his administration’s take will approach Big Tech. Some believe that big tech companies will still face roadblocks; others think the big-deal window is open once again.

“That Google feels able to contemplate big M&A again seems big in itself,” said one source. “Do they think they have the Trump administration on its side?”

Meanwhile, in smaller but still influential markets like the U.K., regulators have recently taken a more favorable stance on Big Tech as part of a broader push to signal that “the U.K. is open for business.” So-called hyperscalers may see this as an opportunity to emerge from the shadows a little more.

Even if the regulatory climate remains tricky for Big Tech M&A, Google’s “multicloud” positioning can come in handy. Cloud services and cybersecurity are emphatically not two area where Google dominates right now, so this deal alone might not raise antitrust alarm bells.

If regulators are scrutinizing Google’s overall dominance, emphasizing Wiz’s ability to work across different cloud platforms could help Google’s argue that it supports competition.

Google Cloud just can’t catch up to AWS and Azure

The final reason Google had to embrace the multicloud model is simple: many customers just don’t and won’t use Google Cloud. As of Q4 2024, Statista data shows that AWS had a 30% share of the global cloud market, with Azure in second place with 21%. Google Cloud trails significantly behind them at 12%.

Why is Google so far behind? Some say it’s because AWS got an earlier start in the field. Some say that Microsoft’s enterprise dominance and strong ecosystem — including its OpenAI partnership — have given it an edge. Google lacks both advantages.

A couple of years ago, people wondered if Google might close the gap, given its cloud offerings were comparable to AWS and Azure.

“Google Cloud has always been a bit of a mystery when it comes to their position in third place in cloud infrastructure market share,” former TC writer Ron Miller tells TC today. “They run the largest cloud applications in the world, yet have had trouble translating that into products for enterprise customers.”

He thinks that changed under Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian. “He has much more credibility with enterprise customers,” says Miller. “They have been growing fast the last couple of years and have a pretty substantial business but still way behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of revenue.”

During an investor call on Tuesday, Kurian emphasized that Google pursued Wiz because of its multicloud capabilities, saying: “Multicloud is something our customers want. Our commitment to multicloud means that new IT projects an organization does with Google Cloud can work with their existing IT investments, and allows them to choose different vendors for products in the future. Customer don’t want to be locked into one vendor.”

But Kurian also thinks that AI might change the game.

AI architectures might cause large enterprises to pool data from multiple places to a central cloud provider, Kurian said. If that happens, then multicloud protection may become less critical,but security for their centralized cache of data will be.



Until then, multicloud is the pitch to “help customers identify, protect and defend against cyber threats across all major clouds and even in on-premise systems,” Kurian said.

Now we will see if regulators, and end users, buy into it.",techmeme

In what many venture investors have described as a sluggish M&A market, this week brings about what would be the largest acquisition of a private, venture-backed company ever — if it goes through.

The planned $32 billion acquisition of cloud security unicorn Wiz by Google parent Alphabet doesn’t come as a shock to many who watch cybersecurity closely. It was just last summer when news broke Alphabet was close to acquiring Wiz for approximately $23 billion, as first reported in The Wall Street Journal.

The reasoning for the deal now is roughly the same — Google is tired of being stuck in third place when it comes to cloud services — behind AWS and Microsoft’s Azure — and Wiz’s software helps companies secure their cloud applications by identifying and prioritizing threats, which could mean possible higher security revenue for the search giant.

As always these days, there’s also an artificial intelligence angle, as Wiz’s offerings also would help keep enterprise systems clean in the advent of AI.

Getting it done

However, reports last summer indicated the deal fell through because of Wiz’s intent to stay independent, as well as concerns about possible regulatory challenges in a dealmaking environment that many saw as unfriendly.

However, all of that comes with some important caveats. While the change in administration could bring less regulation to the market, there is still concern about how friendly the new administration — and the economy it creates — will be to both tech and M&A.

While most believe the election of President Donald Trump will change that environment, that remains to be seen.

The new head of the Justice Department’s antitrust efforts, Gail Slater, is a frequent critic of large technology companies — and Google certainly falls into that category.

Google also is dealing with its own regulatory issues, as just last year a federal judge ruled Google illegally maintained a monopoly in search and advertising markets and the Big Tech giant is facing the possibility of being broken up.

Cyber M&A

None of that means the deal won’t go through, just to point out it’s a far from certain thing (we all remember Adobe’s ill-fated $20 billion plan to buy design platform Figma).

If it does go through, it could be a boon for cyber dealmaking. The largest deal so far the industry has witnessed involving a VC-backed company was Okta’s $6.5 billion stock deal for Bellevue, Washington-based Auth0 way back in 2021.

After a down 2023, which saw only 71 M&A deals involving VC-backed cyber firms, last year saw a big uptick to 119, per Crunchbase data.

This year may well top that, as so far there have been 33 such deals.

Winners

The proposed purchase price also would suggest many VC firms would be happy to see this deal go through. It was just last May when Wiz locked up a $1 billion round at a $12 billion valuation.

That round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital, with participation from Greylock, Wellington Management and existing investors Cyberstarts, Greenoaks, Howard Schultz, Index Ventures, Salesforce Ventures 1 and Sequoia Capital.

All of those firms seemingly would make a nice profit after watching Wiz’s value jump 167% in less than a year — as would those who invested in earlier rounds.

The blockbuster deal will help Google with fast-growing cybersecurity solutions that companies use to remove critical risks, and would test the Trump administration’s appetite for big tech M&A after a few years of tight regulatory scrutiny.

Shares of Alphabet dipped more than 2%. The stock has been down 13% this year on worries over its hefty AI spending against the rise of China’s lower-cost DeepSeek and a pullback in tech giants that led the market for the past two years.

Alphabet is paying a heavier price than its $23 billion bid for Wiz last year, which the Israeli startup had rejected. It was valued at $12 billion in a private funding round last May.

Wall Street is hoping for a shift in antitrust policies under President Trump, whose pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission, Andrew Ferguson, is expected to dial back on big M&A regulation, a hallmark of his predecessor Lina Khan.

However, Trump has said he would continue heavy scrutiny on Big Tech, which began during his first term.

Wiz works with cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft’s Azure as well as Google Cloud and counts Morgan Stanley, BMW and luxury powerhouse LVMH among its customers.

“There will likely be a microscope on the deal by investors, given Google’s lackluster historical track record with capital allocation plan, specifically around M&A,” said Dave Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.

After the deal closes, Wiz will join Google Cloud business which generated more than $40 billion in revenue in 2024 and has outpaced growth in the search business in the recent years.

Wiz’s products will continue to be available across all other major cloud services. Alphabet expects the deal to close in 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said the higher price is based on another year of exponential growth for Wiz.

“For Google to be able to compete with Microsoft Azure for enterprise customers, it needs to be able to offer a deeper suite of services, including security software,” he said.

Wiz has agreed to a termination fee of more than $3.2 billion, a source told Reuters, one of the highest fees in M&A history.

Interest in the cybersecurity industry has risen since last year’s global CrowdStrike outage roiled operations across industries, prompting companies to spend more on safeguarding their online domains.

Regulatory concerns

Google has emphasized that Wiz would continue working with competing cloud platforms — potentially in a bid to head off regulatory concerns.

Interoperability has been a major theme in recent antitrust cases, including the Department of Justice’s existing case over Google’s ad tech.

The FTC is pursuing an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s cloud computing business.

“Generally speaking, Google is not a leader in the cloud business, and Wiz will still be available on all other cloud services,” said Elise Phillips, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group.

“Any type of exclusivity agreement between the two of them down the line would give me cause for concern.”

Google is already in the regulatory crosshairs, with the DOJ pushing for measures including a sale of its Chrome browser to address what a judge said was an illegal search monopoly.

“This (deal) will be a big test for pro-business advocates,” said Aptus Capital’s Wagner.

Google had $23.47 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Dec. 31, implying it might have to seek financing for the deal.

The company, which has kept aside $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, said on Tuesday its capital allocation plans remain unchanged.

In 2015, Wiz’s founders sold cloud security firm Adallom to Microsoft. The latest deal is another sign that Israel’s cybersecurity industry punches well above its weight.

https://techmeme.com,Google’s Sundar Pichai on Wiz deal: “We will turbocharge cloud security”,https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/hym5hmd3kl,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:27:59 GMT","“Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security.” With those words, Google CEO Sundar Pichai underscored the tech giant’s commitment to strengthening cybersecurity as it moves forward with its $32 billion acquisition of Wiz. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in 2026, marks one of the largest cybersecurity acquisitions in history and positions Wiz as a key player in Google Cloud’s security strategy.

Pichai’s statement reflects Google’s long-standing focus on security, now reinforced by integrating Wiz’s cutting-edge cloud security solutions. As businesses and governments increasingly rely on multi-cloud environments, the demand for robust cybersecurity tools has never been greater. “Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds,” Pichai said.

Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian echoed the sentiment, emphasizing that both companies share a vision of making cybersecurity more accessible. “Enabling more companies to prevent cyberattacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption, and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents,” Kurian stated.

Wiz, founded in 2020 by Assaf Rappaport and his team, has rapidly grown into a dominant force in cloud security, serving nearly 45% of Fortune 100 companies. Rappaport, in a blog post announcing the deal, framed the acquisition as a pivotal moment for cloud security. “Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,” he wrote.

One of the key aspects of the deal is Wiz’s commitment to remaining a multi-cloud security platform, continuing to support customers on AWS, Azure, Oracle, and other cloud providers. Google Cloud, which has historically pioneered security innovations like Zero Trust and Kubernetes, sees Wiz as a natural fit for expanding its cybersecurity portfolio.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Wiz and Google: Securing the Cloud,https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/wiz-and-google-securing-the-cloud/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:02:20 GMT","Before we partnered with Wiz in February 2020, our history with Assaf Rappaport and his co-founders Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik and Ami Luttwak already went back almost a decade.

We learned in 2013 that a team of alumni from Israel’s elite 8200 cybersecurity unit were starting a company together. We look for outliers at Sequoia—a founder coming out of 8200 was noteworthy, but a whole team was very special. They weren’t looking for financing. But after our Tel Aviv-based partner Gili Raanan secured a meeting, we convinced them to partner with Sequoia and we led the first financing for Adallom. (I later learned that Assaf thought I was Don Valentine when we first met, which may be why he agreed to the meeting.)

After selling Adallom to Microsoft and leading Microsoft’s Cloud Security Group for five years, the co-founders left to once again start something new. We were thrilled to hear they wanted Sequoia and Gili (who by then had his own firm, Cyberstarts) to be their first partners.

They didn’t know exactly what the something new would be, but they now had a proven track record and the ambition to build an enduring company. Before they even had a product, we led their initial financing round alongside Cyberstarts in early 2020 and I joined the board.

The team quickly hit on the insight that cloud security needed a simpler, agentless architecture for an increasingly complex digital world. Once the vision for Wiz became clear, they accelerated like no company I’ve ever seen: My partner Bogomil Balkansky, who also works with Wiz, says that in the early days the team strategically leveraged their Israeli time zone, working 9-5 on the product and then working late into the night on sales calls to the U.S. and Europe.

As we helped recruit team members, we were consistently impressed with the caliber of talent joining Wiz and their ability to move quickly. Wiz set a record, reaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just 18 months, faster than any software company in history, and quickly became a leader in cloud security.

Today’s milestone marks the start of an exciting new chapter. Wiz and Google Cloud share a vision to improve security by making it easier and faster for organizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end, across all major clouds. This will help spur the adoption of multicloud cybersecurity.

The future is bright for Wiz inside of Google Cloud. Just as we believed Google would change the world when we first partnered with the company in 1999, we believe Wiz is transforming cloud security.

At Sequoia, we partner with founders who want to make a dent in the universe. We couldn’t be prouder of Assaf and the team in reaching this milestone. It’s been an honor to be your partner for over a decade. Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Google to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in the biggest deal in company’s history,https://apnews.com/article/google-alphabet-wiz-32-billion-e50fb41b9a84a1056a116f963e6efed0,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:51:12 GMT","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has struck a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant’s biggest-ever acquisition at the same time it’s facing a potential breakup of its internet empire.

The proposed takeover announced Tuesday is part of Google’s aggressive expansion into cloud computing during an artificial intelligence boom. The frenzy is driving demand for data centers that provide the computing power for AI technology and intensifying the competition in that space among Google and two other tech powerhouses, Microsoft and Amazon.

If the all-cash transaction is approved by regulators, Wiz will join Google Cloud — an increasingly important part of its business separate from the search and advertising operations that account for most of the $350 billion annual revenue at Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

With the advent of AI, however, the cloud division has become a rising star at Google. Annual revenue in the division was $26.3 billion in 2022, and soared 64% to $43.2 billion last year.

Wiz, a five-year-old startup founded by four longtime friends who met in the Israeli army when they were still teenagers, is on track for an estimated $1 billion in revenue this year. After getting its start in Israel in 2020, Wiz now oversees an operation that makes security tools protecting the information stored in data centers from its current headquarters in New York.

“Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,” Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote in a blog post.

In a Tuesday conference call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted Cloud division’s addition of Wiz will result in even better security at a lower cost than can be provided now. That prediction may have been aimed as much at regulators likely to scrutinize how the deal will affect competition and pricing, as much as at prospective customers.

Google had been courting Wiz for some time before finally settling on a price that’s much richer than a reported $23 billion bid that was rejected last July. At that time, Wiz signaled it would instead pivot back to a previously-planned initial public offering. But recent volatility in the stock market has chilled the IPO market, and now Rappaport said Wiz expects to “innovate even faster” by becoming a part of Google.

Wedbush analysts called Google’s move to buy Wiz “a shot across the bow” at other tech giants, particularly Microsoft and Amazon, who have already made big bets on cyber security as the fight to dominate cloud computing intensifies. Google had fallen behind its competition in the cloud space, Wedbush said, but the acquisition of Wiz could alter the parameters.

The bid Tuesday easily eclipses the current largest acquisition in Google’s 26-year history — a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012 that didn’t pay off the way that the Mountain View, California, company had hoped. The $32 billion purchase of Wiz would also go down at the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition and rank among the 20 most expensive takeovers of a software company in history, according to Mergermarket, a financial intelligence service.

As often happens with high-priced acquisitions, investors reacted coolly to Tuesday’s news as Alphabet’s shares fell 3% during afternoon trading.

Some of Google’s other acquisitions have turned into gold mines, most notably its $1.76 billion purchase of online video pioneer YouTube in 2006 and its $3.1 billion takeover of advertising technology platform DoubleClick in 2008. A $5.4 billion purchase of another security firm, Mandiant, in 2022 also helped fuel the recent growth of Google’s Cloud division, which posted an operating profit of $6.1 billion last year.

Google’s DoubleClick deal is now part of an antitrust case filed by the U.S. Justice Department targeting Google’s technology for distributing ads across the internet. A ruling in that case, involving allegations that Google illegally abused its power to manipulate digital ad prices, is expected this year.

Regulators in the U.S. and abroad are targeting Google on other fronts, too.

Last year, a federal judge in another case brought by the Justice Department last year concluded Google had turned its ubiquitous search engine into an illegal monopoly. The penalization phase of that trial begins next month.

The Justice Department is seeking a rebuke that would include a requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser and would ban the company from making agreements with Apple and other companies to make its search engine the default tool for finding online information on the iPhone and other devices.

The Wiz deal will also get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to be more friendly to business deals, it has also shown itself to be leery of big tech.

The Wiz deal raises antitrust concerns due to the potential impact on standalone cyber security vendors, as well as potential disruption for bigger rivals. Still, Wedbush’s analysts note the industry is “ripe for consolidation” — which could pose “massive growth opportunities on the horizon heading into this AI Revolution.”

Antitrust worries were also believed among the reasons Wiz called off sales talks with Google last year while President Joe Biden’s administration was seeking to block a variety of tech deals. Agreeing to a sale now indicates both Google and Wiz are more confident the deal will gain U.S. approval under the Trump administration, Mergermarket analysts Kevin Ketcham and Kevin McCaffrey wrote in a Tuesday note.

“The two sides likely wouldn’t have struck the deal if they didn’t at least see a potential path to closing,” Ketcham and McCaffrey wrote.

If they get the regulatory greenlight and meet several conditions spelled out in their agreement, Google and Wiz expect the deal to close in 2026.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has struck a deal to purchase the cloud-security platform Wiz. With a price tag of $32 billion in cash, the purchase of Wiz makes it the biggest acquisition in the history of Google.

Google’s planned acquisition of Wiz for $32B dwarfs the price of its previous largest acquisition, as it cost the company nearly triple what it paid for Motorola Mobility in 2012 ($12.5 billion). Some of Alphabet’s other biggest acquisitions, by price tag, are Madiant for $5.4 billion in 2022, Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014, DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2007, and Looker for $2.6 billion in 2019.

According to Google, who expect the deal to close next year, the purchase of Wiz was down with the intention of “improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.” The tech powerhouse describes Wiz as “an easy-to-use security platform that connects to all major clouds and code environments to help prevent cybersecurity incident.”

Google’s official statement about the purchase of Wiz largely paints it as added protection against growing artificial technology intelligences, and said users of Wiz will be able to better protect everything the have in the cloud by using Wiz.

“This acquisition represents an investment by Google Cloud to accelerate two large and growing trends in the AI era: improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds. The increased role of AI, and adoption of cloud services, have dramatically changed the security landscape for customers, making cybersecurity increasingly important in defending against emergent risks and protecting national security.”

Wiz, founded in January 2020 by Assaf Rappaport, Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik, and Ami Luttwak, employed roughly 2,000 people as of November 2024. Google previously tried to acquire Wiz for $23 billion last year.

“From its earliest days, Google’s strong security focus has made us a leader in keeping people safe online. Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers. Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, said in a statement.

As for some of Google’s most notable acquisitions in terms of brand awareness, the company famously purchased YouTube for $1.6 billion in 2006. Other buzz-worthy Google purchases include Fitbit for $2.1 billion in 2021 and Waze for $1.3 billion in 2013.",techmeme

“Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport writes separately. “We both also believe Wiz needs to remain a multi-cloud platform, so that across any cloud, we will continue to be a leading platform. We will still work closely with our great partners at AWS, Azure, Oracle, and across the entire industry.”

Google had attempted to acquire Wiz at a lower valuation of $23 billion last year, but that deal feel through over regulatory concerns. This deal will still face regulatory scrutiny, but the current U.S. political climate, despite its tough stance on Big Tech, should prove more amenable to this type of deal, Plus, both companies are clearly pushing the multi-cloud aspect of the deal and their intention continue using Wiz across competitor’s product lines.

“Wiz’s products will continue to work and be available across all major clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud platforms, and will be offered to customers through an array of partner security solutions,” Google notes. “Google Cloud will also continue to offer customers wide choice through a variety of partner security solutions available in the Google Cloud Marketplace.”

Google later sold Moto to Lenovo, but Wiz might not suffer the same fate. That’s because Wiz isn’t in the business of manufacturing smartphones. Wiz might be a lot more important than that, considering the age of AI that we’re now entering.

While significant effort is being devoted to advanced AI models run on devices with limited resources, like mobile phones, we’ll still need cloud processing for the more advanced AI features that companies like OpenAI and Google release. At the same time, AI is becoming increasingly more personal, whether it runs on-device or in the cloud. Then there’s AI use in the enterprise, which might become even more sophisticated in the near future.

Cloud security will be more important than ever, and it makes a lot of sense that Google is looking to bolster the security of its Google Cloud product by buying one of the hottest cloud security startups in the world.

The acquisition isn’t just about AI features running in the cloud. We’ve been using the cloud for all sorts things well before the age of AI arrived. Regardless of the supplier of said cloud offerings, strong security is needed so hackers can’t breach services and access sensitive user data.

Offering enterprise customers top-of-the-line security across cloud services might be a key differentiator for Google Cloud compared to cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, Google’s biggest competitors.

Google wanted to buy the five-year-old startup last year and was ready to pay $23 billion. The talks fell through last July. Following the failed acquisition negotiations, Wiz wanted to go for an initial public offering instead.

As The Verge points out, Google might have been worried about additional anti-trust issues under the Biden administration. Those worries aren’t necessarily gone now that a friendlier administration has taken over. Google might still see some pushback from Trump’s FTC over the acquisition.

However, the deal has a better chance of going through. Also, Google plans to keep Wiz cybersecurity offerings in place for Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure cloud services. Wiz cofounder and CEO Assaf Rappaport confirmed in a blog post Google’s proposed acquisition without mentioning the purchase price. He noted that Wiz would continue to provide security to Google Cloud competitors:

Today’s news comes back to that same guiding principle. Wiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely. We both also believe Wiz needs to remain a multicloud platform, so that across any cloud, we will continue to be a leading platform. We will still work closely with our great partners at AWS, Azure, Oracle, and across the entire industry.

Rappaport also mentioned AI several times in the blog post, including the advantages Google’s AI will bring to Wiz’s security products:

Wiz has achieved so much in a relatively short period, but cybersecurity moves at warp speed and so must we. The time is now. We expect this change to enable us to execute and innovate even faster. Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company. [Google’s cloud] resources and AI expertise will significantly bolster Wiz in important ways for the people who matter most, [including customers, partners, and employees.]

The inclusion of Wiz security alongside Google’s own cloud security advancements should make Google Cloud even more appealing to customers. Even if large companies do not switch services to Google Cloud but pick Wiz tools to secure their AWS and/or Azure servers, it’ll still help with Google’s bottom line, especially over the long run.

Google is paying a massive fee to own Wiz. It wouldn’t do it without seeing a future where Wiz security helps it make back that money and then some.

As for what makes Wiz cybersecurity so compelling, it’s the company’s approach to handling cloud security. Companies going to Wiz for cloud cybersecurity do not need to install programs on their servers so those agents can monitor for threats. Instead, Wiz connects directly to the respective cloud providers and then gathers information about the cloud configurations.

That’s what makes Wiz solutions work with any cloud provider and why Wiz security will remain available to Amazon and Microsoft cloud customers even after the acquisition.

Also, Wiz security offers customers AI-powered, immediate, actionable information that informs companies of how their cloud security issues might impact operations and user data security. Wiz can help prevent some attacks rather than providing reports of how the breaches occurred.

Finally, Wiz is also known for finding a few key vulnerabilities associated with Azure infrastructure, like ChaosDB. Similarly, Wiz identified issues in Oracle and IBM clouds. More recently, Wiz found a massive DeepSeek security issue, a database containing user data that anyone could access, suggesting the Chinese AI’s first major hack might have already happened.

To put things in perspective, Wiz already works with 40% of the Fortune 100 companies. That’s enough to explain why Google would spend tens of billions on a relatively new security player. Wiz was founded in early 2020.",techmeme

Today, Google announced an agreement to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform, for approximately $32 billion. This will be an all-cash transaction subject to closing adjustments and regulatory approvals.

Wiz was started just 5 years ago and is headquartered in New York. Wiz offers an easy-to-use cybersecurity platform that works with all major clouds and code environments. Organizations ranging from startups to government agencies are using Wiz to protect their cloud services and applications.

Following the acquisition, Google promised that Wiz’s security services would continue to work and be available for Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud. They would also be offered through partner security solutions. Additionally, Google Cloud will continue to provide security solutions to other partners in the Google Cloud Marketplace.

Google promises that the Wiz and Google Cloud combination will be able to deliver the following through this proposed acquisition:

Unified Security Platform: A next-generation unified security platform that combines Wiz’s Cloud Security Platform with Google Security Operations, securing cloud-native applications at every stage of development, protecting code, CI/CD systems, and infrastructure.

Assaf Rappaport, Co-Founder & CEO, Wiz, said the following regarding the acquisition:

""Wiz and Google Cloud are fully committed to continue supporting and protecting customers across all major clouds, helping keep them safe and secure wherever they operate. This is an exciting moment for our company, but an even more important one for customers and partners, as this acquisition will bolster our mission to improve security and prevent breaches by providing additional resources and deep AI expertise.”

Google currently offers threat intelligence, security operations, and expert consulting through Mandiant.

https://techmeme.com,Confirmed: Google buys Wiz for $32B to beef up in cloud security,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/google-is-buying-wiz-for-32b-to-beef-up-in-cloud-security/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Google is making the biggest acquisition in its history. The company’s parent company Alphabet is buying Wiz, the cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash transaction. The deal has now been confirmed.

A source described the transaction as a $33 billion deal previously. That includes the $1 billion that Google is paying out on top of the acquisition price in the form of retention bonuses to make sure everyone stays on post-acquisition. With 1,700 people working at the company, that works out on average to more than $588,000 per employee (actual numbers likely to go up and down depending on their respective salaries).

Wiz will remain an independent platform that will work across all cloud providers, not just Google Cloud Platform. There will be more hiring to expand the business, and likely more acquisitions, which is something Wiz has been working to do for the last year.

Our sources tell us that Wiz is at $700 million in annual recurring revenue at the moment. The deal is being described to us as akin to the one between LinkedIn and Microsoft, in terms of autonomy within the bigger organization. (It should be noted that LinkedIn does use a lot of Microsoft services, and has increased that over time, so perhaps that’s a more meaningful analogy than was intended.)

The deal will still need regulatory and other approvals before closing, which the companies expect will be in 2026. Previously, Google’s biggest acquisition had been buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2011.

This acquisition has been on-again off-again for nearly a year. Talks appeared to revive again this week at a $30 billion price tag.

Thomas Kurian — the CEO of Google Cloud — is in Europe at the moment, and Assaf Rappaport, the CEO of New York-based Wiz, is currently in Israel. From what we understand, Kurian was leading on this deal, and Wiz will come under his wing, spearheading a major push into cloud security for the company.

“Google Cloud and Wiz share a joint vision to make cybersecurity more accessible and simpler to use for organizations of any size and industry,” he said in a statement today. “Enabling more companies to prevent cyber attacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents.”

Some backstory. Last year, Google offered to buy Wiz for $23 billion, but the talks fell apart, sources say over concerns about antitrust issues, Wiz’s autonomy for development under Google Cloud and potentially even the price tag. At the time of the deal talks, Wiz was valued at $12 billion based on a $1 billion funding round earlier in the year.

In the interim, there is now a new U.S. President and some believe the new regulatory regime will usher in a more favorable climate for big tech acquisitions that might have previously been roadblocked.

For its part, Google has been interested scooping up Wiz to turbo charge in two areas: enterprise cloud, a business where it continues to lag behind AWS and Microsoft Azure; and security, an area where it does offer some products (Mandiant being one key part of that) but nothing on the size, scale, or growth trajectory of Wiz.

Wiz is particularly attractive because it’s coming to Google Cloud with an existing, massive business in tow. It is currently on track to double last year’s annual recurring revenue to $1 billion.

A Wiz acquisition also works to potentially complement, or even offset, whatever rises and falls might come to the other major area where Alphabet is placing bets: AI.

“The increased role of AI, and adoption of cloud services, have dramatically changed the security landscape for customers, making cybersecurity increasingly important in defending against emergent risks and protecting national security,” Google noted in its announcement today.

Not long after the deal initially fell apart in 2024, Wiz ran a secondary sale at a $16 billion valuation, meaning this acquisition doubles that valuation. That’s a huge windfall for Wiz’s investors, which include the likes of Sequoia, Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Salesforce, Thrive Capital, Greenoaks and around two dozen others.

Rumors were that Wiz — whose founders previously co-founded and sold a security startup to Microsoft, which became the anchor of the company’s cloud security business — was in the process of fundraising at an even higher valuation.

Last year on stage at Disrupt, Rappaport didn’t rule out the possibility of an acquisition in the future but he also confirmed that it was Wiz who walked away from the deal, describing it as “the toughest decision ever” but also maintaining it was “the right choice.”

On a purely financial outcome, it looks like his instinct has held true.

https://techmeme.com,Google Buys Wiz in $32bn Cloud Security Push,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/google-buys-wiz-32bn-cloud/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:45:00 GMT","Google has announced its intent to acquire Wiz, an Israeli-founded cloud security platform based in New York, for $32bn in an all-cash transaction.

Founded in 2020, Wiz will become part of Google Cloud upon the deal's completion, expected after closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2026.

A March 18 statement noted that Wiz’s products will continue to work and be available across all major clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud platforms.

Assaf Rappaport, Co-Founder & CEO of Wiz commented, ""Wiz and Google Cloud are fully committed to continue supporting and protecting customers across all major clouds, helping keep them safe and secure wherever they operate.”

“Customers don’t want to be locked into one vendor, they want to use a number of clouds,” said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO, in a live briefing on March 18.

Google Cloud noted that ‘traditional’ cybersecurity approaches struggle to keep up with a complex digital landscape which includes multi- or hybrid-cloud environments and the increased use of AI platforms.

“Cloud is more important than ever, and attackers aren’t slowing down. They are already using the most innovative technologies to move faster,” said Rappaport in a Wiz blog post.

Wiz differs from the services Google already offers, which includes Google Threat Intelligence, Google Security Operations and Mandiant Consulting.

The Israeli firm offers a cloud security platform that connects to all major clouds and code environments to help prevent incidents from happening in the first place.

Google also noted it believes the acquisition will lower the cost of cybersecurity for end users. It also remains committed to multi-cloud support.

Rappaport said in the briefing that the acquisition will enable the firm to accelerate innovation than it could as a stand-alone company.

In a statement, Kurian, said, “Google Cloud and Wiz share a joint vision to make cybersecurity more accessible and simpler to use for organizations of any size and industry. Enabling more companies to prevent cyber-attacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents.”

In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that the tech giant was in advanced talks to buy the cloud security provider for an estimated $23bn. This was turned down by Wiz.

The Google Cloud business annual revenue has grown from $9bn in 2019 to $43bn in 2024.

The pair say move will boost cloud offerings and lower customer costs

Google will be able to better compete with Amazon and Microsoft

Google has announced it will be acquiring Wiz in a $32 billion deal that will help boost its cloud computing offerings.

“This acquisition represents an investment by Google Cloud to accelerate two large and growing trends in the AI era: improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds (multicloud),” Google said in a statement.

Google has an extensive cloud infrastructure portfolio, and Wiz already offers cloud security on rival platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud, so the move will help boost security and lower costs for organizations of all sizes, Google says.

Strengthening the cloud

Businesses are increasingly turning to cloud services due to the convenience of not needing on-prem hardware to run resource-hungry tools and applications, with the AI boom being a big contributing factor. The acquisition will allow Google to better compete with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud enterprise environment.

Google previously offered $23 billion for the platform in 2024, but negotiations fell apart over discussions about how much independence Wiz would have in its development direction under Google, and the potential for regulatory and antitrust roadblocks.

However, President Trump’s recent rhetoric around removing some of the red tape attached to big tech acquisitions may be a cause for optimism that this new deal will go through, despite the potential for regulatory challenges.

“Google Cloud and Wiz share a joint vision to make cybersecurity more accessible and simpler to use for organizations of any size and industry,"" Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud said.

Thomas Kurian, CEO of the Google Cloud business unit, said the acquisition will extend the reach of a cybersecurity portfolio that extends well beyond its own cloud platform to secure a wide range of heterogeneous computing platforms, including on-premises IT environments.

The addition of Wiz will provide Google Gloud with access to additional telemetry data that will be used to further advance the development of artificial intelligence (AI) cybersecurity services.

Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said the combined company will going forward be able to innovate faster than it could as a standalone company.

Wiz in recent years has emerged as a leading provider of a CNAPP that unifies application and infrastructure security by first embedding code in software that makes it possible to identify vulnerabilities. The data collected is then used to drive a threat intelligence service that includes an assessment of the infrastructure applications are deployed on enabled by an instance of extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF) technology that Wiz developed.

In recent months, there has been a wave of acquisition of providers of CNAPPs, at a time when many organizations are shifting toward relying more on integrated platforms to manage cybersecurity. That shift is being driven by a need to reduce the number of tools that cybersecurity teams need to deploy and master in a way that also serves to reduce the total cost of cybersecurity.

Google will add Wiz to a list of managed cybersecurity services that are delivered by Mandiant, an arm of the company that Google acquired in 2022.

Previously, Google reportedly tried to acquire Wiz last year for $23 billion, only to see the executive leadership of Wiz determine they could exceed the value of that offer as a public company. Since then, a downturn in the economy has accelerated a wave of consolidation across the cybersecurity sector.

Mitch Ashley, vice president and practice lead for DevOps and application development at The Futurum Group, said the deal bodes well for advancing cybersecurity across heterogeneous IT environments in an era where IT vendors, including cloud service providers, recognize the need organizations have to deploy application workloads on multiple platforms. The challenge Google Cloud now faces is bringing that mindset to cybersecurity, he added.

As far as the deal itself is concerned, it’s another example of how the phrase “never-say-never” is frequently underappreciated in cybersecurity circles.

It’s not clear to what degree application and infrastructure security will be unified but as cybersecurity teams rely more on integrated platforms it will become easier to achieve that goal. One of the major issues that cybersecurity teams have historically wrestled with is finding a way to effectively secure software, both as it is being built and then deployed. With the rise of CNAPPs that are now more tightly integrated with managed security services, it should soon become a lot simpler to finally achieve that goal.",techmeme

https://theverge.com,The first new Pebble smartwatches are coming later this year,https://theverge.com/news/631657/pebble-watch-core-devices-duo-2-time-2,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Eric Migicovsky, the original creator of the Pebble smartwatch, is getting ready to ship two new watches. Migicovsky’s new company is called Core Devices, and these will be the first Core smartwatches to hit the market. But they are Pebbles in every important way: they’ll run the newly open-sourced Pebble operating system, they’ll have all the features of the old Pebble devices, and one of them will actually be built using leftover Pebble watch parts. They’re not called Pebbles, but they are Pebbles, and they’re coming soon.

The first watch that Migicovsky and Core plan to ship is called the Core 2 Duo (not to be confused with the old Intel processor), which Migicovsky says will cost $149 and will ship in July. The name explains the whole idea, he says: “It’s like a Pebble 2, but it’s made by Core devices. And then ‘Duo’ is for do-over.” It has the exact same black-and-white E Ink display as the old Pebble 2, and it even comes in the exact same frame. “We were able to find a supplier that still had the frames for Pebble Time 2 and Pebble 2,” he says. “They were never used. So we’ve been able to just draft on that.”

The Core 2 Duo does get a couple of upgrades, mostly by virtue of overall technological progress — Migicovsky says the new watch will last more than 30 days, instead of the Pebble 2’s seven, largely because Bluetooth chips have become so much more efficient. There’s also a speaker in the device now, which Migicovsky uses for chatting with AI assistants. Overall, though, this is an 8-year-old device simply made new again. (This is part of the idea behind the Pebble reboot: Migicovsky is convinced that Pebble mostly had it right a decade ago and simply wants to get back to that.) He estimates there will be around 10,000 Core 2 Duos available and figures a lot of developers and hardcore fans will be happy to have a new watch to play with as soon as possible.

Getting PebbleOS gear up and running has been even easier than the Core team expected. Image: Core Devices

Coming a little later this year is the Core Time 2, an update to the old Pebble Time 2 design. This watch is shipping in December and will cost $225. The big change with the Time 2 is the addition of a touchscreen; Migicovsky says he really likes the tappable “complications” you get on a watchface, with bits of information that open up to full apps, and he wanted to bring the same feature to the Pebble world. “It’d be cool to just tap on your watch, rather than having to dig through a layer of menus with buttons,” he says. He doesn’t intend the touchscreen to enable complicated new apps or become a whole multitouch surface, though. He just wants to be able to tap on the screen.

For the most part, though, the Core Time 2 is a return to old-school Pebble form. It has buttons on the sides, long battery life, lots of customization, and plenty of hacker-friendly features. It also benefits from battery life increases — Migicovsky says this one will last 30 days on a charge, too — and has a speaker, plus some new chips and upgrades for step- and sleep-tracking.

This is all happening faster than Migicovsky says he expected, particularly for the Core 2 Duo. Getting that up and running with the new software and new parts has been pretty smooth. But there are still hurdles. Connecting a PebbleOS watch to an iPhone continues to get more complex and less functional. “I want to be able to reply to notifications, and I can’t,” Migicovsky says. Luckily, Android is easier to both connect to and get information from.

There’s still work to do on manufacturing and software integrations, so Migicovsky is careful to note that things might get delayed. He’s also worried about tariffs and says his only plan is to pass along extra costs to customers. “We’re going to charge more if it costs more,” he says. “We just can’t bear the cost.” But through it all, Migicovsky seems thrilled to be making smartwatches again. “I’m not building a company to sell millions of these,” he says. “The goal is to make something I really want.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,How Trump and Musk built their own reality,https://theverge.com/politics/631078/trump-musk-doge-tesla-internet-tv-politics-spectacle,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","is a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.

The putative president of the United States, Donald Trump, stood on the White House lawn. In his hand, he held a sales pitch for Tesla cars. The most powerful man in America, Elon Musk, attired for a very casual funeral and looking miserable, stood next to Trump. As Trump spoke, promising to buy a Tesla, Musk stood with his arms folded over his chest, giving the undeniable impression of a sulking toddler. Later, Trump threatened to label anyone vandalizing Teslas or Tesla dealerships domestic terrorists.

The entire incident was, in its way, revelatory. A series of protests had targeted Tesla dealerships and owners, as Americans expressed their distaste for Musk, the unelected leader of the US. The instinct, in response to real behavior, was to create a media moment: a Tesla ad.

One of the bizarre hallmarks of the Trump era is a set of elected officials who increasingly cannot tell apart spectacle and reality — as well as a group of voters who seem similarly confused. Take the Trump voter insisting that government agencies get tax cuts for DEI initiatives, as a baffled Sam Seder attempts to explain that, in fact, government agencies are what taxes are for, and thus are not taxed themselves. It seems the conservative mind cannot comprehend that DEI is, in fact, actually popular. To avoid acknowledging that, the voter summoned up a conspiracy theory that flies in the basic facts of governance, which he either does not know or does not care about. Confronted with a choice between a truth he doesn’t like and a fantasy, he has chosen the fantasy.

The break with reality has been a long time coming — QAnon and Pizzagate preceded it — but in the pre-pandemic era, it was largely the fringes of the conservative movement. Now it is the main event. Faced with the horrors of mass death in 2020, a great many people have since apparently chosen to make a break with reality. That is now the basis of the conservative movement, as Mark Zuckerberg tacitly acknowledged when he abandoned fact-checking on Meta platforms. Requiring Trump supporters to stick to truth on social media would mean they could not post.

And what has replaced truth? Spectacle.

The proclivity for spectacle is the thing Musk and Trump truly have in common, though the media they target is different: Musk is an online guy, and Trump was forged in reality TV. Trump’s media instincts hew closer to professional wrestling — he has hosted two WrestleManias — and he appears to approach his cabinet as a kind of casting for Fox News. Is noted drunkard Pete Hegseth good at his job? Who cares, he looks good on television. Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, originated on The Real World, after all.

Musk has similarly created an online profile of himself, largely as a marketing gimmick for Tesla. (Hey, did you hear that Robert Downey Jr modeled his portrayal of Tony Stark on Elon Musk?) In less dire times, he posted about mixing wine and Ambien as readily as he did about SpaceX missions — creating a fandom in the process. He is optimized for the attention economy; Musk may be outrageous, he may be insulting, he may be juvenile, but he is not boring. I am one of many journalists who had to follow his entire charade of taking Tesla private — which played out on Twitter, rather than in any boardroom.

The spectacle works because pseudo-events are more exciting than reality; a normal budgetary meeting is a snooze, and normal diplomatic relations rely on closed doors, occurring out of sight of the average voter. Reality TV doesn’t work on this level — and keeping the viewers hooked is the main source of Trump’s and Musk’s respective power.

The question is how long the spell will last. Is it possible for reality to be more interesting than the spectacle? Is there a point at which the horrors stop being entertainment?

The reality TV president

One of the basic problems of the modern world, and of mass media, is that most news events occur at a distance to a normal person and appear only through representation. The Tesla protests, for example, occur on TV or on TikTok for most people, side by side with fiction, and given equal epistemic weight. TV news itself allowed its seriousness to erode beginning in the 1970s, chasing ratings through entertainment.

This runs parallel to reality TV, which is not especially reality-based. Trump jumped to Fox News from The Apprentice and WWE with his instincts for keeping an audience fully formed. His first term was marked by a preoccupation with ratings — not approval, but television. Trump has long had a propensity to call into his favorite Fox News shows to ramble away — and his schedule during his first term was crammed full of “executive time,” which one might presume was his TV habit.

“This is going to be great television.”

Previous US leaders — starting with President John F. Kennedy — have also skillfully commanded television as a medium to suit their political ends. But those leaders seemed aware of the distinction between television and reality. For Trump, reality is whatever he says it is, which is then broadcast by Fox News back to him to confirm its truth. In his last term, even as Trump himself was sickened by the novel coronavirus, he insisted the pandemic was no big deal. After being taken by helicopter to a hospital, he made a series of public appearances where he was obviously ill and pretending not to be. Almost 400,000 people died from covid that year, according to death certificate information compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This may be the only way of explaining the bizarre economic policy coming from the White House. I don’t think Trump understands money — he’s filed for bankruptcy six times, hardly the sign of a successful businessman. But thanks to The Apprentice, he knows how to play a successful businessman on TV — by appearing domineering and decisive.

The economy, however, occurs in reality rather than on TV, and in just 20 days of Trump’s flailing, the stock market has gone from all-time highs to an atmosphere of pure fear. The tariff threats, which Trump thinks make him sound powerful, are part of the problem, alienating trading partners and jacking up the price of ordinary goods. So, too, are Musk’s random firings of government workers under the guise of “efficiency.” Federal spending cuts also threaten everyone from farmers to retirees. Four airlines have cut their forecasts because they fear consumer confidence is waning.

Sure, some of the economy — the stock market in particular, about which, more in a minute — can be shaped by narrative. The problem is a conflict of interest: the things that Trump thinks make him look strong to his voters also make the business community skittish. Consider his tariffs. They target some of America’s biggest imports and stand to make it harder to get your car repaired, assuming you can buy one at all. If the stock market continues to plunge, it’ll hit baby boomers squarely in their retirement savings, which will mean less spending overall.

So, Trump is destroying the economy so he can look and feel tough — the sign of a man who’s confused about the difference between television and reality.

His main source of funding, Musk, who has signaled he wants to buy more influence, is similarly confused. Musk’s problem isn’t TV, though. It’s the internet.

Becoming meme

Musk spent the last 10 years or so as the internet’s premier financial influencer, memeing Tesla’s stock to a bizarrely high price-earnings ratio through his Twitter antics. (Indeed, the platform was so important to him that he eventually bought it.) And while he has enough sense of reality to ransack the federal government in order to benefit SpaceX, meet with foreign leaders, and cut oversight of his companies, he is also striking poses for the benefit of X.

Take, for instance, telling the foreign minister of Poland, “Be quiet, small man” on X. Poland has been paying for Starlink terminals used in Ukraine and has threatened to find another provider. As Trump and Musk blunder around the EU, alienating allies in order to cozy up to Russia, Musk’s Twitter fingers escalate the sense of panic. Not exactly what you want when the EU is considering rearming itself.

Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to contact him

Rather than attempting to reassert their constitutional power and decapitate DOGE, Republicans have chosen to abase themselves. “What we got to do as Republicans is capture their work product, put it in a bill and vote on it,” said Lindsey Graham, the senator from North Carolina, according to CNN. He is the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, which, before Musk, was actually a fairly powerful position. Now it seems his job is to rubber-stamp Musk’s decisions.

Musk is not so far gone that he can’t raid the government to suit himself. Appealing to the Trump base gives him cover to target agencies that will benefit him directly, such as NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Musk is effectively trying to create his own political reality, using X as a staging ground. The more noxious and viral the claims, the more useful they are to Musk.

Despite Musk’s increasingly batshit public performance, which now includes a gesture that looks suspiciously like a Nazi salute, Republicans are too scared to criticize him. They know Musk can fund a primary challenge against them without breaking a sweat. So they’re stuck with Musk, who has been posting increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories to his X account. When X went down earlier this week, Musk claimed with no evidence that Ukraine was behind the company’s outage. Instead, hacking collective Dark Storm has taken credit for the disruption.

Once upon a time, this all served a business purpose

Musk has a long history of manipulating attention online — well before his chainsaw antics at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), his jumping jack at a Trump rally, or the alleged Sieg Heil. Twitter, when it was still called that, was how he created a fan base that hung on his every word. For at least the last decade, he’s been creating a reality-distortion field. Sometime around 2018 — I’d pinpoint it at his “pedo guy” defamation trial — Musk stopped being able to distinguish between his performances and reality. As this happened, the amount of time he spent posting on Twitter started to climb.

Once upon a time, there was a business purpose: Twitter meant he didn’t have to do traditional advertising for Tesla; eventually, he built a profile big enough that he could just show up on TV shows like Saturday Night Live, while his competitors had to buy ads. But it seems Musk has become increasingly isolated, since his fame has made it difficult to appear in public. That means Twitter, now X, has been his main social outlet for some time, and it appears to have seriously warped him. At CPAC, when Musk, apparently zooted, mumbled something about “I am become meme,” he really, really meant it.

It is, at times, difficult to know if Musk can distinguish fantasy from reality. Twitter is a far more poisoned well than cable news, and as Musk’s use has increased, his public statements have gotten increasingly weird. Musk has repeatedly suggested that Fort Knox’s gold is gone — never mind that in the last Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited the gold. Is this just red meat to the base? Does Musk want an excuse to be let into Fort Knox, to visit or even pocket the gold? Or did he read something on the darker recesses of Twitter and take it as truth?

Musk has also claimed that there is wild fraud in Social Security, targeting it for the latest round of DOGE cuts. Musk has said that Social Security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” which will doubtless be news to the many retirees who rely on it. Looks like Musk is attempting to create the conditions that would allow him to slash Social Security by inventing fraud wholesale. But it is possible, I suppose, that he is so brainrotted he really believes what he’s saying.

The White House is currently claiming that Musk’s intent to meddle with Social Security won’t affect payments. We’ll see. The guy who’s posting memes calling people who receive it “the parasite class” doesn’t seem like he’s a careful steward of the program. And stiffing Social Security beneficiaries could add to Trump’s economic woes — as, once again, retirees cut spending.

The poisoned ecosystem

TV and X reproduce events that happen at a distance, which makes it easier for distortions to take hold. If someone tells me it is raining while I am standing in the sun, I know I am being lied to. But if someone tells me that the gold in Fort Knox has been stolen, I cannot check that directly. I have to trust intermediaries — the soldiers who guard the gold, the Treasury auditors who annually count it. As trust in institutions has been eroded, partly through the institutions’ own mistakes, conspiracy theories have run wild.

Conspiracy theories are usually more entertaining than reality — a secret gold heist is so sensational that multiple movies have been made about it — but they also flatter the conspiracist, who now has secret knowledge. The flattering part, the secret knowledge, is what allows conspiracy theorists to continue to believe lies even in the face of actual, verifiable events.

I’m not convinced Trump and Musk are tracking reality anymore, in part because, in reality, they look pretty ugly. Better to imagine themselves as their fans do: bold heroes, fighting for America — rather than gross authoritarians ransacking the country for personal benefit.

As for their supporters, the erratic behavior, tariffs, abrupt firings, and tensions with Canada have some Michigan swing voters expressing reservations. These people are at least aware of economic reality. But right now, true believers in DOGE and Trump feel they are part of a community that is “saving” the US from, uhhhh, woke? Usually, lie-based belief systems are fragile — it’s hard to make the initial dent in the worldview, but once it happens, the whole thing shatters.

Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s reputation and spending power

Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s business reputation — particularly since he’s supposedly the company’s CEO and yet is spending all of his time in the White House, securing fun new payouts for SpaceX. It also threatens his spending power, since most of Musk’s net worth is tied up in Tesla stock.

Worse, a lot of that stock is pledged as collateral for loans. As of a 2024 SEC filing, about a third of Musk’s Tesla shares were pledged. If Tesla’s share price falls low enough, Musk has to pony up more shares or pay back some of his loans, which leaves him with less spending money for Trump and the Republicans. That loosens some of his grip on power. No wonder he’s panicking. The little demonstration on the White House lawn shows how much power Musk still has over Trump — because if Trump wanted to apply pressure to Musk, he wouldn’t make a public show of support.

You can see, if you squint, what’s happening. Trump and Musk are trying to reframe the protest against Tesla dealerships (and indeed, Teslas themselves) as the “woke mob” — substituting into the roles that “antifa” and “Black Lives Matter” played in Trump’s last presidency. Footage of people protesting Tesla and leaving bags of dog shit on Cybertrucks can create a new enemy for Musk and Trump’s enemies to hate, letting them dodge anger for their actions that harm the economy and Social Security.

The question is whether it’ll work.

Cuts to Social Security and Medicaid have the potential to be dangerous to Musk — and therefore also to Trump. Both programs are popular, even with Republicans. Musk says he’s going to cut $700 billion, which may mean putting up new hurdles for people to receive their benefits — requiring more paperwork, say. Or it may mean cutting payments to doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes. Either way, it’ll hit people who rely on both programs pretty quickly, as they are increasingly unable to access care. And it’s hard to blame that on former President Joe Biden when Musk is out here already taking credit for it.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Google acquires cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion,https://theverge.com/google/24198766/google-acquires-wiz-cloud-cybersecurity-32-billion,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:36:49 GMT","Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has announced its largest-ever acquisition, entering into a deal to buy New York-based cybersecurity firm Wiz, making it a part of its Google Cloud division. This is the company’s second attempt to buy Wiz after talks stalled last year at a lower $23 billion evaluation.

Wiz is a fast-growing Israeli-founded startup that works with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to provide cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company was valued at $12 billion in May 2024, which reportedly climbed to $16 billion later in the year in an equity offering to employees, and has been working towards an initial public offering (IPO) in the months since the previous acquisition fell through. Should the deal receive regulatory approval, it will easily outsize the $12.5 billion paid by Google for Motorola Mobility in 2012.

“We expect this change to enable us to execute and innovate even faster,” said Wiz cofounder and CEO Assaf Rappaport in a blog post. “Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company.”

Perhaps to head off antitrust concerns, Google has confirmed that Wiz’s products will continue to be available across competitor cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud. “Wiz needs to remain a multicloud platform,” Rappaport adds. The Google Cloud Marketplace will also offer a selection of other security services beyond those provided by Wiz.

Google is currently embroiled in two separate antitrust lawsuits with the Justice Department over its search engine and digital advertising businesses. It lost the first but is appealing the ruling, and a final decision is still awaited on the second.

The Wiz purchase is the latest of several acquisitions that Google has made in recent years as it attempts to bolster security for its cloud computing customers. In 2022, Google purchased two cybersecurity firms — Siemplify and Mandiant — for $500 million and $5.4 billion, respectively, with the latter company best recognized for uncovering the SolarWinds hack. Adding Wiz to that mix feels like a targeted effort to tighten Google’s cloud protections in the face of Microsoft’s less-than-stellar cybersecurity reputation.",theverge

There are no details yet on specific sets or which characters will be available in Lego form, but the teaser does include a peek at Pikachu’s tail built from yellow bricks.

Several Pokémon building sets have already been available for a while, but through Mattel’s Mega line, which features components that are Lego-compatible. It’s not yet known if Lego will have exclusive rights to making Pokémon building sets starting next year, or if Mattel will continue to offer them as well.

Today’s tease follows an announcement by Lego last January that, come October, it would be releasing a buildable version of Nintendo’s iconic Game Boy handheld, which happens to be the console where the Pokémon games made their debut in 1996.

Nvidia has announced that Isaac GR00T N1 — the company’s open-source, pretrained but customizable foundation model that’s designed to expedite the development and capabilities of humanoid robots — is now available. “The age of generalist robotics is here,” says Nvidia founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. “With Nvidia Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.”

During his GTC 2025 keynote today, Huang demonstrated 1X’s NEO Gamma humanoid robot performing autonomous tidying jobs using a post-trained policy built on the GR00T N1 model. “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” says 1X Technologies CEO Bernt Børnich. “NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 model provides a major breakthrough for robot reasoning and skills. With a minimal amount of post-training data, we were able to fully deploy on NEO Gamma — furthering our mission of creating robots that are not tools, but companions that can assist humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.”

You might recall seeing this freakishly lifelike bot a few weeks ago in Nothing’s teaser for its latest phone. We didn’t post it because it looked like another human in a robot suit — thanks, Elon.

Other companies developing humanoid robots who have had early access to the GR00T N1 model include Boston Dynamics, the creators of Atlas; Agility Robotics; Mentee Robotics; and Neura Robotics.

Originally announced as Project GR00T a year ago, the GR00T N1 foundation model utilizes a dual-system architecture inspired by human cognition.

System 1, as Nvidia calls it, is described as a “fast-thinking action model” that behaves similarly to human reflexes and intuition. It was trained on data collected through human demonstrations and synthetic data generated by Nvidia’s Omniverse platform.

System 2, which is powered by a vision language model, is a “slow-thinking model” that “reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions.” Those plans are passed along to System 1, which translates them into “precise, continuous robot movements” that include grasping, moving objects with one or two arms, as well as more complex multistep tasks that involve combinations of basic skills.

While the GR00T N1 foundation model is pretrained with generalized humanoid reasoning and skills, developers can customize its behavior and capabilities for specific needs by post-training it with data gathered from human demonstrations or simulations.

Nvidia has made GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios available for download through Hugging Face and GitHub.",theverge

Nvidia is announcing its RTX Pro Blackwell series of GPUs today, designed to meet the needs of professional designers, developers, data scientists, and creatives. The lineup includes a top of the line RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPU for workstations, as well as other RTX Pro Blackwell desktop and laptop variants and a datacenter version of the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell.

The RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell for workstations will ship with 96GB of GDDR7 memory and needs 600 watts of power, slightly more than the 575 watts of the RTX 5090. It also includes PCIe Gen 5 support, DisplayPort 2.1, and the latest Blackwell generation of RT cores and Tensor cores.

This GPU is designed for workstation use, aimed primarily at professionals that work on game development, AI workloads, or any professional tasks that need a lot of VRAM and a fast GPU. The RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell will also be available in a Max-Q variant and a server edition for datacenters.

Nvidia is using its new RTX Pro branding to replace the RTX numbering scheme it has used previously, as well as Quadro in the past. Nvidia is also launching the RTX Pro 5000 and RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell in desktop and laptop form factors, alongside the RTX Pro 4500 Blackwell for desktops.

Laptop versions of the RTX Pro Blackwell will also include the 3000, 2000, 1000, and 500 models. The laptop variants come with up to 24GB of VRAM, and these GPUs also support Nvidia’s latest Blackwell Max-Q technologies that the company claims will “intelligently and continually optimize laptop performance and power efficiency with AI.”

These laptop GPUs will also challenge AMD’s Strix Halo chips that have 128GB of unified memory that is shared among the CPU, GPU, and AI engines. Framework has built a tiny desktop with AMD’s latest chips, so it will be interesting to see what kind of workstations and laptops will ship with Nvidia’s RTX Pro Blackwell GPUs.

The DGX Spark is the new name for Nvidia’s $3,000 Mac Mini-sized “world’s smallest AI supercomputer” that was announced with the name “Digits” at CES earlier this year. Its larger, just-announced DGX Station counterpart, currently with no price tag, is aimed at “AI developers, researchers, data scientists and students to prototype, fine-tune and inference large models on desktops.”

The Spark is powered by Nvidia’s GB10 Blackwell Superchip, featuring a GPU with fifth-generation Tensor Cores and FP4 support. The GB10 is optimized for the Spark’s smaller desktop form factor. However, it can still deliver “up to 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of AI compute for fine-tuning and inference with the latest AI reasoning models, including the NVIDIA Cosmos Reason world foundation model and NVIDIA GR00T N1 robot foundation model.” Spark features 128GB of unified memory, and up to 4TB of NVMe SSD storage.

Meanwhile, the DGX Station, with its larger size, accommodates Nvidia’s just-announced, more powerful GB300 Blackwell Ultra desktop super chip that “provides 20 petaflops of AI performance and 784GB of unified system memory.”

Meanwhile, the DGX Spark will have versions made by Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. You can reserve one today on Nvidia’s website, with deliveries expected this summer.

Nvidia isn’t the only company building GPUs with lots of unified memory that can be used for local LLMs. Rival AMD has the Ryzen AI Max+ “Strix Halo,” and HP is putting the 128GB version into a laptop, while Framework has put it into a $2,000 desktop.

On Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance publicly acknowledged a simmering “tension” between two warring factions inside the Republican party – the populist MAGA right and the tech billionaires who threw their support to Donald Trump – and called for a truce.

In remarks at Andreesen-Horowitz’s American Dynamism policy conference in Washington, DC, Vance, a former venture capitalist, and Peter Thiel, protege turned MAGA internet darling, sought to connect two sides of the coalition that got Trump into the White House, but found each other at philosophical odds. Throughout the transition and early administration, the populist right began heavily criticizing the new tech players and agendas that were now influencing the president – particularly Elon Musk, whose support of H1B1 visas drew a sharp rebuke from the anti-immigration Steve Bannon, and Marc Andreessen, who helped vet potential administration appointees.

“I’d like to speak to these tensions as a proud member of both tribes,” Vance said, in comments reported by the New York Times. “While this is a well-intentioned concern, I think it’s based on a faulty premise. This idea that tech-forward people and the populists are somehow inevitably going to come to a loggerheads is wrong.”

The thrust of Vance’s remarks sought to walk a tightrope between the MAGA right and the tech industry’s fundamental view on globalization: the MAGA movement has long viewed it as a threat to the American working class, while the tech industry has heavily relied on global economic expansion to scale their businesses. Instead, Vance proposed that it was, in fact, the U.S. government that had failed them both: “Not just the government of the last administration, but the government, in some ways, of the last 40 years.”

“And so I’d ask my friends, both on the tech-optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation,” he continued. “Both our working people, our populists, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy. And the solution, I believe, is American innovation. Because in the long run, it’s technology that increases the value of labor.”",theverge

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Oracle is closing in on a deal that would have it “vouch” for TikTok’s security in exchange for a small stake in the company’s US operations, according to Bloomberg. The plan, which was reportedly discussed among the Trump administration last week, would include “guarantees that an updated US version of TikTok would not contain a back door that China’s government could exploit.”

As noted by Bloomberg, the deal may still leave the app’s algorithm with TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance. A source told the outlet that China is aware of the potential deal, and that the country’s authorities will only approve if “TikTok’s algorithm remains fully under China’s control.” The Information similarly reported last week that Oracle could help save TikTok from a ban.

Related How TikTok backed itself into a corner

Whether this proposal changes anything remains in question, as TikTok previously attempted to assuage security concerns by routing US user data through Oracle servers as part of an initiative called Project Texas that began in 2022.

Even with Project Texas in place, reports still emerged claiming Chinese employees had access to US user data and that the effort was “largely cosmetic.” The partnership didn’t seem to inspire confidence in the US government, either. An appeals court acknowledged this in its ruling against TikTok last December, stating the app “could not satisfactorily resolve the government’s concerns,” adding that the government found “mitigation efforts short of divestiture were insufficient.”

Neither TikTok nor Oracle immediately responded to The Verge’s request for comment.

Last week, Vice President JD Vance said, “There will almost certainly be a high-level agreement that I think satisfies our national security concerns” by the April 5th deadline to save TikTok. President Donald Trump approved of Oracle’s bid for TikTok when he initially began targeting the app in 2020.",theverge

Nvidia now makes $2,300 in profit every second on the back of the AI revolution. Its data center business is so gigantic, even its networking hardware now rakes in more money than its gaming GPUs. Now, the company is announcing the AI GPUs that it hopes will extend its commanding lead: the Blackwell Ultra GB300, which will ship in the second half of this year, the Vera Rubin for second half of next year, and the Rubin Ultra that will arrive in the second half of 2027.

This year’s Blackwell Ultra isn’t what we originally expected, when Nvidia said last year that it would begin producing new AI chips on a yearly cadence, faster than ever before, as Blackwell Ultra is not on a new architecture. But Nvidia quickly moved on from Blackwell Ultra during today’s GDC keynote to reveal that next architecture, Vera Rubin, whose full rack should offer 3.3x the performance of a comparable Blackwell Ultra one.

Nvidia’s new AI chip roadmap as of March 2025. Image: Nvidia

Nvidia isn’t making it easy to tell how much better Blackwell Ultra is than the original Blackwell. In a prebriefing with journalists, Nvidia revealed a single Ultra chip will offer the same 20 petaflops of AI performance as Blackwell, but now with 288GB of HBM3e memory rather than 192GB of the same. Meanwhile, a Blackwell Ultra DGX GB300 “Superpod” cluster will offer the same 288 CPUs, 576 GPUs and 11.5 exaflops of FP4 computing as the Blackwell version, but with 300TB of memory rather than 240TB.

Image: Nvidia

Mostly, Nvidia compared its new Blackwell Ultra to the H100, the 2022 chip that originally built Nvidia’s AI fortunes and from which leading companies might presumably want to upgrade: there, Nvidia says it offers 1.5x the FP4 inference and can dramatically speed up “AI reasoning,” with the NVL72 cluster capable of running an interactive copy of DeepSeek-R1 671B that can provide answers in just ten seconds instead of the H100’s 1.5 minutes. Nvidia says that’s because it can process 1,000 tokens per second, ten times that of Nvidia’s 2022 chips.

But one intriguing difference is that some companies will be able to buy a single Blackwell Ultra chip: Nvidia announced a desktop computer called the DGX Station with a single GB300 Blackwell Ultra on board, 784GB of unified system memory, built-in 800Gbps Nvidia networking, and the promised 20 petaflops of AI performance.

Nvidia will also offer a single rack called the GB300 NVL72 that offers 1.1 exaflops of FP4, 20TB of HBM memory, 40TB of “fast memory,” 130TB/sec of NVLink bandwidth and 14.4 TB/sec networking.

But Vera Rubin and Rubin Ultra may dramatically improve on that performance when they arrive in 2026 and 2027. Rubin has 50 petaflops of FP4, up from 20 petaflops in Blackwell. Rubin Ultra will feature a chip that effectively contains two Rubin GPUs connected together, with twice the performance at 100 petaflops of FP4, and nearly quadruple the memory at 1TB.

A full NVL576 rack of Rubin Ultra claims to offer 15 exaflops of FP4 inference and 5 exaflops of FP8 training, for what Nvidia says is 14x the performance of the Blackwell Ultra rack it’s shipping this year. Find other specs by blowing up the images below:

Nvidia says it has already shipped $11 billion worth of Blackwell revenue; the top four buyers alone have purchased 1.8 million Blackwell chips so far in 2025.

Nvidia’s pushing these new chips — and all its AI chips — as essential to the future of computing, and is trying to argue today that companies will need more and more computing power, not less as some assumed after DeepSeek shook up investor assumptions and sent Nvidia’s stock price tumbling. At the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference today, founder and CEO Jensen Huang says the industry needs “100 times more than then we thought we needed this time last year” to keep up with demand.

Huang says Nvidia’s next architecture after Vera Rubin, coming 2028, will be named Feynman — presumably after Richard Feynman, the famous theoretical physicist. He said some of pioneering astronomer Vera Rubin’s family was in the audience today.",theverge

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.

Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr could get a Republican majority slightly sooner than expected after Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks announced Tuesday he plans to resign this spring.

Starks announced his plans in a statement, but did not specify the date of his departure. President Donald Trump’s Republican nominee to serve on the commission, Olivia Trusty, is still awaiting a confirmation vote in the Senate. If Starks leaves before Trusty’s confirmation, Carr could have a 2-1 Republican majority before the Senate vote takes place, allowing him to move forward with more partisan policies that Democrats would not get on board with. Carr has already made several controversial public moves raising First Amendment concerns, including opening investigations into public broadcasters PBS and NPR, and threatening to revoke licenses for broadcasters who he believes are treating Republicans unfairly.

Starks’ announcement cuts his term short of its 2027 expiration, though his plans to leave had been rumored since late last year. Trump will get to nominate a new commissioner to fill his position, but legally, he cannot nominate a fourth Republican to the commission — only three members of a single party are allowed to serve on the FCC at the same time. Still, only three commissioners are needed for a quorum at the agency, so there may not be a rush regardless.",theverge

https://theverge.com,Our five favorite dunks from Drake’s label over his ‘Not Like Us’ lawsuit,https://theverge.com/news/631902/drake-umg-not-like-us-lawsuit-response,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:12:17 GMT","is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Universal Music Group has finally responded to Drake’s claims that the label damaged his reputation with Kendrick Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us,” and there are some spicy tidbits in there.

UMG, which represents both artists, broadly argues that the court should dismiss Drake’s lawsuit because he’s just the sore loser of an ugly rap battle and can’t back up any of his claims. “Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds,” UMG says in the filing.

But that’s only the start of UMG’s response. Here are a few points that stuck out.

Drake previously agreed prosecutors shouldn’t use lyrics against rappers

Though Drake is now suing UMG for defamation, the artist previously agreed that rappers shouldn’t be criminalized because of their lyrics. In 2022, Drake, along with several other prominent artists, signed a letter in support of Young Thug, a rapper whose lyrics were used against him at trial. “The trend of prosecutors using artists’ creative expression against them is happening with troubling frequency,” the letter said.

That irony isn’t lost on UMG: “As Drake recognized, when it comes to rap, ‘[t]he final work is a product of the artist’s vision and imagination.’ Drake was right then and is wrong now.”

Everyone expected a big reaction from Lamar

UMG says Drake can’t claim that “Not Like Us” is defamatory, as the broader context surrounding the song meant the audience was anticipating the use of aggressive lyrics.

It cites the “seven preceding tracks in which Drake and Lamar hurled increasingly vitriolic allegations at each other,” including claims that Lamar’s son isn’t his and that he’d abused his fiancé. “If ever there was circumstance for the audience to ‘anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole,’ this is it,” UMG says.

Drake used fiery lyrics, too

As stated above, Drake is no stranger to rapping similarly vitriolic lyrics. UMG claims it “engaged in the same conduct” when it distributed Drake’s song, “Family Matters,” which “is a scathing attack on Lamar, laden with hyperbolic slurs.”

The label goes on to refute allegations that “Not Like Us” issued a “call to violence,” as Drake’s security guard was shot outside the rapper’s home days after the song’s release. UMG claims that “Drake attempts to contort violent metaphors in the lyrics into incitement.”

It adds that fiery lyrics are “par for the course” in rap music — especially on diss tracks. “Rappers know that their lyrics are exaggerated and nonfactual; that is part of the craft,” the label argues. “Drake’s own diss tracks employed imagery at least as violent, such as gunshot sounds.”

Drake acknowledged the controversies in “Not Like Us”

UMG claims that the controversies mentioned in Lamar’s diss track are “well-known,” saying that “facts and criticism concerning Drake’s relationships with minors predate ‘Not Like Us’ and have been widely reported.”

The label also says that Drake acknowledged and perpetuated these allegations in his song, “Taylor Made Freestyle,” which features an AI-generated version of Tupac’s voice suggesting Lamar should “talk about [Drake] likin’ young girls.”

Drake also affirmed that he understood Lamar’s statements in “Not Like Us” to refer to the Millie Bobby Brown controversy, stating, “This Epstein angle was the shit I expected” and “Only fuckin’ with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I’d never look twice at no teenager.” Clearly, Drake himself understands that Lamar’s lyrics refer to well-known issues.

UMG says Drake doesn’t have evidence to back up his bots and payola claims

UMG pushes back on Drake’s accusations that the label artificially inflated streams of “Not Like Us” by using bots and payola. The label claims Drake based his bots theory on an allegation espoused by an anonymous individual on Twitch, who claimed Lamar’s label paid him to boost the diss track’s streams on Spotify.

However, this “already a dubious source” later claimed that he was specifically hired by Lamar’s manager — not UMG or its subsidiary, Interscope. “To be clear, UMG disputes the contention that anyone paid for or otherwise used bots to inflate streams of ‘Not Like Us,’ as there is no evidence of any such stream manipulation,” UMG says. “But the specific claim that someone affiliated with UMG did so is entirely unsupported by the very source Drake cites.”

UMG goes on to say that Drake’s pay-for-play allegations are made on information and believe “without stating the basis therefor.” It also refutes Drake’s claims of injury and causation. “Drake’s theory — that ‘every time the Recording was played, Drake lost the opportunity for one of his songs to be played,’ — is wildly speculative and not cognizable,” the filing says.

Drake’s lawyer, Mike Gottlieb, isn’t backing down from the artist’s initial claims. “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence,” Gottlieb told NBC. “This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG’s long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.”",theverge

https://theverge.com,GM taps Nvidia to boost its embattled self-driving projects,https://theverge.com/news/631951/gm-nvidia-gtc-deal-cars-robots-factories,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:54:11 GMT","is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

At Nvidia’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif. today, the chipmaker announced it was teaming up with General Motors to develop next-generation cars, robots, and factories.

GM says it will apply several of Nvidia’s products to its business, such as the Omniverse 3D graphics platform which will run simulations on virtual assembly lines with an eye on reducing downtime and improving efficiency. The automaker also plans to equip its next-generation vehicles with Nvidia’s “AI brain” for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving. And it will employ the chipmaker’s AI training software to make its vehicle assembly line robots better at certain tasks, like precision welding and material handling.

GM already uses Nvidia’s GPUs to train its AI software for simulation and validation. Today’s announcement was about expanding those use cases into improving its manufacturing operations and autonomous vehicles, GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. (Dave Richardson, GM’s senior VP of Software and Services Engineering will be joining NVIDIA’s Norm Marks for a fireside chat at the conference.)

Image: Nvidia

“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” Barra said. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.”

GM will adopt Nvidia’s in-car software products to build next-gen vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities. That includes the company’s Drive AGX system-on-a-chip (SoC), similar to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving chip or Intel’s Mobileye EyeQ. The SoC runs the “safety-certified” DriveOS operating system, built on the Blackwell GPU architecture, which is capable of delivering 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of high-performance compute, the company says.

Like most automakers, GM has sunk billions of dollars in the development of fully autonomous vehicles — with mixed results. The company’s advanced driver assist feature, Super Cruise, is considered one of the safest and most capable on the market today. But its work to deploy fully autonomous vehicles has been less successful. Last year, GM pulled funding for its Cruise robotaxi company after a number of safety lapses cast doubt on the operation’s future.

Before it was shuttered, Cruise was exploring developing its own chips to reduce costs for its parent company. The robotaxi startup had been using Nvidia’s in-car computers to power its autonomous vehicles, which executives complained were too expensive.

GM hopes to improve its self-driving fortunes by selling passenger vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities — though it hasn’t said when or using what technology.

In a briefing with reporters, Ali Kani, Nvidia’s vice president and general manager of automotive, described the chipmaking company’s automotive business as still in its “infancy,” with the expectation that it will only bring in $5 billion this year. (Nvidia reported over $130 billion in revenue in 2024 for all its divisions.)

Nvidia’s chips are in less than 1 percent of the billions of cars on the road today, he added. But the future looks promising. The company is also announcing deals with Tier 1 auto supplier Magna, which helped build Sony’s Afeela concept, to use Drive AGX in the company’s next-generation advanced driver assist software.

“We believe automotive is a trillion dollar opportunity for Nvidia,” Kani said.",theverge

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

The White House is working to “improve Wi-Fi connectivity,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement emailed to The Verge. According to The New York Times, it’s using Starlink to address the issue, which White House officials blame on the property’s spotty cell service and “overtaxed” Wi-Fi infrastructure.

Huh. Giving Leavitt the benefit of the doubt, I’ll grant that you can connect to Starlink terminals, like the Starlink Mini we reviewed last year, directly over Wi-Fi. But that’s apparently not what’s happening here, despite the efforts of a SpaceX security engineer named Chris Stanley, who the Times says “went to the roof of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex to explore installing Starlink there,” only to trip a Secret Service alarm. Instead, the outlet writes that the White House is having its Starlink service piped from a government data center miles from the compound.

Let’s set aside the obvious conflict of interest and ethics questions at play here — Elon Musk, who owns Starlink parent company SpaceX, has seemed to have his hand on the Executive Branch’s till a lot since Trump took over as President. We can even skip over the security implications pointed out by a cybersecurity expert in the Times piece. As a practical matter alone, there’s no obvious reason to add another ISP in order to improve Wi-Fi coverage, especially one that the FCC said less than two years ago didn’t “demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service” required for rural broadband funding. The much simpler solution would be running some new ethernet cable or adding a few extra Wi-Fi access points, like routers.

White House officials said Starlink has “donated” the service, the Times writes. Okay, free is free, hard to knock that. If we want to be really generous, maybe the White House is getting The Good Starlink that the rest of us don’t have access to. You know, like that “state-of-the-art Super TiVo” the first Trump White House claimed to have in 2018.

Even then, this is a connection that’s beamed from space, through ever-changing atmospheric conditions, with all the stability implications that brings. Piping it in over fiber from a distant data center doesn’t change that. Starlink is good for what it is — the best, even! It just doesn’t stack up against a solid, hardwired internet connection.",theverge

Among other things, its instruments drilled into the Moon's surface, tested an extraterrestrial vacuum cleaner, and showed that future missions could use GPS navigation signals to navigate on the lunar surface.

These are all important achievements, gathering data that could shed light on the Moon's formation and evolution, demonstrating new ways of collecting samples on other planets, and revealing the remarkable reach of the US military's GPS satellite network.

But the pièce de résistance for Firefly's first Moon mission might be the daily dose of imagery that streamed down from the Blue Ghost spacecraft. A suite of cameras recorded the cloud of dust created as the lander's engine plume blew away the uppermost layer of lunar soil as it touched down March 2 in Mare Crisium, or the Sea of Crises. This location is in a flat basin situated on the upper right quadrant of the side of the Moon always facing the Earth.

Other images from Firefly's lander showed the craft shooting tethered electrodes out onto the lunar surface, like a baseball outfielder trying to throw out a runner at home plate. Firefly's cameras also showed the lander's drill as it began to probe several meters into the Moon's crust.

The first Blue Ghost mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program established in 2018 to partner with US companies for cargo transportation to the Moon. Firefly is one of 13 companies eligible to compete for CLPS missions, precursors to future astronaut landings on the Moon under NASA's Artemis program.

Now, Firefly finds itself at the top of the pack of firms seeking to gain a foothold at the Moon.

Blue Ghost landed just after sunrise at Mare Crisium, an event shown in the blow video captured with four cameras mounted on the lander to observe how its engine plume interacted with loose soil on the lunar surface. The information will be useful as NASA plans to land astronauts on the Moon in the coming years.",arstechnica

Over the next few weeks, I look forward to working with the chairman and my fellow Commissioners, and all FCC staff, to further the mission of the agency.""

https://arstechnica.com,SpiderBot experiments hint at “echolocation” to locate prey,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/spiderbot-experiments-hint-at-echolocation-to-locate-prey/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:46:45 GMT","It's well understood that spiders have poor eyesight and thus sense the vibrations in their webs whenever prey (like a fly) gets caught; the web serves as an extension of their sensory system. But spiders also exhibit less-understood behaviors to locate struggling prey. Most notably, they take on a crouching position, sometimes moving up and down to shake the web or plucking at the web by pulling in with one leg. The crouching seems to be triggered when prey is stationary and stops when the prey starts moving.

But it can be difficult to study the underlying mechanisms of this behavior because there are so many variables at play when observing live spiders. To simplify matters, researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Terradynamics Laboratory are building crouching spider robots and testing them on synthetic webs. The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that spiders crouch to sense differences in web frequencies to locate prey that isn't moving—something analogous to echolocation. The researchers presented their initial findings today at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, California.

""Our lab investigates biological problems using robot physical models,"" team member Eugene Lin told Ars. ""Animal experiments are really hard to reproduce because it's hard to get the animal to do what you want to do."" Experiments with robot physical models, by contrast, ""are completely repeatable. And while you're building them, you get a better idea of the actual [biological] system and how certain behaviors happen."" The lab has also built robots inspired by cockroaches and fish.

The research was done in collaboration with two other labs at JHU. Andrew Gordus' lab studies spider behavior, particularly how they make their webs, and provided biological expertise as well as videos of the particular spider species (U. diversus) of interest. Jochen Mueller's lab provided expertise in silicone molding, allowing the team to use their lab to 3D-print their spider robot's flexible joints.

The first spider robot model didn't really move or change its posture; it was designed to sense vibrations in the synthetic web. But Lin et al. later modified it with actuators so it could move up and down. Also, there were only four legs, with two joints in each and two accelerometers on each leg; real spiders have eight legs and many more joints. But the model was sufficient for experimental proof of principle. There was also a stationary prey robot.",arstechnica

Both watches are sold through the rePebble store in quantities limited by display availability. Migicovsky writes that there are more people signed up for news about the Pebble relaunch than watches available.

Both watches run PebbleOS, which Migicovsky and others pushed Google to make open source late last year. Therefore ""most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches,"" Migicovsky writes on his blog, with the long-running Rebble store making them easier to get to.

Both watches get something like 30-day battery life, largely due to the advances in low-power Bluetooth tech over the last eight years. New to the watches are a speaker (though not one that might necessarily make wrist calls easy) and a linear resonance actuator for stronger vibrations. The Core Time 2 has a touchscreen, the first on a Pebble watch, so its apps can scroll and watchfaces can have interactive complications, but hackers may come up with other uses. Both watches charge with the same magnetic pins as the original models.",arstechnica

Copeland estimates the NDDTC lost about a fifth of its trainers and a number of other support staff when 6,000 employees were let go at the USDA in February as part of a government-wide purge orchestrated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Before he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. “We have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,” he says, referring to two other non-native species. “I don’t think the American people realize how much crap that people bring into the United States.”

Dog trainers are just one example of the kind of highly specialized USDA staff that have been removed from their stations in recent weeks. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone.

“It’s causing problems left and right,” says one current USDA worker, who like other federal employees in this story asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “It’s basically a skeleton crew working now,” says another current USDA staffer, who noted that both they and most of their colleagues held advanced degrees and had many years of training to protect US food and agriculture supply chains from invasive pests. “It’s not something that is easily replaced by artificial intelligence.”

About 96 percent of marine species were wiped out—but were things just as grim on land?

Scientists have debated whether this event caused nearly as much terrestrial destruction. Now, researchers from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology (NIGPAS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggest that terrestrial ecosystems did not suffer nearly as much as the oceans.

Led by paleontologist Feng Liu, the NIGPAS team found evidence for refugiums, oases where life thrived despite the devastation. Not only did these refugiums give life a chance to survive the mass extinction event, which lasted 200,000 years, but they are now thought to have been crucial to rebuilding ecosystems in much less time than was previously assumed.

“This environment might have served as a refugium for the iconic Mesozoic flora that emerged in the late Permian, potentially contributing to the stability of the food chain and attracting numerous terrestrial animals that survived,” the NIGPAS team said in a study recently published in Science Advances.

Life, uh, finds a way

At the Turpan-Hami Basin, an archaeological site in Xinjiang, Liu and his team unearthed fossilized tree trunks and fern stems, their roots still firmly planted in the stone that was once soil hundreds of millions of years ago, that demonstrated these plants had actually grown there and were not just scattered remains.

Preserved pollen grains and other spores told them about the diversity of plant life in the refugium, something like an oasis where there is food and water available, and environmental conditions are moderate enough to keep organisms surviving through natural disasters and other adverse conditions.

The researchers tracked which species disappeared as they went from older to younger rock layers, which spanned from before the mass extinction to directly after. Using zircon dating of the rock layers in which spores were embedded, they determined that most of the plant species found had started growing in the area 60–160,000 years before the mass extinction and persisted through up to 210,000 years after the catastrophe.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,People in this career are better at seeing through optical illusions,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/people-in-this-career-are-better-at-seeing-through-optical-illusions/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:30:33 GMT","Optical illusions are great fun, and they fool virtually everyone. But have you ever wondered if you could train yourself to unsee these illusions? Our latest research suggests that you can.

Optical illusions tell a lot about how people see things. For example, look at the picture below.

The two orange circles are identical, but the one on the right looks bigger. Why? We use context to figure out what we are seeing. Something surrounded by smaller things is often quite big. Our visual system takes context into account, so it judges the orange circle on the right as bigger than the one on the left.

This illusion was discovered by German psychologist Herman Ebbinghaus in the 19th century. This and similar geometrical illusions have been studied by psychologists ever since.

How much you are affected by illusions like these depends on who you are. For example, women are more affected by the illusion than men—they see things more in context.

Younger children do not see illusions at all. To a 5-year-old, the two orange circles look the same. It takes time to learn how to use context cues.

Neurodevelopmental conditions similarly affect illusion perception. People with autism or schizophrenia are less likely to see illusions. This is because these people tend to pay greater attention to the central circle, and less to the surrounding ones.

The culture you grew up in also affects how much you attend to context. Research has found that East Asian perception is more holistic, taking everything into account. Western perception is more analytic, focusing on central objects.

These differences would predict greater illusion sensitivity in East Asia. And true enough, Japanese people seem to experience much stronger effects than British people in this kind of illusion.

This may also depend on environment. Japanese people typically live in urban environments. In crowded urban scenes, being able to keep track of objects relative to other objects is important. This requires more attention to context. Members of the nomadic Himba tribe in the almost uninhabited Namibian desert do not seem to be fooled by the illusion at all.

Gender, developmental, neurodevelopmental and cultural differences are all well established when it comes to optical illusions. However, what scientists did not know until now is whether people can learn to see illusions less intensely.",arstechnica

The results aren't perfect, but it's quite possible everyone in the near future will be able to manipulate images this way.

Last Wednesday, Google expanded access to Gemini 2.0 Flash's native image-generation capabilities, making the experimental feature available to anyone using Google AI Studio. Previously limited to testers since December, the multimodal technology integrates both native text and image processing capabilities into one AI model.

The new model, titled ""Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental,"" flew somewhat under the radar last week, but it has been garnering more attention over the past few days due to its ability to remove watermarks from images, albeit with artifacts and a reduction in image quality.

That's not the only trick. Gemini 2.0 Flash can add objects, remove objects, modify scenery, change lighting, attempt to change image angles, zoom in or out, and perform other transformations—all to varying levels of success depending on the subject matter, style, and image in question.

To pull it off, Google trained Gemini 2.0 on a large dataset of images (converted into tokens) and text. The model's ""knowledge"" about images occupies the same neural network space as its knowledge about world concepts from text sources, so it can directly output image tokens that get converted back into images and fed to the user.

Incorporating image generation into an AI chat isn't itself new—OpenAI integrated its image-generator DALL-E 3 into ChatGPT last September, and other tech companies like xAI followed suit. But until now, every one of those AI chat assistants called on a separate diffusion-based AI model (which uses a different synthesis principle than LLMs) to generate images, which were then returned to the user within the chat interface. In this case, Gemini 2.0 Flash is both the large language model (LLM) and AI image generator rolled into one system.",arstechnica

I still imagine the game series’ three pillars—stealth, parkour, and combat—mixed into a beautiful, brutal choreography, blended with historical drama. In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, two of those pillars, stealth and parkour, are inherently broken. The structure cannot hold. I’m still waiting for the one real Assassin’s Creed game I can love for its core tenets.

Pros One of the most beautifully-crafted worlds in gaming

Combat is punchy with surprising depth at higher levels

Dual protagonists offer some variety in gameplay Cons Parkour is imprecise and causes more frustration than fun

Stealth mechanics broken by enemy AI that doesn’t want to chase you.

Overly-long story lacks meaningful characters or themes

Assassin’s Creed Shadows features two protagonists, the lithe shinobi Noae, and the enormous samurai Yasuke. The second protagonist headlines the game’s best pillar, the combat. It’s your typical action game fair but with the addition of of the series’ typical brutal animations and a surprising amount of depth once you dive deep into the skill tree. As for parkour, inputs are so imprecise that travelling is a chore. Stealth includes some of my favorite sneaking systems that I’ve seen since Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, but it’s all made pointless by one simple factor: enemies can’t climb.

By hour 10 with the game, I thought Assassin’s Creed: Shadows was shaping up to be an intrinsically flawed but still ambitious attempt to offer a true stealth experience in Ubisoft’s venerable franchise. By hour 20, I was routinely yelling at my screen, stomping my feet, and gnashing my teeth so hard I wanted to wrap my jaw around my controller and snap it in half, just to relieve myself of the tension. By hour 30, I was resigned to the issues, enough that by hour 40 I was enjoying Shadows for what it was: ambitious but intrinsically flawed.

Shadows quickly loses itself under the weight of a crushing number of features, from the size of its world map, the number of necessary side missions, and its wide-spanning, near-incoherent story. “It’s a Ubisoft game” is what I hear from most gamer friends when I describe my irritations with Shadows. I detest this excuse, more so because it ignores the strides Shadows actually makes in terms of stealth gameplay and quest design. At the same time, I can’t argue they’re wrong, either. Ubisoft is still obsessed with open world design, but after playing Shadows I only wish there was less gameplay, and for what is there to be more refined and punchy.

And still, I think you should play it, especially if—like me—you have lingering love for the franchise echoing as a faint heartbeat in your chest. It’s one of the most gorgeous games I’ve played in recent memory. It’s also the kind of game I will be thinking about for long after, even if that’s for all the wrong reasons.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is out March 20 and is available for PS5. Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows Still Can’t Make Stealth and Parkour Work

I’ve played nearly every Assassin’s Creed game up to Origins. At that point in the series, the damage numbers floating up from enemies’ heads on every hit and the pseudo-RPG mechanics turned me off. I desperately tried to latch onto something from Odyssey and Valhalla, but I found they were so obsessed with combat they missed everything of what I wanted from a game about “assassins.” I didn’t get to dive fully into Assassin’s Creed Mirage, but I hoped Shadows would lean on even more stealth gameplay and revitalize its parkour.

Noae, the shinobi, is the only character you can really use for stealth. With his enormous bulk Yasuke isn’t made for sneaking. You can see that in the design right down to how he “assassinates” enemies. He literally spears opponents through their spine, lifts them off the ground as they scream, and drops them broken to the ground. Yasuke cannot climb very fast or very well, either. If you try to take a “leap of faith” into a bail of hay, he will scream and flail as he plummets to the ground, then staggers to his feet with a quip like “I’m getting too old for this.”

Yasuke is able to take on multiple enemies at once with crowd-control abilities. On the flip side, Noae has plenty of combat potential, but she doesn’t have the health pool for a protracted fight. Instead, she sneaks, sprints, and stabs—exactly what you expect from an Assassin’s Creed game. She can also do what no other character can in the franchise: go prone. There’s also the inclusion of a visual meter to indicate how quickly enemies will spot you. This ties into the ability to destroy light sources to cloak yourself in darkness or—cough—shadows. It’s the most depth of stealth gameplay the series has ever seen, at least on paper.

Ubisoft’s latest game still fails at making parkour work and it’s largely because of the controls. I can be at the top of the yardarm on a tall ship, and instead of Noae jumping into the water, she’ll decide she would rather plummet to her death on the deck. I can aim a jump to a nearby building, but Noae will instead jump to the ground, where she can be surrounded by enemies. Hitting the “X” or “A” button on a controller is supposed to be the everything-button for climbing, but hitting “O” or “B” is context sensitive for whether you jump off a roof or drop to shimmy along its edge.

These issues are only slightly mitigated by introduction of the grappling hook. This is only way you can scale some buildings with the pagoda-style roofs. It also lets you go where enemies can’t. But that’s a problem, because the systems built for parkour and climbing ruin stealth entirely.

In older Assassin’s Creed games, enemies would try to climb and follow after you after you escape onto a nearby roof. In Shadows, your opponents stay on the ground, bark something like “she went up there” before eventually losing interest and looking for your character elsewhere. The easiest way to lose enemies is by using a grappling hook or by scurrying up a building.

The roof-hopping mechanics end up making other stealth abilities pointless. Noae can unlock the capability to lie in shallow water, breathing through a bamboo pipe. She can use smoke bombs to disappear and bells to distract enemies (if you’re thinking “this sounds like Ghost of Tsushima,” you wouldn’t be alone). Even when these abilities work (and sometimes, they don’t), they’re made pointless by the fact you can simply outrun opponents and scurry onto a roof where enemies can do nothing but throw rocks at you. As a reminder, enemies could follow you onto roofs in the very first Assassin’s Creed all the way back in 2007.

The game is not easy, especially when enemies are leveled higher than you and all you can do is chip at their health bar (you can change it in difficulty options to automatically assassinate anyone). Still, the enemy AI’s inability to climb makes a third of the game’s main pillars pointless. Assassin’s Creed Shadows shows me how the game should play, and maybe with a gameplay overhaul Ubisoft could fix these flaws. In its current state, the game feels like its missing the opportunity to finally fix the series’ woes. Instead, it makes them worse.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows Story is Muted, but This is a Gorgeous Realization of Medieval Japan

Ubisoft told reviewers from the jump that this game is big. Its opening missions may take a few hours while you learn the ropes and slowly get to know the main cast of characters who come form your new assassins club. The main part of the game, after you unlock the ability to play as Yasuke, can easily take 50 hours or more. You can’t simply blitz through the main missions, either. Like all recent Assassin’s Creed titles, enemies and areas of the map are locked by level. You need to do side missions in order to level up and not be one-shotted by enemies four to five levels above you.

For as far as I got in the game, I never felt truly connected to either the two main characters or their mission. Everybody’s obsessed with “freedom” from tyranny. Some characters engage with this idea with some amount of nuance, but the protagonists often express their beliefs with vague overtures to “justice” as they murder incalculable amounts of peasant soldiers and samurai.

Still, I can’t fault any of what Ubisoft has accomplished in its world design. I would gawp at every sweeping vista, of every town village feeling like they were truly lived in. Every few hours of play the seasons change, from bright green summers to autumn where the ground is buried in red and yellow leaves. In winter, the snow piles up and storms wash out the world in white. I’ve witnessed the sky glow pink in sunset, something I’ve never seen modeled quite so perfectly in a game before. I’ve not marveled at a game world as much since I played Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

I can’t stop thinking about the times I struggled through snowstorms on horseback or battled enemies in pouring rain. Then, those instances of brilliance were dashed as soon as my character jumped from a tall tower rather than the platform a few feet away, or when I defeated a hard boss by climbing a the scaffolding of a castle where he couldn’t get to me, then assassinating him over and over while he searched for me in the nearby bushes. Considering the main tenets of stealth, traversal, and combat, it’s a shame that only one third of the game is really there.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows feels so close to my picture-perfect Assassin’s Creed game. Then again, I could also turn around and replay Ghost of Tsushima, a game which manages to blend stealth, traversal, and combat more organically than Ubisoft’s latest take. That game also has a story full of pathos and theme, something Ubisoft’s massive game and massive game budget failed to provide. Shadows is inherently unbalanced, as anything is when two of the three pillars that support it start to crumble. Just like a building that’s being leveled to the ground, it’s a sight you can’t not watch and wonder “what went wrong?”",gizmodo

The story is largely over, but that didn’t prevent President Donald Trump from taking one final stab at the former administration—a stab packed with disinformation, exaggerations, and outright falsehoods.

Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday to once again take credit for the plan to bring the Starliner astronauts back home. The NASA duo, Wilmore and Williams, launched to the International Space Station on board Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner on June 5, 2024. The mission was supposed to last for eight days but NASA declared Starliner unsafe in the wake of alarming technical issues. The spacecraft returned home empty, with Wilmore and Williams assigned a pair of seats aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which finally undocked from the ISS on Tuesday, March 18 at 1:05 a.m. ET.

Trump is disingenuously claiming to have facilitated a rescue mission to bring the astronauts home, accusing the Biden administration of having “abandoned” them. The president’s latest social media diatribe on the return of Crew-9, posted to Truth Social on Monday, is a doozy, filled with nonsensical claims and glaring inaccuracies. We went through Trump’s post, fact-checking the president’s various claims and providing background and context to reveal the true story. The president opens:

I just spoke with the Acting Administrator of NASA, Janet Petro. She is coordinating our Team of highly respected Scientists, Space Engineers, and various other “geniuses,” who has agreed to let our Astronauts come home long prior to the two week period originally approved by NASA.

As the newly appointed acting administrator for NASA, we seriously doubt that Janet Petro had much to do with this routine SpaceX mission. If anything, she’s being a dutiful stooge, hard at work dismantling the space agency from the inside at her president’s behest. Trump pretends to respect the space agency’s “Scientists, Space Engineers, and various other ‘geniuses'” even as Petro carries out his executive orders—closing multiple offices, laying off staff, and likely preparing for even more cuts. With Petro as the acting administrator, NASA has paused the work of a number of astrophysics and planetary science committees and removed references to key terms, including references to women in leadership, from its websites.

Again, as a routine SpaceX mission, NASA’s involvement is minimal, and it’s unclear which “geniuses” at the space agency supposedly played a role in the return. And on that note, putting “geniuses” in quotes distinctly feels like some kind of backhanded burn.

That Trump also “just spoke” with Petro, and that she agreed to “let our astronauts come home,” is yet another sick joke. This plan has been in the works since August of last year. On September 28, 2024, NASA launched its Crew-9 mission with two astronauts instead of the usual four (the two being NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov). The two empty seats were reserved for Williams and Wilmore, who became active and contributing members of Crew-9—even performing spacewalks that, for Williams, resulted in a new record.

Trump added that his so-called rescue mission is bringing the astronauts home “long prior to the two week period originally approved by NASA.” The astronauts are indeed returning home two weeks earlier than planned—at the insistence of Trump—but what does this even mean? Long prior?

Regardless, Trump may be referring to technical issues with the SpaceX Crew Dragon that delayed the launch of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission. That meant Crew-9, along with Williams and Wilmore, couldn’t depart the ISS until Crew-10 arrived at the station sometime in April. NASA ended up switching the Dragon vehicle assigned to Crew-10, launching the mission on March 12 and returning the Crew-9 mission on March 17 after a brief handover period. Technically, that did save the crew an additional two-week period or so on board the ISS, but for astronauts who had been in space for more than nine months, an extra two weeks wouldn’t have made much of a difference. Trump added:

Janet was great. She said, “Let’s bring them home NOW, Sir!” — And I thanked her.

Again, this sense of an urgent call to bring two astronauts back to Earth is pure fiction. The Starliner crew was never in need of a rescue mission—a Crew Dragon spacecraft—the one that launched in September—has been parked outside the ISS this entire time! The crew could have left the station at any point since September. However, doing so would have been incredibly wasteful, as the other Crew-9 astronauts would have had to join them for the return trip. Six month stints aboard the ISS are standard.

Instead, Williams and Wilmore, as bona fide and fully trained NASA astronauts, were more than willing to assume the responsibilities of the two astronauts who weren’t able to make the trip. This made sense for so many reasons—not least of which is the enormous cost of launching astronauts to the ISS. It’s also worth noting that at no point did Wilmore or Williams say they were “abandoned” or hard done by the situation. Trump, however, is seemingly wanting to live out his doomsday film fantasy. More from Trump:

This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so. They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents.

The plan to bring the Starliner crew home most certainly did not begin with Trump calling on his buddy Musk, CEO and owner of SpaceX, to retrieve the abandoned astronauts. In February, Musk claimed that he had offered the Biden administration a plan to bring the two Starliner astronauts back sooner, without waiting for the Crew-9 mission to return from the ISS. Musk has provided no evidence to back this claim.

This Starliner mission was the first crewed flight of Boeing’s program to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. It’s a private test flight, funded by NASA, with the space agency relying on a commercial partner for its spaceflight endeavors. And yet we have Trump dumping on the former administration, and not Boeing, for this epic, embarrassing fail. More from the president’s post:

Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home — Taking off tomorrow, and landing on Wednesday. Exact times will be provided to you. Safety always comes first, and maximum standards are being adhered to.

This “project” of which Trump speaks is most certainly not of his or Musk’s doing, as the plan has been in place for months. And as noted, his only contribution was to expedite the return home by about two weeks. In reality, this is Trumpian political theater and an opportunity to cast unwarranted shade onto the former administration.

Trump also attempted to heighten the drama of his so-called rescue mission by emphasizing “danger,” even though these types of crew missions to the ISS have long been routine. Yes, there is always risk when it comes to spaceflight, but there’s nothing unique about this mission. Also, it’s landing on Tuesday. Trump closed his post by saying:

But after eight long months for a mission that was supposed to be eight days, IT IS TIME. I look forward to seeing Butch and Suni, and thank you again to NASA and Janet Petro!

Trump is, and will continue to be, claiming that he rescued the Starliner astronauts, but the duo is unlikely to play into the president’s ploy to politicize the mission. “The words they said, well, that’s politics. I mean, that’s part of life,” Wilmore told reporters during a recent live webcast from the ISS. “From my standpoint, politics has not played into this at all.”

There you have it—straight from the astronaut’s mouth. But that won’t stop Trump from seizing on Boeing’s troubled Starliner program as yet another way to take shots at his predecessor.",gizmodo

Protestors are standing outside Tesla lots and waving anti-Musk signs. Celebrities and influencers are going viral with videos announcing the sell-off of their Musk-branded EV. People are throwing molotov cocktails at Teslas, spray painting them with swastikas, stealing their tires, and setting them on fire. During a Mardis Gras parade earlier this month, revelers repeatedly pelted a Cybertruck with beads, bottles, and other debris for three hours as it weaved its way through the parade route.

As the news, and insurance claims, pile up, insurers are driving up rates. “Model X or S Plaid drivers pay much higher average rates. Comparatively, average BMW i4 insurance costs are closer to that of a Model 3, at $3,792 per year for full coverage,” Shannon Martin, a Bankrate insurance analyst, told Newsweek. “Tesla Model 3, Model Y, and Model X are the most expensive EV to insure as of February 2025.”

The cost to insure a Tesla Model 3 went up 30 percent last year. “This is 25 percent higher in cost than the comparable Mercedes Benz A-Class,” Martin said. It’s possible those numbers will continue to climb.

This has happened before. In 2023, Kia and Hyundai cheaped out when they manufactured some of their cars. As a result, some of their cars became easy to steal using a USB charging cable. It fueled a social media trend where people would steal the cars, joyride them, and post a video about it on TikTok. Insurance rates for the vehicles skyrocketed and owners filed class action lawsuits against the manufacturer.

Someone has also launched a website called “DOGEQUEST” that allegedly shows the location of Tesla superchargers, dealerships, and Tesla owners. The website shows a map of the United States and users navigate it with a cursor shaped like a Molotov cocktail. Clicking individual cars gives you personal information about alleged Tesla owners. Some of the info included their name, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and employment information.

404 Media first reported on DOGEQUEST and was able to verify that some, but not all, of the information on it is accurate. “The veracity of much of the data is unclear. 404 Media has verified that at least some of the people listed on the site do appear to be Tesla owners or supporters of the company or Musk, but it is not clear if every person listed is,” 404 Media said in its report. “The addresses of several Tesla dealerships checked by 404 Media were correct. 404 Media found some plots on the map don’t correspond correctly to their real-world locations.”

The website bills itself as a place that connects “like-minded Tesla owners with one another, facilitating a vibrant community through shared contact information.” “Is DOGEQUEST a protest platform?” It asks itself. “If you’re on the hunt for a Tesla to unleash your artistic flair with a spray can, just step outside—no map needed! At DOGEQUEST, we believe in empowering creative expressions of protest that you can execute from the comfort of your own home. DOGEQUEST neither endorses nor condemns any actions.”

The site also claims that it will remove people’s personal information from the site if they send in a specific kind of request. “Just provide us with proof that you’ve sold your Tesla…we only accept scanned documents in JPG and PNG formats.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,A Fan-Favorite Severance Character Might Not Be Gone for Good,https://gizmodo.com/a-fan-favorite-severance-character-might-not-be-gone-for-good-2000577506,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:45:42 GMT","As Severance heads into its season finale, its devoted fans—including us obsessives here at io9—have come up with a million theories about the show’s many mysteries. But amid all the Cold Harbor speculation, the Mark/Mark S./Helly/Gemma drama, and the mystifying true purpose of those damn goats, a few things seem already settled thanks to “The After Hours,” the show’s penultimate season two episode. However, in the world of Severance… nothing is every really settled, is it?

In case you’re not caught up with “The After Hours,” beware…

One of the episode’s most heartbreaking moments came when Irving (John Turturro) hopped a train out of Kier with his dog Radar, leaving Lumon and his entire life behind. His escape came with the help of Burt (Christopher Walken). The two sparked a workplace romance as their innie personas, and later, when they met as their outies, felt a similar attraction.

That situation, explored in the latter half of season two, was exceedingly complicated by the fact that Burt has been with his husband for decades, and is also still in cahoots with Lumon in a more malevolent capability than his innie’s role as the folksy head of Optics and Design. However, just when you thought Burt was driving Irving (and Radar) to some kind of Sopranos-style doom, he instead bought Irving a train ticket and gently warned him never to return. The two men shared a poignant farewell, acknowledging their mutual feelings before dutifully setting them aside.

With Irv effectively in exile now, fans have wondered if it’ll be the last we see of the character. It’s a big loss for Severance, since Irv often served as the emotional heart of the show—as well as being someone unafraid to call bullshit, especially valuable in a place like Lumon that’s full of it.

Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Turturro said he wouldn’t feel satisfied if the train scene was really the end of Irving’s story. “If someone wanted the story to be complete? It could be! But I think there’s so much more here,” he explained, noting that there’s a lot more of the character’s backstory he’d like to dig into.

“Irving knows a lot that you don’t know. There’s a big reason why he’s making all those paintings, you know? All that he’s searching for. Everyone gets severed on this show for different reasons. Grief, maybe they’re lost, maybe they’re the daughter of the owner. Maybe it’s also searching for someone, too,” Turturro said.

There’s just one more episode of Severance season two to go—and though Apple TV+ has yet to confirm a third season, it feels like an inevitability at this point. Irving’s return is less of a certainty, but we’d sure love to learn more about him, and Turturro’s just given us fresh hope that might happen.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Roku Tests Putting Ads In the Worst Place,https://gizmodo.com/roku-tests-putting-ads-in-the-worst-place-2000577454,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:10:15 GMT","The business of streaming is revolving more and more around how many ads users are willing to sit through for the sake of cheap content. Roku is pushing that deal to the limit with its first tests for ads that play in the worst place possible, just before you load your home screen. As can be expected, users are less than thrilled with being forced to watch commercials just to select the app they’ll use (which will likely result in them watching even more ads).

Users on Reddit have posted their experience randomly receiving an “unskippable” ad before accessing the home screen. Most people said the ad was for Disney’s Moana 2. A Roku spokesperson confirmed these anecdotal reports in a statement sent to Gizmodo, calling it a “test” of ways to show ad programming while maintaining “a delightful and simple user experience.”

Roku has indicated the ad was skippable, though it’s unclear if users didn’t see the option to end the video player early. We asked Roku whether the ad test was being restricted to smart TVs running Roku OS or any of the set top boxes, but the company didn’t respond to those queries.

Roku users on Reddit were none too happy with the sudden influx of ads before they could even choose the content they wanted to watch. On the official Roku forums, some users promised to “trash” their boxes if these ads became permanent.

The real question is how much the wider Roku audience will care if Roku becomes flooded with even more ads. Other than its streaming gear, Roku is prominent on many TCL-brand TVs, which only helps add to its popularity along with the free, ad-based Roku Channel. In January, the company claimed its userbase had reached close to 90 million households in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Which is a lot of boxes to serve ads on.

Roku has almost always depended on ads and its data harvesting apparatus. The company collects data on users which it can then sell to advertisers or data brokers, which then feeds back into the advertising pipeline. The same can be said for many smart TV operating systems, including the likes of Amazon’s Fire TV and Vizio with its SmartCast OS. Last year, Walmart bought Vizio’s brand for $2.3 billion, mostly for the sake of its user data.

But the companies are running out of places to show those ads. Last April, Roku’s CEO Anthony Wood described plans to put more video ads on the home screen. This was in a spot he referred to as “the marquee” which normally shows a single static ad. This news came after patents showed Roku had investigated how it could show ads to users when they paused content on third-party hardware, such as a video game console. While this hasn’t been enacted on either Roku boxes or smart TVs running Roku OS, it was a sign of how the company is looking to boost revenue.

In its latest earnings call, the company further positioned ads as its main business driver. Wood told investors that their strategy is to “make better use of our homescreen,” beyond marquee ads. “We are very careful about putting ads on our homescreen.” The CEO further implied the company didn’t want to “break” the homescreen, saying “We’re very focused on both driving more monetization but also driving increased customer satisfaction.

When “enshittifcation” is the end result of tech companies seeking infinite growth, ads are sure to follow. You can’t spend much time on Google TV or Fire TV without seeing an ad of some kind on the home screen. The problem is exacerbated when companies like Warner Bros. Discovery are pulling content off their platforms, most recently the entire library of classic Looney Toons. Now, one of the best and increasingly few ways of watching Bugs Bunny stick it to Elmer Fudd is by watching it on Roku.

If enough people grow tired of the ad load on Roku, you may find some users going “duck season” on their set top boxes.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,The Panels We’re Most Excited for at Star Wars Celebration Japan,https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-celebration-japan-panel-schedule-rank-2000577209,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:00:35 GMT","The stage is set for Star Wars Celebration Japan. In exactly one month, the doors will open at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Chiba, Japan, and inside there will be plenty of news about what’s next for fans in a galaxy far, far away.

You can never tell exactly what’s going to be announced or revealed but the first big hints come with the panel schedule, which was released last week. With it was confirmation of big panels for four of Star Wars‘ most highly anticipated upcoming projects, as well as teases of news from the world of games, books, toys, and more.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a panel dedicated to the future of Star Wars movies, nor will there be a big celebration for the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith. Nevertheless, there will be plenty of fun to be had.

Here are the 11 panels we’re most excited for at Star Wars Celebration Japan.

The Mandalorian and Grogu

While we apparently won’t get news of any Star Wars movies beyond summer 2026, there is a hugely exciting one coming then and its panel is by far the most highly anticipated at the convention. Director Jon Favreau showed a brief clip at the D23 Expo last year, but with an hour-long panel, we can expect to learn much more, see more footage, and maybe get a tease of the future.

When: Friday, April 18 from 10-11 a.m. local time. (9-10 p.m. ET)

Lucasfilm Animation’s 20th Anniversary

Yes, this panel will primarily be celebrating 20 years of unforgettable Star Wars animation. But the description also says it will include “a sneak peek at what’s to come.” Sounds like whatever Lucasfilm’s next animated series is after the conclusion of The Bad Batch will be announced here.

When: Friday, April 18 from 3:30-4:30 p.m. local time. (2:30-3:30 a.m. ET on April 19)

Bit Reactor Developer Panel featuring Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games

There are several Star Wars games on the horizon but this panel is focusing on one we don’t yet know anything specific about: a turned-based game from the team behind XCom and Midnight Suns. That, in Star Wars, should be amazing.

When: Saturday, April 19 from 4:30-5:30 p.m. local time. (3:30-4:30 a.m. ET on April 20)

Andor: A Star Wars Story

In this panel taking place just three days before the official premiere of Andor season two, we can expect a full-court press of information regarding the coming season. And, you have to think, there’s a small chance of a secret screening at some point too.

When: Saturday, April 19 from 10-11 a.m. local time. (9-10 p.m. ET)

Lucasfilm Publishing: Stories From a Galaxy Far, Far Away….

Star Wars publishing has been cooking of late, telling stories from seemingly every era of Star Wars while also wrapping up a multi-year arc in The High Republic. What’s next? Here’s when we’ll find out.

When: Friday, April 18 from 2-3 p.m. local time. (1-2 a.m. ET on April 19)

Ahsoka

If this panel was about the upcoming second season of Ahsoka, it would be much higher on the list. However, it’s specifically described as a “look back at the first season.” Even so, creator and showrunner Dave Filoni can’t come to Star Wars Celebration, hold an Ahsoka panel, and not have some news about season two.

When: Saturday, April 19 from 1-2 p.m. local time. (12-1 a.m. ET on April 20)

First Look – Star Wars: Visions Volume 3

While it’s not as popular as the movies or live-action shows, the anime anthology series Star Wars: Visions has had some of the best Star Wars storytelling in recent memory. As a result, this panel is certain to have the most actual news about an upcoming project of the entire event.

When: Sunday, April 20 from 10-11 a.m. local time. (9-10 p.m. ET)

A Conversation with Oscar Isaac

Poe Dameron himself will take the stage at Star Wars Celebration to talk about being one of the galaxy’s best pilots and, hopefully, be asked if he’d ever come back.

When: Saturday, April 19 from 2:45-3:45 p.m. local time. (1:45-2:45 a.m. ET on April 20)

Hasbro Star Wars Panel

In previous years, we here at io9 have gotten incredibly excited about Hasbro panels because of all the possibilities of what could be revealed. In many of those years though, we’ve left disappointed. Hopefully, that doesn’t happen this year.

When: Friday, April 18 from 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. local time. (10:30-11:30 p.m. ET)

Light & Magic

Light & Magic is a dynamite documentary series about ILM on Disney+ and this panel will discuss its new episodes coming soon.

When: Friday, April 18 from 1-2 p.m. local time. (12-1 a.m. ET on April 19)

Disney Experiences: Building the Galaxy with Walt Disney Imagineering

After the confusion earlier this month about what, exactly, is happening in theme park ride Millennium Falcon :Smugglers Run, we’re hoping this panel clears it up as well as digging into the relationship between Disney’s park creators and Lucasfilm.

When: Sunday, April 20 from 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. local time. (10:30-11:30 p.m. ET)

https://gizmodo.com,DOGE Broke Into the Offices of a Pro-Peace Nonprofit: Report,https://gizmodo.com/doge-broke-into-the-offices-of-a-pro-peace-nonprofit-report-2000577536,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:55:15 GMT","In recent weeks, Elon Musk has turned his ire toward “government-funded nongovernmental organizations.” Now we’re starting to see the long arm of the Department of Government Efficiency reach to pocket check NGOs. Late on Monday, the United States Institute of Peace saw DOGE employees, reportedly flanked by FBI agents and Washington, D.C. police officers, force their way into the independent nonprofit and escort out employees, according to the New York Times.

DOGE has been trying to get into the USIP building since last week but got turned away when a USIP lawyer informed them that the organization was an independent agency that does not fall under the jurisdiction of the executive branch. DOGE returned Monday and made multiple attempts at breaching USIP before finally getting in, according to an official from the organization who spoke to NBC Washington.

The Times had this detail on what led to DOGE finally getting in, which should serve as a stark reminder of where law enforcement is aligned: according to the publication, USIP employees called the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department to report DOGE employees for trespassing. When the cops showed up, they escorted USIP employees from the building and let DOGE in.

The standoff technically started weeks before Musk’s gang of “efficiency” enforcers showed up. On February 19, Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to “reduce the scope of federal bureaucracy” and named the U.S. Institute for Peace as one of its entities for elimination.

Last week, per the Times, the White House sent the majority of the USIP’s independent board an email informing them that they were being fired. The remaining three board members—Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and President of the National Defense University Peter Garvin—voted to remove CEO George Moose from the agency and replace him with Kenneth Jackson. Moose holds that his firing is illegal and is challenging it. He also argued that DOGE has no jurisdiction at USIP to begin with, telling NBC Washington, “What has happened here today is an illegal takeover by elements of the executive branch of a private nonprofit.”

USIP has been in action since 1984 when it was created by Congress and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, tasked with researching and promoting diplomatic solutions to conflicts. The reason that it is funded by Congress, which appears to be one of Musk’s big objections to it and other organizations like it, is to help USIP maintain its independence and not feel beholden to influence from outside donors. And look, it’s far from a perfect organization, but it’s also not exactly the kind of thing that you’d target if your true goal was to reduce waste and inefficiency. It’s the kind of thing you’d target if you have a political agenda to upend any institute that may house dissenting opinions to your administration.

USIP was seeking $55 million in funding for the entirety of its operations during the upcoming fiscal year. How much will the deployment of law enforcement to facilitate the takeover of the agency, the ongoing legal battles that will come from the abrupt firing of USIP’s CEO and staff members, and the additional spending on military conflicts that will result from this? Hope it’s less than $55 million or we’re going to have to have a conversation about the definition of efficiency.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Immaculate Feather Fossil Reveals the Unlikely Preserving Power of Volcanoes,https://gizmodo.com/incredible-feather-fossil-reveals-the-unlikely-preserving-power-of-volcanoes-2000577505,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:35:40 GMT","Fossilized feathers discovered 136 years ago are still revealing new secrets. Researchers found that the volcanic rock preserving the feather holds microscopic details preserved within the fossil.

The team’s research—published today in Geology—found that the feathers are preserved in zeolite, a mode of preservation that hasn’t been reported for soft tissues until now.

“Fossil feathers are usually preserved in ancient mudrocks laid down in lakes or lagoons,” said Valentina Rossi, a researcher at University College Cork and lead author of the study, in a university release. “The fossil vulture is preserved in ash deposits, which is extremely unusual. When analyzing the fossil vulture plumage, we found ourselves in uncharted territory. These feathers are nothing like what we usually see in other fossils.”

Rossi told Gizmodo in an email that the finding “expands on what it’s possible in the fossil record,” and that low temperature flows from volcanoes are “very good media to preserve soft tissues.”

The soft sediments at the bottoms of water bodies—and for that matter, non-solid land, like mudslides—can cover dead organisms, keeping them from being scavenged and preserving their remains in deep time. But preservation in zeolites—aluminum- and silicon-rich minerals that are common in volcanic settings—is a new finding, one that could mean more volcanically preserved fossils down the line.

The feather belonged to a vulture that lived in Italy some 30,000 years ago. The animal’s entire body was preserved in three dimensions, from the bird’s eyelids to the tips of its wings. Ergo: A feather fossil that is preserved down to the microscopic pigment structures in the fossil’s wing.

“We are used to [thinking] that volcanic deposits are associated with hot, fast-moving pyroclastic currents that will destroy soft tissues,” said Dawid Iurino, the study’s coordinator and a researcher at the University of Milan, in the same release. “However, these geological settings are complex and can include low temperature deposits that can preserve soft tissues at the cellular level.”

Indeed, the volatile and extreme conditions of volcanic eruptions are surprisingly good at immaculately preserving the most delicate tissues, in the right circumstances. Last month, a team of researchers confirmed that the eruption of Italy’s Mount Vesuvius in 79, which devastated and buried the nearby towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, also turned one victim’s brain into glass—preserving the organ’s microscopic axons and neurons in a solid state.

Volcanoes spew hot gas, ash, and of course, lava when they erupt, often with fatal effects for life in their immediate vicinity. The nature of the vulture’s preservation is an encouraging sign that more extremely well-preserved fossils may lie in wait for paleobiologists to discover.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Stephen King’s Cujo Gets an Unexpected Yet Exciting Director,https://gizmodo.com/stephen-kings-cujo-gets-an-unexpected-yet-exciting-director-2000577510,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:15:15 GMT","Cujo is chomping his way back to the movies and his new owner is someone very good at terrifying you. Darren Aronofsky, the director of Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan, mother!, and The Whale is in talks with Netflix to direct a new adaptation of the Stephen King classic about a killer dog.

If this is the first you’re hearing about the film, that makes a lot of sense. It was only last week news broke that Netflix was working on a new version of the story, but at the time there were no names attached. No director, no writer, no star. Which certainly seemed odd because, how the heck does that work? But, if Aronofsky is on board, it makes a lot more sense. He’s got a great track record across genres and is sure to get all kinds of awesome people interested. The InSneider first broke the news of his involvement, which was then corroborated by multiple trade publications.

Originally published in 1981, King’s book is about a dog who contracts rabies after being bitten by a bat and then goes on a rampant killing spree. Two years later, it was adapted into a hit film starring E.T.’s Dee Wallace but that was that. However, Netflix’s Roy Lee has found lots of success producing King’s stories, such as both installments of It, and brought this new adaptation to light at the streamer.

There’s no writer yet which, again, seems odd—how do you have a director without a writer?—but Aronofsky is not a filmmaker known for compromise. From his earliest days willing a gritty thriller like Pi into existence, all the way through his Oscar-winning fare with Natalie Portman and Brendan Fraser, Aronofsky’s work has always been visceral. It’s intense. It’s emotional. It’s often incredibly messed up. And if you think of all those things wrapped in the frame of a Stephen King story about a killer dog, well, it sounds like a winning combination.

Of course, there’s no guarantee the project with Aronofsky will come to light. He’s currently finishing a crime film called Caught Stealing which will be out this summer. But we hope he does return to the world of intense horrors that made him famous in the first place.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Italian Newspaper Creates Entirely AI-Generated Edition,https://gizmodo.com/italian-newspaper-creates-entirely-ai-generated-edition-2000577463,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:45:15 GMT","An Italian newspaper says it has created the world’s first issue generated entirely using AI, with journalists limited to asking questions of a chatbot and reading the answers before inserting them. The Guardian earlier reported on the initiative by Il Foglio, an Italian liberal conservative paper.

Claudio Cerasa, editor of Il Foglio, said the experiment serves as a test for how AI could work “in practice” in a newsroom and forces journalists to ask tough questions about what the technology means for the future journalism.

“It will be the first daily newspaper in the world on newsstands created entirely using artificial intelligence,” said Cerasa. “For everything. For the writing, the headlines, the quotes, the summaries. And, sometimes, even for the irony.”

The four-page “Il Fogolio AI” was inserted into the larger Tuesday edition, and can also be viewed online.

Early experiments with using generative artificial intelligence in newsrooms have not gone particularly well. Back in 2023, CNET faced criticism after it quietly began publishing financial advice stories generated using AI which turned out to include significant inaccuracies. More recently, the Los Angeles Times released an AI-powered tool called “Insights” that was supposed to rate the bias of opinion articles automatically generated counterpoints; it quickly pulled the tool after it was found downplaying the KKK.

Generative artificial intelligence is good at producing verisimilitudes of genuine writing, something that looks clear and authoritative. There have been attempts to improve the “thinking” process of chatbots, but they are ultimately glorified autocomplete systems and face the intractable problem of simply making things up. Chatbots that present their logic as they produce a response will even sometimes admit as much. Ultimately, the problem with all language models is that the user has to look closely at all the generated text and correct errors if they even spot them at all. Newsrooms in particular have to be careful to not harm their credibility amongst the public even further by publishing slop.

Still, news organizations continue to experiment with the technology despite significant concerns amongst journalists in particular regarding whether newsrooms will try to use AI to cut back on staffing. The Washington Post and Bloomberg both utilize AI to offer article summaries, for instance. Patch, a hyperlocal news site that was previously owned by AOL, now relies entirely on AI scraping the web to find news for many of its local editions.

Quote-unquote “real” journalism should be less affected, as generative AI is simply creating new text from material it has already seen before. Original reporting—finding original stories, interviewing individuals—requires producing entirely new information that is not yet on the web. But the public at large does not place much value on media in the digital age—not just limited to journalism, they are not willing to pay much for music or video anymore either. Labor being the highest cost center in most organizations, it is not hard to see more news organizations using AI wherever possible. Several journalism unions have petitioned for clauses preventing the use of AI.

Someday, we are going to have AI news articles citing information from other AI news articles until one cannot even figure out the original source anymore. Or stories generated entirely from Reddit comments.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Magic: The Gathering's New Expansion Wants You to Behold Some Dragons,https://gizmodo.com/magic-the-gathering-tarkir-dragonstorm-spoilers-details-release-date-2000577126,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:30:52 GMT","Magic: The Gathering loves dragons. It loves them as major players in its lore, it loves them on lavish card art, it occasionally loves them in dungeons, when dallying about with its fellow Wizards of the Coast property. But as the venerable trading card game enters its next original expansion—on the precipice on its next, controversial step into the game’s crossover-laden future—it wants to bring you back not just to the familiar realm of Tarkir, but to the basics. Which, in this case, involves looking the hell out of some dragons.

Tarkir: Dragonstorm marks the conclusion of Magic‘s latest storyline—the middle chapter of an ongoing trilogy of narratives that have encompassed the game’s original card sets since August 2024’s Bloomburrow, all the way to an as-yet-untitled set due to release late next year. Returning to the plane of Tarkir, first visited in the 2014 block beginning with Khans of Tarkir, it’s set amid chaos on the plane as it’s ravaged by the aftermath of a series rebellions against the five Dragon Lords that ruled over Tarkir, creating a dangerous wild new kind of dragon in the process. Dragonstorm will see the planeswalkers Elspeth and Narset team up to investigate the threat of dragons that have been cropping up across the last couple of expansion narratives—battling Sarkhan as he attempts to solidify dragonkind’s grip over both Tarkir and the planes beyond it.

Suffice to say, dragons are a huge element of Dragonstorm, not just narratively and in the makeup of the cards to be found in the set, but artistically and mechanically as well. Beyond the legions of dragons that will be found in Dragonstorm, the creatures are dotted throughout variant cards in the set, from special draconic frames to a series of collector-booster-exclusive lands that focus on dragon eyes, to another set of lands that feature the classic land types of Magic‘s various colors of mana, dominated by the shadowy presence of a dragon flying overhead.

Tarkir: Dragonstorm Card Previews

But within the actual mechanical systems of Dragonstorm, that means there are a lot of dragon cards, and a lot of big dragon creatures to play around in decks with. This coalesces into two major new mechanics being introduced for Dragonstorm. The first, “Behold,” adds a new piece of mechanical language to Magic‘s ever-growing lexicon.

“This isn’t so much a mechanic, but it’s something we wanted to do a lot of times across the set. We kind of wanted to get some better language for the cards, to make them more readable,” Adam Prosak, a senior game designer on the Magic team, told press at a recent event revealing a swath of new cards from Dragonstorm. “I refer to the behold mechanic as a ‘point to a dragon,’ or ‘promise us you put a bunch of dragons in your deck’.”

Present on a lot of the cards in the set (naturally, given the prevalence of dragons on Tarkir), to behold a dragon allows a player to either point to a dragon card they have in either their hand or played on the battlefield, and use its presence to activate an ability on another card. “We chose that word very specifically,” Prosak joked, hoping that players will majestically point toward the myriad dragons at play while announcing their play. But not only will dragons be used as leverage to activate other card’s abilities, multiple of the larger dragon cards in the set will carry another mechanic to help players soften the blow of dumping a lot of high-cost creatures into a thematically appropriate deck: Omen.

“This Omen ability is just something that lets you put a whole bunch of dragons in your deck without messing up the gameplay of having a bunch of really expensive big creatures in your deck,” Prosak explained. “What are you going to do for the rest of the game?”

Omen will be an ability on certain dragon cards that essentially lets them be useful to draw other cards, and then be saved back into your deck for later once you’ve ramped up your mana resources: an instant ability that lets you draw an amount of cards, and then discard the card that used Omen, shuffling it back into your library. “These are basically two cards in one, except for when you cast the instant, you’re hoping to draw your dragon later,” Prosak continued. “And if you catch a dragon, well, you’ve cast a huge dragon. So that’s very exciting.”

Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Previews

But while Dragonstorm is going to be a set about dragons in myriad forms, it’s also a Tarkir set, which means another element at play throughout the set is the major clans first introduced in Khans of Tarkir. “When we returned to Tarkir, we wanted to make sure this set encompassed everything that players expected and loved from the original Tarkir block,” Athena Froehlich, the product designer on Dragon Storm, said. “So you can expect the best of both worlds, that is, clans and dragons.”

The five clans of Tarkir—Abzan, Mardu, Jeskai, Sultai, and Temur—will all return in Dragonstorm, and not only will each of the clans have an allied spirit dragon that connects them all to the rebellions against the Dragon Lords, as well as new characters reflecting how each of them have developed since players last visited the plane, they will also each have a unique mechanic that defines their archetype in the set. Abzan introduces “Endures,” which grants creatures either bonus power and toughness, or creates new spirit tokens, while the Jeskai introduce “Flurry,” bonuses introduced if a player casts a second spell in their turn.

The Mardu have “Mobilize,” which lets cards create additional temporary 1/1 warriors, playing into other cards that rely on having extra creatures, while Sultai adds “Renew,” used from the graveyard to exile a creature entirely in exchange for granting bonus counters (including keyword counters like Lifelink or Deathtouch) to your cards in play. Lastly, the Temur have “Harmonize,” a variant of Flashback that lets players cast sorceries and instants from the graveyard for a higher cost–one that can be reduced by tapping creatures in play, leveraging the Temur’s connection to high-power creatures alongside their spells.

All these will play a role in the not traditional four, but five Commander decks that will release in Dragonstorm, each built around a particular Tarkir clan, and synergize around two potential commanders: one of the clan leaders, or one of their matching spirit dragons, synthesizing the wider set’s theme around both the major factions that define Tarkir… and the massive beasts that might end up dooming them all.

https://gizmodo.com,Disney+ Is Adding a 24/7 Simpsons Channel,https://gizmodo.com/simpsons-streaming-channel-disney-plus-homer-bart-2000577462,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:30:05 GMT","First, the television experience became streaming and now the whole thing is going back the other way. The latest example is Disney+ announcing a brand new “lean-back viewing” experience, a 24-hour continuous stream of The Simpsons. Starting today, it’ll run all 767 episodes of the show in chronological order. When that ends in about 10 days or so, the channel will continue with “a programming lineup that will be refreshed monthly and accessible to Premium subscribers,” according to the press release.

“From day one, the fans have asked for a stream of The Simpsons, and we’re happy to oblige,” Gabe Lewis, SVP of Programming & Content Curation, Disney+, added. “Streams on Disney+ have been a fantastic go-to experience for subscribers looking to sit back and relax with their favorite shows and movies, and we look forward to evolving the user experience and expanding the offering with more streams, to more subscribers, later this year.”

Now, a few things here. First of all, I’m actually all for a Simpsons channel that I can put on, not think about, and it just keeps going, as opposed to individually selecting new episodes. That’s also because I was born in the 1980s and I’m used to television, which did that not just for one thing, but for everything. In fact, it still does. So while this is a nice addition to a Disney+ subscription you’re already paying for, coming up with fancy terms like “lean-back viewing” and acting like you invented the idea of a television channel comes off as a little smug. Next they’ll be touting a landmark idea where you pay for all your streaming services in one big package that allows you to flip between them and see what you want to what. You know, like the cable you had 20 years ago!

Nevertheless, a 24/7 Simpsons channel is a good idea and a nice addition to an already pretty spectacular offering. Even without the stream, Disney+ has a really strong menu of curated Simpsons content based on a whole slew of categories: character, future predictions, sports, music, horror, you name it. And now you can also watch Springfield’s most famous family all day, every day, without touching your remote. Here’s the commercial for it.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,White House Announces Plan to Use Federal Lands to ‘Reduce Housing Costs’,https://gizmodo.com/white-house-announces-plan-to-use-federal-lands-to-reduce-housing-costs-2000577144,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:25:49 GMT","The White House has announced plans to “use” federal lands to create more “affordable housing.” While the effort would presumably destroy areas of wildlife that have been deliberately protected for generations, it will face some daunting headwinds.

The initiative is to be carried out by the Department of Housing Development (HUD) and the Department of the Interior. In a joint announcement from HUD Secretary Scott Turner and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the government said Monday that it was planning to use “underutilized federal Land suitable for housing to increase supply and decrease costs for millions of Americans.” The announcement was also republished as an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal weirdly titled “Federal Lands Can Be Home Sweet Home.” According to the announcement, the two agencies will work together to identify what public lands would be most suitable for conversion into commercial housing:

Under this agreement, HUD will pinpoint where housing needs are most pressing and guide the process by working with state and local leaders who know their communities best. Interior will identify locations that can support homes while carefully considering environmental impact and land-use restrictions. Working together, our agencies can take inventory of underused federal properties, transfer or lease them to states or localities to address housing needs, and support the infrastructure required to make development viable — all while ensuring affordability remains at the core of the mission.

The announcement also notes that the traditional regulatory process will be “streamlined,” presumably meaning that it will disregard environmental impact or safety concerns:

Streamlining the regulatory process is a cornerstone of this partnership. Historically, building on federal land is a nightmare of red tape — lengthy environmental reviews, complex transfer protocols and disjointed agency priorities. This partnership will cut through the bureaucracy. Interior will reduce the red tape behind land transfers or leases to public housing authorities, nonprofits and local governments. HUD will ensure these projects align with affordability goals and development needs.

The statement adds: “This isn’t a free-for-all to build on federal lands, although we recognize that bad-faith critics will likely call it that. It’s a strategic effort to use our resources responsibly while preserving our most beautiful lands.”

On the one hand, America needs more affordable housing. Much of the housing shortage is driven by a limited supply and the affordability crisis for Americans (especially young, first-time homebuyers) is real. That said, the idea that the Trump administration—which is currently a nightmare of chaos, corruption, dysfunction, and legally questionable activities—would handle this project “responsibly” and with deference to preserving the nation’s public lands, seems laughable, at best.

It’s also not clear—from the announcement—what Burgum and Turner are talking about. While it would appear that they are talking about selling off federal lands so that they can be privately developed, the announcement doesn’t say that. It just says they could be “used” in this fashion, although it’s unclear what private housing on public lands would (or could) look like, legally. Are they talking about a reservation for white people? It’s unclear.

Additionally, Trump has created a trade war with Canada out of thin air. That means lumber prices are set to skyrocket, making the cost of building housing significantly higher. Sure, we could cut down more of our own forests, but building new mills will take years.

There’s also another aspect to this situation that is worth mentioning, which is the ongoing effort by a number of wealthy investors with ties to the Trump administration to create geographical safe havens for their own dystopian urban projects.

We’ve previously reported on the plan to create so-called “Freedom Cities.” These supposed cities are being advocated for by a network of wealthy, tech-connected investors who want to take public lands, privatize them, and then use them to create anarcho-capitalist communities that play by different rules than traditional cities. These pro-corporatist cities could be made legal through the enactment of special jurisdictions, which will allow wealthy private investors to write their own laws and set up their own governance structures that could eschew traditional bureaucratic norms and practices. A lobbying group called the Freedom Cities Coalition recently met with White House officials to persuade President Trump to authorize the creation of these zones.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"Pebble, the Original Smartwatch, Has a Colorful New Successor",https://gizmodo.com/pebble-the-original-smartwatch-has-a-colorful-new-successor-2000577263,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:00:05 GMT","Months after announcing a plan to bring the Pebble back, Eric Migicovsky’s new company, Core Devices, is showing off specs and images and opening up pre-orders.

Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, still wears the eponymous smartwatch he created back in 2013. Launched as a Kickstarter campaign, Pebble developed an audience of loyal enthusiasts. The company made smartwatches for a niche of people who traded features like health tracking, color touchscreens, and luxury materials for something more affordable with a black-and-white display and physical buttons that could last for days instead of hours. An open SDK allowed developers to make all sorts of apps not allowed on other smartwatch platforms.

But Pebble eventually collapsed after the company, as Migicovsky said in an interview, “lost the core vision of what made a Pebble a Pebble” and found itself “kind of flipping around in the wind, reacting to what we thought the market was calling for.” Pebble shut down in 2016 and sold its assets to Fitbit, and afterwards Migicovsky said he never found another smartwatch with the exact same suite of features he wanted.

After all these years, he is bringing back the beloved smartwatch under a new company, aptly called Core Devices. Its first two smartwatches became available for pre-order on Tuesday, and Pebble lovers will be glad to know they largely stick to the original design and aesthetic with some key improvements.

“We’re keeping the core things the same,” said Migicovsky. “Like, what makes a Pebble a Pebble? It’s the e-paper screen, long battery life with a clean, simple aesthetic, kinda quirky physical buttons.” On the continued use of buttons, which automakers have been removing to the chagrin of many drivers: “You wanna be able to answer a call or hang up on a call without actually looking down at the screen or pressing play or pause when you’re on the line.” And the watches from Pebble were hackable, “in a way that no other smartwatch is.”

Core 2 Duo (not to be mistaken with the Intel chipset) is said to look and feel just like the Pebble 2, but now with battery life of up to thirty days on a charge, a massive leap from the seven days the earlier watch could get. Migicovsky attributes that to improvements in Bluetooth chip efficiency over the past ten years. “It’s the stress of having to remember all chargers and everything. That’s always a problem,” he said. “So that’s one thing that we’ve improved. You can go on basically the longest vacation you can think of and still not bring your charger on the trip.”

The Core 2 Duo—the “Duo” stands for ‘do-over’—will also have a speaker and microphone as well as sleep and step tracking in a polycarbonate frame. It will cost $149, with an initial production run of approximately 10,000 units available on day one. Shipping begins in July.

The other watch, Core Time 2, is Migicovsky’s “dream watch,” featuring a metal frame and, for the first time, a color reflective LCD touchscreen. He conceded that although buttons are great because you do not need to look at the watch to control it, he likes the complications feature on Apple Watch, and wanted to offer something similar. Wearers will be able to see information from apps directly from the watchface, and tap the complications to go directly into apps. The Core Time 2 will cost $225 and shipping begins in December. Like the Core 2 Duo the company claims it should last about 30 days on a charge. In another departure from the Core 2 Duo, the Core Time 2 also includes a heart rate monitor and should be water resistant.

The software and app marketplace will largely be identical to the Pebble lineup, after Migicovsky convinced Google to open source PebbleOS. Google took over Pebble’s assets with its acquisition of Fitbit. A roughly combined 10,000 apps and watchfaces that were available on the older Pebble watches will be supported.

Pebble fanatics have a lot to like here. The brand is not being exploited to chase new trends—this is not an AI companion like the now-defunct Humane Ai Pin. Though a microphone on the watches will enable chatting with ChatGPT. “We’re not messing with a good thing,” Migicovsky said. Do not fix what is not broken, is what the strategy seems to be.

Core 2 Duo is already far along in the production process. According to Migicovsky, Core Devices has already built dozens of units for testing and development, the process of launching the new company has been aided in part because he began working on development before Google even committed to open-sourcing the OS, and because he found a supplier who still had old Pebble 2 parts. Core Devices is currently in the process of making the first Core Time 2 prototypes.

The market for smartwatches has changed a lot over the years, with the largest players, Apple and Garmin, focusing on health and fitness tracking. Core Devices watches will have basic step and sleep tracking, but Migicovsky believes there remains a niche in the market for people who do not need that.

Migicovsky is not making a big gamble here, having learned from past mistakes. “We’re not taking big risks. We’re not trying to build millions of watches or compete with Apple or Garmin,” he said. “If you’re looking for something that’s perfectly polished or looking for something like a Garmin, go and buy those watches.”

“This is not designed for everyone,” he continued. “It’s designed for a very specific type of person that doesn’t feel like their needs are met by the other guys. I’m not sitting here trying to sell millions of these. This one might sell out, we are only making ten thousand a month. If it works really well and people love it, we’ll make more. But we’re taking it slowly trying to build a sustainable company.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Man’s Two-Year Hiccups Triggered by Rare Allergy Condition,https://gizmodo.com/mans-two-year-hiccups-triggered-by-rare-allergy-condition-2000577361,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:10:12 GMT","Talk about a bad hiccup attack. In a recent case report, doctors describe an elderly man who endured years of incurable hiccups ultimately caused by an allergic condition.

Doctors in Lebanon detailed the strange medical tale in a paper published this month in the Journal of Medical Case Reports. The man’s hiccups got so bad that he eventually had to be hospitalized, at which point doctors discovered an unusual manifestation of a well-known but relatively rare type of allergy. Thankfully, once the cause was discovered, the man received proper treatment and his hiccups finally stopped.

Hiccups are involuntary contractions of the diaphragm, a thin muscle at the base of the chest that primarily helps us breathe. Usually, they’re short-lasting bouts of misery caused by any number of mundane things, such as eating too fast, drinking lots of carbonated beverages, or even getting excited. Rarely, though, hiccups can be a sign of a more serious health problem, especially if they don’t go away after a while.

According to this case report, the man had been suffering for over two years with hiccups that came and went with no rhyme or reason. The man took a variety of medications to help stop the episodes, including baclofen (a muscle relaxant), chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic sometimes used for chronic hiccups), and proton-pump inhibitors (used to treat acid reflux, which can cause chronic hiccups), but nothing seemed to help. The man’s symptoms eventually reached a breaking point, as he began experiencing nonstop hiccups for two weeks straight, along with fatigue, which led him to be hospitalized.

The doctors initially failed to find any clear indication of what was causing the man’s hiccups. But a blood test revealed that he had an unusually high level of eosinophils, white blood cells that help fend off parasitic infections. Unfortunately, these cells also often play a role in causing allergy and asthma symptoms. When everything is normal, about 1% to 4% of an adult’s white blood cells will be eosinophils. But the man had an eosinophil count of 18% and no signs of a parasitic infection. Subsequent tests then confirmed that he had a condition called eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE.

EoE is caused by a damaging build-up of eosinophils in the esophagus (this can happen elsewhere in the body, too). Though episodes of EoE can be set off by common allergy triggers like certain foods, it’s a different type of dysfunctional immune response than the typical food allergy. Sufferers often experience a delayed reaction to their triggers, for instance, rather than the almost-instantaneous reaction seen with a classic peanut allergy. It’s estimated that nearly a half million Americans have EoE, though its prevalence seems to be increasing over time.

Scientists still don’t know a lot about EoE, including exactly how or why it happens, though genetics are a likely risk factor. But this case was even stranger than most, given the man’s hiccups. More common symptoms of EoE include trouble swallowing, heartburn, and food getting stuck in the esophagus, none of which the man had. His EoE was also found at a much older age than usual; cases are typically diagnosed either early in childhood or when people reach their 30s and 40s.

The doctors looked through the medical literature and found only two other suspected cases of chronic hiccups caused by EoE. One possible explanation for the man’s hiccups is that his EoE caused cells in the esophagus to send wayward impulses to the vagal nerve (an important nerve that communicates with the diaphragm, among many other body parts).

Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. The doctors initially gave him a combination of a proton-pump inhibitor (also a treatment for EoE) with baclofen, which only partially improved his hiccups. But once they switched him to a topical steroid, his hiccups went away within a week’s time and his eosinophil count dropped back to a healthier level.

The case, the doctors say, is a lesson that this allergy condition can sometimes appear in unusual ways. “EoE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chronic refractory hiccups even when the typical symptoms of EoE are lacking, and prompt treatment with topical steroids should be considered,” they wrote.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Before-and-After Satellite Images Show Upsetting Glacier Loss in Swiss Alps,https://gizmodo.com/before-and-after-satellite-images-show-upsetting-glacier-loss-in-swiss-alps-2000576116,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:15:29 GMT","The European Alps cover over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) across eight European countries, and their cooler upper climes contain thousands of glaciers. Unfortunately, NASA satellite imagery recently captured 40 years of regression in the Alps’ largest chunk of ice, the Great Aletsch Glacier.

The images—seen below, and taken in 1984 and 2024—were snapped by NASA’s Landsat 5’s Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8’s Operational Land Imager (OLI), respectively. The changes to the glacier’s length and width are apparent, reflecting a retreat of more than 4,300 feet (1,300 meters) in those 40 years.

According to a NASA Earth Observatory release, the glacier has also thinned in that time—to the tune of about 141 feet (43 meters) of water, based on data from the Swiss Glacial Monitoring Network (GLAMOS). In other words, its footprint has shrunk in both dimensions.

Despite some cloud cover in the newer image, the loss of ice is clear. Where ice once reflected bright white back up towards the atmosphere, there are more grayish-brown rock underneath. According to the NASA release, it was too early in the year to capture imagery of the glacier without seasonal snow covering the amount of glacial melt that’s occurred in the intervening years.

Alpine glaciers are retreating across the board. The nearby Oberaletsch glacier has retreated more than 787 feet (240 meters) since 1984, and the Fiescher Glacier’s retreat over the same time period has been a staggering 3,281 feet (1,000 meters).

According to a Reuters report published late last year, Swiss glaciers melted at an above-average rate in 2024, despite heavy snowfalls in winter and spring. The winter storms were simply not enough to counteract record ice losses in the face of a warm August—and even a dose of Sahara desert dust, which made it harder for the Swiss ice sheets to reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere.

In 2024, Swiss glaciers lost 2.5% of their volume, according to Reuters. Central Europe, including Switzerland, lost a staggering 39% of its glacial ice between 2000 and 2024, as a team of researchers reported in Nature this year.

The NASA imagery puts those changes into sharp relief. Coming out of a record warm February—the third-warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—there’s a real worry (and expectation) that we’ll likely see more photos of glacial losses in the near future.",gizmodo

The Roborock Qrevo is one of the most advanced robot vacuum and mop combos available, with an all-in-one dock that auto-refills the mop water and keeps it hot, dries the mopping components with warm air, auto-empties the vacuum chamber, and even cleans itself. This limited-time Amazon sale has dropped the price of the Roborock Qrevo Master by 43%, a $600 plunge from its usual $1,400 price.

Every Surface Gets Clean

There’s no need for multiple cleaning devices for the different floor surfaces of your home, or having a robot cleaner that can clean only part of the home while you’re left to do the rest by hand. The Roborock Qrevo Master cleans carpets, marble, tile, and upholstered surfaces with equal effectiveness.

As a vacuum, the Roborock Qrevo Master’s 10,000Pa hyper-force suction extracts dirt, dust, pet hair, and other debris from even thick carpets, aided by two all-rubber main brushes that agitate the floor and bring the dirt up to be sucked into the Roborock Qrevo Master vacuum chamber, from where it’s automatically drawn into the dock. Roborock’s Carpet Boost+ System ensures 99% hair removal from carpeted surfaces, and its FlexiArm design reaches out to thoroughly clean edges and corners.

As a mop, the Roborock Qrevo Master’s dual brushes spin at 200 rpm, and with 30 levels of flow of the warm water automatically loaded into the robot at the dock. When your hard floors are spotlessly clean, the Roborock returns to the dock to have its mop brushes automatically cleaned and dried.

Smart Service

The app that controls the Roborock Qrevo Master is powered by AI and can identify and avoid 62 different types of objects as it goes about its work. With PreciSense LiDAR Navigtation, it’s able to map the entire layout of your home, from which you can program no-go zones, and a set-it and forget-it schedule so the Roborock Qrevo Master works autonomously and keeps your floors clean without needing your attention.

A $1,400 smart robot that keeps all of your floors clean — carpeted or hard-surfaced — is a worthy investment. But one that’s on sale for 43% off at Amazon for a limited time, bringing its price down to just $800, is a must-have appliance to make your life easier.

https://wired.com,"FTC Removes Posts Critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and AI Companies",https://wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:02:32 GMT","The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.

On the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.

One now deleted blog, titled “Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?” explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled “$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance” instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.

“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.

Another removed FTC blog titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”

The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general purpose government chatbot.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.

Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.

Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s longstanding allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, the New York Times reported in December.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. ""If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.

Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.

“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”",wired
https://wired.com,‘Airport Theory’ Will Make You Miss Your Flight,https://wired.com/story/airport-theory-aka-what-happens-if-you-miss-your-flight/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:32:00 GMT","If airports weren’t already a hellscape, TikTok has found a way to make them worse. Welcome to airport theory, a viral delusion that suggests you can roll up to the airport 15 minutes before boarding, waltz through security, and still make your flight with time to spare. No stress, no waiting, just pure main character energy.

TikTok creators like Michael DiCostanzo (@michael.dicostanzo) swear by it, documenting their dashes through high-traffic hubs like LAX, Atlanta International Airport, and post–Super Bowl New Orleans. Some viewers are sold. Others are calling BS.

TikTok content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

“So you had PreCheck, didn’t check a bag, and were at the nearest terminal? Now let’s do it when it’s not the optimal situation,” one user commented. And, sure enough, the internet is also littered with failed attempts—videos of forlorn TikTokers watching their flights take off without them, their carry-ons full of regret.

It’s a fun fantasy, which explains why “airport theory” has racked up over 400 million views on TikTok. Unfortunately, the the Transportation Security Administration doesn’t care about your viral moment. The national average wait time for security was 27 minutes, 16 seconds in 2024. And if you’re flying out of a notorious bottleneck like JFK, Orlando International, or Chicago O’Hare, it’s closer to 40 minutes. Google searches for “I missed my flight what do I do” have spiked 70 percent in the past month, per Google Trends. It’s not hard to connect the dots.

Here is your sad reality check: Airlines still recommend arriving at least two hours before a domestic flight, three for international. Sometimes that buffer feels like overkill. But would you rather rush through the airport with your heart racing or have a few minutes to find your gate, grab a bag of overpriced whatever, and scroll TikTok watching other people miss their flights? That sounds like a much better airport theory to us.

Airport Hacks That Actually Work

The best way to get through airport security unscathed is to move like you’ve done this a hundred times before. A little planning, the right gear, and skipping social media stunts will get you from curb to gate with minimal stress.

Time It Right

Travel off-peak. According to CheapAir, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often less crowded. Early flights between 5 and 8 am and red-eyes (after 9 pm) tend to have fewer passengers.

Pack Smart

Dress for Efficiency

Empty your pockets before security. Stash everything in your carry-on instead of fumbling at the checkpoint.

Stash everything in your carry-on instead of fumbling at the checkpoint. Keep metal jewelry, watches, and belts in your bag until after screening.

Avoid boots or high-tops. Slip-ons like Allbirds' Tree Runners for $98 and the Rothy’s Driving Loafer for $189—we've raved about them in the past—make security a breeze. If you’re not planning on sprinting through the airport, the Bearpaw Martis Slippers ($70) are ultra-comfy.

https://wired.com,The Pebble E-Paper Smartwatch Is Back. Just Don't Call It Pebble,https://wired.com/story/pebble-smartwatches-core-devices-core-2-duo-core-time-2/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Nearly a decade after its demise, smartwatch maker Pebble is back—sort of. Today, the company's founder, Eric Migicovsky, has unveiled new hardware running open source PebbleOS. However, since Google owns the Pebble trademark, these are not Pebble smartwatches. Instead, say hello to the first watches from a new brand called Core Devices: Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2.

For a brief history lesson, Pebble skyrocketed to fame in 2012 through a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign. The company's smartwatches had e-paper displays and arrived ahead of the first Apple Watch, offering wearers the ability to see notifications, create custom watch faces, and even access an app store—all with battery life that lasted a week despite an always-on screen.

But the company scaled too quickly and then didn't meet its sales targets, eventually deciding to sell to Fitbit. A few years later, Google bought Fitbit, which meant it owned Pebble's assets.

The original Pebble smartwatches didn't die off—Fitbit kept the lights on for some time, and thanks to Pebble's cult-like fanbase, a coalition of developers and enthusiasts helped launch the Rebble project to replace Pebble's web services when Fitbit eventually shut everything down, so that core functions of the watches kept working.

But what's enabled Migicovsky to introduce new hardware running PebbleOS is Google's decision to release the source code in January. “I asked politely if they would open source the operating system, and they very graciously did,” Migicovsky tells WIRED. “We wouldn't be able to do what we're doing now if Google hadn't done that, so we're super appreciative.”

New Leaf

That brings us to Migicovsky's new brand—Core Devices—a nod to the Pebble Core, the screen-less wearable that never shipped. This is a very small operation that consists of Migicovsky, another full-time employee, and a few contractors—he says he's taking things a bit more cautiously this time around. That's why there will only be roughly 10,000 units available for the Core 2 Duo and a little more of the Core Time 2—preorders are live today if you want to reserve one.

“I’m intentionally trying to build something that’s sustainable, rather than a fast-growing do-or-die company,"" Migicovsky says. ""We’re taking small risks, we're doing a couple of products, one at a time—and cautiously, carefully building this company to be sustainable. If we can do our jobs, build these watches and make people happy, we'll build more. There's always more time.""",wired
https://wired.com,How to Protect Your Cats (and Backyard Chickens) From Bird Flu,https://wired.com/story/pets-and-backyard-flocks-are-at-risk-from-bird-flu-heres-how-to-protect-them/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:12:13 GMT","A nationwide egg shortage has sent prices soaring at your local grocery store—and the culprit is H5N1 bird flu. The virus has infected poultry flocks in every US state, with more than 166 million chickens having been killed by the virus or culled to contain it. H5N1 is also spreading among cattle, with close to 1,000 US dairy herds affected, and is suspected to be widespread among wild birds.

But these aren’t the only animals at risk. Domestic cats are particularly susceptible to catching the virus, which can be fatal in felines, while the rising trend of keeping backyard chickens—partly in response to the egg shortage—risks driving up cases further. Pets and backyard flocks can catch the virus from infected birds, alive or dead, as well as from droppings, contaminated surfaces, and contaminated food.

The reported number of US pets impacted by bird flu is relatively low, but cases of H5N1 in domestic cats are rising across the country. As of March 12, there have been 115 cases recorded in pet cats, across 20 states, according to the US Department of Agriculture. However, many cases in pets are probably being missed. “We are likely seeing an undercount of cases of H5 bird flu in pets, as not all sick pets with a possible epidemiologic link or exposure are reported to Veterinary Public Health,” says Jamie Middleton, director of veterinary public health and chief veterinarian at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “As a result, not all cases are tested.”

Cost of testing is an additional barrier to getting an accurate picture of how widespread pet infections are. “Commercial PCR lab testing for influenza at veterinary clinics is very costly, approximately $200 to $300 for a respiratory PCR panel for dogs and cats,” Middleton says. “Thus, many pet owners may elect to not test if their pet is experiencing respiratory symptoms.”

Bird flu can also be missed during testing if an infected animal isn’t shedding the virus at the time they were tested, making it difficult to pinpoint just how widespread the virus is among pets.

The Risks to Your Cat

“We have known for years that cats are susceptible to influenza, and it’s on top of many people’s minds now because they can die from it,” says Sandra Faeh, president of the American Vulnerary Medical Association (AVMA). Cats, specifically those that go outside, are particularly at risk because of their exposure to potentially sick birds.

Cats are also becoming infected by being fed raw food—either homemade or commercially available—as well as unpasteurized milk. Two cats in Oregon recently died of avian influenza after having been fed raw food produced by the company Northwest Naturals. These deaths prompted a voluntary recall of raw pet food by the company.

Northwest Naturals did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

Faeh says that the best thing to do to protect your cat is to keep them inside and away from wildlife. Middleton of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health also advises people to avoid “feeding raw or undercooked meat and poultry products, raw milk or raw dairy products, and raw pet food diets to their pets.”",wired
https://wired.com,Meet the Game Developer Turning Fanfic Into Deadpool DLC,https://wired.com/story/emma-kidwell-turning-fanfic-into-deadpool-dlc/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:15:55 GMT","Before she started writing video games, Emma Kidwell loved Twilight fan fiction. Her “bad, self-insert” stories found a home on DeviantArt, an online community where people posted fan art, original work, and so much more. “The low barrier of entry made it very accessible,” Kidwell says.

Her writing turned into role-playing in forums, and Twilight fandom gave way to a love of video games like Mass Effect. Today, Kidwell is a writer for Firaxis Games and a rising star in the world of game narrative. Her work includes Hindsight, Borderlands 4, Life Is Strange 2, and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII; she has been featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 and the Game Awards’ Future Class of 2023.

This week, she’s hosting the annual Independent Games Festival awards during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. All of that is happening alongside her talk about how writing in fandoms as a kid helped her write DLC for Marvel's Midnight Suns.

Writing fan fiction, it turns out, isn’t so different from writing licensed characters. “I’m role-playing when I'm writing Marvel IP for Firaxis,” Kidwell says. “Fan fiction gave me that foundation to build off of.”

Fan fiction has often been considered a lower form of writing, as either self indulgent or outrageously erotic, the sort of work one does in secret. In the internet culture pantheon, few fanfic writers have ever achieved fame, and those that have sometimes do so for the salacious nature of their work. “My Immortal,” an infamous Harry Potter fanfic, is still referenced in interviews today. Writers such as E.L. James, who created the Fifty Shades series (originally a Twilight fanfic), however, have begun to turn their work into something profitable.

Others, like Kidwell, have turned it into a runway for their careers. “I think because of fan fiction’s relationship to marginalized communities, it wasn't initially seen as being a valid form of writing,” Kidwell says. Clearly, that’s wrong. The gaming and fanfic communities make for a harmonious marriage. The story-driven nature of most games means plenty of fodder for fans craving new narratives, but writers on well-known sites like Archive of Our Own can—and will—turn anything into an original story. Even Tetris.

“Fan fiction is your sandbox,” Kidwell says. “You get to play. There are no rules. You get comfortable playing around with characters that aren't yours and doing whatever the hell you want with them.”

For Midnight Suns, Kidwell was given four characters to choose from, including Deadpool and Storm. Whatever she wrote would be based on the comic versions of the characters, not their cinematic counterparts. While researching both characters, she had a revelation: “This is really similar to what I would think about when creating an original character in a role-playing setting. How would this character fit in with other established characters?”

Writers in Kidwell’s position still have to stick to the rules of the franchise, including its story canon. That hasn’t kept Kidwell from being able to tell the stories she wants. “I think a big, common misconception with IP writing is that it's super restrictive,” Kidwell says. “But I think there's a lot of creative freedom within certain boundaries because you get to inject a little piece of yourself into these characters. It's just kind of like a puzzle: figure out how you can do it authentically and how you can do it in a way that makes sense for the game.”

Kidwell still role-plays in her spare time. Right now, she’s deep into the Dragon Age community. “I see IP writing as kind of the in-between,” she says of fan fiction and fiction. It’s a natural next step in role-playing: “I'm just doing it in a professional setting now.”",wired

Early Big Spring Sale Deals

We see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).

The Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.

The Amazon Fire Max 11 isn’t for everyone, but it’s the best tablet for less than $200. Just be aware that it goes on sale all the time. If you don’t mind needing a workaround for the Google Play Store, and you don’t mind Amazon’s services being pushed at you from every angle, this is a solid budget tablet that‘s good for playing games and watching movies. It charges via USB-C and has hands-free Alexa support.

This is our favorite smart bird feeder. When we first reviewed the Birdfy Smart Bird Feeder (6/10, WIRED Review), we weren’t impressed with the price or the wonky AI features. But since then, the device has improved, with smarter AI and a lower price tag. The AI doesn’t always correctly identify the birds it sees, but it does a better job than smart feeders from other companies, and it does it at a lower price point (even with the $5 per month subscription, if you choose to get it). It‘s part bird feeder, part security camera, with a 1080p viewing angle and color night vision. This version comes with a solar panel—once it’s mounted and connected, you won’t have to recharge the feeder.

This smart bird feeder has a pretty unimpressive smartphone app. Its best features (2K video, AI identification) are locked behind a subscription that costs $4 per month or $48 per year. And the subscription isn’t really worth it—the AI was wonky, and the video clips are just 10 seconds long. However, the battery lasts forever thanks to the built-in solar panel—two months in our reviewer’s testing experience—and there’s a light for night viewing. If you simply want a bird feeder with a camera attached, or you want to see what all the fuss is about, this is a super-affordable option that can help you dip your toes into the world of smart bird feeders.

The Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering.

This countertop appliance went viral on TikTok, and it’s one of the best pizza ovens we’ve tried. The 12-inch cooking surface can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (which takes around 15 minutes). You’ll need to rotate your pizzas pretty frequently, and it can take a while to cook them since the top lets heat out so quickly. But it’s a good option for anyone looking to make homemade pizzas without needing to stick an appliance in their backyard.

This little table made our list of the best standing desks. It can be used as a nightside table or an over-bed desk, and it’s easy to move with the built-in wheels. Press the paddle underneath and adjust the height with ease. It’s nice to keep around if you tend to work from the couch or the back patio, and the 28- by 16-inch tabletop gives you just enough room to work without taking up too much space.

This affordable cat water fountain is our favorite budget-friendly option, and it’s even more affordable once you clip the on-page coupon. The metal bowl is dishwasher-safe, and there’s a clear viewing window so you can easily see the water level. The fountain can be adjusted between a few different configurations (waterfall and two bubble-up modes) so you can choose whichever your cat prefers. Replacement filters are cheap and the reservoir holds 2.4 liters.

The Breville Barista Express is our favorite espresso machine for most people. It goes on sale for this price a few times per year. It’s easy to use thanks to the built-in grinder and adjustable steam wand. It doesn’t have a ton of extra features, but if you just want to make handcrafted espresso beverages at home, this’ll do the trick—and it lasts for years. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has owned his for six and counting.

The Basepaws Breed + Health DNA Test was great fun for me (and possibly less fun for my cat). After snagging a cheek swab and sending in the results, I was met with a ton of data about the stray I adopted years prior. She’s a mix of Maine coon and Ragdoll, with a smattering of many other breeds, and her health was good. (Technically all cats are polycats, but it’s still neat to see what kind of polycat my cat is). The test measures your cat’s DNA against over 100 feline health markers, including whether they’re at risk or at high risk of various disorders (like hypothyroidism or kidney disease). Of course this test shouldn’t replace veterinarian visits, but if you, too, took in a street cat, I think this test is worth it to prove they’re not a Martian.",wired

Maybe. In the meantime, here are some unusual predictions about what technology can do in the world of work. In these days Dario Amodei, co -founder and CEO of Anthropic - one of the best known companies in the sector - has left everyone open -mouth imagining that in the future not too far the most advanced models can be equipped with a ""I discharge"" button, to allow them to refuse to carry out a task or a job that is not to his liking.

""I believe that we should at least ask ourselves a question - said Amodei during an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, an American Think Thank with focus on foreign policy - if we are creating systems that behave in many aspects such as humans and seem to have similar cognitive skills, then we should ask ourselves if these systems have an authentic and significant experience in some way"". By virtue of this, Amodei has advanced the proposal to allow the AI ​​models to abandon an activity that is not to their liking: ""It is only a sort of very elementary preference framework in which it is said that, assuming that the model has a sufficient experience and that he finds himself hatinging off his work, he can simply press the 'I resign' button. If you find out that the models often press this button for really unpleasant things, - does not mean that you are convinced - but maybe you should pay a little attention "".

An unusual hypothesis that of Amodei, who for the first time has advanced the idea of ​​an artificial intelligence with the ability to refuse to carry out a task assigned to him by a human being - something completely unimaginable until some time ago. It is not surprising, therefore, that the declarations of the CEO of Anthropic immediately triggered a wave of criticisms on X and on Reddit, where many users shared comments that attack the excessive anthropomorphism of the AI ​​promised by Amodei. According to the users, in fact, it is not said that an AI refuses to do a job because it really lived a negative experience, considering that it could also do it because it has been trained on training data that make them recognize some activities like more than others. In any case, what amazes is that someone can imagine an AI really able to experience negative emotions and then refuse to continue to try them again and again, a bit like it happens to us with Burnout.",wired

The Mountain View giant announced on Tuesday 18 March the purchase of Wiz for 32 billion dollars. Founded just four years ago, the company based in New York has developed a platform that allows companies to protect its data and applications in the use of cloud services, registering an annual turnover of 700 million dollars and explosive growth. The acquisition of Wiz, who already has several important customers such as Salesforce and Docusign in his wallet, will allow Google to improve its cloud security offer, a sector where its competitors Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure currently hold more market shares. The opposition will take place entirely in cash. The agreement must obtain the regulatory approvals and it is expected that it will be aimed in 2026.

Google's ""yes"" of Wiz comes after a first sensational refusal. In 2023, despite a 23 billion dollar offer, the Cybersiculia company had chosen independence, worried about the regulatory consequences and the limits to its operational autonomy. In just four years Wiz recorded a significant growth of its value: assessed $ 12 billion after a 1 billion financing round at the beginning of 2023, he had subsequently climbed 16 billion after the failure of the first agreement with Google. The current acquisition further doubles this evaluation, generating a considerable return for investors such as Sequoia, Index Ventures and Salesforce. A factor that contributed to the resumption of negotiations was the change of administration in the United States: the victory of Donald Trump in the 2024 elections has in fact aroused expectations of a more permissive approach to mergers and acquisitions in the technological sector, compared to the previous democratic management, which had intensified antitrust actions against the big names of the Silicon Valley.

According to Tech Crunch, the agreement provides that Wiz maintains a high degree of operational independence, following a strategy similar to that adopted by Microsoft in 2016 with the acquisition of LinkedIn for 26 billion dollars. In that case, the professional social network has preserved its identity and leadership, while benefiting from the resources offered by the Redmond giant. According to the terms of the agreement, Wiz will continue to operate with all the main cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud. Existing customers will therefore be able to continue using Wiz's services regardless of the chosen cloud platform. The company plans to expand its staff and evaluates possible further acquisitions to strengthen its technological offer.

For Google, the operation is part of a double strategy. On the one hand, it allows you to immediately strengthen your skills in the field of IT security, a sector rapidly growing and increasingly critical with the evolution of digital threats. On the other hand, it promotes the adoption of the Multicloud model, or the simultaneous use of more suppliers of cloud services by companies, an approach that offers greater flexibility and which Google intends to support as a distinctive element of its offer.",wired

The partnership will come for real, even if it will be necessary to wait a little since the first boxes will be released in 2026. To break the wait there is also a teaser video (see below), starring the most iconic monster of the saga or Pikachu, suggesting that sets will come out to reconstruct some of the most famous creatures, but the collection could also reserve other surprises.

Just a few weeks ago, Lego published a teaser announced Duplo sets coming for the little ones, starring Bluey and Bingo of the very popular animated Bluey series. In the past few minutes, a press release has been issued that formalizes the collaboration between Lego and Pokémon, which should concern the main line of the famous bricks of the Danish brand and which will debut next year, in 2026. The video teaser below shows an immediately recognizable detail such as Pikachu's tail, with the inevitable electrical discharges in support. On the official LEGO website there is already a dedicated page, currently the scar of information, which however declares: ""In 2026, we invite all Pokémon coaches to prepare to build and capture some of their favorite Pokémon"". In short, the hypothesis is that of a first tranche of boxes to compose some of the most popular Pokémon and then also range in more complex settings and rich in details as already happens for example with characters from various other series from Speeds to Star Wars, from the Marvel to the Disney universe to Harry Potter, Minecraft, Fortnite and so on.

In the coming months you should know more with more information on the first sets, including exit and prices. Certainly inspirations will not be missing from the countless video games and animated series released in recent years.",wired

What future for the truce?",https://www.wired.it/article/tregua-gaza-attacco-israele-18-marzo-2025/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:03:44 GMT","Israel launched a massive air offensive on Gaza, ending the fragile truce in force since January 19th. According to witnesses, over twenty Israeli hunting flew over the area around 2 am on Tuesday morning, during Ramadan's pre-Alba meal. The Ministry of Health of the Striscia reports that the balance of the Palestinian victims has already exceeded 300 people, among whom Issam Da'alis, premier of the Hamas government in Gaza, would also have lost his life. The bombings focused mainly on the cities of Gaza, Rafah and Khan Youunis. The military operation comes after weeks of failed negotiations for the release of the Israeli hostages still in the hands of Hamas. The office of the Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel will further intensify the power of military operations against Hamas in the next few days.

Gaza, diplomatic failure

The decision to resume the bombings was taken by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Minister of Defense Israel Katz following the failure to agreement on the release of Israeli hostages. Two Israeli officials confirmed to the Axios website that the Trump administration had been informed in advance of the imminent military operation. The operational plan had been prepared by the Israeli army at the weekend and subsequently approved by political leaders.

Negotiations to extend the truce ran around in early March. The first phase of the agreement of ceased the fire, which began on January 19, officially ended on March 1st. During this phase, only a part of the Israeli hostages were released, while about 59 people (35 of which were held dead) remained in the hands of Hamas. At that point, instead of proceeding with the second phase foreseen by the original agreement, the administration of the American president Donald Trump proposed to extend the first phase until mid -April. This strategy aimed to obtain the release of the remaining hostages before proceeding with any wider concessions to Hamas, allowing Israel to maintain its military position in the strip and avoiding the complete retreat provided for in the second phase of the agreement. The proposal would have led to further exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but without guarantees on the definitive end of the conflict. The talks held in Doha, in Qatar, however, did not lead to an agreement. According to a Palestinian official cited by the BBC, the parties were unable to find an agreement on the fundamental points of the proposal made by the American special correspondent Steve Witkoff.

In response to the refusal of Hamas to extend phase one of the ceased, on March 2, Israel had already adopted restrictive measures, blocking the access of goods and humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. In the following days he also ordered the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), the main Israeli electricity company, to completely stop the energy supply to Gaza, in an attempt to force Hamas to give in to requests in current negotiations. These actions, now followed by the resumption of bombing, have further aggravated the living conditions of the civilian population in the Palestinian encycling.",wired
https://wired.com,"Instead of a European rearmament, we should use defense investments to make good innovation",https://www.wired.it/article/riarmo-europeo-investimenti-innovazione-infrastrutture/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 05:00:00 GMT","Energy is a fundamental theme because Europe, as has been entrusted to the United States for military resources, has also entrusted itself to third parties (Russia in particular) for energy supplies. Therefore, the search for a new independence on the defense cannot be separated from investments in the energy field, also because today the costs of energy in Europe are too high to be able to think of developing the rearmament plan effectively.

Here political and social choices intervene to start, for example, from a convinced and decisive return, at least for Italy, to the adoption of nuclear energy: the new generation fiscal one in the first place and, in perspective, the merger one, the area in which Europe has the global leadership at the moment. Although, it must be said, China is accelerating in this research area.

The industries, the factories, are the other element that must be strengthened: if on the one hand the European industrial capacity is threatened by the new dynamics of the global market (think of the car industry), on the other hand it free industrial resources that can be converted thus reactivating a new generation industrialization process, also enriched by innovation: think, for example, of the additive manufacture (3D printing). Create skills and jobs and which, in perspective, can specialize in those components characterized precisely by the dual-use.

Of course, industry and energy are linked to double wire: without the availability of energy capacity at competitive costs it is in fact almost impossible to restart the industrial process, and without it equally impossible to give concreteness to the continental project of rearm.

The importance of infrastructures

Infrastructures are the other critical element, because there can be no defense project that does not take into account also the logistical aspects that are a key element in case of field interventions. European infrastructures lack coordination and structural homogeneity, which prevents its full integrated use of this.

Here too, however, it is precisely the technological innovation that can be of great help: there are startups that are developing software that allow to coordinate the action of air, marine and terrestrial drones of different manufacturers or that developing algorithms to allow radars to become much more similar to cameras, therefore capable not only of detecting objects but also to recognize them and classify them. There may, then, be innovative companies that help solve infrastructure problems even if, of course, this must be accompanied by a renewal plan that allows for example to trains to travel throughout the continent without problems.",wired
https://wired.com,The research on neurodegenerative diseases passes from the fruit midges,https://www.wired.it/article/ricerca-malattie-neurodegenerative-alzheimer-moscerini-frutta/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 05:50:00 GMT","Neurodegenerative diseases, starting from Alzheimer, are undoubtedly one of the most urgent challenges for biomedical research, also due to their incidence in constant growth due to the aging of the population. In this context, a research line based on the use of fruit midges (Drosophila melanogaster) is being developed as a model organism to study the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.

In fact, the moscerino has a nervous system with many analogies compared to the human one in cellular and brain terms, and also the short life expectation of this species allows you to observe the entire course of the disease in reduced times, offering an opportunity to better understand the processes that lead to neuronal death.

We talked about these topics with Teresa Niccoli, a molecular biologist at the University College in London (UCL) in the research department dedicated to genetics, evolution and the environment, which for years has been studying how to make neurons more resilient to the accumulation of toxic proteins typical of dementia. Niccoli will also be among the protagonists of Wired Health 2025, to tell the behind the scenes of his research.

Teresa Niccoli, how strong - from a scientific point of view - the similarity between the fruit midges and human beings?

Teresa Niccoli, molecular biologist, Ucl Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment (Gee)

""The bond lies in the shared genetic and neurobiological characteristics, which make the moscerins a powerful model to study brain functions, development and neurological diseases. About 75% of human genes have a consideration in the midinian genome, including those involved in fundamental biological processes, such as brain development, neuronal function and even behavior. The same neurotransmitters - dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, etc. - for communication between neurons, and the mechanisms of the synapses are extremely similar.

""Despite being much simpler (100 thousand neurons compared to 86 billion of human beings), the brain of Drosophila has distinct regions with specialized functions, similar to human ones. For example, there are areas dedicated to the processing of sensory information - such as vision and sense of smell - motor control and even learning and memory. The so -called Mushroom Bodies, key structures in the brain. of the moscerino, they play a fundamental role in memory and learning processes, with some functional similarities with the human hippocampus.",wired

https://cnet.com,Is it okay to continue using your old smartphone? Risks and countermeasures you should know,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230298/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:45:00 GMT","Appleの「iPhone 16 Pro」とサムスンの「Galaxy S25 Ultra」には、現時点で最高水準のモバイル技術がつぎ込まれているが、その結果、どちらもかなり高価になっている。2025年現在で最上級のモデルが1000ドル（約15万円）を超えるとなれば、多くの人がもっと安価な選択肢を求めるは当然で、そうなると中古商品や旧モデルの購入を検討するのが有力な手段になってくる。中古品の購入は、新しいモバイル製品を手に入れる費用対効果の高い方法といえる。なにしろ、ハードウェア的には必要な機能を使うのに十分だし、端末を少しでも長く使い続ける方が、廃棄するよりずっと環境にやさしい。

だが、そのような古い端末は安価で済む反面、安全ではないおそれもある。旧型のスマートフォンは、搭載している「Android」や「iOS」が古くなっている可能性があり、その場合、ユーザーとデータを守るための重要なセキュリティアップデートが提供されなくなっていることが多い。最高のカメラ機能や最速のプロセッサーを望んでいるのでない限り、ハードウェア自体は問題なく使えることがほとんどだ。しかし、セキュリティがサポートされていないほど古いとなると、安全性は大幅に下がってしまう。セキュリティやプライバシーを心配しているのであれば（というより気にかけておくべきなので）、考慮すべき点を以下にまとめてみた。

モバイルOSのセキュリティパッチとは何か

ハッカーは、スマートフォンのソフトウェア上で悪用できる脆弱性や抜け穴を見つけようと、常に目を光らせている。新たな抜け穴が見つかった場合、スマートフォンメーカーは通常、それを修正し、悪用されないようにその修正プログラムをユーザーの端末に送信する。これがセキュリティパッチだ。サイバー犯罪者は終始スマートフォンのセキュリティをかいくぐる新しい手口を狙っているので、私たちがスマートフォンを使っている間、おそらく何度もこのセキュリティパッチを受け取っている。終わりのないいたちごっこのようなもので、ハッカーが抜け穴を見つけては、ソフトウェアプロバイダーがパッチを発行する、その繰り返しだ。

ほとんどの場合、自分の知らない間に行われているが、これこそスマートフォンを最新の状態に保ち、既知の脅威から保護してくれる仕組みだといえる。

スマホメーカーがセキュリティパッチを終了する理由

サムスン、ソニー、Google、OnePlusなど、すべてのメーカーは、スマートフォンを一定期間しかサポートしない。新しいモデルが登場するたび、Androidがバージョンアップするたびに、新しい脅威の評価とパッチの発行が必要になる。そこに要する作業は膨大であり、モデルごとに抜け穴をそれぞれ検出してパッチを発行するという作業を一定の年数より長く続けるのは、現実的に不可能になる。

その結果、Googleもスマートフォンメーカー各社も最終的に古い機種のサポートは打ち切らざるを得ない。そうなった端末はセキュリティアップデートが送られてこなくなるので、その機種で脅威が見つかったとしても、もはや修正されないのである。

旧型のスマホを使い続けるのは安全ではないのか

セキュリティインテリジェンス企業Lookoutのディレクターを務めるChristoph Hebeisen氏はこう説明している。「セキュリティパッチが提供されなくなったデバイスを使うのは安全とはいえない。セキュリティ上の重大な脆弱性は数週間ごと、あるいは毎月のように明らかになっているので、システムがサポートされなくなった時点で、そのシステムを使い続けるユーザーは、既知の脆弱性を悪用される可能性が高くなる」

Hebeisen氏によると、スマートフォンの脆弱性を放置した場合、スマートフォン上のあらゆる情報へのアクセスを許可した状態になってしまうおそれがあるという。個人のメールや勤務先のメール、連絡先、オンラインバンキングの詳細な情報、通話の音声などがその対象だ。そして、危険な状態になった端末を使い続ける限り、ハッカーはそうした情報にアクセスし続けるかもしれない。

自分のスマホが古いかどうかを判断する方法

自分のスマートフォンが今もサポート対象かどうか、セキュリティパッチが提供されているかどうかを確認するのは、容易でない場合も多い。まず、「設定」を開いてソフトウェアアップデートを確認し、利用可能な最新バージョンをインストールする。この段階で通常は、前回のアップデートがいつだったかを確認できる。OSは最新と表示されるが、そのインストールが何カ月も、あるいは何年も前である場合は、悪い知らせだ。そのスマートフォンは、おそらくもうサポートが終了している。

残念ながら、あるモデルのサポートを終了する時点でメーカーからの通知はない。したがって、自分自身で上述の不本意な結果に気づくか、あるいは何か別の方法を使って自分で調べるしかないのが現状だ。

以前は、スマートフォンのサポート期間は数年というのが普通だったが、幸いGoogleやサムスンなど多くの企業がその方針を改め、最新世代のスマートフォンについては最低7年のサポート期間を設けるようになった。Googleの最新モデル「Pixel 9」と「Pixel 9 Pro」は、セキュリティアップデートの提供が2031年8月まで続く。Appleの「iPhone XR」は、発売から6年経った今でも最新バージョンのiOSを利用できる。Fairphoneのように、最低8年間のサポートを保証しているメーカーもある。

ただし、サポート期間が長くなったのは最近の傾向なので、中古市場で旧型を購入する場合は、サポート期間が今よりも短い可能性もあり、すでにサポート期間が切れていることも考えられる。

自分のAndroid端末がサポートされているかどうかを確認するには、少し手間がかかる。サムスンは、筆者が同社の広報チームに連絡をとった結果、一覧表を送ってくれた。こちらのページでも公開されており、これを見れば現在どのモデルがアップデート対象かはひと目で分かる。ただし、そのアップデートがいつまで続くかは書かれていない。Googleでは、Pixelのモデルごとにセキュリティサポート終了時期が分かるページが用意されている（念のためお伝えしておくと、「Nexus」もPixelも、2021年モデルの「Pixel 5a」まで含めた旧モデルはすべてサポートが終了している）。使っているスマートフォンのメーカーのウェブサイトで、サポートページを検索するところから始めてみよう。

自分のスマートフォンが古くなっていても、すぐには気づかないかもしれない。OSが古くなっていることに気づきやすいのは、おそらく新しいアプリのダウンロードを試みるときだろう。端末のソフトウェアやハードウェアの制限から対応しなくなるアプリは多く、そうなると、そのアプリのインストールはできない。

スマホがハッキングされたことに気づく方法

仮に自分のスマートフォンのセキュリティが破られたとしても、それに気づくのは難しい。サイバー犯罪者はデバイスにアクセスした痕跡を露骨に残したりしないので、自分で兆候を探さなければならない。画面にポップアップが表示されたり、ダウンロードしていないのに突然アプリが出現したりするのは、大きな目印になる。

データ使用量が不意に増えたときも要注意だ。悪意のあるアプリがバックグラウンドで大量のデータを消費している兆候かもしれない。そのほか、バッテリーの使用量が増える、パフォーマンスが落ちるといった現象も目安になるが、そのどちらも経年劣化した旧型のハードウェアが原因という可能性もある。

古いスマホを使っている場合の対策

Hebeisen氏が言うように、サポート期間が切れたスマートフォンはとにかく使わないことが最も望ましい。お金に余裕がなく買い換えられない場合、あるいは何らかの理由で一時的に古いスマートフォンを使わざるを得ない場合には、安全策の足しになる手段がいくつかある。

まず、最新のソフトウェアがインストールされているかどうかを確認しよう。中古品を購入した場合は、必ず端末を出荷時の状態にリセットする。Androidの場合、アプリは必ず「Google Play」ストア（サードパーティーや非公式のアプリストアからではなく）からダウンロードする。ウェブサイトからAPKファイルをダウンロードしてアプリをインストールすることは避ける。APKファイルからのインストールは、不正なソフトウェアの侵入経路になりがちだからだ。

個人情報を保護するには、そもそも情報を過剰に入力しないようにすればよい。その端末ではオンラインバンキングを使わない、会社のメールアカウントと同期しない。そして、安全なデバイスをまた使えるようになるまで、きわどい画像や性的なビデオチャットを送るのは控えること（機械の上でも、性をめぐる安全を心がけるのは大切だ）。Hebeisen氏によると、このような対策を講じなかった場合は、「デバイス上で行われるあらゆることが攻撃者に監視されたり、操作されたりしてしまう可能性がある」という。恐ろしいことだが、これが現実なのだ。

https://cnet.com,Is the popularity of the Apple Watch going down? --Thinking about three factors and market changes,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230566/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","According to a new report from research firm Counterpoint, the smartwatch market has been declining for the first time. Smartwatch shipments fell 7% year-on-year in 2024, and this could be partly due to a sluggish Apple products.

According to the company, Apple Watch shipments fell 19% during the same period due to intensifying competition and weakening upgrade cycles.

In the report, senior research analyst Anshika Jain said: ""Despite the release of the Apple Watch Series 10, the Apple Watch lost momentum on the 10th anniversary (after the first model was released). The biggest factor was the North American market, with the lack of announcement of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the lack of enhancements to the Apple Watch Series 10, which forced consumers to refrain from purchasing.""

There are several reasons why Apple wearable devices have lost their appeal over the past year. The company faces a variety of factors that could potentially slow down the number of units shipped, including blood oxygen concentration sensors that could not escape patent disputes and intensify competition in the wearables field.

1. Blood oxygen sensor

In 2024, Apple lost to medical device manufacturer Masimo in a dispute over a patent for the blood oxygen sensor installed in its Apple Watch. For this reason, this feature is no longer available on Apple Watches sold by Apple in the US after January 18, 2024. This has attracted consumer dislike. The message board site ""Reddit"" has raised comments saying that they would consider purchasing an Apple Watch once the feature is back.

Meanwhile, competing products such as Huawei's ""HUAWEI WATCH D2"" are equipped with blood oxygen sensors. According to a report by Counterpoint, Huawei saw a 35% increase in shipments from the previous year.

2. Being a notification machine

A few weeks ago, I spoke to a friend at a tech event. In addition to his Apple Watch, he also wore a fitness tracker, ""Whoop."" When I asked why I was wearing both, I told them that while Whoop is good at tracking activity, recovery and monitoring health, the Apple Watch is used to receive notifications.

One of the uses of the Apple Watch is to understand the health of users. However, Apple has also developed a variety of functions to allow the Apple Watch to be used more widely as a health care device, as well as a small smartphone. For example, you can answer calls, send text messages, set timers and reminders, and use navigation in the maps app.

It doesn't have to be a modern Apple Watch if you want to perform these tasks. In fact, the same can be done with models a few generations ago, and these devices tend to have longer lifespans than smartphones. That could delay customers' purchases of the latest generation.",cnet

A product equipped with this is scheduled to be released in March.

Qualcomm released its first SoC for portable game consoles, the Snapdragon G3X, and has since released a new version every year. Smartphone games are still very popular today, but the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck demonstrate the performance of high-end portable devices, paving the way for similar portable game consoles to grow into a more mainstream niche, from small machines like the Analogue Pocket to high-performance models like Lenovo's Legion Go S.

Qualcomm's three new chips are targeted at different mobile game console categories. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 is for high-end models, the G2 Gen 2 is for standard models, and the G1 Gen 2 is for models that stream games primarily using cloud services. Just like traditional SoCs, it specializes in gaming, and has a different workload than Qualcomm's SoCs for other categories such as smartphones and PCs.

""The clear distinction between the mobile and portable gaming platforms is that portable gaming machines are dedicated machines and are based on long-term play,"" says Micah Knapp, head of business and product at Snapdragon Gaming Platforms. ""We have designed the entire platform, both software and hardware, to bring out peak performance while maintaining it for a long time.""

The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, the top-of-the-line lineup, has 30% CPU performance and 28% GPU performance compared to the previous year's model, and supports displays with a maximum QHD + resolution and a refresh rate of 144Hz. Furthermore, the Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3.

https://cnet.com,Tokyo Metro invests 3 billion yen by fiscal year 2027 - Accelerating co-creation with startups,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230623/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:04:00 GMT","Tokyo Metro has announced that it will launch Tokyo Metro Ventures as a corporate venture capital (CVC) that collaborates with startup companies and invests in its investments. A 3 billion yen investment quota will be established between 2025 and 2027.

Since 2016, the company has implemented an open innovation program that co-creates new value with external companies, mainly startups, and has invested in multiple companies. Based on this achievement, they will be instructing CVCs.

https://cnet.com,"Rings become ""little doctors"" -- Oura's CEO talks about the future of smart rings",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230085/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","筆者はスマートリング「Oura Ring」をかれこれ1年以上つけている。使い勝手を聞かれた時は、看板に偽りなしと言える珍しい製品だと答えることが多い。

Oura Ringは体調の悪化を予測し、心拍数の変動を検出し、朝食の写真をもとに食材を正確にリスト化し、身体的・精神的なストレスをリアルタイムで記録してくれる。初めてOura Ringをつけて空港のセキュリティチェックを通過したとき、「日中のストレス」の値が驚くほど跳ね上がったことを今でも覚えている。

Oura Ringとそのブランドは、広告通りに動くテクノロジーが生み出す魔法のような体験を体現する存在だ。このことを先日、Ouraの最高経営責任者（CEO）Tom Hale氏に伝えたところ、テクノロジー製品への期待値が低すぎないかと笑われた。そうかもしれない。Ouraは飽くなきイノベーションによって市場でのポジションを獲得した。その背中を今では多くのテクノロジーブランドが追う。

Ouraがスマートリングを初めて発売したのは2015年のことだ。一方、サムスンが初のスマートリングを発売したのは2024年だ。Appleがスマートリングを開発しているといううわさもあるが、仮に事実だったとしても、発売は早くて数カ月後、もしかしたら数年先になるかもしれない。他社がなんとか追いつこうとしている間に、Hale氏はさらに壮大な計画を描いている。それは、Oura Ringによって人々の健康を増進するというミッションだ。

医師が足りない

この大きなミッションの背景には、現代の医療システムが抱える問題、つまりプライマリケア（初期診療）を担う「かかりつけ医」が不足しているという状況がある。「人口に対する医師の数は過去最高の水準にあるのに、プライマリケアを提供する医師が足りていない」とHale氏は言う。

一人ひとりに合わせた予防的なケアを常時提供することで、Oura Ringは「コンシェルジュドクター」として、この問題の解決に貢献できるのではないか――。

このビジョンは、歩数や睡眠時間を記録するだけの従来のヘルストラッカーとは一線を画す。Ouraが目指しているのは単なる歩数計ではなく、パーソナライズされたかかりつけ医のような存在だ。

このビジョンに向けて、Ouraは精度の向上、プライバシー保護の強化、病気を予測し、休息を促す機能（例えば「症状レーダー」）の導入、医療機関との提携、ヘルスケア分野の有力ブランドの買収などを進めてきた。

「機械が守護天使、あるいは小さな医師のように自分を見守ってくれるという、この種のモデルの力によって、状況はがらっと変わるだろう」とHale氏は語る。

現在のOura Ringは、基本的には健康関連のデータを収集・記録できるウェアラブル製品にすぎないが、同社の目線は高い。2025年1月には民間医療保険プログラム「Medicare Advantage」を展開するEssence Healthcareと提携し、会員にOura Ringを無償で提供し、健康管理に役立ててもらう取組みを開始した。

会員はOura Ringのセットアップ時に、効率的なケアを受けるためにOura Ringが収集する健康データをEssenceのケア担当チームと共有するかどうかをたずねられる。この斬新なパートナーシップについて、Ouraのヘルスケア担当バイスプレジデントのJason Oberfest氏に話を聞いたところ、今後も代謝・心血管の健康や女性の健康といったカテゴリーで同様の提携を進める計画があるという。

プライバシーを最優先

新たな提携や機能の開発を進める一方で、Ouraは最近、一部のAI機能の処理を現在のクラウドベースからデバイス上での処理に変更することを発表した。これはAI企業webAIとのパートナーシップを通じて可能になったもので、処理とストレージの安全性と速度の向上が期待できるという。「ユーザーのデータをユーザーの健康増進以外の目的で使用する動機やインセンティブは当社にはない」とHale氏は言う。

多くの人はOuraをテクノロジー企業と認識しているかもしれないが、Hale氏はOuraを健康やヘルスケアのブランドに近いと考えているという。もちろん、Oura自体は医療機関ではないが、医療サービスを提供しているさまざまな組織と提携している。

そのため、Ouraが掲げるプライバシーポリシーや基準は非常に厳しく、安全性を追求したものでなければならない。現在のようにAIが急速に進化している不確実性の高い状況では、これは非常に重要な意味を持つ。「当社のような企業には、規制の整備を待たずに正しい行動を取ることが求められる」とHale氏は語る。

テクノロジーからヘルスケアへ――Ouraブランドが目指す進化は、IT業界全体で進んでいる大きなトレンドとも符合する。Apple傘下のイヤホンブランドBeatsは最近、心拍センサーを搭載したワークアウト用イヤホン「Powerbeats Pro 2」を発表した。ウェアラブルブランドのWithingsは2025年1月、ユーザーの心臓関連のデータを認定心臓専門医に送り、医療レビューとフィードバックを受けられる「Cardio Check-Up」を発表した。

2024年にはAppleが「AirPods Pro 2」に聴力チェック機能を追加し、「Apple Watch Series 10」と「Apple Watch Ultra 2」に睡眠時無呼吸症候群の検出機能を搭載した。どちらの機能も2024年に米国食品医薬品局（FDA）の認可を受けており、収集したデータは診断や治療の参考資料として医師に提供できる。

なぜテクノロジー企業はこぞって健康機能に力を入れているのだろうか。Hale氏の意見はこうだ。Oura Ringのようなウェアラブルデバイスは常時身につけ、計測を続けることを前提としているので、かかりつけ医による30分間の診察やバイタル測定では捉えきれない、多面的な健康データを入手できる。

技術自体の精度も上がり、医療レベルに近づきつつあるため、診察に取り入れる医療機関も増えつつある。こうした要因と、コロナ危機によって露呈した米国の医療システムのもろさ、他の富裕国の平均2倍に達する医療費などを考え合わせると、テクノロジー企業が健康機能に注力する理由が見えてくる。

持ち運べる小さな医師

2024年、Ouraは代謝の健康に特化したプログラムを提供するVeriを買収し、持続血糖モニター（CGM）を製造するDexcomとの戦略的提携を発表した。

CGMは、もともとは糖尿病やインスリン抵抗症の患者だけが使うものだったが、現在は健康管理ツールとしても人気が高い。腕につけるだけで、食事が身体に与える影響を瞬時にデータ化してくれるからだ。CGMは食事やストレス、運動に対する反応は人によって違うことを証明しているとHale氏は言う。

Oura Ringが個人の睡眠や活動量を分析し、パーソナライズされた情報を提供するように、CGMは食事がエネルギーや身体に与える影響を教えてくれる。CGMの最大のポイントは、健康を増進する方法は人によって違うということだ。

「何世紀もの間、科学は『平均値』に基づいて展開されてきた」と、Hale氏は言う。「しかし、今後は『N-of-1』が大きな力を持つようになる」(N-of-1は、1人を対象に最適な解決策や診断を見つける臨床試験のこと）

「どう呼ぶにせよ、この『持ち運べる小さな医師』というビジョンは、遅かれ早かれ実現すると考えている。一気に起きるわけではないし、世界中で同時に起きるわけでもない。しかし、確実に実現しつつある」とHale氏は言う。

「これは世界で起きている重大な問題、つまり人々が十分な医療を受けられていないという問題の解決につながる。このプロセスに少しでも貢献したい。人々が信頼し、安心できる形で役に立ちたい。それが当社のビジョンだ」

https://cnet.com,"""USB-C"" cable that I can no longer let go--Ideal for people who travel and business trips [Mini Review]",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230601/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:19:00 GMT","I've tried countless USB-C cables so far, but sometimes I come across products that I find ""it's great.""

Many USB-C cables have connectors on the straight cable, which is standard, but they often feel inconvenient when used in practice. A particularly problematic problem is that the connector part, including the stress buffer (strain relief), protrudes from the device by a few centimeters. If you try to use it in a small space, this protrusion will surprisingly become in the way.

In my experience, this issue was particularly serious in hotels. The only outlet is located near the desk or bed, often with very little space for cables to be plugged in. It was a lot of trouble, as I moved heavy furniture many times, forced it into an outlet on the wall, putting a strain on the cable.

On the other hand, the solution is simple: use a cable with an L-shaped (right angle) connector. I tried using Ugreen's ""Right Angle USB-C to USB-C Cable"" on a few weeks of travel, but I was convinced I couldn't let it go.

UGREEN USB C L-shaped Cable PD 100W (Check price on Amazon)



The cable is three types of length (approximately 1m, 2m, and 3m) and the surface is woven from nylon material, making it resistant to friction and tangles. I've already taken it to many countries, but it looks just like new. It supports outputs of up to 100W, making it powerful enough to use your MacBook Pro while you're traveling while you're still charging it.

The highlight of this product is that the USB-C connector on one side is at a right angle.

This L-shaped connector is very helpful when using cables in travel destinations or in tight spaces, and is even more comfortable when using on a smartphone or tablet. When operating the device while charging, it is much easier to hold than a regular USB-C connector sticks out sideways, and there is a reduced risk of it breaking or getting caught.

I'm also happy that it is designed to be slightly longer so that it can be inserted even when you have a thick case attached to your smartphone. Also, as mentioned above, I have been using it for a few weeks, but there are no problems such as the cable itself being weak or not being able to charge it properly, and it is a cable that is reasonably priced and I can recommend it.

https://cnet.com,"SAP Japan announces ""Business Data Cloud"" -- Generation AI also deploys consulting functions",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230645/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:36:00 GMT","SAPジャパンは3月18日、2月にグローバルで発表した新たなマネージド型クラウドサービス「SAP Business Data Cloud」（関連記事）に関する説明会を開き、同サービスを第2四半期から一般提供すると発表した。また、第2四半期では生成AIアシスタントの「Joule」で、SAPコンサルタント向けの機能を提供することも明らかにした。



SAP Business Data Cloudの構成概要（SAPジャパン説明資料より） SAP Business Data Cloudの構成概要（SAPジャパン説明資料より）

既報の通りBusiness Data Cloudは、あらゆるSAPのシステムのデータおよび非SAPシステムのデータも統合、集約し、各種データをSAPのアプリケーションやAIで利用できるためのデータプラットフォームになる。このために同社は、Databricksとも協業している。

説明したSAPジャパン Business Data Cloud ソリューションアドバイザリー部 ソリューションアドバイザーエキスパートの椛田后一氏によると、同サービスは、異なるシステムが持つデータをAIが理解できるよう整合性を確保する役割を担うとのこと。SAP Business Data Cloudは、大きく「ビジネスデータファブリック」「Insight Apps」「データプロダクト」で構成されている。

まず中心となるが、ビジネスデータファブリックだという。SAPはデータの統合・管理の「SAP Datasphere」やデータ分析の「SAP Analytics Cloud」も提供しているが、Business Data Cloudでは、この2つをビジネスデータファブリックに組み込み、「SAP S/4HANA」のデータや非SAPシステムのデータをSAP DatasphereでS/4HANAの「Core Data Services」（CDS）のモデルに再現。そのデータを例えば、SAP Analytics Cloudで可視化するといった利用を実現する。

次にデータプロダクトは、マスターデータやトランザクションデータ、オブジェクトデータ、アナリティクスデータなどユースケースに応じたデータセットのカタログになり、ユーザーはカタログから目的のデータセットを選択することで、容易かつ速やかに利用を始められるとのこと。S/4HANAなどのシステムと同期し、S/4HANAでのデータの変更などはリアルタイムにデータプロダクトにも反映されるという。

また、「SAP Knowledge Graph」というナレッジグラフ機能も提供する。ビジネスデータの関係性をナレッジグラフとして容易に構造化、保持でき、そのコンテキストなどを生成AIエージェントなどに活用したりもできるとする。データの正確性を担保することでAIのハルシネーション（誤情報生成）を減少できるとしている。

Insight Appsでは、あらゆるSAPアプリケーションの一貫した可視性をユーザーに提供するダッシュボード機能になる。各種基幹業務や人的資源管理、支出管理、顧客分析、サプライチェーン分析といった業務で正確性の高い洞察を提供し、ユーザーはテンプレートを用いて、すぐに目的に応じた利用を開始できるという。

Business Data Cloudの各種機能の高度な利用や、そのケイパビリティーを引き出す上で重要な点がDatabricksとの連携だという。これによりユーザーは、Databricksのデータ基盤で管理しているデータをゼロコピーでBusiness Data Cloudから利用できるようになり、機械学習技術を生かした洞察の獲得といったことを透過的に実現、ネイティブに近い形で利用できるようになるとした。

なお椛田氏は、Business Data Cloudでは、「SAP Business Warehouse」（SAP BW）の機能も組み込んでいると説明。SAP BWは、実質的に旧来製品の位置付けにある。椛田氏によれば、SAP BWをオンプレミス環境で使用中のユーザーは、まずSAP BWの稼働基盤をクラウドに移行（リフト）し、次にBusiness Data Cloudと連携を開始して、適用範囲を拡大していく。同氏は、既存のSAP BWの資産を生かしつつBusiness Data Cloudへ順次移行することを推奨していると明言した。

また、SAPのクラウドオファリングとなる「GROW with SAP」と「RISE with SAP」でもBusiness Data Cloudと同等機能が順次提供されていくという。

説明会では、常務執行役員 最高事業責任者の堀川嘉朗氏がSAPジャパンのAI戦略の概況などに触れた。同社は、2月に開催した2025年のビジネス戦略説明会で代表取締役社長の鈴木洋史氏が「AIファースト、スイートファースト」という方向性を示した。

堀川氏は、これを踏まえて日本市場向けにもAIの提供範囲を順次拡大しているなどと強調。特に2025年は、AIエージェントの拡充と推進、展開を重点施策の1つに位置付けており、堀川氏は、Jouleにおいて、2025年第1四半期にSAPアプリケーション開発者向け機能、同第2四半期からSAPコンサルタント向け機能をそれぞれ提供すると述べた。

開発者向け機能では、開発者が機能要件などをJouleに入力するだけで、Jouleが「Advanced Business Application Programming」（ABAP）の推奨コードを自動生成してくれる。開発生産性の大幅な向上が期待されるという。

SAPコンサルタント向け機能では、パートナーなどのSAPコンサルタントが顧客からヒアリングなどにより得た要件をJouleに入力するだけで、Jouleがベストプラクティスなどに基づいて顧客要件に最適化したSAPシステムの設計、構成、実装支援などを行う。堀川氏は、これによってSAPシステムにまつわるプロジェクトの形が大きく変わると強調した。

堀川氏は、こうしたSAPジャパンのAI推進においてもBusiness Data Cloudが重要な位置付けになるなどと説明している。",cnet

https://cnet.com,PFU improves ScanSnap Cloud service operation with observability,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230638/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:35:00 GMT","PFU (Kahoku City, Ishikawa Prefecture) has adopted the observability platform ""New Relic"" for monitoring, operation and maintenance of ScanSnap Cloud, a cloud service for the document scanner ""ScanSnap."" New Relic announced it on March 18th.

ScanSnap Cloud provides services to approximately 40 countries around the world from three regions of Microsoft Azure: Japan, North America and Europe, and during its peak, 650 online processing occurs per minute. Before New Relic was introduced, experienced engineers used their own ""problem detection approach"" and ""situation and troubleshooting,"" but after implementation, real-time understanding of customer experiences has been made possible, making problem resolution faster.

ScanSnap Cloud's service infrastructure system has rapidly become more complicated due to the increase in users, expansion of functions, expansion of linked cloud services, and the shift to microservice architecture. Therefore, if an unknown problem occurs, it takes time to resolve the problem.

For example, engineers have used their own ""problem detection approach"" and ""confirming the situation and troubleshooting"" by noticing a user's complaints when confirming posts on social media, and then associating a large number of logs to solve the problem. With the introduction of New Relic, it is now possible to understand customer experiences in real time, allowing you to quickly resolve any issues that affect service quality.

Furthermore, by utilizing New Relic, the monitoring, operation and maintenance capabilities of the entire team have been improved. By incorporating the knowledge of veteran engineers into New Relic, even inexperienced members can operate on the same level. This allows you to instantly grasp processing delays and outages in ScanSnap Cloud, and quickly identify the causes that are exacerbating the customer experience. As a result, the work from problem detection to initial investigation is almost completely gone, and the system patrol task, which previously took half a day, is no longer necessary.

In operational operations, we can now spend our efforts on efforts to improve customer experience and operational efficiency, such as New Relic's dashboard and script development, and on technology inheritance.",cnet
https://cnet.com,"Qualtrics announces ""Experience Agents"" AI agent -- Accelerating customer response improvements",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230633/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT","AI agents can be said to be the next frontline for AI assistants, as they not only answer questions but also perform tasks. By deploying AI agents, Qualtrics aims to help its technology interact directly with customers and improve the customer experience (CX).

On March 17th, Qualtrics announced its AI agent, Qualtrics Experience Agents, ahead of its own event, the X4 2025 Experience Management Summit (18th-20th), to be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. This is an assistant function that involves interacting with customers and quickly and empathizes with them, and understands and resolves issues.

""Our approach is how we can expand what our customers are already using and enable businesses to respond to every interaction,"" Brad Anderson, president of product, user experience (UX) and engineering at Qualtrics, told ZDNET.

Experience Agents operate at a variety of customer contact points, including surveys, contact center interactions, and posting product reviews. The agent aims to complete a series of customer feedback processes by instantly providing answers that are appropriate for individual requirements.

Qualtrics cited examples of sports fans giving feedback on how slow food service was being provided during games. Experience Agents can interact with their fans, understand issues and respond individually.

At the briefing before the presentation, I had the opportunity to see Experience Agents running. During the demonstration, a customer from an airline provided additional feedback on issues they received in a Qualtrics survey, and the author was impressed by the agent's speed and quality of responses. The answers are not only quick but also empathetic, and it can be said that the quality of customer service is high, which is often overlooked by traditional chatbots and even experts.

A major feature of Experience Agents is that they not only streamline internal processes, but also interact directly with customers and ensure that they provide a better experience. In the future, Qualtrics aims to develop agents that predict customer needs based on past interactions with employees and internal industry expertise.

When asked about the possibility that client companies might hesitate to interact with their customers directly, Anderson said, ""We value accuracy and have a team working on AI ethics and safety measures."" Qualtrics has published many of its research on its dedicated page, ""Trust Center,"" to dispel concerns from its client companies.",cnet
https://techcrunch.com,"Nvidia debuts Groot N1, a foundation model for humanoid robotics",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/nvidia-debuts-groot-n1-a-foundation-model-for-humanoid-robotics/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Nvidia is releasing what it’s calling an AI foundation model for humanoid robotics.

Announced at GTC 2025 in San Jose, the model, dubbed Groot N1, is a “generalist” model, trained on both synthetic and real data. Nvidia claims that Groot N1 features a “dual system architecture” for “thinking fast and slow,” inspired by human cognitive processes.

Groot N1 is an evolution of Nvidia’s Project Groot, which the company launched at its GTC conference last year. Project Groot was geared toward on industrial use cases, but Groot N1 broadens the focus to humanoid robots in a range of different form factors.

Groot N1’s slow thinking system lets a robot perceive and reason about its environment and instructions, and then plan the right actions to take, according to Nvidia. As for the fast thinking system, it translates the aforementioned plan into robotic actions, including actions that involve manipulating objects over multiple steps.

Groot N1 is available in open source. Alongside the model, Nvidia is releasing simulation frameworks and blueprints for generating synthetic training data.

“The age of generalist robotics is here,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

Humanoid robots have attracted a lot of publicity in recent years. Companies like X1 and Figure are attempting to create general-purpose robots that move more or less like humans. The challenges are formidable, but these companies claim that technology has reached the point where mass-produced humanoid robotic systems are a realistic near-term goal.

The many disappointments in recent robotics history suggest that will be easier said than achieved.

https://techcrunch.com,Here’s why Google pitched its $32B Wiz acquisition as ‘multicloud’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/heres-why-google-pitched-its-32b-wiz-acquisition-as-multicloud/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Tuesday’s big news that Google is acquiring security startup Wiz for a record-breaking $32 billion comes with a very big qualifier. Google says it will position Wiz as a “multicloud” offering, meaning Wiz will not be a Google-only shop.

The reality is that Google had no choice but to do this, and a closer look at the reasons behind the decision also highlights Google’s weak spots in the months ahead.

Customer retention

Wiz brings a massive customer list to Google. As of today, the startup has already reached an annual revenue rate of $700 million. Before the news broke on Tuesday, it was on track for that to grow to $1 billion.

“Before the news broke” is the operative phrase here. Google and Wiz surely hope the acquisition will create an interesting new funnel of customers and revenue, but first and foremost, both will need to ensure they keep existing customers from shopping around for another security provider.

Many of these customers already use a hybrid cloud arrangement and may not use Google Cloud at all. One of the key reasons some of them chose Wiz in the first place was its ability to support multiple cloud platforms.

If Google cuts off that ability, it risks alienating those users.

That’s why Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport and other senior leaders were calling customers in the hours leading up to the deal, reassuring them that it’s just business as usual.

Antitrust regulation

When news broke last summer that Alphabet/Google was looking to acquire Wiz, speculation quickly followed about the regulatory challenges of pushing such a large deal through. Google has been under intense antitrust scrutiny for years, particularly for its dominance in areas like search, mobile operating systems, and advertising.

The regulatory climate has shifted since. The U.S. under President Trump has yet to hear a major antitrust case, and there are mixed opinions about how his administration’s take will approach Big Tech. Some believe that big tech companies will still face roadblocks; others think the big-deal window is open once again.

“That Google feels able to contemplate big M&A again seems big in itself,” said one source. “Do they think they have the Trump administration on its side?”

Meanwhile, in smaller but still influential markets like the U.K., regulators have recently taken a more favorable stance on Big Tech as part of a broader push to signal that “the U.K. is open for business.” So-called hyperscalers may see this as an opportunity to emerge from the shadows a little more.

Even if the regulatory climate remains tricky for Big Tech M&A, Google’s “multicloud” positioning can come in handy. Cloud services and cybersecurity are emphatically not two area where Google dominates right now, so this deal alone might not raise antitrust alarm bells.

If regulators are scrutinizing Google’s overall dominance, emphasizing Wiz’s ability to work across different cloud platforms could help Google’s argue that it supports competition.

Google Cloud just can’t catch up to AWS and Azure

The final reason Google had to embrace the multicloud model is simple: many customers just don’t and won’t use Google Cloud. As of Q4 2024, Statista data shows that AWS had a 30% share of the global cloud market, with Azure in second place with 21%. Google Cloud trails significantly behind them at 12%.

Why is Google so far behind? Some say it’s because AWS got an earlier start in the field. Some say that Microsoft’s enterprise dominance and strong ecosystem — including its OpenAI partnership — have given it an edge. Google lacks both advantages.

A couple of years ago, people wondered if Google might close the gap, given its cloud offerings were comparable to AWS and Azure.

“Google Cloud has always been a bit of a mystery when it comes to their position in third place in cloud infrastructure market share,” former TC writer Ron Miller tells TC today. “They run the largest cloud applications in the world, yet have had trouble translating that into products for enterprise customers.”

He thinks that changed under Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian. “He has much more credibility with enterprise customers,” says Miller. “They have been growing fast the last couple of years and have a pretty substantial business but still way behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of revenue.”

During an investor call on Tuesday, Kurian emphasized that Google pursued Wiz because of its multicloud capabilities, saying: “Multicloud is something our customers want. Our commitment to multicloud means that new IT projects an organization does with Google Cloud can work with their existing IT investments, and allows them to choose different vendors for products in the future. Customer don’t want to be locked into one vendor.”

But Kurian also thinks that AI might change the game.

AI architectures might cause large enterprises to pool data from multiple places to a central cloud provider, Kurian said. If that happens, then multicloud protection may become less critical,but security for their centralized cache of data will be.



Until then, multicloud is the pitch to “help customers identify, protect and defend against cyber threats across all major clouds and even in on-premise systems,” Kurian said.

Now we will see if regulators, and end users, buy into it.",techcrunch

Perhaps the most significant is Vera Rubin. Vera Rubin, which is set to be released in the second half of 2026, will feature tens of terabytes of memory and a custom Nvidia-designed CPU called Vera. Vera Rubin delivers substantial performance uplifts compared to its predecessor, Grace Blackwell, Nvidia claims, particularly on AI inferencing and training tasks.

When paired with Vera, Rubin — which is two GPUs in one, technically — can manage up to 50 petaflops while doing inference (i.e. running AI models), more than double the 20 petaflops for Nvidia’s current Blackwell chips. Moreover, Vera is about twice as fast as the CPU used in Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell GPU.

Rubin will be followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027, a collection of four GPUs in a single package delivering up to 100 petaflops of performance.

On the near horizon — H2 2025 — Nvidia will release Blackwell Ultra, a GPU that’ll come in several configurations. A single Ultra chip will offer the same 20 petaflops of AI performance as Blackwell, but with 288GB of memory — up from 192GB in vanilla Blackwell.

On the far horizon are Feynman GPUs. Huang during the keynote gave few details about Feynman’s architecture, named after American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman — save that it features a Vera CPU. Nvidia plans to bring Feynman, which will succeed Rubin Vera, to market sometime in 2028.",techcrunch

The publication surveyed 1,230 owners on their EV charging experiences between March 2024 and February 2024, and just 4% of the respondents said they experienced problems at Tesla’s Supercharger network. Only 5% said they experienced problems using Rivian’s Adventure Network chargers.

Owners had the worst experience with Shell’s Recharge network, having reported a problem 48% of the time. EVgo and Blink chargers were similarly troublesome, with owners experiencing problems 43% and 41% of the time, respectively. Other well-known networks didn’t perform too well, either, with owners logging problems at Electrify America 35% of the time and at ChargePoint chargers 24% of the time. Rivian and Tesla were the only networks in single digits.

EVs made up more than 8% of vehicle sales in the U.S. last year, according to Cox Automotive, and while sales growth has cooled, overall volume is still growing. People are increasingly embracing electric vehicles, but it’s clear from Consumer Reports’ survey that many of the charging networks meant to support that adoption are lagging way behind. Representatives for Shell, EVgo, Blink, Electrify America, and ChargePoint didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Consumer Reports said that the most common reported problems across all networks had to do with making payments and with the charging station hardware itself — especially with the screens.

“By calling out broken screens, payment issues, and slow charging power, community members are crowdsourcing data that will hold charging networks accountable and improve drivers’ experience with public charging,” Consumer Reports’ campaign manager Drew Toher said in a statement.

Tesla has been building out its Supercharger network for over a decade now, so it’s not surprising that it has hammered out a lot of the issues that still plague many of these other companies. And that’s great news for non-Tesla EV owners or prospective buyers, since the company has opened up the Supercharger network to essentially all other electric vehicles.

What is a bit surprising is that Rivian is apparently matching Tesla when it comes to reliability, at least based on these respondents’ experiences. That means it’s off to a great start with its first 100 stations. But it will be up to Rivian to maintain that quality as it attempts to build the other 500 stations it has planned for North America.",techcrunch

Virtual cameras are tools often used in digital filmmaking and 3D animation to capture and navigate scenes in real time. With Stable Virtual Camera, Stability sought to add generative AI to the mix to deliver greater control and customizability, the company said in a blog post.

Stable Virtual Camera generates “novel views” of a scene from one or more images (up to 32 total) at camera angles that a user specifies. The model can generate videos that travel along “dynamic” camera paths or presets, including “Spiral,” “Dolly Zoom,” “Move,” and “Pan.”

The current version of Stable Virtual Camera, a research preview, can generate videos in square (1:1), portrait (9:16), and landscape (16:9) aspect ratios up to 1,000 frames in length. Stability warns the model may produce lower-quality results in certain scenarios, however, particularly with images featuring humans, animals, or “dynamic textures” like water.

“Highly ambiguous scenes, complex camera paths that intersect objects or surfaces, and irregularly-shaped objects can cause flickering artifacts,” Stability notes in its blog post, “especially when target viewpoints differ significantly from the input images.”

Stable Virtual Camera is available for research use under a noncommercial license. It can be downloaded from the AI dev platform Hugging Face.

Stability, the beleaguered firm behind the popular image-generation model Stable Diffusion, raised new cash last year as investors including Eric Schmidt and Napster founder Sean Parker sought to turn the business around. Emad Mostaque, Stability’s co-founder and ex-CEO, reportedly mismanaged Stability into financial ruin, leading staff to resign, a partnership with Canva to fall through, and investors to grow concerned about the company’s prospects.

In the last few months, Stability has hired a new CEO, appointed “Titanic” director James Cameron to its board of directors, and released several new image generation models. Earlier in March, the company teamed up with chipmaker Arm to bring an AI model that can generate audio including sound effects to mobile devices running Arm chips.

U.S. District Judge James Bredar last week ordered the Trump administration to reinstate employees laid off across a number of U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

The ruling focuses on federal probationary employees, which includes workers who were hired or promoted within the past three years. CISA fired 130 probationary employees in February, as part of the Trump administration’s broad push to slash the federal workforce.

CISA is now seeking to contact the since-fired employees, according to a message displayed on CISA’s website. The message indicates the agency doesn’t have contact information for all of the former employees it fired — or isn’t aware of all the staffers who were affected by the cuts.

“CISA is making every effort to individually contact all impacted individuals,” the message reads, adding that fired employees who believe they fall under the court’s order to “please reach out.”

Per the website notice, CISA is asking affected former staffers to email a “password protected attachment that provides your full name, your dates of employment (including date of termination), and one other identifying factor such as date of birth or social security number.”

The cyber agency is also reportedly asking for the password to be sent by email to the same mailbox.

When asked by TechCrunch if this was accurate, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey declined to comment.

CISA has confirmed that re-hired employees will be immediately placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits.

Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who announced the partnership Tuesday during his keynote at the company’s GTC conference in San Jose, said the time for autonomous vehicles has arrived.

“We’re looking forward to building with GM AI in all three areas,” he said on stage. “AI for manufacturing, so they can revolutionize the way they manufacture; AI for enterprise, so they can revolutionize the way they work to design cars and simulate cars, and then also AI for in the car.”



The deal means Nvidia will provide AI infrastructure — essentially GPUs — for GM as well as help the automaker build its own AI, according to Huang.

Nvidia has a decades-long relationship with the automotive and autonomous vehicle industry, supplying GPUs to companies like Tesla, Wayve, and Waymo for use in data centers or their vehicles. Nvidia has also developed an autonomous vehicle platform for automakers that includes an operating system called DriveOS to provide real-time AI processing and integration of advanced driving and cockpit features. Toyota announced earlier this year plans to equip next-generation vehicles with automated driving capabilities powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin supercomputer and safety-focused operating system, DriveOS.

“We work with the car industry however the car industry would like us to work with them,” Huang said during the keynote. “We build all three computers: the training computer, the simulation computer, and the robotics computer (the self-driving car computer) — all the software stack that sits on top of it, the models and algorithms just as we do with all of the other industries that I’ve demonstrated.”



GM plans to work with Nvidia to build custom AI systems using several of the tech giant’s products. GM did not disclose the financial value of the deal.

GM will use Nvidia Omniverse with Cosmos to train AI manufacturing models to help it improve help it build next-generation factories and robotics. Using Omniverse, GM will be able to build a digital twin of its factories — and even assembly lines — to virtually test new production processes without disrupting existing vehicle production. The effort will include training robotics platforms GM is already using for operations such as material handling and transport, and precision welding.

The automaker will also use Nvidia Drive AGX for its in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences. The automaker recently stopped funding its commercial robotaxi development business in a pivot that has shifted resources towards its hands-off advanced driver assistance system known as Super Cruise. GM is in the process of absorbing its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise and combining it with its own efforts to develop driver assistance features — and eventually fully autonomous personal vehicles.

GM’s relationship with Nvidia isn’t new. The Detroit-based automaker has used Nvidia GPUs to train AI models for simulation and validation. The expanded deal now includes using Nvidia AI products to focus on improving automotive plant design and operations.",techcrunch

He’s launching his own startup, focused on a different problem for online shoppers: what he calls “check-in.”

When you click on an ad for something like a T-shirt, the experience afterward can feel a little clunky. The website you land on might not even have the product you clicked on to begin with. That causes many shoppers to bounce back, hurting conversion rates, Kuruvilla told TechCrunch.

Kuruvilla wants to change that with AI. His new startup, Spangle AI, creates custom landing pages for shoppers based on what they searched for or clicked on. It sells to major retailers looking to better monetize their traffic and is powered by an AI model called ProductGPT that decodes customer interactions.

Based in Seattle, Spangle AI raised a $6 million seed round last year, it told TechCrunch. Its investors include Seattle-based Madrona Ventures and Streamlined Ventures, which is in Silicon Valley.

Spangle AI joins a host of other e-commerce startups who sell AI to customize online shopping experiences and improve conversions. Vancouver, B.C.,-based Unbounce, which sells no-code landing pages, raised almost $40 million in 2020 while Dubai-based Qeen.AI raised $10 million earlier this month for its smart shopping assistants.

It’s still early in Spangle AI’s journey, but the startup claims to be seeing promising signs from its product, which has boosted conversion rates by 51% in early testing. Armed with its product and these case studies, Spangle AI says it will now focus mostly on sales.

Kuruvilla was Bolt’s CEO for two years and previously worked for almost eight years at Amazon. He replaced Bolt’s outspoken co-founder Ryan Breslow in 2022 after Breslow’s fiery Twitter tirade against Y Combinator.

That didn’t end the drama for Breslow, though, after he was sued by Bolt investors over a $30 million personal loan he took out of Bolt. Breslow has since returned as CEO, defended the loan as a vote of confidence in Bolt, and announced that Bolt’s legal troubles are over.

Kuruvilla, who jokingly announced on X that he had “one-click checked out” from Bolt when he left last year, is looking ahead. “I just love e-commerce and I love solving hard problems,” he told TechCrunch.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Pebble creator unveils two new Pebble-inspired smartwatches,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/pebble-creator-unveils-the-first-new-pebble-inspired-smartwatches/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","It looks like a Pebble, it works like a Pebble, but don’t call it a Pebble. Eric Migicovsky, the original creator of the Pebble smartwatch, just unveiled two new smartwatches — called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2.

These spiritual successors to the Pebble smartwatches are available for preorder, costing $149 and $225, respectively.

If you aren’t familiar with Pebble, the Palo Alto-based startup was one of the first breakthrough successes of the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform — all the way back in 2012. The company created smartwatches before the Apple Watch and Android-based smartwatches existed.

While Pebble managed to sell over 2 million devices, the company abruptly closed in 2016. After an insolvency process, what was left was acquired by rival Fitbit (now a division of Google, of course).

Fast-forward to 2024, Migicovsky had a bold idea: What if we could go back to those simpler times and simpler tech devices? What if we could bring back the spirit of the Pebble?

Google has been surprisingly helpful in this process, as the tech giant is open sourcing PebbleOS, the operating system that powered the original Pebble smartwatches.

While Google acquired Fitbit a few years after Fitbit acquired Pebble’s assets, it turns out that Pebble’s IP wasn’t worth much to Google, so the company decided to give it back to the community of Pebble enthusiasts.

Now, Core Devices, Migicovsky’s new company, has unveiled two new smartwatches that will run PebbleOS.

The Core 2 Duo is essentially a new Pebble 2 running the original Pebble software.

It has an always-on E Ink display with a few buttons on the side of the device. Compared to other 2025 smartwatches, it’s pretty basic. That E Ink screen is a non-touch, black-and-white display. But the smartwatch supports alarms and timers — groundbreaking, I know.

The wearable pairs with your phone using Bluetooth so that it can display notifications and connect to the internet. You can also control the music on your phone thanks to the Bluetooth connection.

But the two things that made the Pebble stand out from its successors are still true today. First, the battery life is excellent. The company promises up to 30 days of battery life. Second, it’s a fun, hackable device. There are thousands of watch faces, and it’s easy to create small apps for the device.

“This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches,” Migicovsky wrote in a blog post announcing the devices. “There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like.”

“The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile 🙂,” he added.

The other smartwatch Migicovsky’s company announced today, the Core Time 2, essentially shares the same specifications as the Core 2 Duo, but it has a bigger, 64-color display in a metal casing. It’s also a touch display, but Pebble apps don’t support touch interactions for now.

Migicovsky says shipments for the Core 2 Duo should start in July.

The Core Time 2 will take a bit longer to produce and ship; it’s slated to be available in December.",techcrunch

The company’s parent company Alphabet is buying Wiz, the cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash transaction. The deal has now been confirmed.

A source described the transaction as a $33 billion deal previously. That includes the $1 billion that Google is paying out on top of the acquisition price in the form of retention bonuses to make sure everyone stays on post-acquisition. With 1,700 people working at the company, that works out on average to more than $588,000 per employee (actual numbers likely to go up and down depending on their respective salaries).

Wiz will remain an independent platform that will work across all cloud providers, not just Google Cloud Platform. There will be more hiring to expand the business, and likely more acquisitions, which is something Wiz has been working to do for the last year.

Our sources tell us that Wiz is at $700 million in annual recurring revenue at the moment. The deal is being described to us as akin to the one between LinkedIn and Microsoft, in terms of autonomy within the bigger organization. (It should be noted that LinkedIn does use a lot of Microsoft services, and has increased that over time, so perhaps that’s a more meaningful analogy than was intended.)

The deal will still need regulatory and other approvals before closing, which the companies expect will be in 2026. Previously, Google’s biggest acquisition had been buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2011.

This acquisition has been on-again off-again for nearly a year. Talks appeared to revive again this week at a $30 billion price tag.

Thomas Kurian — the CEO of Google Cloud — is in Europe at the moment, and Assaf Rappaport, the CEO of New York-based Wiz, is currently in Israel. From what we understand, Kurian was leading on this deal, and Wiz will come under his wing, spearheading a major push into cloud security for the company.

“Google Cloud and Wiz share a joint vision to make cybersecurity more accessible and simpler to use for organizations of any size and industry,” he said in a statement today. “Enabling more companies to prevent cyber attacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents.”

Some backstory. Last year, Google offered to buy Wiz for $23 billion, but the talks fell apart, sources say over concerns about antitrust issues, Wiz’s autonomy for development under Google Cloud and potentially even the price tag. At the time of the deal talks, Wiz was valued at $12 billion based on a $1 billion funding round earlier in the year.

In the interim, there is now a new U.S. President and some believe the new regulatory regime will usher in a more favorable climate for big tech acquisitions that might have previously been roadblocked.

For its part, Google has been interested scooping up Wiz to turbo charge in two areas: enterprise cloud, a business where it continues to lag behind AWS and Microsoft Azure; and security, an area where it does offer some products (Mandiant being one key part of that) but nothing on the size, scale, or growth trajectory of Wiz.

Wiz is particularly attractive because it’s coming to Google Cloud with an existing, massive business in tow. It is currently on track to double last year’s annual recurring revenue to $1 billion.

A Wiz acquisition also works to potentially complement, or even offset, whatever rises and falls might come to the other major area where Alphabet is placing bets: AI.

“The increased role of AI, and adoption of cloud services, have dramatically changed the security landscape for customers, making cybersecurity increasingly important in defending against emergent risks and protecting national security,” Google noted in its announcement today.

Not long after the deal initially fell apart in 2024, Wiz ran a secondary sale at a $16 billion valuation, meaning this acquisition doubles that valuation. That’s a huge windfall for Wiz’s investors, which include the likes of Sequoia, Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Salesforce, Thrive Capital, Greenoaks and around two dozen others.

Rumors were that Wiz — whose founders previously co-founded and sold a security startup to Microsoft, which became the anchor of the company’s cloud security business — was in the process of fundraising at an even higher valuation.

Last year on stage at Disrupt, Rappaport didn’t rule out the possibility of an acquisition in the future but he also confirmed that it was Wiz who walked away from the deal, describing it as “the toughest decision ever” but also maintaining it was “the right choice.”

On a purely financial outcome, it looks like his instinct has held true.

Y Combinator partner Jared Friedman recently claimed that a quarter of YC’s W25 startup batch have 95% of their codebases generated by AI.

Sensing an opportunity, VCs are rushing to back startups developing AI-powered assistive programming tools. One of these startups, Graphite, on Tuesday announced that it raised $52 million in a Series B round led by Accel, with participation from Anthropic’s Anthology Fund with Menlo Ventures, Shopify Ventures, Figma Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and The General Partnership.

Tomas Reimers, Greg Foster, and Merrill Lutsky founded Graphite in 2020. Reimers is an ex-Facebook software dev, whereas Foster was an engineer at Airbnb and Google. Lutsky previously founded Posmetrics, a customer feedback solutions firm.

Graphite began its life as a mobile development tooling company, but it pivoted to code review shortly after opening up shop. Today, Graphite’s platform gives feedback on code, leveraging AI — specifically Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s models — to flag errors and possible oversights.

“Graphite started as an internal tool we built to solve our own pain around code review,” Lutsky told TechCrunch. “We shared what we built with a few ex-Meta engineers, who quickly shared it more broadly, and soon the demand for Graphite became too loud to ignore.”

Graphite also suggests code changes from developer comments on codebases, summarizes code, and generates possible fixes for code failures. For the startup’s next act, Graphite is spinning out Diamond, an AI tool designed to catch coding bugs and errors automatically, as a standalone product.

There’s a lot of competition in the AI coding assistant space. Beyond GitHub Copilot and well-funded efforts like Cursor maker Anysphere, Poolside, Augment, Magic, and Codeium, startups CodeRabbit and DeepCode both focus specifically on AI-powered code review applications. OpenAI recently updated its macOS ChatGPT app to directly edit code in popular app dev tools, and Anthropic — one of Graphite’s financial backers — has an assistive programming tool of its own.

Graphite has managed to carve out a niche for itself, however, partly by working to allay customers’ fears of the reliability risks associated with AI-powered assistive coding tools. Unlike some tools on the market, Graphite lets customers define patterns unique to a codebase and set up filters for sensitive information that might compromise a codebase’s security.

“Revenue grew 20x in 2024, and we’ve scaled to serving tens of thousands of engineers at more than 500 companies, including Shopify, Snowflake, Figma, and Perplexity,” Lutsky said. “Combined with our revenue growth, this new funding gives us many years of runway, a clear path to profitability, and the resources to invest aggressively in growth and AI.”

To make its platform even more attractive, Graphite has made its core code review offering free for teams of all sizes. Previously, only groups of 10 or fewer could use the company’s tools at no charge.

Laude is the new fund launched in 2024 by Perplexity co-founder Andy Konwinski, the UC Berkeley computer scientist who also co-founded Databricks.

This isn’t the only check Laude has cut. But it is the first publicly announced one, Laude co-founder and general partner Pete Sonsini told TechCrunch. Sonsini is well-known for his years at NEA, where he led early investments in Databricks, Anyscale, and Perplexity.

As for Salazar, he’s a repeat founder. He landed at Okta after selling his authentication API startup, Stormpath, to the company in 2017. He spent the next few years at Okta as a VP building products. Partee, for his part, had been building LLM-based applications and contributing to some key open source projects like LangChain and LlamaIndex, according to Arcade.

When Salazar saw the debut of ChatGPT 3.5, he saw the future, and his next startup idea: an AI agent company. Arcade was founded in February 2024.

Then he and Partee quickly discovered that AI agents don’t really work.

“We were trying to build a site reliability agent that was going to compete with [companies] like Datadog,” Salazar said. But “most agents suck. They don’t do much.”

Salazar and Partee kept “beating our heads against the wall” trying to get their agent just to connect to other services and get the data needed to do their job.

One reason, they discovered, is because many agents use LLMs trained on public data, but not private data. So they can, for instance, talk about product features but can’t confirm that an order was delivered.

Not an agent, but a tool used by them

The pair decided Arcade would do for AI agents what Okta once-upon-a-time did for SaaS cloud services. The founders built a tool-calling platform for their site reliability agent.

“People were very surprised when we would show them the demo of that agent. They weren’t that interested in the agent itself,” Salazar said. They wanted to know how they got the agent to actually work.

“Ultimately, we just looked at each other and said … Why don’t we just, like, stop with the agent and sell the underlying tool-calling platform?” Salazar said.

Enter Arcade, which helps each agent get access with the same privileges to the same apps and data as the worker it assists, or the job role it plays. Arcade is available via usage-based pricing or subscriptions.

Arcade integrates with OAuth, so it can handle the authentications of thousands of SaaS services and websites. It also acts an intermediary, providing secure token management that prevents the LLMs themselves from accessing those credentials, Salazar said.

When Sonsini, who had backed Salazar with Stormpath, heard that the founder was doing a new startup, he reached out and wanted in.

“We’re very, very focused on super technical type founders, and so we’re very plugged in with the research community. We have limited partners that are researchers,” Sonsini said.

Whereas many AI startup founders are focused on the “shiny object” around LLMs, like agents, “my background is the lower levels, the infrastructure where billion-dollar businesses can be built,” Sonsini said. And Arcade “falls right in that space.”",techcrunch

https://techcrunch.com,Exist is a new social wellness app that wants to help middle-age users find community,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/exist-is-a-new-social-wellness-app-that-wants-to-help-middle-age-users-find-community/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A new iOS social wellness app called Exist wants to help middle-aged consumers connect and build meaningful communities with one another as they navigate their lives and the stresses that come with it.

The app describes itself as the edgier cousin of Calm or Headspace, and its main feature is social journaling. The idea behind the app’s social and community-driven journaling is to help people heal together, rather than alone. Exist also features a daily mood tracker, audio exercises, guided meditations, and more.

The app was founded by Alicia Waldner, who is the founder of a marketing agency called ADventure Marketing, and iOS developer Jason Jardim, who previously founded a startup called Lounge.

Waldner told TechCrunch in an interview that she had attended a series of group mental wellness experiences, and had heard from people who were looking to have these sorts of community-based experiences at home. She then set out to create an app that would encompass this community-building idea. To help bring her idea to life, Waldner hired Jardim through Indeed as her CTO and then brought him on as a co-founder.

While Exist was originally meant to target Gen Z users, the premise ended up resonating with middle-aged users, as the average age of users who signed up for the app was 40. The duo then decided to focus and center the app around this older group.

Image Credits:Exist

Exist features a TikTok-like feed that allows users to swipe through a mix of videos and text posts featuring people’s public journals and their responses to daily prompts. Users can share comments on these posts to share similar experiences or offer support and advice.

“The biggest feature that makes us different is the community side,” Waldner said. “Headspace and Calm proved that there’s this audio-based market, but people still feel very alone in those experiences and in real life, people meditate and then they journal, but that’s a solo experience. And what we did was make that a social experience. So instead of journaling all your thoughts and feelings at home and putting it underneath your bed at night, you’re sharing it with the world, and people are commenting back.”

Exist also offers an AI-powered question feature that prompts users to expand on their journals and explore more of their thoughts and feelings. Waldner says the feature is meant to help people get to the bottom of their issues and allow them to think deeper about something.

The community and social journaling aspects of Exist are free. If users want access to guided audios and meditations, they need to sign up for the app’s $5.99 monthly subscription.

In terms of the future, the startup wants to continue leaning into the human connection aspect of Exist and look for way to improve it. Exist also wants to add additional features around logging your sleeping habits and emotions, along with more personalized prompts for journals.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Al Gore’s Just Climate fund raises $175M from Microsoft and CalSTRS for nature-based climate investments,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/al-gores-just-climate-fund-raises-175m-from-microsoft-and-calstrs-for-nature-based-climate-investments/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When it comes to climate-related investments, the lion’s share has gone to companies working in energy and transportation. Most investors overlook actual lions — that is, nature-based solutions like biodiversity tend to get short shrift in the investment world. Just $35 billion was invested in nature-based solutions in 2022, compared with $1.46 trillion for the rest of the climate finance sector.

To address the shortfall, Just Climate has raised $175 million from Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund and CalSTRS.

Just Climate is an offshoot of Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management. Until this year, it had focused on what it calls industrial climate solutions, much like most other private climate tech investors.

The new fund will focus on natural climate solutions, which could include everything from farming to forestry. Nature-based solutions address greenhouse gas sources that typically fall under agriculture, forestry, and land-use change, which together represent about 15% of annual global emissions.

But nature-based solutions can also eliminate carbon dioxide that’s already in the atmosphere. Reforestation projects grow new trees on degraded land, sequestering carbon in the wood. For example, Microsoft recently invested in one such startup, Chestnut Carbon.

The new fund aims to restore nature to reverse biodiversity loss and emissions from land use. The firm cites a few examples of possible investments, including biological fertilizers and pesticides, restoration finance platforms, and technologies that verify carbon reduction and biodiversity protection.

Just Climate’s first investment, made in January, led a Series B funding round in NatureMetrics. The company determines the biodiversity of a site by surveying what’s known as eDNA, or environmental DNA, which is free-floating DNA found in water or soil samples.",techcrunch

On Tuesday, the company added a feature to its AI-powered Gemini chatbot that the company is calling Canvas. Similar in concept to OpenAI’s identically-named Canvas tool for ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Artifacts, Canvas provides Gemini users with an interactive space where they can create, refine, and share writing and coding projects.

“Canvas is designed for seamless collaboration with Gemini,” Gemini product director Dave Citron wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. “With these new features, Gemini is becoming an even more effective collaborator, helping you bring your ideas to life.”

Workspaces such as Gemini Canvas, ChatGPT Canvas, and Artifacts are the AI companies’ latest attempt to transform their chatbot platforms into full-blown productivity suites. Dedicated workspaces can offer more precision than text-based interfaces alone, as well as provide a way to preview code in real-time.

Gemini Canvas, which can be launched via the prompt bar from the Gemini app on the web and mobile, lets users draft lengthy messages with Gemini that they can then edit and fine-tune. Using Canvas, users can update specific sections of a draft and adjust the tone, length, and formatting via dedicated tools.

“For example, highlight a paragraph and ask Gemini to make it more concise, professional, or informal,” Citron explained in the blog post. “If you want to collaborate with others on the content you just made, you can export it to Google Docs with a click.”

As alluded to earlier, Canvas also packs programming-focused capabilities, including a feature that lets users generate and preview HTML, React code, and other web app prototypes. Users can ask Gemini to make changes to a preview, and Canvas will iteratively refresh it.

“For example, say you want to create an email subscription form for your website,” Citron wrote. “You can ask Gemini to generate the HTML for the form and then preview how it will appear and function within your web app.”

The new Gemini Canvas can be used to write and edit longer docs. Image Credits:Google

Along with Canvas, Google is bringing the Audio Overview feature of NotebookLM to Gemini, the company announced Tuesday. Google’s NotebookLM went viral last year for Audio Overview, which creates realistic-sounding podcast-style audio summaries of documents, webpages, and other sources.

As with Audio Overview in NotebookLM, Audio Overview in Gemini accepts files and content in a range of formats. Uploading a document via the prompt bar will trigger the Audio Overview shortcut, and once a summary is generated, it can be downloaded or shared via the Gemini app on the web or mobile.

Both Canvas and Audio Overview are available for free to Gemini users worldwide as of Tuesday. Canvas’ code preview feature is only on the web for now, however, and Audio Overview summaries are limited to English.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,WhatsApp will soon limit number of broadcast messages users and businesses can send,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/whatsapp-will-soon-limit-number-of-broadcast-messages-users-and-businesses-can-send/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Chat platform WhatsApp said today that it will limit the number of broadcast messages individual users and businesses can send to curb spam on the app.

In the coming weeks, the company will start testing limits on individual broadcast messages. Under these limits, WhatsApp will put a monthly limit on the number of broadcasts. While there will be moving limits during the test, one example Meta gave was allowing 30 messages per month.

Meta said that if individual users want to send more messages to a large number of people, they could use Status updates or channels.

The company is also thinking about putting similar guardrails around broadcast messages from business accounts. Until now, WhatsApp Business accounts could send free and unlimited broadcast messages, but the company will soon introduce a paid version of the feature with some additional tools.

In the coming months, Meta will test new customized broadcast messages for product updates or holiday sales. Plus, Business account users will be able to schedule messages as well. During the pilot period, merchants will get 250 customized messages for free, and then they will have to pay for additional messages. Currently, the company hasn’t put a price on these messages.

The company’s thinking behind this is that users can still receive occasional broadcast messages without feeling overwhelmed. WhatsApp has taken a few steps to reduce spam in user inboxes, like limiting the number of marketing messages users get in a day. Last year, the company started experimenting with an “unsubscribe” feature that lets users signal they would rather not receive certain types of messages from a business without blocking the account.

For the last few years, WhatsApp Business has become an important asset for Meta — revenue is growing, as the company executives have mentioned in quarterly earnings calls. The company’s ethos is to give merchants the WhatsApp Business app for free with some features such as a landing page, a business profile with details, and the ability to create a catalog. The company then charges for various kinds of messages — including marketing, utility, service, and authentication — when merchants use the solution powered by its API.

Outside of the API charges for different kinds of conversations, Meta only charged for the optional Meta Verified subscription. The new broadcast messaging feature will be one of the first paid features for merchants who don’t use APIs. It will also become another revenue source for Meta.

In Search, Google says it’s using AI and ranking systems to expand “knowledge panel” answers on thousands of health-related topics, and adding support for healthcare queries in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese on mobile. Search already provided knowledge panel answers for ailments such as the flu or the common cold, but the update greatly expands the number of topics the knowledge panels cover, the company said.

Google is also debuting a Search feature it’s calling “What People Suggest” on mobile in the U.S. to highlight content from users with shared experiences relating to health conditions. For instance, if someone asks about common exercises for people dealing with arthritis, What People Suggest will collate reports from various forums around the web using AI.

What People Suggest builds on capabilities like Google’s personal health stories feature on YouTube, and seems pretty clearly aimed at keeping people from leaving Search for Reddit and other sources of health advice.

“While people come to Search to find reliable medical information from experts, they also value hearing from others who have similar experiences,” Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer at Google, wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “Using AI, we’re able to organize different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes, helping you quickly grasp what people are saying.”

Google on Tuesday also launched new medical records APIs globally for its Health Connect platform for Android devices. These will help collect data from medical providers and let users see this data across different apps, as well as make it easier to access the info on devices like phones, Google said.

“These APIs enable apps to read and write medical record information like allergies, medications, immunizations, and lab results in standard FHIR format,” DeSalvo explained in the blog post. “With these additions, Health Connect supports over 50 data types across activity, sleep, nutrition, vitals, and now medical records — making it easier to connect your everyday health data with data from your doctor’s office.”

In other product announcements pertaining to health, Google said that the Loss of Pulse Detection feature on its Pixel Watch 3 smartwatch, which has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will launch by the end of March in the U.S. The feature can detect when you’ve experienced a loss of pulse — for example, due to primary cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning — and automatically prompt a call to emergency services if you’re unresponsive.

Google also unveiled new open AI models for drug discovery called TxGemma, following the company’s launch of a collection of Gemini AI models for multimodal use cases in healthcare. TxGemma is set to be released in the coming weeks.",techcrunch

Even though it's just finished bringing Blackwell B200 into full production and has Blackwell B300 slated for the second half of 2025, it's already looking forward to the next two years, and helping its partners plan for the upcoming transistions.



One of the interesting points made is that ""Blackwell was named wrong."" In short, Blackwell B200 actually has two dies per GPU, which Jensen says changes the NVLink topology. So, even though it calls the current solution Blackwell B200 NVL72, he says it would have been more appropriate to call it NV144L. Which is what Nvidia will do with the upcoming Rubin solutions.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Nvidia) (Image credit: Nvidia)

Above we have the Rubin NVL144 rack that will be drop-in compatible with the existing Blackwell NVL72 infrastructure. We have the same configuration data for the Blackwell Ultra B300 NVL72 in the second slide for comparison. Where B300 NVL72 offers 1.1 PFLOPS of dense FP4 compute, Rubin NVL144 — that's with the same 144 total GPU dies — will offer 3.6 PFLOPS of dense FP4. Rubin will also have 1.2 ExaFLOPS of FP8 training, compared to only 0.36 ExaFLOPS for B300. Overall, it's a 3.3X improvement in compute performance.



Rubin will also mark the shift from HBM3/HBM3e to HBM4, with HBM4e used for Rubin Ultra. Memory capacity will remain at 288GB per GPU, the same as with B300, but the bandwidth will improve from 8 TB/s to 13 TB/s. There will also be a faster NVLink that will double the throughput to 260 TB/s total, and a new CX9 link between racks, with 28.8 TB/s (double the bandwidth of B300 and CX8).



The other half of the Rubin family will be the Vera CPU, replacing the current Grace CPUs. Vera will be a relatively small and compact CPU, with 88 custom ARM cores and 176 threads. It will also have a 1.8 TB/s NVLink core-to-core interface to link with the Rubin GPUs.

Rubin Ultra will land in the second half of 2027, and while the Vera CPU will remain, the GPU side of things will get another massive boost. The full rack will be replaced by a new layout, NVL576. Yes, that's up to 576 GPUs in a rack, each with an unspecified power consumption.



The inference compute with FP4 will rocket up to 15 ExaFLOPS, with 5 ExaFLOPS of FP8 training compute. It's about 4X the compute of the Rubin NVL144, which makes sense considering it's also four times as many GPUs. The GPUs will feature four GPU dies per package this time, in order to boost the compute density.



Where the NVL144 Rubin solution has 75TB total of ""fast memory"" (for both CPUs and GPUs) per rack, Rubin Ultra NVL576 will offer 365TB of memory. The GPUs will get HBM4e, but here things are a bit curious. Nvidia lists 4.6 PB/s of HBM4e bandwidth, but with 576 GPUs that works out to 8 TB/s per GPU. That's seemingly less bandwidth per GPU than before, but perhaps it's a factor of how the four GPU dies are linked together. There will also be 1TB of HBM4e per four reticle-sized GPUs, with 100 PetaFLOPS of FP4 compute.



The NVLink7 interface will be 6X faster than on Rubin, with 1.5 PB/s of throughput. The CX9 interlinks will also see a 4X improvement to 115.2 TB/s between racks — possibly by quadrupling the number of links.



Obviously, there's plenty we don't yet fully know about Rubin and Rubin Ultra, but those details will get fleshed out in the future. Data centers need a lot more planning than consumer GPUs, so Nvidia has shared full details well in advance of the products being ready to ship. And it's not quite done...

https://tomshardware.com,Nvidia Blackwell RTX Pro with up to 96GB of VRAM — even more demand for the limited supply of GPUs,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-blackwell-rtx-pro-with-up-to-96gb-of-vram-even-more-demand-for-the-limited-supply-of-gpus,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:27:46 GMT","If you already thought it was hard to get an Nvidia RTX 50-series Blackwell GPU, things are potentially about to get even more difficult. We've heard from some people at GDC/GTC that Nvidia is working to improve the supply of all of its Blackwell GPUs, and some even suggested we ""might"" see supply finally start to catch up to demand by May/June -- and by that, we mean the suggestion was that we could even see MSRP priced models on sale and readily available. We'll believe that when we see it. In the meantime, Nvidia during the GTC 2025 keynote this morning just announced its Blackwell RTX Pro series of graphics products. These will target both laptops and desktops, as well as standalone PCs and data center products.



We expected this announcement, and certainly Nvidia would know it was incoming and would plan for the increased production required. But we would also say the same of the RTX 50-series launches. Nvidia should have known demand would be high, and yet the supply has been woefully insufficient. And given the choice between shipping GB202/GB203/GB205 GPUs as consumer parts with an ostensible $550~$2,000 MSRP, or to ship professional and data center parts that can cost five times as much, we suspect the latter category will be served first whenever possible.

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Details on the exact specifications and configurations haven't been shared, though we do know that the top solution will use the same GB202 chip as the GeForce RTX 5090, but with a dramatically altered memory configuration. First, some of the professional GPU configurations will be equipped with 24Gb (3GB) GDDR7 chips, the same chips that are currently going into the RTX 5090 Laptop GPU. That bumps the memory configuration from 32GB on a 512-bit interface to 48GB, or from 16GB on a 256-bit interface (for lower tier parts) to 24GB, and for a 192-bit interface there will be 18GB options.



But that's only part of the potential upgrade. As we've traditionally seen with professional and data center solutions, Nvidia will ship some products with memory chips in ""clamshell"" mode -- with GDDR7 chips on both sides of the PCB. That doubles the maximum capacity for every interface width, yielding up to 96GB for GB202 and its 512-bit interface, up to 48GB for GB203 and its 256-bit interface, and up to 36GB for GB205's 192-bit interface.



And that's not some hypothetical number. Nvidia has stated that it will have a Blackwell RTX Pro GPU with 96GB of GDDR7 memory, with ECC enabled. Laptops on the other hand look like they'll stick to similar capabilities as the RTX 50-series mobile solutions, with an RTX Pro solution sporting up to 24GB -- the same as the RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, which uses the GB203 silicon.



Nvidia has also announced a change in branding, if you missed that. Where the previous professional and data center solutions were sold under various RTX names (RTX A6000/A5500/A5000/etc. for Ampere, then RTX 6000/5000/4500/etc. for Ada), the new Blackwell generation of professional and data center GPUs will use RTX Pro nomenclature.



Nvidia already listed the RTX Pro 6000/5000/4500/4000 series GPU names for desktops. For laptops, there will be RTX Pro 5000/4000/3000/2000/1000/500 models, and for data center so far there's only an RTX Pro 6000. That last will, naturally, be the full-fat model with 96GB of GDDR7 ECC memory, taking over from the Nvidia L40.

We're glad to see the change in naming, as things were becoming a bit obfuscated after Nvidia killed off its Quadro branding several generations back. Now, RTX Pro will very clearly indicate that something is different from the standard GeForce RTX lineup. However, there's still the matter of those numbers. RTX Pro 6000 quite obviously implies a Blackwell GPU for now, but what will happen with the next generation Rubin (or whatever the codename ends up being for the non-DC parts) GPUs? This is where the Ampere RTX A6000 branding made sense, but Ada parts dropped the A and things became a little fuzzy. Hopefully, that's something Nvidia addresses when those future products finally arrive.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Nvidia’s new silicon photonics-based 400 Tb/s switch platforms enable clusters with millions of GPUs,https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/nvidias-silicon-photonics-based-1-6-tb-s-switch-platforms-enable-clusters-with-millions-of-gpus,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:45:00 GMT","At GTC 2025, Nvidia introduced its Spectrum-X Photonics and Quantum-X Photonics networking switch platforms for exascale datacenters that use silicon photonics. The new networking switch platforms up data transfer speed to 1.6 Tb/s per port, and 400 Tb/s in the aggregate, allowing millions of GPUs to operate together seamlessly. Nvidia says the new switches offer higher bandwidth, lower power loss, and superior reliability compared to conventional networking solutions.

The Spectrum-X Photonics Ethernet and Quantum-X Photonics InfiniBand platforms deliver speeds of 1.6 Tb/s per port (twice the maximum of current top-tier copper Ethernet solutions) and total bandwidths reaching 400 Tb/s through various port configurations. Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Photonics switches come in several configurations, offering 128 ports at 800 Gb/s or 512 ports at 200 Gb/s, reaching a total bandwidth of 100 Tb/s. A higher-capacity model provides 512 ports at 800 Gb/s or 2,048 ports at 200 Gb/s, achieving 400 Tb/s throughput. The Quantum-X Photonics series features 144 ports at 800 Gb/s InfiniBand, using 200 Gb/s SerDes for efficient data transmission.

Compared to previous-generation networking solutions, Quantum-X doubles performance and increases AI compute scalability fivefold, making it suitable for high-intensity workloads and building even bigger AI clusters.

The Quantum-X InfiniBand switches include a liquid cooling system, ensuring the onboard silicon photonics chips operate at peak efficiency without overheating. As a result, the new networking platforms promise 3.5 times better energy efficiency, 10 times greater network reliability, and 63 times stronger signal integrity, reducing power consumption and improving long-term performance. Additionally, deployment speeds increase by 1.3 times, making these switches a more effective solution for hyperscale AI data centers, according to Nvidia.

Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Photonics Ethernet and Quantum-X Photonics InfiniBand platforms use TSMC’s silicon photonics platform called Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) that combines a 65nm electronic integrated circuit (EIC) with a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) using the company's SoIC-X packaging technology. Nvidia also worked with Coherent, Corning, Foxconn, Lumentum, Senko, and others to establish its own silicon photonics ecosystem with a steady supply chain that enables Nvidia and its partners to build AI clusters and data centers that were impossible before using proprietary hardware.

Nvidia expects Quantum-X InfiniBand switches to be released later in 2025, while Spectrum-X Photonics Ethernet switches will arrive in 2026.

While these advancements promise significant improvements, integrating silicon photonics at such a large scale is complex, and widespread adoption depends on organizations being willing to upgrade their existing networking infrastructure. Despite these hurdles, Nvidia’s silicon photonics technology is a major step forward in AI networking. While Nvidia yet has to disclose future plans for its networking gear, TSMC’s COUPE has a very promising roadmap, which will perhaps be followed by Nvidia.

Along with the base B300 building block, there will be new B300 NVL16 server rack solutions, a GB300 DGX Station, and GB300 NV72L full rack solutions. Put eight NV72L racks together, and you get the full Blackwell Ultra DGX SuperPOD: 288 Grace CPUs, 576 Blackwell Utlra GPUs, 300TB of HBM3e memory, and 11.5 ExaFLOPS of FP4. These can be linked together in supercomputer solutions that Nvidia classifies as ""AI factories.""



While Nvidia says that Blackwell Ultra will have 1.5X more dense FP4 compute, what isn't clear is whether other compute have scaled similarly. We would expect that to be the case, but it's possible Nvidia has done more than simply enabling more SMs, boosting clocks, and increasing the capacity of the HBM3e stacks. Clocks may be slightly slower in FP8 or FP16 modes, for example. But here are the core specs that we have, with some inference of other data (indicated by question marks).

We asked for some clarification on the performance and details for Blackwell Ultra B300 and were told: ""Blackwell Ultra GPUs (in GB300 and B300) are different chips than Blackwell GPUs (GB200 and B200). Blackwell Ultra GPUs are designed to meet the demand for test-time scaling inference with a 1.5X increase in the FP4 compute."" Does that mean B300 is a physically larger chip to fit more tensor cores into the package? That seems to be the case, but we're awaiting further details.



What's clear is that the new B300 GPUs will offer significantly more computational throughput than the B200. Having 50% more on-package memory will enable even larger AI models with more parameters, and the accompanying compute will certainly help.



Nvidia gave some examples of the potential performance, though these were compared to Hopper, so that muddies the waters. We'd like to see comparisons between B200 and B300 in similar configurations — with the same number of GPUs, specifically. But that's not what we have.



By leveraging FP4 instructions, using B300 alongside its new Dynamo software library to help with serving reasoning models like DeepSeek, Nvidia says an NV72L rack can deliver 30X more inference performance than a similar Hopper configuration. That figure naturally derives from improvements to multiple areas of the product stack, so the faster NVLink, increased memory, added compute, and FP4 all factor into the equation.



In a related example, Blackwell Ultra can deliver up to 1,000 tokens/second with the DeepSeek R1-671B model, and it can do so faster. Hopper, meanwhile, only offers up to 100 tokens/second. So, there's a 10X increase in throughput, cutting the time to service a larger query from 1.5 minutes down to 10 seconds.



The B300 products should begin shipping before the end of the year, sometime in the second half of the year. Presumably, there won't be any packaging snafus this time, and things won't be delayed, though Nvidia does note that it made $11 billion in revenue from Blackwell B200/B100 last fiscal year. It's a safe bet to say it expects to dramatically increase that figure for the coming year.",tomshardware

However, AMD GPUs dating back to the first GCN-based graphics cards (including GPUs such as the Radeon HD 7970) have been capable of running ray tracing for a while through software emulation. Clewless Clay on YouTube brought this fact to our attention, and several sources demonstrate ray-tracing on older AMD GPUs, including a Vega 64 graphics card running Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at well over 30 FPS.

The software-based ray-tracing implementation offers surprisingly potent performance. One YouTuber fittingly named ""no RTX no problem"" shared a video of an RX Vega 64 running Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in Linux Fedora 41 at 1080p with 50% resolution scaling (720p internal resolution) with medium graphics settings at playable frame rates. Frame rates hovered anywhere between 50 to 60 FPS average.

Another YouTuber, BK Benchmark, showed an RX 5700 XT running the same game with identical settings but at native 1080P resolution (100% scaling). The newer GPU demonstrated significantly better performance, hovering in the 70 to 80 FPS range on average.

Ray tracing emulation exists through Linux's RADV driver, an open-source counterpart to AMD's official AMDVLK reference Linux driver (significantly expanding AMD GPU capabilities in Linux). Ray tracing support on non-RT supported AMD GPUs was allegedly the brainchild of Joshua Ashton, known for his work on Proton and DXVK. Phoronix reported that adapting AMD's Linux-based RADV driver to run emulated RT was not difficult for the developer. Ashton's RADV ray tracing emulation is achieved by emulating AMD BVH intersection instructions in software.

Joshua Ashton allegedly started experimenting with RT emulation support in 2021, adding support for architectures dating back to GCN 1.0 in 2022. By 2023, his RT emulation development reached full stability, achieving a ""100% pass rate"" (according to Phoronix). The feature can even be activated on RDNA2 and RDNA3 for benchmarking purposes using the ""emulate_rt"" debug option.

Linux's RT-emulation on AMD GPUs is not a competitive solution against newer GPUs sporting hardware-baked ray tracing acceleration. However, the technology has major implications for making modern games playable on older graphics cards. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great example, being one of the first (if not the first) titles to require a ray-tracing capable graphics card. If this trend continues, we can expect future titles to boast the same requirement. Emulating ray tracing will be the only way to make these future games playable on non-RT accelerated GPUs, assuming the ray-traced lighting in future games can be tuned down to playable levels.

However, the biggest hurdle of this RT-emulation implementation is that it only supports Linux operating systems, being an open-source Linux-specific driver. Apparently, there is no work being done to bring such a feature to Windows 10 or Windows 11 (in an official or open-source manner), and there is no work being done to offer this capability on Nvidia GTX graphics cards, limiting its functionality to the niche group of users running Linux on pre-RDNA2-based AMD graphics cards.",tomshardware

The Top 10 largest fabless chip developers earned nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars last year; roughly half of that sum came from Nvidia.

The largest fabless chip designers generated $249.8 billion in revenue, up 49% from the previous year. The growth boomed due to skyrocketing demand for AI GPUs, ASICs, adjacent chips (e.g., network processors, DPUs), datacenter CPUs, and recovered demand for client PCs. Market consolidation also intensified, with the Top 5 firms now accounting for over 90% of the revenue among the Top 10.

(Image credit: TrendForce)

Nvidia was at the forefront of the industry and extended its dominance, posting $124.3 billion in revenue (a 125% increase from 2023) and capturing 50% of the revenue share. Hopper-based H100, H20, and H200 GPUs drove the company’s revenue increase, as Blackwell-based B200/GB200/B100 only emerged in the fourth quarter. As demand for Blackwell parts — which are believed to be more expensive than Hopper GPUs — increases this year, they will likely enable an even higher revenue for the green company this year.

Qualcomm ranked second, earning $34.86 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase. The company’s growth came from smartphones, the automotive sector, and PCs, a new source of the company’s revenue. The company secured a legal victory against Arm, and there are no risks that the latter will withdraw its licenses. The company also confirmed its interest in datacenter CPUs, though its entry into this market is likely a few years down the road.

Broadcom held third place, with its semiconductor unit bringing in $30.64 billion, up 8% from the previous year. AI-related products accounted for more than 30% of its semiconductor revenue. Despite a mid-year slump, demand for wireless communication, broadband, and server storage will drive the company’s growth in 2025.

AMD followed in fourth, increasing revenue by 14% to $25.79 billion. Its server business surged by 94%, boosting its position in datacenters and the cloud. Strategic partnerships with Dell, Google, and Microsoft are expected to help sustain its momentum, according to TrendForce.

MediaTek secured the fifth spot, with $16.52 billion in revenue, marking a 19% annual increase. The company’s success was driven by mainstream 5G smartphones, power management chips, and AI-related products. Its collaboration with Nvidia on Project Digits positions it for further expansion in 2025 as AI integration in mobile devices increases.

Marvell was the sixth largest fabless chip designer, with 5.637 billion in revenue, up 2% from the previous year. Realtek moved to seventh place with $3.53 billion (16% YoY growth), benefiting from a recovery in PC and automotive-related sales. Meanwhile, Novatek dropped to eighth, with revenue declining 10% to $3.2 billion.

Will Semiconductor and MPS closed the top ten, each showing 21% revenue growth, reaching $3.05 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. Will Semiconductor benefited from high-end CMOS image sensors in Android phones and autonomous vehicles, while MPS saw success as its power management chips entered the AI server supply chain.

Leveraging the chipmaker's GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, the Ascent GX10 offers up to 1,000 TOPS of AI performance.

Like Project Digits, the Ascent GX10 is a mini-PC that can be placed on your desk. You just need to connect a keyboard, mouse, and monitor to it to have a powerful AI supercomputer at your disposal. Asus hasn't liberated the product page for the Ascent GX10, so all the specifications we have on the mini-PC come from the press release.

The GB10, the heart of the Ascent GX10, combines Nvidia's Grace CPU and Blackwell GPU. However, the GB10 is a shrunk-down version of Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip.

The Grace CPU features a 20-core Arm design comprising 10 Cortex-X925 and 10 Cortex-A725 cores. It is connected to Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPU through a high-performance NVLink-C2C interconnect. In unison, the GB10 delivers up to 1 PFLOP (1,000 TFLOPS) of FP4 performance.

Ascent GX10, Bringing AI Power To Developer's Fingertips

“AI is transforming every industry, and the ASUS Ascent GX10 is designed to bring this transformative power to every developer’s fingertips,” said KuoWei Chao, General Manager of ASUS IoT and NUC Business Group in the press release. “By integrating the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchip, we are providing a powerful yet compact tool that enables developers, data scientists, and AI researchers to innovate and push the boundaries of AI right from their desks.”

The Ascent GX10 also has 128GB of unified system memory, which allows the device to handle AI models with up to 200 billion parameters. While Asus didn't reveal the memory's specifications, it should use the same LPDDR5x as Project Digits and up to 4TB of M.2 NVMe storage with self-encryption.

The device has Nvidia's ConnectX network interface as part of its networking capabilities, meaning you can hook up to Ascend GX10 systems for larger AI models, such as Llama 3.1, which flaunts up to 405 billion parameters.

The updates, shown at HP's Amplify partner conference, include new lattice-free keyboards and feature chips from both Intel and AMD.



The new machines are 14-inch and 16-inch convertible 2-in-1s and a 17.3-inch standard laptop.



The 14-incher, the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1, starts with an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V and goes up to a Core Ultra 7 258V, or on the AMD side, a Ryzen AI 5 340 up to a Ryzen AI 7 350. Those Ryzen chips all have 50 TOPS NPUs, while the Intel chips range from 40 to 47 TOPS. All of them hit the minimum NPU requirement to be Copilot+ PCs.



The Intel models will have 16 or 32GB LPDDR5x-8533 RAM options, while the AMD models also feature a 24GB version and run at a slower LPDDR5x-7500. Intel's storage goes higher, too, at 2TB, while the AMD version tops out at 1TB.



Either way, you get a 14-inch, OLED touch display with resolutions up to 2880 x 1800, as well as either Wi-Fi 6E or 7 support.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The 16-inch 2-in-1 laptop has the same chip options as the 14-incher, but with a larger OLED screen. In addition, though, there's one extra configuration — the only one not labeled as an AI PC — with an AMD Ryzen 5 220, which doesn't feature an NPU. That one has other basic specifications including just 8GB of RAM and a 1920 x 1200 display. It's likely to be an affordable option in this high-end chassis, but HP hasn't announced any pricing for any of these systems.



If you're looking for more of a workstation, the HP OmniBook X 17.3 pairs either an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V or 258V with either integrated Arc graphics or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU. This system has either 16 or 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB of storage. HP is listing a standard, 1920 x 1080 display.

Across the board with these new models, HP has adopted a lattice-free keyboard, without any space between the keys; It's a design similar to what Dell was using on its XPS line – perhaps the Dell Premium line now? This allows for larger keys and, an HP rep suggested, softer typing. The standard chiclet keys will remain on the OmniBook 7 lineup and below. It seems that the blue highlights on the function keys on last year's OmniBooks have gone, which is a shame because that slight pop of color was fun.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Each of these laptops has a solid selection of ports, including HDMI 2.1, USB Type-C (Thunderbolt 4 on most Intel systems), USB-A (2 ports on the 14 or 16-inch Flip, 3 ports on the 17.3-inch clamshell), and a headphone jack. They all also feature a 5MP camera with infrared for Windows Hello facial recognition.

While HP is pushing these laptops as being AI-focused, demos shown to press relied primarily on image generation and other tasks that are table stakes at this point. Local AI still has a ways to go to become extremely useful on mainstream PCs.



Beyond the OmniBook X series, HP is also updating its OmniBook ,. 5, and 3 series in a swathe of sizes and Intel and AMD chip options. No pricing has been announced, but HP expects to also launch these devices in the spring.",tomshardware

The aptly-named Omen 16 Slim, set to release this spring, packs up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H ""Arrow Lake"" CPU and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU in a chassis that's 16% slimmer than the standard Omen 16.

The height at the front of the laptop is just 19.99 mm (where HP gets that 16% number), though at its thickest point, the Omen 16 Slim is 22.7 mm tall. The laptop weighs about 5.35 pounds.

In a brief-hands on with the system, it felt slim, but wasn’t necessarily featherweight. Most of the ports are on the back, a move that has been popular among slimmer gaming laptops to maintain a sleek aesthetic from the side profile. I didn't get to stick it in a bag, but having jammed plenty of gaming laptops into my backpack for testing, I suspect this one would fit just fine.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Slim will start at a Core Ultra 5 225H and go up to a Core Ultra 7 255H before the bump to Ultra 9. At the moment, the RTX 5070 is the only discrete GPU on the laptop's spec sheet, though an ""up to"" suggests that others may be announced down the line. HP claims that using its ""Unleashed Mode,"" you can get up to 105W of power.



You can get the laptop with 16, 24, or 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and either 512 GB or 1TB of PCIe Gen 4 SSD storage.

The laptop has a 16-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, and will have resolution choices of 1920 x 1200 or 2560 x 1600. The 2560 x 1600 option will go up to 250 Hz, while the 1200p version will come in 144 Hz or 165 Hz versions.

In addition to the Slim, HP is also refreshing the HP Omen 17, Omen Transcend 14, and Victus 15. The Omen 17 will use AMD's Krackan and Strix Point processors (up to AMD Ryzen AI 9 365) while the portable Transcend 14 will stick with Intel, but both will top out at an RTX 5070.



The Victus, positioned as a more budget offering, will have a vast array of options (likely depending on market), including 13th and 14th Gen Intel CPUs, as well as the Intel Core 5 210H processor. On the AMD side, there are options ranging from Ryzen 8000 up through 200 and 300-series Ryzen AI. Graphics on the Nvidia side range from an RTX 2050 to a 4060, along with unspecified ""Next Gen"" laptop GPUs, while AMD will have a range of integrated graphics and the Radeon RX 6550M.

The multi-day event focuses on artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and other technologies that rely on GPUs' specialized computational power. The keynote address will happen live at the SAP Center in San Jose, California at 10 am Pacific Time, but it will also be live-streamed to a global audience via YouTube.

GTC March 2025 Keynote with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang - YouTube Watch On

A pre-broadcast livestream, Live at Nvidia GTC with Acquired, will start on YouTube at 8 am Pacific Time. The company says this event will feature speakers who will dive into Nvidia’s over 30-year history to see how it became the AI giant it is today.

But what’s more exciting for everyone is that Huang is expected to unveil the Blackwell Ultra GPU, which has since been renamed the B300 series, that is expected to deliver more performance and have upgraded memory configurations. Huang said he will also show off next-generation Rubin AI GPUs and more at GTC.

The B300 series AI GPUs are expected to be available in the latter half of this year, while the next-generation Rubin is scheduled for 2026. Many people are anticipating the arrival of these more powerful chips, especially as tech giants and startups alike are battling for supremacy in the AI space.

Nvidia’s competitors, like AMD and Intel, also have their own AI GPU offerings. However, they are miniscule compared to Team Green, which currently owns around 92% of the entire data center GPU market. Its near-monopoly on AI GPUs, plus the hype around AI models, allowed it to become the most valuable company in the world practically overnight.

It has since dropped to third place after some market corrections, with the company losing more than half a trillion dollars in market cap after the release of DeepSeek AI. But as long as there’s demand for powerful AI GPUs, it’s unlikely that Nvidia will go away anytime soon.

It’s just a shame that many gaming enthusiasts, which was Nvidia’s primary market before AI exploded into the scene, feel that they’re being left behind by the company. While it’s understood that the company will prioritize its AI cash cow, the pricing and availability (or lack thereof) of its recently launched RTX 50-series GPUs has disappointed millions of its core fan base.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,GPU meets PCIe-based hard drives: Seagate and Nvidia demo NVMe HDDs,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/gpu-meets-pcie-based-hard-drives-seagate-and-nvidia-demo-nvme-hdds,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:48:22 GMT","Hard drives will remain the most cost-effective storage solution for data centers for years to come, but to make them more suitable for AI data centers, Seagate is developing HDDs that use a common PCIe interface and the NVMe 2.0 protocol. At GTC, Seagate demonstrated a proof-of-concept system running NVMe HDDs, NVMe SSDs, Nvidia's BlueField 3 DPU, and AIStore software to show how NVMe transforms hard drives for AI workloads. Seagate is ahead of its rivals, which are also working on NVMe HDDs.

New protocol, new performance

Hard disk drives have traditionally used specialized interfaces, such as SCSI, Parallel ATA, Serial ATA (SATA), and SATA, which are fine but are reaching their limits for modern, high-performance data environments, specifically in AI and large-scale data centers. Both SATA and SAS rely on serialized protocols developed in the 1980s that carry legacy protocol layers not suited for modern high-speed data processing. Also, SAS and SATA setups require host bus adapters and additional controller layers, adding complexity, potential points of failure, and latency. As a result, these architectures are not suitable for AI workloads, which require high-throughput, low-latency access to massive datasets.

Compared to SAS/SATA, NVMe paired with PCIe offers significantly higher bandwidth, lower latency, and better scalability. Unlike SAS/SATA, which are limited to 6-12 Gbps speeds and rely on complex layers like HBAs and expanders, NVMe operates over an industry-standard PCIe interface, supporting speeds up to 128 GB/s (one HDD is not going to need more than 1 TB/s for quite a while, but on a system level, the more bandwidth, the merrier), and greatly reducing system complexity as well as simplifying scalability. NVMe also enables direct GPU-to-storage (GPUDirect) access through DPUs bypassing CPUs (thus reducing CPU bottlenecks), and supports 64K queues with 64K commands per queue, vastly improving parallel processing, which is important for AI systems.

Proof-of-concept system

To validate this architecture, Seagate built a proof-of-concept system integrating eight NVMe HDDs, four NVMe SSDs for caching, an Nvidia Bluefield 3 DPU, and AIStore software, all running in a Seagate NVMe hybrid array enclosure.

The test machine demonstrated that direct GPU-to-storage access minimizes latency in AI workflows. Also, removing legacy SAS/SATA infrastructure simplified system architecture and increased storage efficiency. AIStore software dynamically optimizes data caching and tiering, which greatly enhances AI model training performance.

Also, Seagate says that the system can scale to exabyte levels when using NVMe-over-Fabric (NVMe-oF). Specifically, NVMe-oF integration enables seamless expansion of multi-rack AI storage clusters, which is crucial to scale efficiently (perhaps more importantly, seamlessly) across large data centers.

The trial confirmed that NVMe HDDs could support high-performance AI environments without requiring fully flash-based storage solutions, reducing costs while maintaining performance.

AI systems are driving exponential growth in data storage needs, with Existing architectures facing significant constraints. SSDs deliver high-speed performance but are financially unsustainable for long-term storage at this scale. SAS and SATA HDDs offer affordability but introduce complexity and latency due to reliance on host bus adapters (HBAs), proprietary silicon, and controller systems not optimized for AI’s high-throughput, low-latency requirements. Cloud storage options further complicate infrastructure with high WAN data transfer costs, unpredictable retrieval times, and latency spikes, which hinder AI processing efficiency. These limitations result in complex, costly, and inefficient architectures, slowing down AI adoption and performance.

Nowadays, enterprises manage petabyte to exabyte-scale datasets for AI model training and inference. Going forward, their needs will increase, and this is where Seagate's solution to bring NVMe connectivity to HDDs and create a unified and efficient data center storage platform will shine.

From an HDD complexity point of view, adding NVMe to hard drives is not that expensive as the HDDs retain SAS/SATA physical connectors and their traditional 3.5-inch form factor. The only things that change are the addition of the NVMe protocol support and a PCIe interface to the controller (which probably costs pennies), as well as the development of firmware that supports NVMe features and capabilities like GPUDirect. Keeping in mind that the transition to NVMe/PCIe connectivity eliminates HBAs and complexity, small HDD cost price hikes will hardly be noticed by the industry.

However, as HDDs gain capacity, their IOPS-per-TB performance drops, and this may affect performance when working in AI clusters going forward (or will require more flash to mitigate). To that end, it is possible that in the future, dual-actuator HDDs, such as Seagate's Mach.2, will be preferable for AI clusters. Such drives are, of course, more expensive than regular single-actuator HDDs, but each such drive still costs less than two single-actuator HDDs, so this will not create any significant disruptions.

When?

One of the things that an avid reader would ask after learning the benefits of NVMe for HDDs is when such hard drives are set to hit the market. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell. Large companies prefer to have dual source supply for products like HDDs, which is why NVMe hard drives were developed as part of the OCP project. However, while Seagate already has NVMe hard drives, its rivals yet have to introduce their devices. When that happens, and all makers of hard drives can produce such products in volume, cloud service providers that address AI companies and workloads will start to adopt such products.",tomshardware

The device was shown off at the AMD Greater China Channel Summit today, with top red-team execs like CEO Lisa Su and SVP & GM Jack Huynh in attendance. GMKTec was lucky enough to get Dr. Su to sign one or more of the new EVO-X2 mini PCs, and the source blog hints there is a batch of Signature Editions.

Detailed hardware specs of the EVO-X2 are not readily available, and the product page has yet to be published by GMKTec, so you'll have to settle for a brief outline for now. As far as the internals go, all we are sure about is that this compact desktop will pack an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor. However, its performance in DeepSeek R1 tests is more than 3X that of an RTX 5080 desktop GPU, according to purported GMKTec hardware demonstrations.

To recap the AMD Strix Halo APU's specs, it features a Zen 5 architecture CPU configured with 16 cores and 32 threads (two CCDs), operating at a maximum frequency of 5.1 GHz. As an APU, this is joined by a beefy iGPU, namely the RDNA 3.5 architecture Radeon 8060S with 40 compute units. Rounding off the processing package, there is an XDNA2 NPU which is capable of 50 TOPS. AMD has also shoved 80MB cache onboard, but buyers will have a choice of the RAM quota (up to 128GB of 256-bit LPDDR5X-8533 RAM) at time of purchase.

(Image credit: GMKTec blog and social media)

Back to pixel peeping to unearth more details about the GMKTec EVO-X2, and one of the first comments we can make is that it is pretty sizable for a mini PC. In the image featuring Jack Huynh, you can see the AMD SVP & GM holding a Geekom machine, which appears to be a traditional '4 x 4' NUC-a-like. With the EVO-X2 in close proximity, we Photoshop-estimate that the EVO-X2 is a '5 x 4.5' and larger in the remaining dimension.

Images shared by GMKTec on social media provide further ideas about the shape and form of the EVO-X2. Also, we can clearly see a power button to the front, alongside an SD card reader, a Thunderbolt (Type C) port, twin USB (Type A ports), and a headset jack. Around the back are three more USB (Type-A) ports, another Thunderbolt, HDMI, DP, an RJ45 network port, another headset jack, and a barrel power jack.

Enthusiasts are excited about the new generation Strix Halo APUs from AMD. So if GMKTec can get its product on shelves ahead of the likes of the HP Z2 Mini G1a and Framework Desktop - at an attractive price - it will have won a minor coup. We don't know how many 'Lisa Su' signed models there are, but the source blog hints there is a batch.

As for who will be first with an AMD Strix Halo, Asus originally slated its ROG Flow Z13 for release in February, but it still seems to be in pre-order purgatory, and it's not a mini PC. The Framework Desktop machines with Ryzen AI Max chips aren't expected until Q3 this year. The other machine we have heard about, the HP Z2 Mini G1a, is set to be released in 'spring.'",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Intel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers — Technology still gated by closed-source barriers,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-finally-releases-the-xess-2-0-sdk-for-developers-technology-still-gated-by-closed-source-barriers,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT","Intel finally released the SDK (Software Development Kit) for its XeSS 2.0 stack of technologies to the public through its GitHub repository yesterday. The XeSS SDK 2.0.1 offers a more streamlined and user-friendly process for developers to integrate Intel's latest XeSS-SR, XeSS-FG, and XeLL technologies into their games. After a bit of research, we discovered that despite all these major updates, XeSS remains a closed-source and Windows-first technology.

Intel's latest endeavors into the budget segment with the Arc B580 and B570 in December came with a new suite of updates to its XeSS stack. XeSS 2 is now subdivided into three main branches: XeSS-SR (Super Resolution), XeSS-FG (Frame Generation), and XeLL (Low Latency). XeSS-SR and FG target the respective upscaling and frame-generation tech found in Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR offerings. Meanwhile, XeLL serves as Intel's response to Reflex and Anti-Lag from Nvidia and AMD, respectively.

XeSS 2.0 (SR only) extends support towards older DirectX 11 titles, exclusively for systems with Arc graphics onboard (Iris Xe to Arc Battlemage). To further accelerate the integration of its technology, Intel is supplying pre-baked XeSS plugins for Unreal Engine and Unity, likely with engine-specific optimizations for faster development. The XeSS inspector tool used for debugging has also been updated for XeSS 2.0, adding API support to analyze XeSS-SR implementations in Vulkan and DirectX 11 titles. Notably, the whitepaper detailing Intel's XeSS 2.0 suite is also now available.

With the patch notes out of the way, it's important to mention that XeSS has still not gone open-source as Intel promised. The release section only contains pre-compiled binaries for Windows. A closer look at the licensing agreement also explicitly states: ""No reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the Software is permitted."" The license mentions that Intel grants no rights to its intellectual property, which means that the modification of the source code is prohibited. Not that Intel is offering the source code in the first place.

Giving Intel the benefit of the doubt, this may mean that XeSS is not considered sufficiently mature for an open-source release. On the contrary, the open-source nature of FSR allows it to be cross-platform, simplifies developer integration, allows fine-tuning, and also opens room for community contributions such as mods that can enable FSR 3 in most games.

As it stands, XeSS is still a proprietary technology, so developers will be restricted to its binary releases, with limited compatibility on Linux. Even now, only a handful of games support XeSS 2.0 which is a shame, given the impressive features it brings and that early Battlemage adopters likely took into consideration at the time of purchase.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,AMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-gpu-supply-to-stabilize-after-april-claims-aib-partner-yeston,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:05:00 GMT","It is not a secret that it is close to impossible to get a Radeon RX 9070-series graphics card at MSRP in the U.S., and apparently customers in China are suffering from the same problem. Yeston, which is a relatively small supplier of graphics add-in-boards (AIBs), admits that supply of AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs is unstable at this time, and says that it expects the situation to stabilize ""after April""

🥰Hello everyone! Thank you for the support! We have received a lot of messages and would love to inform you now the supply is unstable, but we will restock every week. Please don't be frustrated if you didn't get it. The supply will continue stable to be available after April. https://t.co/U6oJSkziqbMarch 18, 2025

""We have received a lot of messages and would love to inform you now the supply is unstable, but we will restock every week,"" a statement by Yeston posted on X reads. ""Please do not be frustrated if you did not get it. The supply will continue stable to be available after April.""

While the company does restock frequently, availability remains patchy. For example, Yeston makes announcements regarding exact availability time of its Radeon RX 9070 XT products (which are among the best graphics cards), which is a good indicator that availability is indeed scarce. To that end, buyers interested in securing one of these graphics cards should keep an eye on Yeston's official updates on X for the latest restock information.

It should be noted that Yeston is not a major maker of graphics cards and sells boards based on processors from both AMD and Nvidia, so it does not really get priority supplies from either of the big two GPU developers.

Although AMD stated earlier this month that the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards running at default clocks and without factory overclocking would be available at $549 and $599, actual retailers in the U.S. and UK increased prices by $50 to $130. As a result, there are almost no models available at MSRP. Reports suggest the situation might be worse than initially thought.

Stores like Micro Center, Newegg, and Overclockers U.K. have marked up Radeon RX 9070 XT prices by 11.7% to 21.7% in the U.S. and 14% to 17.4% in the U.K., while the vanilla Radeon RX 9070 is up 14.5% to 21.8% in the U.S. and 7.5% in the U.K. The entry-level models are supposed to follow AMD's pricing recommendation, yet only Best Buy and Micro Center list some at MSRP — though they are sold out.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,New undersea cable tech listens for sabotage — can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/new-undersea-cable-tech-listens-for-sabotage-can-be-retrofitted-to-existing-fiber-optic-lines,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:38:41 GMT","German tech company AP Sensing just developed a technology that lets undersea cables detect tampering and sabotage through soundwaves. The company tested its new Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) last year when it sent a diver to make contact with an underwater cable it was monitoring. “He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,” Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing told BBC. “The acoustic energy which travels through the fiber is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.”

The technology works like sonar, where it senses vibrations traveling through the water by monitoring the light traveling within the fiber optic cable. These tiny movements, as well as temperature changes and physical disturbance, affect the minute number of photons being reflected back along a fiber optic cable. By measuring these changes, the team can determine if something makes contact with the cable or if a part of it is unearthed.

AP Sensing’s software is also claimed to be able to pick up vehicles moving and events happening within the vicinity of the cables. This makes it possible for fiber optic cables to hear a dropping anchor, detect ships passive above it, and even possibly determine the vessel’s approximate class.

One more advantage to this technology is that it can be retrofitted to existing lines that have free channels or at least one unused cable. That means undersea cable operators do not have to spend millions in laying new cables with built-in sonar sensors. The only additional investment they need is to install signal-listening devices every 100km (approx 62 miles).

Many companies are starting to invest in technologies like this in the wake of several high-profile cable-cutting incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan in late 2024 and early 2025. As the majority of global communications rely on undersea cables, purposely disrupting this crucial infrastructure could be considered a hostile act.

However, these sabotage detectors may only help catch an offending vessel after it has already damaged or severed a cable. Still, some suggest putting dedicated sensors around crucial infrastructure is a good idea, giving Coast Guard and Navy ships some time to respond before damage is inflicted. This would make it easier to safeguard these key undersea lines of communication and would work well alongside NATO’s deployment of sea drones.",tomshardware

ZDNET's key takeaways

The Pixel 8 offers a flagship-level experience with Google's latest AI and machine learning features, and right now, it's marked down to $488 on Amazon.

With fast performance, amazing cameras, and Google's Actua display, it's one of the best smartphone deals available.

Compared to similarly priced phones, like the Nothing Phone 2, the Pixel 8 is a far better value.

As part of Amazon's 2025 Spring Sale, Google's base Pixel 8 in Obsidian (black) has received a 30% discount. It's price has dropped from $700 to just $488.

The Google Pixel 9 might be getting all the attention nowadays (especially with its access to Google's new Gemini AI model), but the standard Pixel 8 is still an impressive model among the rest of Google's smartphone catalog.

Also: Amazon's Big Spring Sale is back: Here's everything you need to know to shop saavy

That's because the Pixel 8 offers one of the best combinations of specs, features, and premium design at a price considerably lower than the competition. Even at full price, the device is cheaper than contemporaries like the Galaxy S24 ($760) and the OnePlus 12 (normally retails for $900).

Because it balances performance and cost so well, the Pixel 8 is difficult to ignore and perhaps the only phone you should consider if you're shopping on a budget. You won't find another phone like it under $500, and it's only when you sift through the $800-$1,000 options that you find commendable competition.

A big reason why this is such a compelling option is the Tensor G3 chip, Google's latest in-house processor that powers all of the Pixel 8's AI and machine learning features. It's not just a solid Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 alternative but a monumental reason why the Pixel 8 is such a great phone.

The chip powers all the Google Pixel-ness of the Pixel 8, from transcribing voices in the Recorder app to letting you edit photos to your heart's content with the AI-powered Magic Editor. The Google Assistant also takes advantage of the G3 to process your voice quicker and even summarize web pages for quickly consuming information. Alongside powering Google's HDR pipeline for photography and ensuring Android 14 is slick and smooth, the G3 is one of the most capable smartphone chips on the market. And when paired with 8GB of RAM, you'll never have a slow day.

The display is another huge reason to get this phone. The Pixel 8's 6.2-inch Actua display is a bit smaller than the screen on the Pixel 7, but that makes it easier to hold in one hand. It's also stunning to look at; with a Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 2,000 nits of peak brightness, it's one of the brightest and clearest displays on the market. Plus, it's OLED, so colors are vibrant, and inky blacks are plentiful.

Look beyond the display, and you'll find a good-looking phone crafted out of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus. Featuring Google's signature camera bar on the back and thin bezels around the display, the Pixel 8 is a stunner among other sub-$500 phones. It's also IP68-certified for dust and water resistance, and it comes in three nice finishes: Obsidian (black), Hazel (kinda green), and Rose (more of a golden peach, in my opinion).

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

When it comes to Pixel phones, there are two areas you have to talk about: cameras and software.

On the camera front, Google knocked it out of the park. The rear 50MP main shooter and 12MP ultra-wide are both excellent performers in broad daylight and at night. The cameras easily match or outpace what you'd get with an iPhone 15 Pro or Galaxy S23 Ultra in terms of clarity, detail, and sharpness, while colors are often far more accurate than they ever have been on a Pixel phone.

Also: I still recommned this older Samsung phone - and it's on sale for 23% off

You also get all of the camera chops that the Pixel name carries like astrophotography, Super ResZoom, dual exposure controls, and Ultra HDR. That's on top of other features like Best Take and Magic Editor that make these cameras the smartest you'll find. Plus, video quality has been vastly improved over previous Pixels -- it's flat-out comparable to the iPhone.

On the software side, Google's Pixel experience atop Android 14 remains my favorite way to interact with Android. It's clean and minimal and gives you a warm, inviting feeling that no other Android skin can mimic. You get all the features of Android 14, like customizable lock screens, better security, larger fonts, and improved notifications, along with all of the Pixel features you could ask for, such as Call Screen, Now Playing, Direct My Call, AI-generated wallpapers, and -- of course --the Pixel Launcher.

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

But the real kicker in the software department is Google's extended support. The company guarantees seven full years of software support, which means you'll get updates until 2030 if you buy this phone. That's unheard of for an Android phone, and it gives devices like the iPhone a run for their money.

Also: There's one new Pixel 'upgrade' you might not love - here's how to fix it

Thanks to the 4,575mAh cell inside, the Pixel 8 can also last all day on a charge. With my medium to heavy usage, I typically end days with 30-40% in the tank, which means anyone using the phone a bit less could stretch it out to last a day and a half. Plus, you get 30W fast charging to juice back up and Qi wireless charging.

So, what are the downsides? Honestly, there aren't a lot. The Pixel 8 still gets pretty warm after being used for a while, but that's typical with Google's Tensor processors. I also wish there was a proper telephoto camera on the back; Super Res Zoom is handy for upscaling digitally zoomed photos, but it can only take you so far. Oh, and I still don't trust Face Unlock; Google lets you use it to pay for things now using Google Pay, but it still relies on a flat image of your face to authenticate you.

ZDNET's buying advice

You're not going to find a much better value than the Pixel 8 - especially at such a deep discount. From the gorgeous display and design to the speedy performance and amazing cameras, Google's standard flagship phone stands on its own with an impeccable balance of high-end features for a lower price than other flagships.

Also: The 10+ best early Amazon Spring Sale phone deals

With its sale price of $487, the closest competition happens to be the Galaxy A35 5G and Nothing Phone (2), two devices that are perfectly worthy of a spot in your pocket but don't offer the same value as the Pixel 8. Google's phone is a proper flagship with seven years of software support, the latest AI features, and the company's latest camera tricks.

Anyone shopping for an Android phone under $500 should consider the Pixel 8. Its value is simply incredible, and it's still a formidable device in 2025.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

The document of around thirty pages constitutes the work base on which European deputies of the ITRE commission will work to lead to an agreement.

The MEP had been appointed as a rapporteur of this report at the end of 2024. She has carried out interviews for several weeks in order to identify the main challenges of the digital sector and issue recommendations.

Haro on regulations

This first preliminary report, officially presented in the ITRE committee, expresses a strong theme: the reduction of standards and regulations which, according to the MEP, hamper the innovation and competitiveness of the actors of the European Union.

Thus, the report is directly inspired by the measures implemented by the British administration of David Cameron in the 2010s. It proposed the implementation of a ""one-in-out"" policy in regulatory matters. This approach provides for the abolition of two regulatory texts for each new regulations implemented in strategic sectors.

The other proposal of the report are at the endorsement. In terms of energy policy, the report proposes to put an end to the rule of ""Merit Order"" which makes it possible to supervise the prices of electricity in Europe. In tax matters, the text proposes to simplify the regulations supervising the European long -term investment fund. Or ""reform European regulations which make assets considered to be risky and emerging"" less attractive. A formulation which evokes the regulatory framework in force on the active crypto challenged by the European far -right parties.

An approach influenced by the Trump administration

Finally, the report also proposes to open up to States the possibility of ""reserving their strategic markets for European companies with respecting sovereignty criteria"". He also pleads for an alignment of European cloud safety certification, EUCS, on the requirements of the highest level of the French qualification of the ANSSI, Secnumcloud.

The text must now be the subject of amendments by the other European parliamentarians designated by the ITRE commission. The final vote is scheduled for September.

During the presentation of the report, the MEPs from the Renew group deplored ""a text which praises certain measures of the Trump government and criticizes European initiatives rather than proposing concrete solutions"". Others, like the representative of the PPE right center group, called for ""sovereignty not used as an excuse to justify protectionism."" The other parliamentary groups of the Commission have until March 20 to propose their amendments.

Ideal timing

In parallel with the publication of this report, Reuters reported yesterday that several European players in industry and digital technology transmitted to the European Commission a letter asking it to strengthen the digital sovereignty of the EU.

In particular, they offer support for a European purchasing policy in public tenders. But also the creation of a sovereign infrastructure fund intended to finance industrial projects in the field of semiconductors or quantum technologies.

The letter has been signed by more than 90 large European companies, including Airbus, Dassault Systèmes, or OVHCloud.",zdnet

At the center of this development is Sameer Samat, Android manager at Google.

He took the time, during the Chaos of the MWC denier, to discuss with me new video capacities in real time and screen sharing of Gemini Live - functions fueled by the ASTRA project of Deepmind - and what they reveal on the future of AI in Android.

The new gemini live video and screen sharing features

Samat's enthusiasm for the new features of Gemini Live was palpable as soon as we started to discuss updates. Even if he first praised Circle To Search. We didn't really use the word ""AI"" once, ""he said.

We were content to say: ""Here is what you can do with and how it helps you"". And Samat plans to continue to disseminate the advantages of the new features of Android instead of insisting that AI is at the origin of most of them.

Kerry Wan/Zdnet

Gemini Live's great novelty is the possibility of pointing the smartphone camera on anything and discussing it immediately.

First two cases of use for Gemini Live

I was able to test the functionality in a special room, where a ceramic vase tried on a table next to several color samples. Gemini Live, in conversation, was able to help decide which colors would agree best on the virgin vase thanks to vocal requests and live video of the camera of a Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Gemini Live will also be able to recognize the screen sharing content and initiate contextual conversations around what he sees.

Samat here quotes the example of someone looking for online prices for a new car and using Gemini Live to say: ""What is the average price of all the things we have just looked at?"" Gemini Live could then calculate the average cost of each vehicle consulted during the session.

The ASTRA project first arrives on the smartphone

These capacities come from the ASTRA project of Deepmind. This research aims to develop a ""universal AI assistant"" who simultaneously treats voice, images and the environmental context.

Samat admits that if these features that arrive on the smartphone are exciting, they only touch the surface of what is possible. ""Gemini and the capacities astraine in a way what is possible on the glasses,"" he said.

During the Google I/O conference of last year, the founder of Google Sergey Brin said that the connected glasses fed by the ASTRA project were promising. Kerry Wan/Zdnet

Imagine that you leaf through an engineering manual, illustrious Samat. And that you ask Gemini to remember a diagram on the pages. Later, when solving a problem, you ask Gemini to refer to the knowledge of the diagram he saw earlier. ""It can help you solve problems. It's quite impressive,"" he said.

The question of continuity of the use of technology

This contextual window of knowledge is a key element of the power and promise of these new multimodal functions in Gemini Live.

It is therefore necessary to take note of these ambient details from the start of the experience.

SAMAT says that this continuity is a major challenge at present. ""Things that seem most magical are the most transparent,"" he continues. ""We are all trying to get there and we work there hard.""

Draw from the failures of the Google Glass

Mr. Samat also refers to Google's decade of experience in enhanced reality. And at the launch of Google Glass in 2013.

These are examples of the way of approaching this technology taking into account concerns in privacy protection.

For example, Mr. Samat believes that Google's pioneering work in the field of ""Wearables"" played an important role in the development of the industrial standard consisting in alerting passers -by when a camera placed on glasses records.

Will agents overshadow applications?

The rise of artificial intelligence agents on smartphones, like Gemini 2.0 of Google, which feeds functions such as Gemini Live and Project Astra, arouses the concern of certain developers. They fear that their applications will be sidelined by the use of AI agents.

""I am optimistic about this point. I think it will be a partnership where the two parties will work together,"" said Sameer Samat on this point.

T-Mobile unveiled a smartphone powered only by artificial intelligence agents at the MWC last year. Kerry Wan/Zdnet

In this sense, Mr. Samat considers embedded agents as means allowing users to accomplish more tasks rather than replacing them entirely.",zdnet

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

To equip itself with an ERP, the startup did not choose a young shoot, like in Genai with Dust, but with a history of the sector.

The fintech makes the choice to deploy SAP S/4hana Public Cloud, the version in Public Cloud mode of the German publisher's software package. According to the supplier, this model guarantees ""regular updates and rapid scalability.""

S/4 in the public cloud for updates

SAP ERP selection is part of Qonto’s internationalization strategy. S/4hana will thus be the common application of all subsidiaries for the processing of financial processes.

""This strategic investment will allow us to strengthen our financial processes while retaining the agility that has always been at the heart of our success,"" says Anita Szarek, Qonto's financial director.

The CFO also justifies this technological choice by the desire “to build an evolving financial basis” aligned with the international ambitions of the hexagonal unicorn. Several objectives are pursued through the deployment of the ERP in the public cloud.

Standardize, automate and secure processes

Qonto specifies wanting to ""standardize, automate and secure financial processes"" with a view to improving productivity and traceability of operations. By this process of unification, it is also a question for the Fintech of having a ""single and reliable source of data.""

The company also indicates to seek to:

Strengthen internal control

Guarantee regulatory compliance

Improve the user experience

Agility and scalability are also cited. The software system must here in particular ""adapt to new regulations, products and acquisitions.""

To lead the deployment of S/4hana from the beginning of next year, Qonto calls on the consulting firm Meltone, which has expertise in the integration of SAP solutions. The company is also already known to French Tech.

Four new markets in 2024

After a record fundraising in 2022, Qonto is now planning as a European champion of financial management. Last September, the startup settled on four new markets: Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Portugal.

In 2019 and 2020, Qonto opened subsidiaries in Italy, Spain and Germany. Between December 2020 and December 2023, the fintech posted an annual growth in the number of customers of 86% and its revenues by 138% on these three countries.

For its international development, Qonto takes advantage of its approval as a payment establishment. This status offers him the possibility of extending ""his license to any other EU country.""

With the success of this mission called ""High Five"", the young Toulouse shoot has completed its deployment. With 25 nanosatellites now in orbit, it becomes the first space connectivity operator dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT).

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

Funded at 100 % by French public and private funds including BPIFRANCE, BNP Paribas Development, CNES, CLS, Ceud and industrialists Thales and Héméria, Kinéis has succeeded in building its constellation in record time, in less than a year. The startup employs 60 employees and uses more than 200 experts in the Occitanie region.

The nanosatellites each weigh 28 kgs. They are equipped with electric propulsion systems powered by solar panels. What ensure their maintenance in orbit and avoid collisions. They are positioned in low orbit (Leo) at just 650 km altitude. They travel 40,000 km per orbit. ""This proximity to the earth reduces latency and improves the quality of the signal,"" says Kinéis.

Sigfox satellite version

The constellation is supplemented by a network of 20 ground stations. What improve the speed of data processing and transmission. Its vocation has nothing to do with the Starlink megaconstellations of SpaceX and soon Kuiper of Amazon dedicated to satellite internet access.

Kineis is positioned on low -speed space connectivity. Its now full constellation will allow you to reassemble the data of connected sensor in almost real time, from any point in the globe. Applications are endless that it is a question of locating, monitoring or alerting in areas not covered by land networks. That is to say 85 % of the planet.

Kinéis will open its commercial services on June 1. The startup intends to invest in the field of prevention of natural risks - detection of forest fires, floods, drought, pollution - monitoring of infrastructure and energy networks, monitoring of transport and logistics, precision agriculture further control of maritime activities.

With this space IoT, an industrialist can for example:

Anticipate breakdowns and do predictive maintenance

Reduce the consumption of energy or natural resources

Optimize its inventory management and supply chain.

Detection of fire departures

The Les Echos evokes a contract with the State for the deployment of some 100,000 early detection tags for forest fires in order to prevent firefighters at the slightest start of fire. According to the economic daily, “discussions are underway with EDF to follow the electric pylons and locate breakdowns. »»

With subsidiaries in the United States and Brazil, Kinéis immediately addresses a world market.

Part of a white sheet in 2019, the company plans to reach the profitability threshold this year, and exceed 20 million euros in turnover in 2026 and reach the 100 million euros mark in 2030.

An increasing number of professionals use generative artificial intelligence and automatic learning to accomplish banal tasks and devote more time to the most important activities.

Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. Learn more about the use of personal data

But it is business leaders and CIOs who are responsible for transforming these first incursions into the world of AI into a long -term competitive advantage.

Here are three ways to make AI positively transform your organization.

1. Increase the time spent in value added activities

Dave Moyes, DSI at the architect Simpsonhaughu, says that his company uses AI in three key areas: Words, IA of images and generative AI (Gen AI).

Words is an asset for productivity. The cabinet uses automation to help staff reduce the number of hours devoted to time -consuming tasks such as e -mail, drafting meeting reports and reporting.

The cabinet uses generative AI for parametric design, where construction elements and technical components are shaped using algorithmic processes rather than manual manipulation.

Mr. Moyes explains to ZDNET that this AI branch is now well established in the field of architecture. His office refines his approach using tools such as Autodesk Forma and the Grasshopper visual programming interface in Rhino [3D software]. ""Something as simple as the orientation of a building can make a huge difference, especially when it comes to large towers,"" he said on this subject. ""The AI ​​allows you to rotate the 10 degree building to see the effect of the wind. Previously, this process would have required the intervention of a specialist and taken many hours"".

Less time for paperwork

According to Mr. Moyes, the good news is that the automation made possible by Gen AI allows staff to devote less time to paperwork and more time to value -added activities. ""Architects can focus on design. Technology eliminates a large part of the questions related to compliance.""

Finally, the firm uses Image AI (and the specialized Comfyui tool) to help professionals generate preliminary design proposals based on sketches and prompt. ""Visualization is an argument of sale on the vision of the project, on the context in the city, the advantages for the environment and the advantages for customers. The generation of images allows us to improve the sale arguments"", says Mr. Moyes.

""Our collaborators can say"" give me the image of a person sitting in a room with a view of the beach "". It is easy to generate this image within a large linguistic model"".

However, Mr. Moyes warns business leaders. According to him, highly qualified people must remain in the loop. ""The tools may not understand what a double exposure apartment is. The architect must therefore still make his contribution to say:"" The diagram created by this AI tool is not good "". Technology always needs someone to validate the data"".

2. Reduce administrative tasks and increase productivity

Carrie Jordan, World Director of Programs at Microsoft, says that the technology giant uses AI internally to conclude contracts effectively.

Microsoft uses Strategic Response Management of Responsive (Platform for the management of strategic responses) and AI to develop an approach that stimulates the productivity of salespeople.

Ms. Jordan explains to ZDNET that the writing of commercial proposals is a task that takes a long time. And which distance from sellers from face to face conversations and problem solving that are the cause of client orders. ""Proposals are one of the most painful points for sellers,"" she said. ""At Microsoft, sellers have a lot to do. They have a lot of resources and accounts, and responding to a tender is a painful point.""

First, Ms. Jordan says that her business used responsive to create a standard of 20,000 elements of proposals content. But Ms. Jordan says that the search for correct answers still takes a long time, especially when some tenders have more than 600 questions with strong technical requirements.

Work the Home References

Carrie Jordan worked with responsive to see how AI could help create a first version automatically from the content repository that Microsoft had already built.

Before the AI, at Microsoft, it was necessary to spend about 20 minutes per question, to search for the elements in the library and find the right answer.

With the AI ​​-based system, the proposal creation process can take five minutes or less. Even by taking into account the time required to ensure that the result is correct. According to Ms. Jordan, the final validation stage is crucial for the success of the project. ""What we don't want is that there is excessive dependence on AI,"" she said. ""To solve this problem, we put all kinds of reminders everywhere: AI creates a first version and the role of the professional is to validate, examine and modify the content to ensure its accuracy.""

Ms. Jordan specifies that the company also includes non-liability clauses that explain to customers how AI has been used in the proposal process. ""We do our best to guarantee the accuracy and quality of the answers. But it is a challenge because automation implies a modification of human behavior.""

3. Use data for effective personalization

Raymond Boyle, VP data and analysis at Hyatt Hotels, says that he uses innovation in order to create better experiences for customers and colleagues.

Mr. Boyle explains that Hyatt uses snowflake ai data cloud for travel and hotels. This unified data platform helps your business consolidate business data in one place. Then, the priority is to ensure that AI and data are used to improve the research experience and the recommendations that people receive.

""Personalization concerns the way our guests and our customers interact with us. This process therefore begins when you dream of your vacation, you are looking for a place of accommodation and you receive recommendations on the places that may interest you,"" said Boyle. ""It then goes to additional areas. Perhaps you want to participate in different experiences, such as a day at the SPA, a golf game or a dinner on the beach. All these areas are great opportunities for automatic learning and personalization systems.""

In addition to personalization, Mr. Boyle indicates that Hyatt is deploying price optimization capacities worldwide. ""We are thinking about how we can help our owners and our operators reach higher profit levels.""

Mr. Boyle's team also studies the possibility of using Gen Ai's capacities in the field of analysis. ""We are thinking about how self-service analysis can help have information to make more judicious decisions.""

""In these fields, we take advantage of the ability to carry out natural language research to obtain information from data.""

More and more fans of the laptop (of which I am a), which are not ready to adopt a touch pad, turn to convertible laptops.

For what ? Because they offer professionals the best of both worlds.

The three essential points to remember from the laptop 2-in-1hp Envy X360

The HP Envy X360 2-in-1 (2024) with 16 '' OLED screen is available in different configurations including that with AMD Ryzen 7,8840HS and 16 GB of RAM at a price of € 1050.

It has one of the most beautiful screens I saw on a convertible laptop.

It is a bit heavy.

A sublime screen

The HP Envy X360 16 ""2-in-1 presents itself with what all buyers expect a convertible:

A superb screen

Powerful speakers

Good equipment under the hood

The result is very correct performance and a satisfactory multimedia experience for a mid -range price.

Yes, a 16 -inch screen is large when used as a tablet, even a little difficult to handle. However, the OLED screen on this laptop is so good that it doesn't matter to me. In fact, it could be larger and I would gladly transport it anyway.

Yes, there are fingerprints

The Envy X360 has an OLED touch screen with a resolution of 2.8K (2880 x 1800) with a variable cooling rate of 120 Hz which provides a fluid visual experience. The brightness of 500 nits is more than sufficient for normal use. And the brilliant finish is magnificent (but may not suit everyone, because the fingerprints are common).

Reading the video is clear, with a realistic color depth and contrast. HP also announces that Envy X360 is a ""IMAX"" certified laptop. It is one of the first of its kind. He obtained this certification for his ability to display content in IMAX format at the original scale of 1.43: 1 or 1.90: 1.

The sound is also correct. Although it seems that the two vents on each side of the keyboard are speakers, the sound actually comes from the two speakers in the shape of a DTS bar: X Ultra located at the back of the device. There are not many bass. But the medium frequency sounds and the dialogues are clear and clear.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

It does not heat

The vents mentioned above on each side of the keyboard are actually used to evacuate the heat. So you can work with your knees without burning your legs in the first degree.

The Envy X360 is positioned just below the range of portable HP spectable computers. And their excellent performance meets most professional users.

The Envy X360 model that I tested is equipped with an AMD Radeon GPU which, associated with the AMD Ryzen 7,8840HS processor, can correctly perform gourmet processor resources and graphic tasks. This corresponds to the needs of creators and freelancers. It allows applications such as Davinci Resolve and Adobe Photoshop to operate without problem.

An effective fast load!

I found that the autonomy of this HP Envy X360 was better than the average. Especially for a laptop equipped with an OLED screen. Surely thanks to the Ryzen 7 8840HS Ryzen processor gains.

Thus, with intermittent use, the laptop battery lasted several days. With a sustained activity, I counted more than 10 hours of autonomy, which is more or less equivalent to what is announced.

The fast charging function is very good. I found it even faster than the 50% in 45 minutes announced by HP.

A very solid construction

The hinge type design (which is almost identical to that of Lenovo 7i 2-in-1) is robust! The screen oscillates very little. But it is resistant enough to stay in place when used as a touch screen.

That said, it is not a particularly light laptop. He weighs almost two kilos. Most of this weight is due to the 16 -inch OLED.

Despite its weight, it is very fine (only 1.8 cm). In short, this makes it a fairly transportable laptop.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDN

He misses a digital pavement

The selection of Ports de l'Evy X360 2024 will also be sufficient for most users. Two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, a 3.5 mm headphone jack and an HDMI port are present. And the keyboard is special. The keys are large and thick, in a matt gray color, with oversized letters in a font without distinct serif. It is beautiful. But a digital block is missing on the right, especially for a PC of this size.

My main criticism of this laptop is the bug that can occur when you go from one orientation to another. The transition from tablet mode to the classic mode can cause a delay or malfunction of the keyboard response. And the orientation of the screen can remain in a frozen position. This then makes a manual repositioning of the laptop to reset the gyroscope.

These problems are common on all 2-in-1 laptops that I tested. And they are intermittent enough not to be a problem. But at times, it can be frustrating to be confronted with equipment that does not work. You have to keep this in mind.

Purchase advice for the laptop 2-in-1hp Envy X360

The HP Envy X360 16 (2024) is offered at a reasonable price for a mid -range device with a superb screen and solid performance. The creators will appreciate the flexibility of this laptop and its impressive autonomy. After using it for a few weeks, I can say that it is my 2-in-1 favorite screen, despite its imperfections. It is a laptop for work as much as for entertainment.

Compared to its competitors, the HP model is more complete.

Take a look at Lenovo Yoga 7i. It is also an excellent device. But yoga is heavier and its screen is duller.

Microsoft's pro 11th generation surface undoubtedly has better equipment. But it is much smaller, with its 13 -inch touch screen.

The MacBook Pro is another excellent option. But do you really want to spend money on something that will probably be exceeded in a year or two?

If you are looking for a smaller option, think of the 14 -inch X360 2024 spectrum 2024.

For a daring option, take a look at the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i, which has two screens.

But last month, the billion monthly podcast listeners on YouTube was celebrated. Indeed, listening to audio content is experiencing crazy growth and the creators of podcasts are always more likely to house their episodes on the application.

Between the podcasts animated by celebrities and the integration of video elements, the listening experience (for premium subscribers) on YouTube attracts more and more Internet users. Depending on the platform, video podcasts are more than a simple trend, they touch the public where it is: that is to say on YouTube. Faced with this, the platform strives to allow fans to find more easily the content they like, to discover new ones and to listen to them/look where and when it sings.

The figures are surprising! The number one video platform is also able to generate a very important audio engagement. A success carried out largely by the creators of content and celebrities, who use the Podcast format as a secondary relay to highlight their work. It is therefore logical to see the audience following the movement.

Last year, more than 400 million hours of podcasts were consumed monthly on living room devices. And today, YouTube is the most used tool to listen to podcasts in the United States.

This feature combines agents, skills and models to perform actions in several stages for users. This allows for example to do:

Meeting of meetings after identifying an hour that suits everyone

The generation of clips

Document writing

""AI Companion goes from the status of personal assistant to that of real agent,"" said Smita Hashim, Director General of Zoom.

AI COMPANION's agent capacities

The company is launching Zoom Tasks, which identifies the actions to be taken in meeting summaries, cats and emails, then performs tasks, such as planning a follow -up meeting or the creation of a document. Zoom Tasks should be launched at the end of the month and can be integrated into a zoom document.

Zoom

A new voice recording function accessible on the Zoom Workplace mobile application will also be launched at the end of March. It makes it possible to transcribe, summarize and capture conversations during face -to -face meetings so that users can consult the notes later.

This vocal recording function seems similar, in its features, to existing transcription services, such as Otter.ai.

Agenda timer to orient meetings!

Another feature, Meeting Agendas With Ai Companion, can help meetings stay on the right track by allowing hosts to add agenda timer to sections and receive live notes generated by AI during meetings. And this via the new Live Notes for Meetings and Phone feature (live notes for meetings and the phone). These two features should be launched in May.

The vocal recording function. Zoom

Zoom also launches an AI companion for booking a workspace. This function indicates to users the days when their colleagues are supposed to be at the office, and uses this information to suggest days when going to the office according to the scheduled meetings. It even allows you to book an office or a zoom room for meetings. This feature should be launched in May.

Zoom products, such as Zoom Docs, will also have new functions with AI Companion, such as Advanced References, whose launch is scheduled for June. This function makes it possible to create an editorial plan based on internal and external references and to place it in a document.

Zoom Ai Companion is always free for paid users

Zoom Docs will also have a function of creating data tables in July, which will make it possible to ask AI Companion to create data tables from content, including summary of meetings. The company is also launching Zoom Drive. The product should be launched in May and will host Zoom Workplace assets.

Despite these additions, Zoom Ai Companion is still free for users with paid services in their zoom account.

For those who want even more AI assistance, Zoom also introduces a Custom AI Companion complementary function which allows users to personalize technology according to their needs.

Custom Ai Companion Add-on

The complementary Custom AI Companion module includes many options. These options include:

The creation of personalized meeting models

The creation of meeting summary models

The creation of dictionaries with terms specific to the functions of the company

The incorporation of internal data and knowledge from third -party applications

Access to a personal coach

Users can also access Custom Avatars for Zoom Clips, which allows you to create clips using a script supplied by the user and a ""personalized avatar generated by AI"".

The Custom AI Companion extension costs $ 12 per user and per month and will be available in April. The personal coach function should be launched in June. The complementary module uses new small linguistic models (SLM) of zoom and large linguistic models (LLM) of third parties.

Last fall, Google announced that it officially replaced Assistant, the default Android assistant for your phone by Gemini. So you still had the possibility of using Assistant so far. But this option therefore ends. And users must go to Gemini.

But gradually. In a recent blog post, Google announced that it officially ended Assistant. ""In the course of the year, the classic Google assistant will no longer be accessible to most mobile devices and will no longer be downloaded from mobile application stores,"" said Google.

For smartphones, as for cars

This change means that users with routines and reminders with assistant will have to create new ones with Gemini.

Telephones are not the only ones to be updated. Google added that Gemini would also arrive on tablets, cars, devices that connect to your phone, such as watches and headphones, domestic devices, such as speakers and screens, and ""televisions in the coming months"".

The only way to keep assistant is that your device does not meet the minimum conditions required, namely at least 2 GB of RAM and Android 10 or a later version.

Why did Google proceed to this change?

Google said millions of people have already changed, Gemini being now available in more than 40 languages ​​and more than 200 countries.

Why did Google proceed to this change?

The objective is that Gemini becomes a technology that goes beyond the assistant capabilities.

To more personalization

Google added a support to allow Gemini to do what the assistant could do - basic tasks, such as timer adjustment, media reading, reminders and control of intelligent domestic devices.

However, Google wishes to create an assistant capable of interacting with other applications and services, which is aware of the world around you, in order to make you more productive and creative.

This is a first in Europe says the operator, who sees this initiative a desire to innovate to simplify the experience of travelers.

Concretely, the purchase of transport titles with virtual currencies can now be done via the Tisséo mobile application (Android). It was obviously already possible to pay with a bank card. And this is therefore now possible with cryptocurrencies.

Pay in crypto, what advantage for pros?

Tisseo mentions that ""nearly 150,000 monthly validations have been identified via the dematerialized purchase service since 2018"".

The design and deployment of this new feature is made possible by the French Fintech Lyzi, which uses the Crypto Binance platform. The cost of integrating this type of payment into cryptos is 50,000 euros.

The possibility of paying goods and services in crypto can be an asset for professionals. According to Adan and KPMG, 12% of French people hold cryptocurrencies. In this context, some restaurateurs, hoteliers and even service companies see the possibility of accepting cryptopaments, in order to attract customers sensitive to these new technologies. In addition to the innovative aspect, more and more companies also seek to diversify their payment solutions to facilitate transactions with foreign tourists without going through the exchange of currencies.

In transport, but also in retail

Payment in crypto also develops in retail. Lyzi in August of last year announced that the Spring brand made payment in crypto ""in the 20th stores spring in France"" possible.

Paypal, the famous online payment service, went to cryptos in 2022.

For his part, Sacha Briand, member of the Tisséo Communities union committee and deputy mayor of Toulouse, insists on the experimental nature of this offer: “The payments in cryptocurrencies begin to democratize. We want to see if this corresponds to a concrete use for our customers and if this offer can be generalized in the long term, ”he said to BFMTV.

The technical starting point, which feeds suspicions is that your smartphone is constantly using its microphone so that your assistant can hear the voice commands. And it's probably not the only device to do so.

But do these devices hear other things that you say apart from vocal orders? And do conversations in the background leave your device?

How do you know if your phone listens to you?

Start by choosing a unique subject that you have never wanted on your smartphone. Or that you have never discussed before. It must be a subject that has nothing to do with your usual centers of interest, explains NordVPN.

Discuss this subject for several days, making sure you are close to your phone every time. Talk about the subject and specific subjects linked to it (such as tourist sites or hotels in a certain city). But do not do online research on this subject.

During the following days, pay attention to the advertisements you see appear. It can be your social media news, websites you visit, applications and even on your TV. If you are starting to see advertisements on the subject you have chosen, you have confirmed that your phone is listening.

What to do if your device listens to you?

If you find out that your listening phone, NordVPN recommends some measures.

First of all, check the authorizations of applications on your devices (especially microphone and location) and limit applications that do not need to access it. Please note, this can cause the deletion of certain very practical features.

Then manage the data from your voice assistant. Erase the vocal history of Google, Siri or Alexa, because your vocal orders can say a lot about your private life.

Then make sure that updates to your software tools are made. According to NordVPN, these updates do not only concern the addition of new features, but also the application of critical security fixes, which can patcher flaws on your device.

Although a targeted advertising based on a conversation may seem innocent, says in conclusion Marijus Briedis, DT at NordVPN, it is an indicator that your device has too much access to your data.",zdnet

A master stroke allowed thanks to a high -volley hacking of the French gendarmes, unveiled in July 2020. Probably helped by the National Technical Service of Capture, a structure attached to the DGSI, they had managed to hack the Emprochat mail. Handmakers over 115 million conversations between 60,000 users.

This kind of operation then flourished, with other procedures against messaging of the same type, such as Sky-ECC. It is indeed more relevant to tackle an infrastructure used by criminals rather than each criminal organization separately.

Another Canadian arrested

At the risk, however, denounce the criticisms of this kind of operation, to make a too wide fishing, taking people in their nets simply concerned with their safety.

On the contrary, as a source close to investigations in the Parisian said, investigators rather think that messaging was ""created on order"" at the request of thugs.

A point which will be, in the event of a trial, at the heart of the debates. In addition to the person who must be extradited from Switzerland, French justice already holds another major player in the case. It is Paul Kruksy, also Canadian, presented as the boss of the communication solution. It was extradited around France just over a year ago from the Dominican Republic.",zdnet

The device could simply become the most expensive model ever marketed by the brand, with a price of around $ 2,300.

This price would be close to that of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, currently sold at $ 1,200 (and € 1480 in France!).

The folding iPhone would not arrive before 2027

After a visit to Asia where he met several manufacturers of components, Tim Long claims that discussions around a folding iPhone are intensifying within the supply chain. The device could be launched at the end of 2026 or early 2027. But its high price may limit its sales.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a specialist in the apple brand, shares a similar forecast. According to him, the price of the future folding iPhone could oscillate between $ 2,000 and $ 2,500.

However, he believes that if Apple manages to eliminate the visible fold on the screen, the demand could be there despite a high cost.

What should we expect?

According to Ming-Chi Kuo, this model would embark an internal screen of 7.8 inch and an external screen of 5.5 inch. It would be equipped with two rear cameras, a front camera, a power button integrating Touch ID, as well as a high density battery.

On the design side, the device would be distinguished by a reduced thickness: 4.5 mm once unfolded and between 9 and 9.5 mm once folded.

Its exterior could be designed in titanium, while the hinge would associate titanium and stainless steel. Production should start in the fourth quarter of 2026.",zdnet

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

In an email sent last week to several customers, Amazon announces that as from March 28, the option which prevented audio sharing of Alexa requests with the company would be deleted. Available for users of certain Echo devices, this option deals with Alexa requests locally instead of sending the records to the cloud.

Although this option seems to be available for all Alexa users, it was limited to users of Echo Dot 4th generation, Echo Show 10 and Echo Show 15, and only to people residing in the United States whose language is English.

What impact on confidentiality?

To respond to these concerns, Amazon indicates that it will automatically update the privacy settings of the users concerned so as not to keep voice recordings. In this case, the recordings will always be shared with Amazon. However, they will be deleted once the request was processed. Amazon will also remove all the previous recordings that are still accessible.

Even with the option ""Do not send vocal records"" activated, your requests to Alexa are never completely deprived. Admittedly, the audio of your conversations is not sent to the cloud. However, the textual transcriptions of your requests are shared so that Alexa can answer you, indicates a help page from Amazon. In addition, the audio of certain Alexa requests, such as a call or send a message, is always sent to the cloud.

Another feature requiring cloud access is voice identification. It allows Alexa to recognize your voice to provide you with more personalized answers. When you configure a voice identification, the audio recordings that learn your voice to Alexa are shared with Amazon. If you do not allow the sending of your vocal recordings to the Amazon cloud, the voice identification will not work.

In 2023, the company was sentenced to a fine of $ 25 million in the United States for misleading users on Alexa's practices in terms of data deletion. Two years earlier, researchers had discovered that only a small number of Alexa skills had a privacy policy. In 2019, a report revealed that Amazon employees listened to Alexa's requests to improve its precision. The same year, the company recognized that the voice recordings were kept indefinitely, unless users deleted them manually.

Alexa+ and confidentiality

Confidentiality will be an important factor with the launch of Alexa+.

Thanks to AI, the new service will be able to manage requests and conversations more naturally, such as Chatgpt or Google Gemini.

This means that it will respond with a more fluid rhythm, will lead longer conversations, will manage several requests, will generate content and process documents. To take advantage of all this, the counterpart will probably be to give up a little privacy.",zdnet

Launched on March 11 for the Tuesday patch this month, the KB5053598 patch was aimed at paying several important bugs and adding new features to Windows 11.

But these developments are accompanied by a new problem affecting Microsoft's AI application.

Microsoft recognizes the bug and gives a solution

In a press release published after the publication of the update, Microsoft reveals that the Copilot application is involuntarily uninstalled and removed from the taskbar on certain devices. This bug affects only the standard COPILOT application, not the COPILOT application of Microsoft 365, available via a Microsoft 365 subscription.

Microsoft says it works on a solution to solve the problem. ""In the meantime, the users concerned can reinstall the application from the Microsoft Store and pin it manually at the taskbar,"" said the company. To do this, it is necessary to access the COPILOT page of the Microsoft Store, download the application, then run the .exe file.

Once the installation is complete, to reintegrate Copilot into the taskbar, click on the Start button and search for Copilot in the menu or on the screen all. Finally, it is necessary to right click on your shortcut, access the menu more and click on pin at the taskbar. You can then launch and use Copilot normally.

Act promptly before the end of the Windows 10 support

Windows 11 has been assigned by many bugs, most of the most recent concerning the 24H2 version. Microsoft always tries to correct certain unresolved problems, including those accidentally introduced by certain updates.

This bug with Copilot is relatively minor, because it is easy to solve by reinstalling the application. But that shows that Microsoft continues to encounter difficulties that affect the stability and reliability of Windows 11 24H2.

A problem that the company must imperatively solve before ending Windows 10 support next October.",zdnet

The AI ​​Factory France project, that is to say the creation of a factory to make artificial intelligence, was selected as part of the European EuroHPC program.

The EuroHPC program aims to provide the European Union with ultra-powerful calculation infrastructure, optimized for AI. Yes because the true engine of artificial intelligence is a huge computing power. But when we open the door of an AI factory, what do you find there?

Partners

First, there are partners.

And in the list of these partners, there are prestigious names like Inria, CNRS, CEA or Station-F.

Their role is to federate a decentralized AI ecosystem. And this by providing calculation, data, training and financing resources.

Huge computers

Then, and there are huge computers, capable of doing high performance calculation.

The Jean Zay Supercalculator, already in service since 2019, will be mobilized. But also the future super computer Alice Recoque, which will be named after a famous French computer scientist.

It must enter into production in 2026. And it must allow France to cross a decisive course in terms of computing power.

Guarantee European sovereignty in AI

Finally, the ambition behind this project is to guarantee European sovereignty in AI.

The EU provides 13 AI factories spread over the continent, with an overall investment of 1.5 billion euros.

These infrastructure will prioritize in strategic sectors such as health, energy, defense and aeronautics.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

To better understand this advance, here is a simplified explanation of its main characteristics.

A truly revolutionary technology?

Called soberly ""new RGB LED"", this display technology provides individual control of the three primary colors - red, green and blue - thus offering an independent light emission for each shade. Result: a better return of colors. The images will cover 99 % of the colorimetric space DCI-P3 and approximately 90 % of the ITU-R BT.2020 standard.

The Japanese manufacturer also incorporates its ""backlight control technology"", designed to accurately reproduce shades and subtle gradients. What strengthen the realism of the images displayed on future televisions.

Thanks to its new technology, the screen automatically adjusts its brightness according to color variations.

A high binary flow of 96 bits

In comparison, conventional high -light conventional televisions tend to focus light on the most radiant areas of the image. If this allows you to get bright colors, it is often done at the expense of details. The subtleties of degrades and nuances are lost, which can give a less natural and sometimes dull overall rendering.

The new RGB LED is also distinguished by its rapid signal treatment, with a high binary flow of 96 bits. This performance offers two major advantages:

A simultaneous expression of deep blacks and brilliant whites

Large vision angles

Collaboration with Mediatek

By the way, Sony also promises to return image without visual artefacts, eliminating current defects such as the clipping of whites or the crushing of blacks, for a more faithful visual experience.

The launch date of the first televisions equipped with RGB LED technology remains unknown. But Sony announces a production for the end of the year.

To carry out this project, the technological giant collaborates with industrial partners, in particular Mediatek.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"SAP Japan announces ""Business Data Cloud"" -- Generation AI also deploys consulting functions",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230645/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:36:00 GMT","SAPジャパンは3月18日、2月にグローバルで発表した新たなマネージド型クラウドサービス「SAP Business Data Cloud」（関連記事）に関する説明会を開き、同サービスを第2四半期から一般提供すると発表した。また、第2四半期では生成AIアシスタントの「Joule」で、SAPコンサルタント向けの機能を提供することも明らかにした。



SAP Business Data Cloudの構成概要（SAPジャパン説明資料より） SAP Business Data Cloudの構成概要（SAPジャパン説明資料より）

既報の通りBusiness Data Cloudは、あらゆるSAPのシステムのデータおよび非SAPシステムのデータも統合、集約し、各種データをSAPのアプリケーションやAIで利用できるためのデータプラットフォームになる。このために同社は、Databricksとも協業している。

説明したSAPジャパン Business Data Cloud ソリューションアドバイザリー部 ソリューションアドバイザーエキスパートの椛田后一氏によると、同サービスは、異なるシステムが持つデータをAIが理解できるよう整合性を確保する役割を担うとのこと。SAP Business Data Cloudは、大きく「ビジネスデータファブリック」「Insight Apps」「データプロダクト」で構成されている。

まず中心となるが、ビジネスデータファブリックだという。SAPはデータの統合・管理の「SAP Datasphere」やデータ分析の「SAP Analytics Cloud」も提供しているが、Business Data Cloudでは、この2つをビジネスデータファブリックに組み込み、「SAP S/4HANA」のデータや非SAPシステムのデータをSAP DatasphereでS/4HANAの「Core Data Services」（CDS）のモデルに再現。そのデータを例えば、SAP Analytics Cloudで可視化するといった利用を実現する。

次にデータプロダクトは、マスターデータやトランザクションデータ、オブジェクトデータ、アナリティクスデータなどユースケースに応じたデータセットのカタログになり、ユーザーはカタログから目的のデータセットを選択することで、容易かつ速やかに利用を始められるとのこと。S/4HANAなどのシステムと同期し、S/4HANAでのデータの変更などはリアルタイムにデータプロダクトにも反映されるという。

また、「SAP Knowledge Graph」というナレッジグラフ機能も提供する。ビジネスデータの関係性をナレッジグラフとして容易に構造化、保持でき、そのコンテキストなどを生成AIエージェントなどに活用したりもできるとする。データの正確性を担保することでAIのハルシネーション（誤情報生成）を減少できるとしている。

Insight Appsでは、あらゆるSAPアプリケーションの一貫した可視性をユーザーに提供するダッシュボード機能になる。各種基幹業務や人的資源管理、支出管理、顧客分析、サプライチェーン分析といった業務で正確性の高い洞察を提供し、ユーザーはテンプレートを用いて、すぐに目的に応じた利用を開始できるという。

Business Data Cloudの各種機能の高度な利用や、そのケイパビリティーを引き出す上で重要な点がDatabricksとの連携だという。これによりユーザーは、Databricksのデータ基盤で管理しているデータをゼロコピーでBusiness Data Cloudから利用できるようになり、機械学習技術を生かした洞察の獲得といったことを透過的に実現、ネイティブに近い形で利用できるようになるとした。

なお椛田氏は、Business Data Cloudでは、「SAP Business Warehouse」（SAP BW）の機能も組み込んでいると説明。SAP BWは、実質的に旧来製品の位置付けにある。椛田氏によれば、SAP BWをオンプレミス環境で使用中のユーザーは、まずSAP BWの稼働基盤をクラウドに移行（リフト）し、次にBusiness Data Cloudと連携を開始して、適用範囲を拡大していく。同氏は、既存のSAP BWの資産を生かしつつBusiness Data Cloudへ順次移行することを推奨していると明言した。

また、SAPのクラウドオファリングとなる「GROW with SAP」と「RISE with SAP」でもBusiness Data Cloudと同等機能が順次提供されていくという。

説明会では、常務執行役員 最高事業責任者の堀川嘉朗氏がSAPジャパンのAI戦略の概況などに触れた。同社は、2月に開催した2025年のビジネス戦略説明会で代表取締役社長の鈴木洋史氏が「AIファースト、スイートファースト」という方向性を示した。

堀川氏は、これを踏まえて日本市場向けにもAIの提供範囲を順次拡大しているなどと強調。特に2025年は、AIエージェントの拡充と推進、展開を重点施策の1つに位置付けており、堀川氏は、Jouleにおいて、2025年第1四半期にSAPアプリケーション開発者向け機能、同第2四半期からSAPコンサルタント向け機能をそれぞれ提供すると述べた。

開発者向け機能では、開発者が機能要件などをJouleに入力するだけで、Jouleが「Advanced Business Application Programming」（ABAP）の推奨コードを自動生成してくれる。開発生産性の大幅な向上が期待されるという。

SAPコンサルタント向け機能では、パートナーなどのSAPコンサルタントが顧客からヒアリングなどにより得た要件をJouleに入力するだけで、Jouleがベストプラクティスなどに基づいて顧客要件に最適化したSAPシステムの設計、構成、実装支援などを行う。堀川氏は、これによってSAPシステムにまつわるプロジェクトの形が大きく変わると強調した。

堀川氏は、こうしたSAPジャパンのAI推進においてもBusiness Data Cloudが重要な位置付けになるなどと説明している。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"Qualtrics announces ""Experience Agents"" AI agent -- Accelerating customer response improvements",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230633/,"Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT","AI agents can be said to be the next frontline for AI assistants, as they not only answer questions but also perform tasks. By deploying AI agents, Qualtrics aims to help its technology interact directly with customers and improve the customer experience (CX).

On March 17th, Qualtrics announced its AI agent, Qualtrics Experience Agents, ahead of its own event, the X4 2025 Experience Management Summit (18th-20th), to be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. This is an assistant function that involves interacting with customers and quickly and empathizes with them, and understands and resolves issues.

""Our approach is how we can expand what our customers are already using and enable businesses to respond to every interaction,"" Brad Anderson, president of product, user experience (UX) and engineering at Qualtrics, told ZDNET.

Experience Agents operate at a variety of customer contact points, including surveys, contact center interactions, and posting product reviews. The agent aims to complete a series of customer feedback processes by instantly providing answers that are appropriate for individual requirements.

Qualtrics cited examples of sports fans giving feedback on how slow food service was being provided during games. Experience Agents can interact with their fans, understand issues and respond individually.

At the briefing before the presentation, I had the opportunity to see Experience Agents running. During the demonstration, a customer from an airline provided additional feedback on issues they received in a Qualtrics survey, and the author was impressed by the agent's speed and quality of responses. The answers are not only quick but also empathetic, and it can be said that the quality of customer service is high, which is often overlooked by traditional chatbots and even experts.

A major feature of Experience Agents is that they not only streamline internal processes, but also interact directly with customers and ensure that they provide a better experience. In the future, Qualtrics aims to develop agents that predict customer needs based on past interactions with employees and internal industry expertise.

When asked about the possibility that client companies might hesitate to interact with their customers directly, Anderson said, ""We value accuracy and have a team working on AI ethics and safety measures."" Qualtrics has published many of its research on its dedicated page, ""Trust Center,"" to dispel concerns from its client companies.",zdnet
