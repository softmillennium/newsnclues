The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has received approval from the Centre for the Chandrayaan-5 mission, ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan confirmed. The mission, aimed at further advancing India's lunar exploration capabilities, is part of the country's long-term goal of achieving a human landing on the Moon by 2040. The announcement was made during an event held in Chennai, where Narayanan also outlined ISRO's roadmap, including the development of an Indian Space Station by 2035. The Chandrayaan-5 mission is expected to feature a 350 kg rover and will involve collaboration with Japan.

According to reports, ISRO has outlined multiple upcoming missions, including Chandrayaan-4, which will focus on landing and sample collection. Chandrayaan-5 is expected to enhance lunar exploration by deploying a high-capacity lander, a critical step towards future human landings. Last year, Union Minister Jitendra Singh confirmed government approval for Chandrayaan-4, which will test key technologies for landing, sample collection, and a safe return to Earth.

Additionally, ISRO has been tasked with the development of an independent space station, named "Bharatiya Antriksh Station," scheduled for completion by 2035. Plans are also underway to send Indian astronauts to the Moon aboard an indigenous rocket.

Reports indicate that ISRO has been expanding its launch capabilities, with significant progress made in satellite deployment. Since 2014, India has launched satellites for 34 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Canada. Over the past decade, 393 foreign satellites and three Indian commercial satellites have been launched using PSLV, LVM3, and SSLV launch vehicles.
The upcoming rocket launch facility at Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu is expected to play a key role in small satellite launches. Construction began on March 5, 2024, following the foundation stone-laying ceremony by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The spaceport will focus on polar launches using the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), with production supported by Indian industry.

During the Chennai event, Narayanan highlighted ISRO's achievements, including Chandrayaan-1's discovery of water on the Moon and Chandrayaan-3's successful landing at the lunar south pole, making India the first country to achieve this milestone. He also mentioned India's progress in solar research, stating that the country has become the fourth nation to launch a dedicated satellite for studying the Sun.

The event was attended by several dignitaries, including former Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, former MLA Vijayadharani, and former Chennai Mayor Saidai Duraisamy.

Blockchain technology is reshaping industries beyond cryptocurrencies. Initially developed for Bitcoin transactions, blockchain has evolved into a powerful tool for securing data, automating processes, and improving transparency. Governments, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and supply chain managers are exploring blockchain's potential.

This article explores blockchain's future, its applications, and the challenges it must overcome.

Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain is immutable, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be altered. This feature makes it valuable for applications requiring trust and security.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies use blockchain to facilitate secure, borderless transactions. Blockchain reduces reliance on banks, enabling faster and cheaper international payments.

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with terms written in code. They eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency in legal, financial, and business transactions.

Companies use blockchain to track products from manufacturing to delivery. This improves transparency, reduces fraud, and ensures authenticity in industries like food safety, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods.

Blockchain enables secure storage and sharing of patient records. Hospitals and clinics can access verified data while maintaining patient privacy, reducing errors and improving treatment efficiency.

Blockchain-based voting systems enhance election security by preventing tampering and ensuring transparency. Several countries and organisations are exploring blockchain voting solutions to increase trust in electoral processes.

DeFi platforms use blockchain to provide financial services without banks. Users can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, increasing financial inclusion.

Blockchain's encryption and decentralised nature make it resistant to hacking. Industries handling sensitive data, such as banking and healthcare, benefit from its security features.

Blockchain creates permanent, tamper-proof records, reducing fraud and corruption. Businesses and governments can use it to increase accountability in transactions and record-keeping.

Real estate, art, stocks, and commodities can be tokenised on the blockchain, allowing fractional ownership and easier asset trading. This can increase liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets.

Blockchain can complement AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. For example, blockchain can enhance IoT security by preventing data breaches in connected devices.

Many blockchain networks struggle with slow transaction speeds and high fees. Solutions like layer-2 scaling and blockchain sharding aim to address these limitations.

Governments worldwide are still developing blockchain regulations. Inconsistent laws create uncertainty for businesses and investors, slowing adoption.

Some blockchain networks, like Bitcoin, consume large amounts of energy due to mining processes. Sustainable alternatives, such as proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, are being developed to reduce environmental impact.

Businesses and governments must invest in infrastructure and workforce training to implement blockchain effectively. Adoption remains slow due to high costs and resistance to change.

Blockchain technology is expected to evolve with innovations that address scalability, security, and energy concerns. Key trends include:

Blockchain technology offers immense opportunities for businesses, governments, and individuals. While challenges remain, ongoing advancements in scalability, security, and regulation will drive its growth. As blockchain becomes more integrated into everyday life, it will revolutionise industries and redefine digital trust.

CorPower Ocean has secured financial backing from Vinnova, Sweden's national innovation agency, for a project exploring the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for improved performance and control in wave energy technology.

The WACE project, short for Wave energy AI-based Control Enhancement, is now underway and is set to run until November 2025.

CorPower Ocean is being supported by project partner Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

A model-based design framework will be used in the WACE project. After establishing requirements for the closed-loop control system, an AI-based optimal control strategy is being designed along with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test setup.

CorPower Ocean anticipates that its wave energy converters are operated in arrays or farms which will generate a vast amount of data. This project also aims for utilizing the available data to enhance an existing model-predictive control strategy combining optimal model-based control with AI.

This combination allows the exploration of more performant control schemes while keeping the devices in its feasible operating region. The performance of the developed algorithm will be proven using HIL testing providing a realistic real-time environment while using the existing operating strategy as a baseline.

“The optimal operation of wave energy converters is one of the key factors to lower the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ultimately making it an attractive part of the future clean energy mix. The main goal of the WACE Project is to combine AI methods with optimal control to enhance our existing operating strategy and further improve the performance of our point absorber type wave energy converter,” said Gabriel Forstner, WACE Project Lead and CorPower Ocean Control Engineer.

A key feature of CorPower Ocean's technology is its ability to tune and detune according to ocean conditions, limiting the response to storms and amplifying the motion and power capture in normal waves.

This feature has been demonstrated during the operational period of the company's C4 device in Aguçadoura, off Portugal. The verification of the amplified motion and power capture by the phase control system is seen as a key outcome from the HiWave-5 demonstration project.

Wave farm projects are being developed by customers using CorPower Ocean's technology along the Atlantic Arc, including sites in Scotland, Ireland, Portugal and Norway.

One project is being developed by Ireland's state-owned energy supplier, ESB, off the coast of County Clare, following two decades of investigating a wide variety of technologies.

The pre-commercial phase of the EU-backed Saoirse Wave project, will involve CorPower Ocean wave energy converts as part of a CorPack cluster.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Facebook (now Meta) executive, has published a shocking memoir, Careless People: A Story of Where I Used to Work, exposing the inner workings of the social media giant. The book details Facebook's toxic work culture, aggressive global expansion tactics, and how CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team prioritized growth over ethics. Originally reported by The Guardian, Wynn-Williams' revelations highlight Facebook's failures, from data privacy concerns to enabling political manipulation and even workplace harassment.

Wynn-Williams worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2018, rising to the position of director of global public policy. She describes the company as an almost “cult-like” environment, where employees were expected to be devoted to its mission at all costs.

In one shocking incident, she recalls working on a memo during labour, moments before giving birth. She was drafting an update on Facebook's expansion in Myanmar for then-COO Sheryl Sandberg. Her husband was furious, but the hospital doctor had to step in and physically close her laptop.

She also highlights Facebook's extreme work expectations for women, referencing Sandberg's Lean In philosophy, which encouraged women to work tirelessly, even during pregnancy. The reality, she later realized, was that this culture promoted self-exploitation rather than empowerment.

One of the book's most alarming revelations is Facebook's role in fueling hate speech and violence in Myanmar. Zuckerberg's Free Basics program, which aimed to provide free internet access in developing countries, was marketed as a philanthropic effort. However, Wynn-Williams exposes how it was a strategy for Facebook to dominate the internet in those regions.

She admits that initially, she believed in Facebook's mission to connect the world. However, she later realized that in Myanmar, Facebook became a tool for the military junta to spread hate speech and incite violence against the Muslim Rohingya population.

Wynn-Williams writes, “Myanmar would have been a better place if Facebook had not arrived.”

The book also details widespread sexual harassment on Facebook. Wynn-Williams recounts how senior executives, including Meta's global affairs chief Joel Kaplan, allegedly made inappropriate advances toward female employees. She describes a company culture where high-ranking men were protected while women were expected to stay silent.

She also shares a disturbing incident in which Sandberg invited her to sleep in the same bed during a work trip. While she declined, she later worried that rejecting the offer might have harmed her career.

According to Wynn-Williams, Facebook's leadership, including Mark Zuckerberg, knew about these issues but did little to address them.

Wynn-Williams criticizes Facebook's handling of political advertising and misinformation, particularly during the 2016 US elections. She describes how Facebook's ad-targeting system was used to spread disinformation, influence elections, and manipulate users.

She accuses Zuckerberg of misleading Congress about the extent of Facebook's cooperation with the Chinese government. She claims that behind closed doors, Facebook was developing censorship tools to comply with China's strict regulations, contradicting Zuckerberg's public statements.

Following the book's release, Meta dismissed Wynn-Williams' claims, stating that she was a disgruntled former employee trying to sell books. A company spokesperson labelled the memoir “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims, along with false accusations about our executives.”

Despite this, Wynn-Williams argues that Facebook's culture remains unchanged, even after rebranding to Meta. She warns that as Zuckerberg expands into artificial intelligence, the company's irresponsibility and pursuit of profit could pose even greater risks.

Her book, published by Pan Macmillan, serves as a critical insider account of Facebook's rise to power, its internal dysfunction, and the consequences of its unchecked influence on society.

OpenAI and Google, having long trained their ravenous bots on the work of newsrooms like this one, now want to throw out long-established copyright law by arguing, we kid you not, that the only way for the United States to defeat the Chinese Communist Party is for those tech giants to steal the content created with the sweat equity of America's human journalists.“With a Chinese Communist Party determined to overtake us by 2030,” OpenAI wrote Thursday to the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy, “the Trump administration's new action plan can ensure that American-led A.I. built on democratic principles can prevail over CCP-built, autocratic, authoritarian AI.”Built on democratic principles? More like built on outright theft.That's why news organizations, including this one and the New York Times, have sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft over their breaking copyright law by vacuuming up millions of newspaper articles without permission or payment, constituting copyright infringement on a colossal scale.Now OpenAI comes back with the absurd argument that this was somehow necessary for national security.In their letter, Sam Altman's crew added a whole lot of obfuscating, self-serving blather about “scaling human ingenuity” and “freedom of learning and knowledge” while describing the innovations of ChatGPT as part of some great and glorious trajectory from domesticated horses to steam power to electricity to printing presses and the internet.You see the irony there? Printing presses.For generations, those presses sent out the work of America's reporters, the fruits of capital invested, and hard labor performed, in city halls and crime scenes and throughout all the communities they served. They amplified and distributed a news organization's work, as now does the internet.

They didn't steal the work of someone else and then pass it off as their own.Gutting generations of copyright protections for the benefit of AI bots would have a chilling effect not just on news organizations but on all creative content creators, from novelists to playwrights to poets. That iron-clad commitment to protecting the rights of owners of work they themselves created is precisely what distinguishes the United States from Communist China, not the reverse.This country has dominated the world of news and information by respecting not just the precious freedom of the press but also its right to protect its work. Had it not done so, there would have been no economic base on which to build the kinds of news organizations that can, and still do, keep a check on the government. Heck, there would have been no economic basis to build anything creative whatsoever.Securing permission from, and fairly compensating, those publishers who created this great foundation of knowledge is the right, just and American thing to do.The government should reject these self-serving proposals and protect the work of artists, authors, photographers, journalists and all other creators and copyright holders who have been the victims of these companies.This editorial is being published in more than 60 daily newspapers throughout the MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing networks.
