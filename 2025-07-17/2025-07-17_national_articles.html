                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell responded by letter Thursday to a senior Trump administration official who accused the head of the central bank of mismanaging an “ostentatious overhaul” of its Washington, DC, headquarters. “Instead of attempting to right the Fed's fiscal ship, you have plowed ahead with an ostentatious overhaul of your Washington D.C. headquarters.” Powell said in his response late Thursday that the renovation and its financing have always had careful oversight from the central bank's board and its own watchdog. “We have taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen since it was first approved by the Board in 2017,” Powell wrote. Additionally, Powell said upgrades that were reflected in official planning documents submitted to the NCPC in 2021 were later taken out, but the Fed didn't need to resubmit paperwork because they weren't “substantial.” The changes were instead “intended to simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,” Powell wrote. “The Board does not regard any of these changes as warranting further review.” In his letter, Powell noted that both buildings needed “significant structural repairs and other updates… including the removal of asbestos and lead contamination, complete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and -2- suppression systems.” Powell, who cannot be removed except “for cause,” presides over the Fed's monetary policy committee that has been holding interest rates at current levels all year, contrary to President Donald Trump's wishes for lower borrowing costs. “When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,” Trump told reporters this week, adding that he believes it is “sort of” a fireable offense. Last month, Powell was asked about the central bank's renovation plans during his biannual testimony before Congress and pushed back on the assertion that he has overlooked the project's steep price tag to indulge in upscale design features. We took down the old marble while putting it back up,” Powell said. Vought's July 10 letter accused Powell of lying in his testimony. In his response Thursday, Powell clarified that some features, including new water features, had been eliminated in the years since the initial design proposal. “These changes were intended to simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,” Powell wrote. He clarified that while there are no “roof terrace gardens,” a parking lot is being constructed under the building, meaning the ground-level front lawn will serve as a “roof” for the parking structure. Marble sourced from Georgia would be used in places where the original marble structure was damaged, he said. A 2023 Fed budget document attributed some of the additional cost to “significant increases in raw materials… higher labor costs, and changes in construction schedule expectations which lengthen use of leased space.” The Fed has previously said materials and equipment for the project have been sourced from 32 states and Washington, D.C.

Demonstrators standoff against law enforcement on horseback during a protest, June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. Protesters confront Marines outside the Federal Building on July 4, 2025 in Los Angeles. CHICAGO (AP) — Protests and events against President Donald Trump's controversial policies that include mass deportations and cuts to Medicaid and other safety nets for poor people have started Thursday at more than 1,600 locations around the country. The “Good Trouble Lives On” national day of action honors the late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. Protests were being held along streets, at court houses and other public spaces. Organizers have called for them to be peaceful. “We are navigating one of the most terrifying moments in our nation's history,” Public Citizen co-president Lisa Gilbert said during an online news conference Tuesday. “We are all grappling with a rise of authoritarianism and lawlessness within our administration ... as the rights, freedoms and expectations of our very democracy are being challenged.” Lewis first was elected to Congress in 1986. He died in 2020 at the age of 80 following an advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Lewis was beaten by police, suffering a skull fracture. Within days, King led more marches in the state, and President Lyndon Johnson pressed Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act that later became law. “Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America,” Lewis said in 2020 while commemorating the 1965 voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Chicago will be the flagship city for Thursday's protests as demonstrators are expected to rally downtown in the afternoon. Much of the rest of the rally will have a livelier tone, Magness said, adding “we have a DJ who's gonna rock us with boots on the ground.” Pushback against Trump so far in his second term has centered on deportations and immigration enforcement tactics Earlier this month, protesters engaged in a tense standoff as federal authorities conducted mass arrests at two Southern California marijuana farms. Those raids followed Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard outside federal buildings and to protect immigration agents carrying out arrests on Los Angeles. On June 8, thousands of protesters began taking to the streets in Los Angeles. Demonstrators labeled Trump as a dictator and would-be king for marking his birthday with a military parade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexico City officials have announced a 14-point plan to address the capital's housing and gentrification problems, which sparked large and sometimes violent protests earlier this month. Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said officials will propose a law to regulate rental prices, strike a balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants, prevent people from being displaced and regulate short-term rental properties. Many residents say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods, in part because of overtourism, short-term home rentals and an influx of people and businesses with higher purchasing power. Related vertical video Mexicans protest immigrants from US Brugada said on Wednesday that an “objective and rigorous methodology” will be worked out to regulate temporary housing rentals to prevent residents from being displaced and avoid “the loss of the community's roots and identity.” The city government will also set up an agency to enforce the rent law and penalize offenders. While the demonstration was largely peaceful and reflected growing anger about inequality in the city, some protesters vandalized stores in wealthier neighborhoods and used anti-immigration language that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized as xenophobic. Frente Anti Gentrificación Mx, one of several groups that helped organize the protest, pushed back against Sheinbaum's characterization, saying the demonstration was meant to highlight the plight of those priced out of their homes and to demand reforms from the government. “We are not against migration because gentrification is not a problem of migration (which is) a human right. We are against violence as a government model,” spokesperson Yessica Morales told CNN last week. Housing costs in the country have soared to 286% since 2005 while real wages have gone down by 33%, according to Morales, citing data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography and the Federal Mortgage Society. Experts say gentrification in Mexico City has been happening for decades and can't be blamed on immigration alone. Airbnb defended its activities in Mexico City last week, saying it helped generate more than $1 billion in the local economy last year, and argued that guests who booked accommodations also spent money on shops and services in the capital. The issue is not unique to Mexico City. Across Europe, residents of tourist destinations have also protested gentrification, while local governments have announced restrictions on short-term rentals in several cities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solar panels are installed on a home in Chapel Hill, N.C., Wednesday, July 2, 2025. Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum listens to President Donald Trump speak during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, July 8, 2025, in Washington. The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said. Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. “At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.” That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation's electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said. It's obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy. While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit. The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032. About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said. While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa. Associated Press writer Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Denise Richards has accused her estranged husband Aaron Phypers of “repeatedly” physically abusing her throughout their marriage, according to court documents. Richards was granted a temporary restraining order against Phypers, the documents state, which were filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday and obtained by CNN. The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star alleged in her declaration that throughout their relationship, Phypers would “frequently violently choke me, violently squeeze my head with both hands, tightly squeeze my arms, violently slap me in my face and head, aggressively slam my head into the bathroom towel rack, threaten to kill me,” and that he hacked into her laptop and phone to download “all of my text messages,” the filing read. In a statement to People magazine on Thursday, Phypers denied the allegations, saying, “Let me be unequivocally clear: I have never physically or emotionally abused Denise — or anyone.” “These accusations are completely false and deeply hurtful. Denise and I, like many couples, have faced our share of challenges, but any suggestion of abuse is categorically untrue,” his statement continued. “I have always tried to approach our marriage with love, patience, and respect.” CNN has been unable to reach Phypers for further comment. The former couple were married in 2018 and do not share any children together.</p>

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports on Sarah Grace Patrick turning herself in for allegedly murdering her mother and stepfather on 'Fox News Live.' After spending years in a mental health center, a Wisconsin woman involved in the infamous 2014 "Slender Man" stabbing case will be released, a judge ruled after several months of deliberation, according to The Associated Press. Morgan Geyser, now 22, confessed in 2017 to stabbing her friend, Peyton Leutner, when Geyser was just 12 years old, as part of a disturbing plan she and co-defendant Anissa Weier devised to appease "Slender Man," a fictional internet figure. As part of a plea deal, Geyser was committed to a psychiatric institution, where she has spent the past eight years. On Thursday, a Waukesha County judge approved her conditional release, the AP reported. The decision follows a lengthy legal process that included expert testimony, prosecutor's objections and a judicial review of Geyser's mental health status. A Wisconsin judge approved the conditional release of Morgan Geyser, who spent eight years in a psychiatric center after the 2014 "Slender Man" stabbing case when she was 12. However, in April, Leutner's mother voiced concerns over Geyser potentially being placed in a group home roughly 8 miles from their home. Prosecutors opposed the release based on these concerns. Geyser and Weier drew national attention in 2014 after luring Leutner into a wooded area after a sleepover and stabbing her 19 times. All three were just 12 years old at the time. During police interviews, Weier and Geyser told authorities they felt they had to kill Leutner to become Slender Man's "proxies," or servants, and protect their families from him. Morgan Geyser is led out of Waukesha County Circuit Court after her petition for conditional release was denied April 11, 2024. Leutner was left for dead but miraculously survived the attack after she crawled out of the woods and was found by a bicyclist. In 2017, Geyser pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in Leutner's attack but claimed she was not responsible due to her mental illness. Geyser has been at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute for nearly a decade but asked the court to consider her conditional release every six months. In 2021, she was released on the condition she must live with her father and wear a GPS monitor. "Slender Man" started with an online post in 2009 as a mysterious specter whose image people edit into everyday scenes of children at play. He was regarded by his devotees as alternately a sinister force and an avenging angel. As of now, specific details regarding the timing of Geyser's release and the final placement plan remain undisclosed. Fox News Digital reached out to Geyser's lawyer but did not immediately receive a response. She covers topics including missing persons, homicides, national crime cases, illegal immigration, and more.

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins joins Americas Newsroom to discuss sanctuary cities pushing back on President Donald Trumps illegal immigration crackdown amid the rise in assaults on immigration enforcement agents. The release of a twice-deported rapist in Virginia is putting renewed focus on the dangers posed by Democrat-led sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Guatemala national David Cabrera was collared by ICE last week after being set free by sanctuary-aligned jurisdiction Arlington County, who refused to honor a federal detainer and released him without notifying ICE. In a video obtained by Fox News, Cabrera is seen roaming a local street before ICE agents initiate his arrest. Illegal immigrant David Cabrera was arrested last week. He was previously deported twice and re-entered the U.S. at least three times. He was released into ICE custody in 2017 and subsequently deported to Guatemala, but re-entered the U.S. again at an unknown time and date. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons blasted the release, telling Fox News it puts agents and the public at risk. "This is the whole reason why sanctuary jurisdictions do not keep America safe," Lyons said. "It lets criminals back on the street to reoffend again. If Arlington had cooperated, we could have arrested him in a secure facility — instead, our agents had to track him down in the community, where they could have encountered others." Arlington's 2022 trust policy allows police to comply with state and federal law — but restricts voluntary detainer holds and information-sharing with ICE unless required by law. In May, the county board removed a provision which had allowed limited police cooperation with ICE, including in cases involving terrorism, gangs, or felony arrests). Since then, local police cannot proactively contact ICE in such cases, though they must comply with legal orders. Cabrera was arrested on June 4 for a probation violation and released from Arlington County Adult Detention Center on July 11 despite an active ICE detainer. We did deport him… and they don't want to turn that individual over the right way," Lyons said. Lyons said that Arlington County's actions put agents at risk. This comes at a time when agents are being doxxed, and attacks on them have skyrocketed by 830% since January. "Here you have an aggravated felon that's been deported multiple times… and Arlington County is releasing him back into the community. Lyons said that Arlington County's actions put agents at risk. This comes at a time when agents are being doxxed, and attacks on them have skyrocketed by 830% since January. "We wouldn't have to send ICE agents into the community, where they run the chance to run into someone else that we might arrest," Lyons said. "We would much rather arrest someone in a secure, safe environment. Anti-ICE activists across the U.S. have been protesting immigration enforcement, sometimes harassing ICE agents and demanding their badge numbers and the removal of their masks. ICE agents were attacked and had rocks thrown at their moving vehicles during a raid on a marijuana farm last week, while ICE agents have also come under attack outside an ICE detention facility in Portland. Law enforcement vehicles were also pelted with rocks during deportation-linked rioting in Los Angeles. DHS accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., of showing a violent mob an ICE employee's business card, prompting a mob to attack him. The official was struck by a rock and sent to the emergency room, where he received multiple stitches, DHS said. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump reportedly has chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition of the blood vessels. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner on Thursday about the condition after Trump was seen with makeup on his hand, apparently covering a bulge or discoloration. Physician to the President Dr. Sean P. Barbabella issued a statement Thursday afternoon indicating that he had evaluated Trump after noticing “mild swelling in his lower legs.” CVI is a relatively common condition, particularly for older adults over age 70. BREAKING: Trump has "chronic venous insufficiency," as revealed by a recent medical exam, per @PressSec  — Trump has noticeably exhibited swelling in his ankles and bruising on his hand in recent days CVI occurs when veins in the legs and arms become damaged and cause blood to pool in a particular area instead of flowing toward the heart. When blood pools under the skin, it can result in blue or reddish-brownish patches on the skin that can easily break open if scratched or bumped. CIV itself is usually not life-threatening, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but it is a progressive condition that can cause more pain and discomfort over time if left untreated. The physician's report said there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a potentially dangerous blood clot most commonly in the legs or pelvis that can be fatal if left untreated. A variety of causes could contribute to why the president may be experiencing CVI symptoms in his hands, including blood clots, trauma to the hand or arm, or an underlying blood vessel disorder. Other chronic conditions, including high blood pressure or kidney problems, also affect overall vascular health. The goal of treating CVI is to improve blood flow and reduce pain and swelling associated with the condition, according to Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Lifestyle changes, including improved diet and regular exercise, are the first-line treatment recommendations for CVI. Weight management is critical to relieve pressure on veins and damaged valves. Compression stockings or bandages are also common to reduce swelling. Treatment does not reverse damage, but it can improve quality of life.</p>

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent was dragged for nearly a block in Oklahoma by an illegal alien from Honduras attempting to escape federal custody, authorities said. ICE agents pulled over a vehicle in Oklahoma City Tuesday, and Melgar-Rivas, a Honduran national and an ICE fugitive, refused the officer's demands to exit the vehicle, court documents say. A struggle ensued as officers attempted to remove him, and Melgar-Rivas shifted the vehicle into drive and fled, according to a complaint. An ICE officer became trapped in a door of the vehicle as it accelerated. While ICE officers were detaining Honduran illegal alien Jose Melgar-Rivas, he accelerated his van and dragged an officer nearly a block in an attempt to escape, authorities said. The officer was dragged on a road for nearly a block as Melgar-Rivas tried to escape, the complaint says. The officer ultimately freed himself and sustained multiple injuries. ICE said its Enforcement and Removal Operations agents from Dallas were involved in the incident. Melgar-Rivas was arrested several hours later, prosecutors said. ICE also shared a photo with an agent holding each arm of a handcuffed Melgar-Rivas once he was taken into custody. "Ensuring the safety of law enforcement personnel in executing their lawful duties is paramount, and it remains a top priority of the Justice Department," Troester said in a statement. "Those who assault or interfere with members of law enforcement for simply doing their job enforcing the law must and will be held accountable." "Those who assault federal officers will face swift and stern accountability for their actions," Travis Pickard, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Dallas special agent in charge of North Texas and Oklahoma, added. "Violence and any threats of violence to a federal officer in the performance of their duties will result in an immediate and collaborative law enforcement response to track down the perpetrator." An ICE officer sustained multiple injuries after being dragged by the vehicle of an illegal alien allegedly evading arrest in Texas. "Assaults on federal agents will not be tolerated by the FBI," FBI Oklahoma City acting Special Agent in Charge Joe Ogden said. "We will continue to aggressively support and defend our fellow public servants so they can safely carry out their sworn duties." The Department of Homeland Security has reported a 700% increase in assaults against ICE agents and other immigration enforcement officers in the first six months since President Donald Trump returned to office. The FBI on Wednesday captured a Marine Corps reservist believed to have opened fire at the officer and correctional officers that night. Los Angeles has seen a rash of anti-ICE demonstrations since June, but the Pentagon this week removed about half of the 4,000 National Guard troops federalized to protect the city, arguing most "lawlessness" had subsided.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points. “Elected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,” said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture. Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology. Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents. He's hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes. “The idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,” Mahan said in an interview. One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city's transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers. Arjona Amador set up a customized “AI agent” to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft's Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with “robust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances — not replaces — human judgment.” Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations. ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s “Make America Healthy Again” commission. In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document. While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches. “Historically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,” he said. He added, however, that “you still need a human being in the loop. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such “AI agents” is now a key focus for the tech industry. More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent. Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes. The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of “agentic AI” projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, “due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.” San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers “in the bowels of bureaucracy” to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork. “Whether it's finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.”</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy clashed with Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., Wednesday over slashing DEI, climate initiatives. EXCLUSIVE: An environmental advocacy group accused of trying to manipulate judges organized a years-long, nationwide online forum with jurists to promote favorable info and litigation updates regarding climate issues – until the email-styled group chat was abruptly made private, Fox News Digital found. But critics, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, say CJP is funded by China and left-wing activists for one purpose. "They fund CJP to train judges," Cruz said during a June hearing. Then, these left-wing bankrollers turn around and fund the climate litigators who will bring these bogus cases before those same judges that they've just indoctrinated. CJP rolled out a listserv where leaders from the Climate Judiciary Project could message directly with judges. One of the efforts CJP launched included rolling out an email-styled listserv by which leaders from the Climate Judiciary Project could message directly with judges, documents obtained by Fox News Digital show. A portal website page for the forum was previously publicly available, with an archived link saved in July 2024 showing there were 29 members in the group. "Judicial Leaders in Climate Science," the archived website link reviewed by Fox Digital reads, accompanied by a short description that the group was a "Forum for Judicial Leaders in Climate Science to share resources." A link to the forum now leads to an error warning, stating, "Sorry, but that group does not exist." Fox News Digital obtained the archived chat history of the forum, which detailed numerous messages between at least five judges and CJP employees trading links on climate studies, congratulating one another on hosting recent environmental events, sharing updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts, and encouraging each other to participate in other CJP meet-ups. One message posted by Delaware Judge Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, features a YouTube video of a 2022 climate presentation delivered by a Delaware official and a Columbia University professor that focused on the onslaught of climate lawsuits since the mid-2000s. It also included claims that such lawsuits could one day bankrupt the fuel industry. Laster shared the video in the group with a disclaimer to others: "Please do not forward or use without checking with me" as the video is "unlisted" on YouTube and not publicly available. A handful of other judges responded to Laster's video and message, praising it as "great work." "This is great work/great stuff, Travis; congrats on a job well-done, & thank you so much for sharing this!," Indiana Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Scheele responded, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Another judge in a Nebraska county court added that he had not watched the video yet but said the state court administrator's office was interested in a similar program focused on "litigation and climate change." The Nebraska judge said he "may need to lean on all of you for guidance and direction." The report finds that climate change will continue to affect our nation's health, food security, water supply, and economy," the message read. In another message, CJP's manager, Jared Mummert, sent a message to the group in May 2024 praising the judges for their mentorship of a second group of "Judicial Leaders in Climate Science" – which included 14 judges from 12 states and Puerto Rico – as part of a partnership between CJP and the National Judicial College. It added that CJP was ramping up its number of "engagement opportunities" to "every six months for both cohorts of judges to come together to share updates and connect with one another." Fox News Digital reached out to five of the judges on the listserv for comment, four of whom did not respond. Scheele's office told Fox News Digital on Thursday that he first joined the 2022 National Judicial Conference on Climate Science, more than two years before he was appointed to the Court of Appeals of Indiana, after another delegate was unable to attend. "At the last minute, when another appointed delegate was unexpectedly unable to attend, Judge Scheele was asked by Indiana's state court administration to fill in as Indiana's representative, and he accepted the invitation. As is normal in conferences attended by our judges, this conference addressed emerging, hot button issues that might come before the courts," Scheele's office said. It added: "Judge Scheele does not recall any substantive communication on the ‘listserv' mentioned. He, like all of our judges, educates himself on emergent topics in the law and applies his legal training to evaluate the legal issues before him." CJP, for its part, said the now-defunct email list was created in September 2022 to help members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program communicate and network with one another for the duration of the program. Judges quietly working behind the scenes with climate and environmental activists have drawn criticism from conservative lawmakers in recent years as climate-focused suits increased, including those who have accused CJP of manipulating the justice system. Cruz, for example, has been at the forefront of condemning CJP for joining forces with the National Judicial College. Cruz argued in a 2024 opinion piece that he is "concerned that this collaboration means court staff are helping far-left climate activists lobby and direct judges behind closed doors." Judges quietly working behind the scenes with climate and environmental activists have drawn criticism from conservative lawmakers such as Sen. Ted. Cruz again railed against CJP during a Senate subcommittee hearing in June, called "Enter the Dragon – China and the Left's Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance," where the Texas Republican argued there is a "systematic campaign" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to "undermine American energy dominance." CJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the "lawfare" as it works to secure "judicial capture." Cruz said CJP's claims of neutrality are bluster, and the group instead allegedly promotes "ex parte indoctrination, pressuring judges to set aside the rule of law, and rule instead according to a predetermined political narrative." Judges have previously landed in hot water over climate-related issues in group forums, including in 2019, when a federal judge hit "reply all" to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff regarding an invitation to a climate seminar for judges hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. Fox News Digital spoke with Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Zack Smith, who explained there has been an overarching increase in courts promoting trainings for judges on issues they would eventually be asked to preside over impartially, pointing to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' DEI trainings for judges during the Biden era. "There's a problem right now with many courts putting forward, seeming to take sides on issues they will be asked to address through the trainings that they're putting forward. And this was a particular problem with the DEI trainings that different federal district courts were putting on, that the Administrative Office of U.S. courts were sponsoring. It appeared that the judiciary itself was encouraging violations of the Constitution, violations of federal law, and most problematically was taking sides in issues they would eventually be asked to sit and preside over impartially," he said. Justice Department officials did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on the CJP program in question, or other efforts to educate judges more directly on climate issues. Still, news of the program's outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years, including cases targeting oil majors Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly engaging in "deceptive" marketing practices and downplaying the risks of climate change, as well as lawsuits bought against state governments and U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department, for failing to adequately address risks from pollution or adequately protect against the harm caused by climate change, according to plaintiffs who filed the suits. CJP's educational events are done "in partnership with leading national judicial education institutions and state judicial authorities, in accordance with their accepted standards," a spokesperson for the group said in an emailed statement. "Its curriculum is fact-based and science-first, grounded in consensus reports and developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards." "CJP's work is no different than the work of other continuing judicial education organizations that address important complex topics, including medicine, tech and neuroscience," this person added. To some extent, the educational efforts led by CJP appear to have been enacted in earnest to address real questions or concerns judges might have in presiding over these cases for the first time – many of which seek tens of millions of dollars in damages. While the move itself is not immediately significant, it will be closely watched by oil and gas majors, as they look to navigate the complex landscape of environmental lawsuits, including lawsuits filed by state and local governments. Oil majors typically prefer to have their cases heard by federal courts, which are seen as more sympathetic to their interests. U.S. appeals courts have declined to take up many challenges filed on behalf of plaintiffs in several states who have sued claiming government inaction and failure to act to protect against known harms from fossil fuel extraction and production in the U.S. An environmental activist with the group Extinction Rebellion DC scales the Wilson Building as part of an Earth Day rally against fossil fuels on April 22, 2022 in Washington, D.C. Their work includes partnerships with myriad outside groups beyond the CJP aimed at informing and educating judges on a range of issues, including neuroscience and bioscience, constitutional law, and bankruptcy, among other things. According to their website, the effort is important to help judges understand relevant case law and ethics, sentencing guidelines, and other types of issue-specific programs they might be encountering for the first time. Fox News Digital has previously reported on CJP's cozy relationship with judges, including when the group's president, Jordan Diamond, detailed in a Wall Street Journal letter to the editor in September that the group "doesn't participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case." A subsequent Fox News Digital review published in December found that several CJP expert lawyers and judges continued to have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation, including tapping insight from university professors who have also filed several climate-related amicus briefs. "Our courses provide judges with access to evidence-based information about climate science and trends in the law." Fox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this piece.

Connecticut Sun's Olivia Nelson-Ododa, right, defends against Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark (22) during the second half of a WNBA basketball game, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Boston. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Caitlin Clark is out of All-Star weekend. I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action and I'm looking forward to helping (Liberty coach Sandy Brondello) coach our team to a win.” Clark was supposed to compete in a loaded 3-point contest Friday night and is captain of one of the All-Star teams. They haven't announced a replacement for her in the 3-point contest. Clark sat out the Fever's 98-77 loss against New York. Fever coach Stephanie White said Clark had imaging done Wednesday afternoon and deferred to the team's training staff for more details except to say that she considered it good news. Clark got hurt with under a minute left. She walked downcourt holding her right groin after assisting on the Fever's final basket. During the timeout, she covered her head with a towel and appeared to be holding back tears. Clark had been durable throughout college and her first season in the WNBA, never missing a game. Now she's had four different muscle injuries so far this year. She missed the preseason opener with tightness in her quad but played the next day in an exhibition game at her alma mater, Iowa. She suffered a quad strain against New York on May 24 that kept her out for five games. Clark returned June 14 and played in five games before suffering another injury to her left groin that kept her out for four contests and the Commissioner's Cup final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's desire to have Coca-Cola use cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in its products could cost jobs, a corn industry group warned on Wednesday. Trump suggested Wednesday that Coca-Cola had agreed to use “REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States.” However, Coca-Cola has not publicly confirmed it will move to use cane sugar. “Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit,” John Bode, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement on the group's website. A switch to cane sugar could result in an economic hit to Iowa, the largest producer of corn in the U.S. Cane sugar is largely produced in southern states, including Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, but Brazil is the largest producer in the world. In the U.S., Coke is typically sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, a decision shaped in large part by agricultural subsidies to the corn industry and its cheaper cost. Some international versions of the company's signature beverage use cane sugar. Coca-Cola additionally pushed back on claims that high fructose corn syrup is worse for the body than sugar. “The name sounds complex, but high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) – which we use to sweeten some of our beverages – is actually just a sweetener made from corn,” the company said. “It's safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body. The American Medical Association has confirmed that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners.”</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a press briefing Thursday afternoon, as the Trump administration faces pushback from its supporters over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

President Donald Trump has increasingly been distancing himself from the debacle, calling Epstein's client list a “hoax” created by Democrats. He even suggested that any conservatives who are outraged over the Epstein case are no longer his supporters.

TRUMP STRUGGLES TO CONVINCE MAGA EPSTEIN FILES A RUSSIA-LIKE ‘HOAX'

Despite his dismissive answers, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release any information in the Epstein files she deems credible.

The press briefing is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lena Dunham's new series makes falling in love look almost utilitarian. The first time I watched Too Much, Lena Dunham's return to scripted television after a seven-year hiatus, it felt impossibly disappointing—visually flat, almost defiantly unfunny, more cringeworthy in its reliance on Anglo-American culture clashes for charm than Mary-Kate and Ashley trying to get a royal guard to crack a smile. The premise: Jess (played by Hacks' Megan Stalter) is a New Yorker working in advertising production who's offered the chance to move to London when her relationship catastrophically implodes. (Dunham, as ever daring us to try to like her characters, has Jess, in the first episode, breaking into her ex's apartment and terrorizing his new influencer girlfriend while brandishing a garden gnome.) Both are hapless in different but complementary ways—Jess tells Felix how to wash his hands, Felix helps Jess get home when she accidentally orders her Uber to Heathrow. These are hard times to be a romantic, especially on Netflix. Two years ago, on a New Yorker podcast lamenting the modern state of the rom-com, Alexandra Schwartz noted that the most crucial quality for any romance is this: “You have to believe that these two people want to be together, and you have to buy in.” On this front, Too Much barely even tries. Stalter is wackily endearing as Jess, and Sharpe adds brooding complexity to Felix's offhand charm. Initially, this set my teeth on edge—two characters with seemingly little interest in each other being paired off with the chaotic insistence of a child making her soft toys kiss. Too Much is co-produced by Working Title, and the names of its episodes nod to some gooier rom-coms served up by the company in bygone days: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill. If you compare Too Much with Celine Song's recent film, Materialists, in which every character sizes up romantic prospects with the agenda of a hiring manager, you can sense a theme. Dunham presents infatuation as nonsensical, or even destructive: The best episode of Too Much is one that details the breakdown of Jess's seven-year relationship with Zev (Michael Zegen), a wannabe music writer who appears like a white knight in a bar one night when she's lost her friends and her pizza (nobly, he secures another slice) and immediately dazzles Jess into submission, charming her family, devising kissing rituals scored to songs, even massaging her grandmother's feet. When she moves in with him, he's outraged by the fact that so much of her stuff is pink. “I swear you dress as a fuck you to people sometimes, Jess,” he tells her, when she puts on a sailor smock to go out. No one is better than Dunham at writing sympathetic fuckboys, men in varying stages of arrested development who are unpleasant in uniquely beguiling ways. At the pub, Felix treats Jess like a kind of curiosity (she is, in fact, wearing the very same sailor smock that we later learn Zev had been so cruel about). It isn't until he sees the coziness of Jess's rental apartment that something seems to click in his mind in an enticing way, like a modern-day Elizabeth Bennet reconsidering her feelings for Mr. Darcy after she first visits Pemberley. He walks around for a bit listening to Fiona Apple and smoking, then goes back to Jess's place, where he finds her being hosed down in the shower by a baby-faced paramedic after having accidentally set her nightgown on fire. Compared with Dunham's Girls, whose direction and cinematography specifically emulated Woody Allen and Mike Mills, it's a strangely unprepossessing show, the kind that more typically gets pulled together cheaply on the British taxpayer's dime. In a bottle-ish episode early on, Jess and Felix stay up all night in her apartment, having sex, eating takeout pho, and ignoring each other's emotional cues. (He tells her about being grossed out by an ex when he once saw her eating cold Chinese food with a look of blank desperation; later, in secret, Jess shovels cold noodles into her mouth with the same vacancy.) The characters do antic, no-stakes things that require little explanation and often defy logic. Felix goes to claim unemployment, telling the officer assessing him that if he gets a job, he won't have time to write music. Jess, still devastated from her breakup and friendless in London, finds instant stability in Felix as someone who'll care for her, even if, subliminally at least, she seems to see through him. Like so many Dunham heroines, Jess is a perplexing mix of intuition and delusion; she offers Felix a joint bank account after they've been together barely a week, but also correctly identifies that his total lack of ambition fits awkwardly with her pride in her work. If, as an actor, Stalter sometimes seems less convincing than Dunham was at pulling the combination off, it's because it's an exceedingly difficult register to play in. Felix, whose childhood is revealed to have been unloving and unstable, seems to see in Jess something like instant security: not just a warm person with a home that's much more welcoming than his chaotic squat full of eco-warriors, but an insta-family. If their relationship skips the heady, obsessive crush phase to get straight into a comfortable, stolid, domestic mode, maybe it's because that's what both of them are really yearning for. Initially, something about Too Much's insistence on citing rom-coms in its episode titles while so stubbornly resisting romance felt galling to me. But realistically, what is love if not care and attention? Dunham buries clues throughout Too Much that seem to suggest what she thinks about men and women: Matrimony, Felix's father tells his wife late in the show, comes from the Latin words mater, meaning “mother,” and monia, meaning “activity”—it's about preparing a girl to be a mother, and in many ways, a maternal dynamic is exactly what both Felix and Jess are craving.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles police officers have begun working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement once again despite warnings from the city's mayor that ICE is a disruptive force threatening the community. Los Angeles is a sanctuary city, generally preventing local authorities from assisting ICE with carrying out immigration enforcement efforts through actions such as detaining or deporting illegal immigrants. The sheriff's cooperation with federal agents comes despite Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass's public animosity toward ICE, which she has accused of disrupting immigrant communities through raids targeting illegal immigrants for deportation, including many working in industries heavily reliant on migrant labor. The following month, Bass made an in-person appearance at MacArthur Park, a local immigrant hub, to stop ICE from carrying out a raid in the area. Anger over the Trump administration's deportation effort was highlighted during anti-ICE protests in June, some of which turned into riots where demonstrators attacked law enforcement officials. Amid the unrest, federal officials, “border czar” Tom Homan among them, have warned that ICE agents are at risk of murder, as assaults on officers surge. Cudahy Vice Mayor Cynthia Gonzalez, a southern California city councilwoman, is among those who have been criticized for stirring tensions due to a video she recently posted on social media that appeared to call on gang members to “help out and organize” resistance efforts against ICE. She apologized after posting the video, which referenced Florencia 13 and 18th Street, two violent street gangs in Los Angeles with a history of murdering police officers. Immigrant advocates in California have accused ICE of racial profiling to carry out arrests, mounting a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging “individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from.” ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens detained during a disputed ICE operation in the Golden State, was “physically assaulted … for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.” A federal judge ruled last Friday that ICE officials cannot rely on profiling factors, such as race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, to form reasonable suspicion for a detentive stop.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A conversation with Julie K. Brown, the investigative reporter who knows more than almost anyone else about Jeffrey Epstein Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts American astronauts really did leave footprints on the moon. When you're a true-blue conspiracy theorist, none of that matters. The Epstein story seems practically lab manufactured to appeal to conspiracy theorists (incidentally, things manufactured in labs are also something conspiracy theorists love to talk about). The Epstein saga hits on practically every theme of every major conspiracy theory, going back for centuries: It entails allegations of horrific child abuse. Plus, Epstein was Jewish—so the whole affair is inevitably laced with anti-Semitism, a key feature of conspiracism since the Crusades. The thing is, only some parts of the Epstein story are conspiracy theories, and it's surprisingly difficult to suss out which ones. People in positions of tremendous power really did let him off easy back in the Bush administration. In an attempt to make sense of all of this, I talked with Julie K. Brown, an investigative reporter at the Miami Herald and the reporter who knows more about Epstein than almost any other person on the planet. Attorney General Pam Bondi: It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. News host 2: Would you declassify the Epstein files? FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino: I'm not ever gonna let this story go, because of what I heard from a source about Bill Clinton on a plane with Jeffrey Epstein. We have information, names that will come out. Piers Morgan: Is it gonna be shocking? Habba: I don't see how it's not shocking. I am Adrienne LaFrance, executive editor of the Atlantic, filling in for Hanna Rosin, who is away this week. For years, President Trump and his allies have promised to make bombshell news on the Jeffrey Epstein case. Many conspiracy-theory-obsessed Americans are preoccupied by Epstein, and MAGA world has long promised that Trump would be the one to release secret files about him. The saga is catnip for conspiracy theorists. The thing is, there are legitimate questions about Epstein, so it's hard to tell what's real and what's made up. Until recently, Pam Bondi, the attorney general, repeatedly said that she had specific new information about Epstein. But over the past two weeks, things got a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated. News host 3: The Department of Justice and FBI released a memo today, saying there was no Jeffrey Epstein client list, contradicting previous promises to provide it. LaFrance: Last week, the FBI released a memo, saying it had reviewed all of its evidence on Epstein, some 300 gigabytes of material, and it announced that it does not plan to release any more information. The Department of Justice now says there is no Epstein client list, and they say there's no evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people. This is pretty much the exact opposite of what Trump world has been claiming all along. Now, Americans are accustomed to Trump and his allies making outrageous claims without evidence. But this particular about-face has MAGA tearing each other apart, with some major influencers turning on previous allies and many Trump supporters criticizing Trump himself for what seems to them like a cover-up. News host 4: President Trump facing unprecedented criticism from some of his biggest supporters. Trump: He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. LaFrance: This is a wild story politically, so wild that it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that there are real crimes underlying the larger scandal. So on this episode, we're going to try to make as much sense of this as we possibly can. Julie Brown: This is gonna be like the [John F. Kennedy] assassination. Long after you and I are gone, there's gonna be people that are gonna be writing and looking at this, and writing books about it. She's an investigative reporter at the Miami Herald, and she probably knows more than anyone in the world about this case. In 2018, Julie published a series of deeply reported stories about Epstein that led to the effective reopening of the case. The next year, Epstein was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges. LaFrance: Let me start by asking you about last week. Are you surprised by all of this drama? Or have you been basically waiting for this moment, where Trump world says, Oh, just kidding. Brown: I've been waiting for this moment. I could see this like it was a train wreck that you can't take your eyes from, because you know what's going to happen, and this does not surprise me. What would've surprised me is if they had really released files, because I really didn't think they were going to. LaFrance: And is that because there aren't files to release, or because of what might be in them? I mean, there are files to release, but I knew that they probably contain a lot of sensitive information and that there would be a lot of hand-wringing over what they could release, if they could release them. The other thing is: There is an ongoing criminal appeal of a criminal conviction attached to some of these files, which are the files that contain the Ghislaine Maxwell case. And so I would think that, legitimately, there might be some things there that they probably couldn't release, because the case is still on appeal. But nevertheless, there's still a lot of files that date back to probably 2005 even that they could have released if they elected to do so. LaFrance: Well, let's establish some of the basics. Brown: Well, let's start with something that almost no one really starts with in this whole scandal that's been happening over the past week, and that is the victims. Jeffrey Epstein abused probably at least 200 young girls, some of them reportedly as young as 12 years old, over a span of decades. He also sexually abused young women who are in the area of 18 to 25 years old. But this is a case about a man who used these women as pawns to further his own ambition and finances, in that he used them not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others that he had hoped to do business with. And this was all part of the sex-trafficking operation. He had several different offices, so to speak, with this operation. He had a whole staff that helped him with this. He had legal people that helped him with this. So this was just not Epstein having sex in his mansion with a couple of underage girls. And I think people sometimes lose sight of the fact that he was able to continue doing that because our federal government and our criminal-justice system failed these victims, and never really pursued this case with the seriousness and intensity that they should have from the very beginning. And that's why he got away with it. It's why he was released way back in 2009, and he was able to continue doing the same things all over again after his release from this plea deal that he initially negotiated two decades ago with the federal government. When you think about the lag in taking this operation seriously, does that cross different presidential administrations in terms of the DOJ? Or is there one period in which it was particularly egregiously ignored? Brown: Sexual assault doesn't discriminate based on political party. There were bad people on both sides of the political aisle in this story. And when you hear all of these conspiracy theories, how do you sort between, you know, the theories that are just totally outrageous and you think are not worth dwelling on, versus, you know, perhaps an example of what might be called a conspiracy theory but you, as an investigative reporter, think is actually a legitimate line of questioning? Brown: That is this scandal, in a nutshell, in that we have some competing forces here. We have the forces of truth and facts, versus the forces of conspiracy that want to fan theories in order to further some kind of agenda, whether that's a political agenda or—there's a million agendas. And it's a real struggle, to be honest with you. That's why I always try to bring these questions back to what I know based on my reporting, based on court records, based on, you know, police records, based on interviews that I've done. LaFrance: Let's talk about the client list, or what's sometimes called the “Epstein client list.” Is it real? Where did this idea that it exists come from? Brown: That whole thing about the so-called list is really a red herring. I think it morphed out of sort of a phone directory that Ghislaine Maxwell actually is responsible for compiling on a computer way back in 2005, 2006. And it was these copies that were printed out from a computer, and every time Epstein or Maxwell met somebody important, they would get their contact information, and they would put it in this file. There were people like Donald Trump on that list and celebrities. I mean, it was a comprehensive list. So it was pretty clear that this was not a black book in the sense that these were all his clients. But the reason why they called it a black book is because when the FBI first got its hands on it, there was someone who was trying to sell it to one of the lawyers who represented the victims. He sort of circled some names on that list, of people that he was trying to say were somehow connected to Epstein in a more nefarious way, whether it was business or whether it was sex trafficking. People just started then on social media, started to refer to something called a client list. The bad actors here, the people that he sent some of these victims to, they know who they are. So as long as they were cooperating with him and doing that, there was no reason to say, I have you on a list. That wasn't the way he operated. But that said, there are still names in those files, of people who were involved with Epstein's operation. He could never have done this all by himself. We know he had people helping him get visas for women that he was recruiting from overseas countries. LaFrance: We're going to take a quick break. More with Julie in just a moment. LaFrance: Let's talk for a moment about the Donald Trump of it all. You know, there are some conflicting data or information to reconcile here, and I'm really interested to hear how you think about this, because we're talking about a man, in Trump, who has bragged about grabbing women without their consent, who is credibly accused of rape and sexual assault. And so, on one hand, you have, you know, this—you point out that the Epstein list is a red herring, that, you know, Elon Musk claimed without evidence that Trump is on this list, which you're saying probably doesn't even exist. On the other hand, there's good reason, empirically grounded reason to question Trump's record of sexual or alleged sexual abuse. And so I'm curious how you think about, you know, in this moment, when you have the Trump administration waving this away, saying, There is no list, you know, Trump saying, This whole line of questioning is boring. You don't really know how he fits completely into this scandal. I was finally forced to say something during the election, when there were so many of those conspiracy theorists out there on the left who were trying to directly link him with Epstein's crimes. And there's absolutely no evidence that he was involved in Epstein's crimes. And I've pretty much read almost everything that's out there. And I would say that with everything that's happened in the past week, it certainly raises suspicions that maybe there is more to his, you know, friendship with Epstein than maybe we know. And to your point about them having had a relationship, you know, Trump himself has said that they were friends. In 2002, there was an interview that Trump did with New York magazine. I'm going to read this quote from Donald Trump at the time. It says—he says, quote, “I've known Jeff for fifteen years. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” So given that, and given everything, you know, more importantly, do you think it's possible that Donald Trump didn't know what Epstein was up to? The reason why he knew is, one of the impetuses for their alleged falling out was: Epstein went to Mar-a-Lago at one point, and he hit on one of the young daughters of one of the other club members. I honestly think, back in the culture that existed back then and to some degree, of course, still today, that some of these powerful men really believed they were helping these girls and women. They really felt that by paying them, this was a good thing: We're helping this woman, you know. We're helping this girl to get an education. They still sometimes look at these cases and say, What's the problem here? There is still this cultural problem that we have in this country that powerful men who take advantage of vulnerable women or younger women don't do anything wrong. LaFrance: You're someone who has spent years trying to understand the truth about all of this. If you had a magic wand and could wave it and, you know, get the question you most want answered answered, or see the document, or whatever it is, what is the thing that you most wish you could know, once and for all, about all of this? If you're gonna charge him, charge him with just something minor, and let's get this done. Brown: Well, there was intense political pressure because, you know, initially, the case was a local police case. It was the Palm Beach police who found a litany of girls that were going in and out and having sex with Epstein at all hours of the day and night. And they wanted to, of course, charge him with sexual battery or rape or, you know, something like that, on a local charge. And initially, the state attorney in Palm Beach County, where this happened, was completely on board with the police case and their investigation, said, Go after him. Epstein lawyered up with some pretty powerful lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, and they started getting dirt on the girls, trying to show that they didn't live, you know, the best lives. And I think he thought that it would end with the local police once the state attorney—which the state attorney finally did sort of say, I am not going to charge him. But the police, to their credit, never gave up on it. They did everything they possibly could have done to try to move the needle and get him put away. And, you know, of course, at that point, once the feds took over, then Epstein had a bigger problem, and then he needed to hire more lawyers who were politically connected in Washington. Then at that point, it rose and rose to the White House, really, where the case just kept rolling. And that was part of my—really, the biggest part of my investigation was looking at how Epstein and his lawyers manipulated our Justice Department in a big way. They wanted him to walk away without anything. You know, the victims never even knew exactly what happened until a year later, when finally, a judge unsealed the agreement. Because if they had done their jobs, of all these people in 2006, 2007, and 2008—if all those people working for us, the American public, had done their jobs, we wouldn't be sitting here right now. A lot of those victims would've never been victimized. LaFrance: So it sounds like under the Bush administration, primarily, or does this go into Obama's DOJ as well? Brown: No, it was primarily initially Bush's administration. LaFrance: What should happen now, if there's any possibility of justice or truth or any sense of closure in this scandal? There had been tons of stories about the “Lolita Express,” “Epstein Island.” You know, this conspiracy-theory cycle started way back before I even took up the investigation, but I was looking at it from a different vantage point, as a journalist, about exactly what happened. I looked at it sort of like a cold-case detective, just pretend that I know nothing about the case and start all over. And I think at this point, that's probably the same thing that the Justice Department, in an ideal world, should do. Because this is never going to end. This is going to be like the JFK assassination. Long after you and I are gone, there's gonna be people that are gonna be writing and looking at this, and writing books about it. I just don't think there's the courage or the political will to do something like that, because a hearing where you're bringing a couple people before Congress isn't going to do that, isn't gonna get you those answers. What will get your answers if you get a really good prosecutor to really examine this. LaFrance: I want to end where we started, which is with the victims, and we're talking here about some 200 people whose lives are forever changed by these crimes. Have you talked to any of those victims in the past week or so? Brown: I try not to bother them, you know, every time you call them—even one of the lawyers I spoke with who represented nine victims, I spoke with this morning, I said, Have you spoken with your clients? He said, I do not call them unless it's something really big, because you just open that wound every time they get that phone call. And so I've been very respectful of their privacy. You know, I felt their pain when he said those words. This is just a nightmare for them. This is just a horrible nightmare for them because all they want is for the government to do its job. And the interviews I did with them were very painful to do. And I just think that what they went through and they're still continuing to go through is painful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts say President Donald Trump's plan for tariffs on the red metal could stymy the goal of boosting American manufacturing while potentially igniting inflation. Trump's July 8 announcement of a 50% tariff on copper imports beginning August 1 sent prices surging 13% in one day, up to a record high of $5.69 per pound. And those prices could just be a sign of things to come. While Trump says his copper tariff is needed to spur domestic production due to national security concerns, there is no quick fix. The US imports over 50% of the copper it needs, primarily from South America, Hansen said, “with no clear path to improving that for years to come.” That's because it takes almost 32 years, on average, from the discovery of mineable copper in the US to production, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “A tariff-induced price premium risks making copper—and by extension, US manufacturing and infrastructure—materially more expensive,” Hansen said. Copper is highly conductive, making it a critical input for electrical and electronic products. “This is a vital metal for everyday use,” Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank's asset management group, told CNN. As Trump's self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches, businesses and investors don't know what will happen in the wake of a massive tariff on a key component of the economy — let alone if the president will follow through with it at all, considering his history of backing off tariff threats. And the price of copper has been rising in recent years. Copper prices this year have smashed through previous records amid Trump's threat of tariffs. Trump's tariffs on metals, including steel and aluminum, are intended to bolster US supply chains. His administration also cited national security concerns for levying a tariff on copper. But an import tax on copper would raise production costs for manufacturers in industries including construction, electronic goods and automobiles, according to Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics. “For the US, this seems like a fairly pointless act of self-harm,” Obstfeld added. Businesses would face higher costs because there aren't many viable substitutes for copper, according to Brandon Parsons, a practitioner of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. While aluminum can be a substitute, it is more flammable and does not have the same conductivity, making it less viable for using in items like semiconductor chips. “There isn't really a good way for businesses or consumers to avoid these higher costs,” he said. “It's going to be felt widespread through the economy.” The United States in 2024 mined an estimated 1.1 million tons of copper, according to the US Geological Survey, meeting just under half of its consumption. Arizona was home to more than 70% of domestic copper production in 2024. Shifting economic incentives in the modern era and the opening of free trade have both contributed to a decline in US copper production, according to Pepperdine's Parsons. Industrial buyers and Wall Street traders in recent months have shipped enormous amounts of copper to the United States to get ahead of potential tariffs. Morgan Stanley estimates 400,000 tons, or roughly six months' worth of “extra” copper was front-loaded and delivered to the US in the early months of 2025. The copper stockpiles could “temporarily buffer” the market when tariffs go into effect, according to Ewa Manthey, a commodity strategist at Dutch bank ING. However, the buildup of copper won't last forever, and it'll be difficult for the US to produce enough copper domestically. At some point, the US will likely need to import more copper under the 50% tariff, which could risk a resurgence in inflation, Manthey said. It remains to be seen whether companies will absorb the higher costs or pass the costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, although economic theory suggests businesses would pass on higher costs to consumers when possible. Related article Here's how Trump's tariffs could be impacting prices for US consumers Wall Street and corporate America have been expecting  tariffs on copper — just not 50%. “Investors were caught off guard, as the market had been expecting a much lower tariff rate,” Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said in an email. Smaller tariff rates such as 10% can be used strategically to encourage domestic manufacturing, economists say. That could lead to slower economic growth across industries, such as a lull in home building. Trump has espoused using tariffs as a means to boost US manufacturing. But tariffs are not a panacea that will revive the manufacturing industry, Pepperdine's Parsons said. So, while this does provide some incentive, it's something that's more long-run. Incentives like direct government subsidies or credits could promote domestic production of copper and fortify US supply chains, according to Parsons. Trump in February signed an executive order opening a Section 232 investigation into copper imports. A Section 232 investigation comes with a 270-day deadline for an investigation, which means the Trump administration had until November to complete its review of copper, according to ING's Manthey. “There are many foreign suppliers of copper, including close allies like Canada, so a national security rationale seems contrived,” Berkeley's Obstfeld said. Related article Trump invokes wartime powers to increase production of critical minerals The US Geological Survey is expected to publish an updated classification list for critical minerals this year. “The US has very limited current mining capacity,” Obstfeld said. “It will take a decade or more to onshore copper production substantially. That will still leave copper prices much higher in the US, and in the meantime, American consumers and businesses will suffer even more.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.
