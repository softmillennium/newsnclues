                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is trying to leave behind the restrictive walls of a chatbot text box and expand into every nook and cranny of your device. On Thursday, the company announced ChatGPT Agent, its foray into the growing “agentic” space that allows artificial intelligence models to perform specific tasks. The company offered examples like “look at my calendar and brief me on upcoming client meetings based on recent news,” “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,” and “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.” Once given the task, ChatGPT Agent acts independently without additional input to navigate websites, open apps, and perform the tasks it was given. The Verge reports that ChatGPT Agent was built on a new, unnamed model that OpenAI developed specifically for this project that combines the functionality of its Operator tool, which can navigate web browsers, and Deep Research, which can complete multi-step research and analysis tasks—both features that were introduced earlier this year. Additionally, the Agent tool was reportedly trained on complex tasks that can require multiple tools to complete, like jumping between a browser and the terminal. The Verge noted that while it appears quite capable of tackling multi-step operations, it can be slow to complete its tasks and is not designed for humans to sit there and watch it work. Wired, likewise, said that the thing isn't exactly blazing fast. It took an hour to order cupcakes for OpenAI's research lead, Isa Fulford, who said that still amounts to saving time because she “didn't want to do it.” One feature that Wired highlighted as leaving an impression was the agent's “replay” feature, which lets you replay the steps it takes to understand and complete its tasks. Klarna, for instance, adopted AI agents to take over its customer support operation, only to backtrack and bring back human operators due to the quality of work the agents provided. ChatGPT Agent will be available to people who are subscribed to a ChatGPT Pro, Plus, or Team plan, where it can be accessed by selecting “agent mode.” The company said it will introduce the agent to ChatGPT Enterprise and Education users later this summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roblox is rolling out new features aimed at making the platform safer for minors, including a revamped friend system, privacy tools, and age verification services users submit by recording a video selfie. In Roblox's old friend system, players have no distinction between people they know casually or online versus someone they consider a close friend. WIRED raised the issue of 13-year-olds not having government-issued IDs to chief safety officer Matt Kaufman. Those communications are still subject to Roblox's community standards and moderation, but the company hopes removing filters will keep users on their platform rather than moving to spaces like Discord. By keeping players within Roblox, the company can monitor their activity. A spokesperson told The Verge that includes “any predatory behavior aimed at manipulating or harming minors, the sexualization of minors, engaging in inappropriate sexual conversations with or requesting sexual content, and any involvement with child sexual abuse material.” Kaufman says the company wants to make Roblox “safe by default.” That's why the company filters communications even for teenagers who haven't verified their age. “If parents are uncomfortable with that, and it's the right decision for their family, parents can turn off communications through parental controls,” Kaufman says. Roblox is one of the biggest platforms worldwide in video games, especially with kids. Kaufman, in a press briefing, said roughly 98 million people from 180 countries use the platform; Kaufman says that over 60 percent of users are over age 13. The company has struggled, however, with predators and minors' safety. According to a 2024 Bloomberg report, police have arrested at least two dozen people who've used Roblox as a platform for grooming, abuse, or abduction. Roblox has also been the subject of several lawsuits. In the briefing, Kaufman called Roblox “one of the safest places online for people to come together and spend time with their friends and their family.” Kirra Pendergast, founder and CEO of Safe on Social—an online safety organization operating worldwide—says Roblox's latest safety measures are largely opt-in, therefore putting “responsibility on minors to identify and manage risks, something that contradicts everything we know about grooming dynamics.” Features like machine-learning age-estimation tools, for example, can incorrectly categorize users as older or younger; in-person code scanning, she says, “assumes that in-person QR code scanning is inherently safe.” Real protection would require guardian co-verification of any connections, not child-initiated permissions.” Furthermore, says Pendergast, Trusted Connections applies only to chat, which leaves “large surface areas exposed, making it a brittle barrier at best.” When asked how an in-person QR code keeps minors safe from real-world grooming tactics, Kaufman echoes a press briefing comment that there is no “silver bullet.” Instead, he says, it's many systems working together. So we have a whole suite of things that are in place to keep people safe. Kaufman says that Roblox is “going farther” than other platforms by not allowing kids age 13 to 17 to have unfiltered communication without going through Trusted Connections. “We feel that we're really setting the standard for the world in what it means to have safe, open communication for a teen audience.” According to Roblox's briefing, the updates are part of Roblox's typical development process and haven't been “influenced by any particular event” or feedback. “What we're doing with this announcement is also trying to set the bar for what we think is appropriate for kids,” he says. In the briefing he said Roblox believes it's important for parents and guardians to “build a dialog” with their kids about online safety. Dina Lamdany, who leads product for user settings and parental controls, said in that briefing that as teenagers are experimenting with their independence, “it's really a moment where it's important for them to learn the skills that they need to be safe online.” Teen users can grant dashboard access to their parents, which gives parents the ability to see who their child's trusted connections are. “We won't be notifying parents proactively right now,” Lamdany says. Online safety, especially for minors, is an ongoing problem in games spaces. For younger users, it relies heavily on parental controls, while adults are expected to be proactive in who they chat with. The system's privacy policy warns that it might also “monitor and record your video and audio interactions with other users,” though some people are concerned about that level of surveillance and argue it makes GameChat less appealing than Discord. “We're the only large platform in the world that has a large number of kids and teens on it, and for that reason, privacy has been built into the foundation of our entire platform,” he says. “It must stop asking children and parents to manage their own protection and start building environments where trust isn't optional, it's engineered in as safety by design,” she says. “Age estimation, parental dashboards, and AI behavioral monitoring must be default, not optional, creating a baseline of systemic defense, not user-managed or user-guardian managed risk.” Otherwise, Pendergast says, “parents and children are left to do the heavy lifting often without the digital and online safety literacy required.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a man whose brain was partially eaten by a worm and who once admitted to keeping jars full of roadkill in his freezer, is begging the Canadian government to spare the lives of 400 ostriches who may have been exposed to bird flu. Kennedy, who also happens to be in charge of America's federal health policy, believes those ostriches could help scientists “better understand the virus.” The ostriches in question are at the heart of a legal battle in Ottawa, where federal judges are now deciding whether birds belonging to Universal Ostrich Farms, an animal reserve in British Columbia, should be destroyed or allowed to live. The farm owners have maintained that this would be unnecessary and amounts to government overreach, The Globe and Mail reports. Kennedy, as well as a gaggle of MAGA influencers and other Trump officials, have repeatedly stepped in to ask that the lives of the sick birds be spared. Earlier this year, Kennedy also apparently told Canadian officials that “significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment.” The whole let-bird-flu-run-wild thing has been a longstanding obsession with Kennedy. Kennedy has a number of allies in his mission to save the birds. The U.S.'s administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz (also known by his TV personality, Dr. Oz) has offered to let the birds stay at his 900-acre ranch in Florida. Kennedy's plea for an executioner's stay is sorta funny, given that the HHS director seems to have never met an animal he wasn't comfortable slaughtering—or whose corpse he wasn't interested in desecrating. In addition to Kennedy's admission that he once committed the chef d'oeuvre of public littering by dumping a bear cub corpse in Central Park, his daughter remembers fondly an incident in which he used a chainsaw to cut the head off of a beached whale. His cousin also claims he used to put baby chicks and mice into a blender to feed his hawks. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that Coca-Cola would switch from using high-fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar in its drinks. The president made his announcement on Truth Social, but people online were skeptical that Trump was telling the truth, and with good reason. “I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You'll see. A spokesperson for Coca-Cola acknowledged the president's statement in an email to Gizmodo but didn't exactly confirm Trump's claims, instead using the kind language you deploy when you're trying not to contradict the most powerful person in the world but have no intention of completely revamping your product line. Coca-Cola also defended the use of high-fructose corn syrup in a tweet Wednesday on X. “The name sounds complex, but high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)—which we use to sweeten some of our beverages—is actually just a sweetener made from corn. It's safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body,” the company wrote. The use of high-fructose corn syrup is controversial, though the FDA has previously said it found no evidence that it's more dangerous than cane sugar. Coca-Cola noted that other organizations have asserted this as well, even if the consumption of sugary drinks in any form can lead to a host of serious health problems. “The American Medical Association has confirmed that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners,” the company continued. “Please be assured that Coca-Cola brand soft drinks do not contain any harmful substances. One is that Trump just enjoys lying and feeling powerful. And Trump knows that the so-called Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement is a newly important part of his base since he brought on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Trump often tries to will his own version of reality into existence by simply declaring things through posts on Truth Social. Trump frequently tries this tactic with trade deals, for instance. President Trump also knows that right-wing media will just parrot his declarations as fact, as Fox News did when its X account proclaimed Trump “celebrates a new win for the ‘MAHA' movement” and insisted “@CocaCola announces it's switching from artificial flavoring to real cane sugar.” Again, Coke announced no such thing. Epstein died in a New York jail during Trump's first term, and the entire MAGA movement has been clamoring to see the so-called Epstein files. Trump has failed to deliver that for his base, even claiming that anyone who still cared about Epstein was involved in a “hoax,” calling them his “past supporters.” Democrats have pounced on the controversy, suggesting that Trump's announcement about Coke was just a new way to distract his followers. Gavin Newsom wrote a joking response to Trump's post on Wednesday: “Oh thank god! The other option: Trump is just losing his mind and doesn't know what he's saying. Support for that theory came this week when Trump told a bizarre story about his uncle, the late John Trump, who was a professor at MIT. The president insisted that his uncle had taught Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, and that he had discussions about this before John Trump died in 1985. Sometimes it's really hard to tell when Trump is intentionally lying. It's entirely possible that the 79-year-old's brain is just melting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. That hurt its appeal to me, especially since it would be a more attractive sub-$1,000 laptop if Dell were selling a 512-GB option. It dipped down to $850 briefly during Amazon Prime Day last week before shooting right back up. It also has a 2,560 x 1,600-pixel resolution display, plenty sharp for the 14-inch size. If you prefer a larger screen to work on, Dell offers the same laptop in a 16-inch size at the same price and specs. Compare this deal to my current recommendation for the best cheap laptop, the Asus Vivobook 14 (Snapdragon), which is selling for $750. The Dell 14 Plus blows that laptop away at its $700 sale price. These are two areas where laptop manufacturers tend to compromise to bring the price down, and the Dell 14 Plus uses high-quality parts in both. It also supplies the best integrated graphics I've tested on a laptop. Don't expect AAA gaming at max settings, but for lighter stuff, the Core Ultra 7 256V may surprise you. It held up surprisingly well at a recent casual LAN party, with Counter-Strike 2, Heroes of the Storm, Starcraft, and a few other lightweight titles. If you're buying a laptop right now, there's only one other laptop that would make me question buying the Dell 14 Plus. It got a price cut last week at Walmart, dropping the price to $599, and that sale is still going strong. It's a pitiful amount of RAM and storage, yes, but for the right person, that MacBook is still probably the way to go. You can also find higher-quality Windows laptops out there, such as the Surface Laptop, which has a faster screen-refresh rate and a haptic feedback trackpad. But you'll be paying extra for it and getting less storage. At its sale price, the Dell 14 Plus is nearly impossible to beat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A “biblically strong,” super-smart, unkillable warrior crafted from AI and brought from the digital world into the real world. Oh, and he's on a mysterious mission, so you can add “curiosity” to that list of character traits. Add in some absolutely dazzling visuals, and you can get a good idea of what's to come in Tron: Ares. The latest trailer is here, and it gives us our best look yet at Jared Leto's supersoldier, unveiled by a smug-looking Evan Peters and questioned by a very skeptical Gillian Anderson. Here's the official scoop: “Tron: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. The feature film is directed by Joachim Rønning and stars Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, with Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Jared Leto, Emma Ludbrook, and Steven Lisberger are the producers, with Russell Allen serving as executive producer.” We should learn a lot more about Tron: Ares at San Diego Comic-Con next week, where it'll have its own Hall H panel to reveal even more details about the new movie (while presumably continuing to remain silent about the recent allegations against Leto).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FCC chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement that the commission is looking to defend U.S. infrastructure against a variety of threats. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The FCC announced yesterday that it plans to vote on new rules "to unleash submarine cable investment to accelerate the buildout of AI infrastructure, while securing cables against foreign adversaries, like China," as part of its efforts to follow the America First Investment Policy Memorandum that President Donald Trump issued in February. “Submarine cables are the unsung heroes of global communications, carrying 99% of all Internet traffic," FCC chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement. Carr's proposal takes a two-pronged approach: one incentivizes "the use of American submarine cable repair and maintenance ships and the use of trusted technology abroad, including a proposal to "presumptively entirely exempt from Team Telecom review license applications that meet a high-level security standard," while the other disincentivizes the use of Chinese technology in global infrastructure by imposing additional restrictions on its use in any undersea cables that connect to the U.S.. Perhaps the most prominent example arrived in November 2024 when two undersea cables that connected Finland and Sweden to the rest of Europe were cut; December 2024 reports suggested that underwater footage supported claims this was a deliberate act of sabotage conducted by a Chinese bulk carrier that dragged its anchor across the cables. There are also concerns that China might abuse the use of its technologies in these undersea cables to conduct mass spying. "Spy agencies can readily tap into cables landing on their territory," the report said, with one expert telling the outlet that "undersea cables were 'a surveillance gold mine' for the world's intelligence agencies." So what does Carr want to do about that? The FCC said that Carr's proposal would see it "adopt a range of measures to protect submarine cables against foreign adversaries—apply a presumption of denial for certain foreign adversary-controlled license applicants, limiting capacity leasing agreements to such entities, prohibiting the use of 'covered' equipment, establishing cybersecurity and physical security requirements, and more—all while streamlining the Commission's license review procedures." Presumably, these restrictions would face similar obstacles if they're accepted. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Customers can now access treatments far beyond basic hair and nail care, from wrinkle-smoothing Botox and fillers to permanent laser hair removal to weight management through GLP-1 medications. When Boulevard launched in 2016, the company's co-founders, Matt Danna and Sean Stavropoulos, wanted to solve what seemed like a simple problem: allowing people to book hairstyling visits online. The duo couldn't understand why salons still made clients call to make appointments. So, Boulevard built a machine learning-based booking system that considers various constraints, such as clients' unique service needs and punctuality history. Boulevard's revenue soared over 500% in the last three years, partly driven by a burgeoning new client segment: medspas. These businesses, which are a hybrid between traditional day spas and medical clinics, provide nonsurgical, minimally invasive procedures ranging from microneedling and Botox to prescribing GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for weight loss. Danna, who serves as Boulevard's CEO, said he was first surprised that medspa owners were interested in using the company's software instead of electronic medical records systems (EMRs). He discovered that EMRs are better suited for clients billing insurance, whereas medspas predominantly run on a cash-pay model. Three years after introducing these features, Boulevard estimates that it is powering approximately 15% of all medspas in the U.S. “I am really impressed by how beauty and medical services lines are blurring,” Danna said. “So, we started capturing credit cards to hold appointments, and that solved the problem of no-shows.” Boulevard now estimates it will process approximately $5 billion in payments this year.

HighPoint Technologies, which specializes in storage solutions, just introduced two adapters that massively expand your system's storage capacity through a single PCIe slot. According to the company's press release, the Rocket 1628A and 1528D NVMe Switch Adapters let you directly plug up to eight PCIe devices into one PCIe 5.0 x16 or PCIe 4.0 x16 slot, or up to 32 NVMe drives via a UBM-compliant backplane. These adapters are primarily designed to give systems with limited space and PCIe/NVMe slots more connectivity options. Aside from accommodating NVMe drives, they're also designed to work with GPUs, NICs, capture cards, and storage controllers, allowing you to attach all the tools you need, even if your workstation has a limited number of slots. Aside from this, HighPoint's PCIe switching architecture and flexible lane allocation optimize the connection for all attached devices, splitting the x16 bandwidth into multiple x4 and x8 lanes to avoid bottlenecks. Aside from those features, the company also included several quality-of-life improvements. You can also check the status of each card without taking it apart, thanks to its LED status lights for diagnostics. But in case you need to take them apart for service, the 1628A and 1528D offer hot-swap capabilities, ensuring that your system remains online. The company recommends these adapters for multiple applications, including data center and edge computing that need high-density storage, AI and machine learning infrastructure that demand multi-GPU setups, industrial automation systems with multiple PCIe sensor arrays, compact professional workstations with limited PCIe expandability, and custom storage solutions. However, these adapters are designed for enterprise use, so they are generally meant for EDSFF E1.S and E3.S SSDs, not the typical M.2 drives you'll find in your nearby computer store. Nevertheless, these devices are the perfect solution for those who require more PCIe slots but are constrained by space and limited expandability in their current system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French AI lab Mistral introduced a range of new features to its Le Chat chatbot on Thursday that bring it closer to the capabilities of rivals like OpenAI and Google. The news comes a couple days after Mistral released Voxtral, its first open source AI audio model that's capable of reasoning in multiple languages, transcription, and more. Mistral says its new deep research mode, like those offered by rivals, turns Le Chat into a coordinated research assistant that can plan, clarify your needs, search, and synthesize data. “What the model does is really go and look into a big variety of sources on the web to answer a specific question,” Mistral's head of product, Elisa Salamanca, told TechCrunch. “We believe this feature is going to be very relevant for both consumer and enterprise use cases. While the updates are available across all tiers — Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise — Salamanca notes that Mistral is focusing on integrating Le Chat and Mistral's productivity suite into enterprise ecosystems with this release. That's in large part because Mistral handles data connectors differently than competitors. It also opens the door for Mistral to offer other productivity tools. “A big part of our value proposition, especially when we release Le Chat Enterprise, is that we want to make [things like] Microsoft Excel and Google Docs and that kind of office suite work seamlessly with our capabilities,” Salamanca said. We're building these connectors internally because we believe this is going to be a key for using Le Chat as a productivity enabler in the business context.” Aside from deep reasoning, Le Chat has gotten other updates today. While users have been able to use Le Chat to reason through complex questions via Magistral, Mistral's new reasoning AI model, that capability was previously only available in English. Now Mistral natively supports multilingual reasoning in languages like French, Spanish, Japanese, and others. This latest update from Mistral also includes the addition of Projects, which helps users stay organized by grouping chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces. This allows users to create and edit images with prompts like “remove the object” or “place me in another city.” Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk's broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Synopsys this week received approval from Chinese regulators to complete its $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, removing the final obstacle to closing the deal, which happens July 17. The combined company — which will retain the Synopsys name — will become a powerhouse offering tools that will span the full design spectrum of both chips and actual devices, which will open a lot of new doors both for Synopsys-Ansys and the industry. Synopsys is primarily known for electronic design automation (EDA) software that enables the design and verification of semiconductor circuits, chips, and multi-chiplet system-in-packages (SiPs). By contrast, Ansys specializes in simulation tools that model how products perform in the real world — electrically, thermally, structurally, and even fluidically — spanning across many industries and applications, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, and industrial. "High-end simulation capabilities are more important than ever with the acceleration of AI-powered systems, which are silicon-powered and increasingly complex to design and deliver," a spokesperson for Synopsys told Tom's Hardware. "Engineering AI-powered products requires the integration of digital design with multiphysics simulation and analysis. At Synopsys (now including Ansys), we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive, integrated simulation and design solutions that empower customers to innovate the next generation of intelligent systems. Simulation remains foundational to our mission of enabling world-changing innovation." The combined company will offer tools that span the full design spectrum, from transistor-level chip design (Synopsys) to physical system analysis and simulation (Ansys). Designers can now use AI to optimize power, performance, thermal behavior, and reliability of devices holistically, which will simplify and perhaps even shrink the development cycle. Also, this could be particularly important in a world where design technology co-optimization (DTCO) becomes a major factor in the extraction benefits of the latest process technology. "Through our strong, 8-year partnership, we have seen first-hand how integrating robust simulation into AI-powered design environments enables engineering teams to manage complexity, catch issues earlier, and accelerate development. This combination allows for continuous co-optimization from silicon to systems, helping customers innovate faster and deliver higher quality solutions across a wide range of industries." In fact, Synopsys is already working hard to add simulation to its EDA stack, which will be particularly beneficial for multi-chiplet designs, such as data center CPUs and GPUs, or upcoming UCIe-enabled solutions. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. "Together as one company, we're uniquely positioned to deliver new, holistic system design solutions for customers across industries like semiconductors, high-tech, automotive, aerospace, industrial, and more. We'll continue to invest in innovation that advances the capabilities of our combined offerings, so we can better serve our customers across a broad range of industries." While EDA tools are ubiquitous for chip design, simulation is used across many industries. As a result, Synopsys will tap into Ansys's stronghold in aerospace, automotive, energy, and heavy industry, whereas Ansys gains deeper exposure to electronics and semiconductors as a result of the transaction. Unless specifically prohibited (more on this later), both companies will be able to upsell and bundle solutions, increasing customer stickiness and total contract value. "Bringing Synopsys and Ansys together creates an industry leader in engineering solutions from silicon to systems and positions us to take on a broader set of opportunities," the representative continued. "Together, we are able to serve not only our existing semiconductor and high-tech customers. We can also accelerate innovation across industries like automotive, aerospace, industrial, healthcare, and more." While Ansys is becoming a part of Synopsys and will be integrated into the company, the Ansys brand will be retained for some time. "We will continue to use the Ansys brand for select products, and we will share more guidance as the integration moves forward. There are no immediate plans to retire the Ansys brand; we will keep leveraging its strong reputation and legacy in simulation to benefit our customers." Cadence (Synopsys's arch rival) will face stronger competition if the integration succeeds, which might trigger further M&A or ecosystem shifts. China's antitrust regulator imposed a condition that Synopsys must not turn down any customer requests to extend existing licenses or force bundling. In addition, the U.S. demanded that Synopsys ensure all Ansys and Synopsys tools will be interoperable with competing solutions from rivals, such as Cadence, Dassault, or Siemens. As a result, expect export restrictions, national security rules, and cross-border IP management to become even more complex than they are today. Chinese regulators already created a roadblock for the Cadence and Ansys transaction when, earlier this year, the U.S. government considered limiting access to EDA software for Chinese entities over national security concerns, briefly introducing new export controls before removing them weeks later after China agreed to ease export controls on rare earth metals. This approval is especially notable given China's past reluctance to sign off on large U.S. tech mergers, such as Qualcomm and NXP in 2018 or Intel and Tower Semiconductor in 2023. However, given unique capabilities that the merged Synopsys-Ansys company is set to provide, it is important for Chinese chip and system designers; thus, China greenlit the deal. The merger of Synopsys and Ansys reduces the number of independent players in a critical tech space, which is set to raise competitive and regulatory concerns. As a result, regulatory pressure on the combined company may grow, as the new entity will offer a set of tools that is applicable in the semiconductor sector and in other sensitive spaces, such as aerospace or defense.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. However, the delay doesn't seem to be extreme, with shipments now being touted to begin in “late August.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Analogue blamed “last week's sudden tariff changes” for the change of plans. Following last week's sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month. Late August, the wait ends: reviews go live with everything we've been saving for this moment.…July 15, 2025 If you are one of the long-suffering pre-order customers, then perhaps the assertion that tariffs have caused this delay may worry you. But having had their $250 locked in for a while already, and the potential price rises coming when the units hit general distribution, we wouldn't expect a lot to take up this offer. In March this year, customers were asked to shoulder a delay until July, without explicit reasons given. Now, macroeconomic turbulence has pushed the delivery dates back to “late August.” The Analogue 3D is new console hardware designed to replace your creaking Nintendo 64, offering “one hundred percent compatibility” with original cartridges from every region (USA, EU, and JP). Importantly, the Analogue 3D also folds in 4K HDMI output – with original display modes supported, as well as “reference quality recreations of specific model CRTs and PVMs.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Remember, like several other modern retro recreations, the Analogue 3D isn't relying on software emulation for its functionality. In case you're wondering, Analogue asserts that its new N64 tribute doesn't play copyrighted ROM files. That probably leaves it open to the use of N64 backup systems such as the NEO N64 Myth Cart, although we can't be sure until hardware gets into enthusiast hands. Analogue appears to have a sterling track record for its retro gaming FPGA hardware. It has also previously sold machines for MegaDrive / Genesis and SNES devotees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey isn't just vibe coding new social apps, like Bitchat and Sun Day; he has also invested $10 million in an effort to fund experimental open source projects and other tools that could ultimately transform the social media landscape. These efforts are funneled through an online collective called “andOtherStuff,” formed in May, whose team includes Dorsey; Twitter's first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath; “Calle,” creator of the e-cash platform Cashu; Alex Gleason, former engineering head at Truth Social; and Jeff Gardner, the fourth employee at Intercom. The group originally met through collaborating on Nostr, an open, “apolitical” social networking protocol that has been receiving the bulk of Dorsey's attention since Twitter's sale to Elon Musk and his stepping down from social network Bluesky's board. In recent years, Dorsey has been more critical of how social media platforms have evolved, saying that Twitter should have never been a company and that Bluesky seemed to be repeating the mistakes he and others made at Twitter. Together, they're working to create technologies that could include new consumer social apps as well as various experiments, like developer tools or libraries, that would allow others to build apps for themselves. For instance, the team is behind an app called Shakespeare, which is like the app-building platform Lovable, but specifically for building Nostr-based social apps with AI assistance. Developments in AI-based coding have made this type of experimentation possible, Henshaw-Plath points out, in the same way that technologies like Ruby on Rails, Django, and JSON helped to fuel an earlier version of the web, dubbed Web 2.0. In the nearly hour-long episode, Dorsey delves into Twitter's history as well as his philosophies around where social media went wrong and how it can be fixed. “It took me a long time to realize this … I didn't really put it into words until I came back as CEO the second time. But it's hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,” Dorsey says. Musk has even threatened advertisers with lawsuits over ad boycotts driven by their concerns over X's lack of moderation and controversial comments Musk has made. But Dorsey believes Bluesky faces the same challenges as traditional social media because of its structure — it's funded by VCs, like other startups. “That's where I want to push my energy … into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation,” Dorsey adds. In later episodes, Henshaw-Plath will interview others who have insight into how social media and tech have evolved, including journalists like Kara Swisher and Taylor Lorenz; former Twitter head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth; Substack co-founder Chris Best; Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine; Cory Doctorow (who coined the term “enshittification” to describe the state of much of the current web); and renowned misinformation researcher Renée DiResta. The team at “andOtherStuff” is also working on a social media “Bill of Rights,” says Henshaw-Plath, which spells out what social media platforms need to provide in areas like privacy, security, interoperability, transparency, identity, self-governance, and portability. This, they believe, will help platforms, including Bluesky and others, remain accountable to their users despite any outside pressure. Meanwhile, others are contributing their time to build Android versions, developer tools, and different social media experiments. Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

These three Dem clowns deserve derision, but for full context, this is a GOP sponsored bill, with a full-on cryptocurrency sponsored GOP government in complete control of the country.
