                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swiatek has not always been successful at Wimbledon, and it was actually her weakest performing major tournament before this year. However, after reaching the final in Bad Homburg, Swiatek showcased her improved grass court game at Wimbledon. This was concluded with Swiatek thrashing Amanda Anisimova in the final, and now one of her Wimbledon opponents has revealed what she noticed about the now six-time major champion. Of the players that came up against Swiatek at Wimbledon this year, Caty McNally was the only one to win a set. When looking back on that match in an interview with Tennis Channel, McNally explained that she noticed how much better Swiatek was handling certain shots like the slice. “It's tough to say in that moment, you never know,” McNally said when asked if she thought Swiatek could win Wimbledon after their match. I think in the past maybe she thought or other people said that her game is not suited to grass. “I feel like she did a really good job of staying calm and hitting big targets. “Obviously you never know what is going to happen in a final with nerves but credit to Iga, she kind of showed everyone up and told everyone I can play on every surface. McNally's match against Swiatek at Wimbledon was not the only time they have shared a court together. Swiatek has won both of their matches at senior level, but it was McNally who was the victor in their Roland Garros junior semifinal in 2018. It was at that same tournament when Swiatek and McNally also played doubles together, and would actually go all the way to win the title. This is one of two junior Grand Slam titles that Swiatek won before playing on the senior tour, with her other coming in the singles event at Wimbledon. Just two years later, Swiatek would win Roland Garros for the first time and she is now a six-time major singles champion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic is chasing history this September, as he aims to become the outright leader in Grand Slam singles titles won. Djokovic, who fell short against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon, is tied with Margaret Court for the most Grand Slam singles titles in history. The upcoming US Open represents Djokovic's best and last hope of reaching number 25. Below are three reasons why the US Open is the perfect time for Novak Djokovic to win his 25th Grand Slam It is no secret that Novak Djokovic has a strong record at the US Open. He is only beaten out by Roger Federer, Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors, who all have five US Open titles to their name. Also, Djokovic's last Grand Slam victory was at the US Open. In that match, he avenged his 2022 US Open final loss by beating Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to win his 24th major. Ultimately, Djokovic has all the tools and experience of playing and succeeding in New York to win his 25th Grand Slam Crown. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner present the biggest stumbling blocks to Novak Djokovic's 25th Grand Slam title. The pair have won the last seven Grand Slam men's singles titles combined, and are showing no signs of slowing down. However, Djokovic will not want to play another of his great rivals, Jannik Sinner. The Italian leads their head-to-head by six wins to four and has won their last five matches dating back to the 2023 Davis Cup Finals. Numerous players have had run-ins with the crowd, including Daniil Medvedev, Laura Siegmund and even Novak Djokovic, who Rafael Nadal said did not deserve to be booed after retiring from his US Open fourth-round match in 2016. Some players, like Daniil Medvedev, thrive in the toxic atmosphere. Djokovic has never been one to mince words, but he has always thrived when playing the ‘villain' role on court. For years, he was the bane of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal fans. It was a rarity that Djokovic would hold the majority of support in a stadium if he was competing against either of those two players. However, Djokovic is a master at utilising these hostile environments to his advantage. Speaking on Nick Kyrgios' Good Trouble Podcast in 2024, Djokovic said: “I don't know, it really depends. People think that I really thrive on that energy when somebody doesn't like me or I'm facing adversity on and off the court. I know that not everyone will like me. “I know that people of course have their favorite players or maybe they want an underdog to win and things like that happen.”</p>

He followed his title run with a dream fourth-round showing at Wimbledon, falling to eventual champion Novak Djokovic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The International Tennis Hall of Fame has rejected a $10 million gift from hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman after his widely criticized entry in its ATP Challenger event, according to Front Office Sports. The 59-year-old Ackman, a longtime tennis fan, competed in the Hall of Fame Open in Rhode Island last week as a doubles team with former top-10 player Jack Sock, losing to Omar Jasika and Bernard Tomic 6-1, 7-5. Jasika and Tomic were openly going easy on him, but it didn't prevent him and Sock from losing in straight sets. 1 Andy Roddick, the last American man to win a Grand Slam singles title. Speaking on his "Quick Served" podcast, Roddick called the match "a total miss," "pathetic," "hard to watch," and "the biggest joke I've watched in professional tennis." If you want to argue with me, go back and watch that video. You can't tell me there was more than one person trying as hard as they could every point, or any point. "This was beneath the Hall of Fame, in my opinion." Three days after the match, Ackman posted a lengthy tweet in which he defended the Hall of Fame, criticized his own play and pledged to set up a $10 million endowment he would manage, giving the Hall 10% of the principal each year. He said the criticism the Hall received was "entirely" on him, but also tried to explain why he played so badly. "What has not been disclosed is that I played a doubles tournament 10 days prior at the HOF, and I played great. The field was comprised of former pros and top college players from around the world, but 55 plus in age. Richey Reneberg and I lost in the semis to the ultimate winners of the tournament in the tie breaker ... Where things went wrong is that I hadn't been beta tested in a professional tournament and my nerves got to me. I was also serving into the 1:30pm sun with a shot clock (a new experience for me), and to make matters worse the other side held back making the whole thing look like a farce." It added, “In hindsight, we would not make this decision again,” referring to Ackman's entry. Late Wednesday, Ackman tweeted that he would instead provide a $10 million endowment to the Junior Tennis Champions Center, which counts Frances Tiafoe among its graduates. Ackman made sure to note that JTCC had already accepted the gift, adding "all is well that ends well."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Navarro has sent a tongue-in-cheek message to World No. 1 Jannik Sinner ahead of the US Open Mixed Doubles Championships. Raducanu has already revealed her tactics with Alcaraz and now Emma Navarro has shared a cheeky message to her partner Sinner. Navarro has jokingly suggested there's a few things the Wimbledon champion has to work on ahead of their partnership. Navarro took over the US Open's social media accounts to send a jokey message about his potential doubles play. I'm getting a bit worried because I didn't see that much net play,” Navarro joked in a social media video to Sinner. The star continued: “You did hit a Tweener at one point, which was pretty cool, but you missed the overhead!” Navarro's concerns may be valid as Sinner has never played a doubles match at a Grand Slam event, but the American doesn't have much experience either. She has never won a doubles match at the US Open and the star is currently ranked World No. The tournament will take place on August 19 and 20. 1 Jack Draper is paired with 2024 Olympic Gold Medalist Zheng Qinwen, while current Italians Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti will team together.</p>

The two had met each other last at tribute held in honor of Nadal at Roland Garros

Dubai: Tennis legend Roger Federer and his wife Mirka visited Rafael Nadal at his academy in Mallorca recently. 

The two had met each other last at the emotional tribute held in honor of the 14-time French Open champion at Roland Garros.

Two videos posted on social media. One shows the two champions walking side-by-side near the court at the academy while the other shows both having a discussion as Mika looks on.

Nadal posted a picture of him with Federer and said: "Really enjoyed our morning together at the @rnadalacademy!"

The Swiss legend ended his long career at the 2022 Laver Cup – which took place at the O2 Arena in London – in which he played his last doubles match right alongside Nadal.

Nadal called it an end to his professional career in November last year after representing his Spain for the last time at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tunisian trailblazer Ons Jabeur announces she is taking a break from professional tennis having previously been beaten in the final of Wimbledon twice and the US Open final amid a frustrating search for a Grand Slam title over the past few years Two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur has announced she is taking a break from tennis to 'rediscover the joy of living' after a difficult spell in her career. The Tunisian recently made a tearful first-round exit at Wimbledon as she was forced to retire injured during her match against Viktoriya Tomova. Jabeur has asserted herself as something of a fan favourite on British soil in recent years, having made the final at SW19 in both 2022 and 2023, falling to Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova on those occasions. The defeats would combine with her 2022 loss at the US Open final in fuelling a painful pursuit of a maiden Grand Slam title, with subsequent injury issues and a decline in form culminating in her decision to step away from the court. "For the past two years, I've been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges," she said in a statement on social media.

"But deep down, I haven't truly felt happy on the court for some time now. The 30-year-old last played at Wimbledon on June 30 in a first-round match against Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova, eventually retiring from the match due to difficulty breathing. She suffers from asthma and also experienced breathing difficulties at the 2025 Australian Open. Jabeur's 2024 season ended early due to shoulder discomfort and this season she's battled a recurring knee and leg injury. Recently, Jabeur hinted at taking a break following her early exit from Wimbledon, saying at that time she would “try to disconnect a little bit from tennis” and spend time with her family while recovering. Even though Jabeur is a former world No.2, she struggled this year to reach top form. She lost her first-round match at the French Open and suffered a third-round defeat at the Australian Open. "Thank you to all my fans for understanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis legend John Fitzgerald joined Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in China to announce the Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off will return to Chengdu this year. “As the Grand Slam of Asia Pacific, we are thrilled to bring the AO Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off back to Chengdu,” John Fitzgerald, Australian tennis legend, said. Each year we see more players breaking through, and none more inspiring than Qinwen Zheng – last year's AO finalist – who followed in the footsteps of her idol Li Na, crowned champion a decade earlier At last year's Play-off, Zhang Shuai and Kasidit Samrej won their places in the main draw of Australian Open 2025. Winning the tournament capped off Chinese star Zhang Shuai's late-season resurgence. Zhang fell as low as world No.768 in February 2024 amid a 24-match losing streak before turning her season around on home soil at Beijing's China Open, a WTA 1000 tournament where she ultimately went on to reach the quarterfinal, followed up by her victory in Chengdu. At Australian Open 2025, Zhang defeated American rising star McCartney Kessler in the opening round before going down to No.24 seed Yulia Putintseva. “It's unearthed some incredible stories – such as Denis Istomin, who earned his wildcard and went on to stun Novak Djokovic in the second round of AO 2017, and Wang Xinyu, who won the play-off in 2017 and is now firmly inside the world's top 50. It will be held at Sichuan International Tennis Centre. Luzhou Laojiao (Official Baijiu Partner of the Australian Open) is an official partner of Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick Kyrgios, fresh off two weeks at Wimbledon as a pundit, has sparked rumours he is dating a reality TV star through his posts on social media. The Australian was unable to play at SW19 this year as he recovers from injury, but worked for both TNT Sports and talkSPORT throughout the Grand Slam. She appeared on season six of the show's Australian version and was runner-up with Niko Fotopoulous. Kyrgios took to his Instagram story to share a snap at a poolside location in Nassau with stunning views. And, in what could be a remarkable coincidence, Mia also shared snaps to her story this week at the same location. She captioned it: “Nassau, Bahamas,” with a silver love heart. Mia, whose real name is Efthimia Dalkos, posted a picture of herself in a salon in May, which grabbed Kyrgios' attention. The very next day, Mia shared a series of photos from her sister's wedding as she donned a stunning black dress. The snaps were described as “beautiful” by the outspoken ATP Tour star, to which she replied with a red heart emoji. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Kyrgios, 30, last spent more than three years in a relationship with Costeen Hatzi before splitting up earlier this year. During an Instagram Q&A he was asked about the break-up and said: "Things happen. So many incredible memories that will stay with me." Influencer Hatzi also opened up on the split, telling the Herald Sun: "We haven't spoken, relationships come to an end. "I hope he finds peace and happiness within himself. I definitely entered the relationship with pure intentions. I loved him, thought we had a great connection."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All England Club offers talks on creating player council Slams also face legal action from union set up by Djokovic The Guardian has learned that during discussions with representatives of several top-10 world-ranked men and women players at Wimbledon last week, the All England Club offered to hold talks over creating a player council to give athletes a voice in decisions over scheduling, as well as indicating a willingness to contribute to their pension and healthcare provision for the first time. Player representatives held two meetings with Wimbledon and French Open officials, and executives from the Australian Open and US Open, at SW19 with sources involved on all sides describing the discussions as positive. The talks had begun in May at Roland Garros, where leading players, including Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff, met with the grand slam heads and made a series of demands, including a greater proportion of their revenue to be shared in prize money; contributions from the four majors to player healthcare, pensions and maternity pay; and a formal say in decisions regarding tournament scheduling. All the grand slams have introduced significant changes to their playing conditions in recent years without consulting the players, including Sunday starts at the Australian and US Opens, playing on the first Sunday at Wimbledon and more evening sessions everywhere, which has led to 3am finishes in Melbourne and Paris in particular. Many of the players feel such changes have had a detrimental effect on their preparation for tournaments and want a formal say on such decisions in the future, particularly as there is a feeling some of the grand slams want to introduce Saturday starts to give them three full weekends of action to sell to broadcasters. While the issue of prize money was not discussed in detail at Wimbledon there is an acceptance by the players that it has continued to increase significantly each year, with the All England Club paying out £53.5m this year, a rise of 7% on 12 months ago. “We always welcome the opportunity to engage with the players and are regularly in touch with them year-round,” a spokesperson said. “We were happy to continue those conversations at Wimbledon. Listening to the players' feedback and maintaining a constructive relationship with them is very important to us and these discussions will continue.” Ahmad Nassar, the PTPA chief executive, said that they have since held productive discussions with the grand slams and expressed confidence they can reach an agreement. “The one page to me means far more than 180 pages.</p>
