Doug Burgum, interior secretary, and Pam Bondi, attorney general, visit island as Nancy Pelosi calls idea ‘lunacy'

A delegation of US officials toured Alcatraz on Thursday as part of Donald Trump's pledge to reopen the shuttered federal prison and tourist attraction in the San Francisco Bay, amid an outcry from California leaders who have called the plan “lunacy”.

Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, who visited the island prison with the attorney general, Pam Bondi, said the federal government was beginning “the work to renovate and reopen the site to house the most dangerous criminals and illegals”.

The president's proposal to reopen Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to steep operating costs and is now a National Park Service museum with 1.4 million visitors a year, has attracted fierce criticism from local leaders, California Democrats and the state governor.

“With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump administration's stupidest initiative yet,” said Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker and San Francisco congresswoman, ahead of the delegation's visit. She described it as a “diversionary tactic” from the recently passed budget and “lunacy”.

“It remains to be seen how this administration could possibly afford to spend billions to convert and maintain Alcatraz as a prison when they are already adding trillions of dollars to the national debt with their sinful law.”

In May, Trump said his administration would reopen and expand Alcatraz to “house America's most ruthless and violent offenders”. This week, as the administration continued to deal with the outcry over the decision not to release additional files related to Jeffrey Epstein, Bondi and Burgum traveled to the site.

“Alcatraz is the brand known around the world for being effective at housing people that are in incarceration, so this is something we're here to take a look at,” Burgum told Fox News on Thursday. “It's a federal property – its original use was a prison. So part of this would be to test the feasibility of returning it back to its original use.”

But reopening the prison would be an enormous logistical and financial undertaking. The facility, known for its brutal conditions and escape attempts, closed because its operating costs were three times more than any other federal prison due to its physical isolation – and million of dollars were needed for restoration. While in operation, nearly 1m gallons of water were transported to the island each week, according to the Bureau of Prisons.

The site later became a symbol of Indigenous resistance when Indigenous American activists began a 19-month occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, and opened to the public for tours in 1973. Officials have said it is in no condition to serve as a detention center.

“There is no realistic plan for Alcatraz to host anyone other than visitors,” Daniel Lurie, San Francisco's mayor, said on Thursday. “If the federal government has billions of dollars to spend in San Francisco, we could use that funding to keep our streets safe and clean and help our economy recover.”

In response to news of tour, Gavin Newsom's press office said: “Pam Bondi will reopen Alcatraz the same day Trump lets her release the Epstein files. So … never.”

Only 9 percent of Americans have pensions today, compared to 44 percent in 1975.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) is taking on the “retirement crisis” in the U.S. with a new bill aimed at guaranteeing pensions or solid retirement plans for every worker in America.

On Thursday, Sanders introduced the Pensions for All Act, which would require corporations to provide a retirement plan equivalent to or better than the pensions plan offered to members of Congress. 

“If we are serious about addressing the retirement crisis in America, corporations must be required to offer all of their workers a traditional pension plan that guarantees a monthly income in retirement,” Sanders said in a statement. “And if corporations refuse to offer a decent retirement plan, their workers must be allowed to receive the same type of pension that every member of Congress receives.”

“If we can guarantee a defined benefit pension plan for members of Congress, we can and we must provide that same level of retirement security to every worker in America,” he went on.

Congress's retirement plan, Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), offers a far higher contribution into retirement than most employers' retirement plans, while also giving out higher payments in retirement. Meanwhile, Congress has enabled growing inequality in retirement accounts, with research finding that the gap between the average amounts in the accounts of the top 10 percent and the working class has grown drastically in recent decades.

Research has found that pensions could play a major role in reducing poverty. 

But corporations have worked to massively gut pensions. According to data from the Department of Labor, only 9 percent of workers have a pension now, compared to 44 percent of workers in 1975.

This has led to an affordability crisis for retirement-age Americans and seniors, with more than half of seniors living off less than $25,000 a year and no retirement savings. Over a fifth of seniors are living in poverty, a far worse rate than in other wealthy countries, Sanders's office points out.

The bill, introduced to build upon Sanders's legislation to strengthen and increase Social Security benefits, has been endorsed by several unions and progressive organizations.

“We've gone from being a country that promised security and dignity in old age to being a country that forces people to work until they're in the grave,” said United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain in a statement in support of the legislation. “Pensions have long been the bedrock of retirement for working-class people, but corporate greed has eroded that foundation. The billionaire class gutted pensions in pursuit of profit, and Washington let it happen.”

Indeed, instead of making it easier for Americans to retire, Republicans have proposed raising the minimum age for benefits like Medicare and Social Security in recent years. 

Meanwhile, this month, Republicans passed a bill that will slash Medicaid and other crucial anti-poverty programs, which will make it even harder for Americans to save for retirement. Right-wing figures have openly said that they are against the idea of Americans being able to retire at all, effectively saying that Americans should work until they die.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Donald Trump is suffering from a chronic vein condition which causes swollen ankles, the White House has revealed.

Photographs of the US president's enlarged ankles at the Fifa World Club Cup on Saturday prompted speculation about the state of his health.

Questions only grew after Mr Trump appeared on Tuesday with an apparent bruise on his hand, which seemed to have been covered over with makeup.

On Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, revealed Mr Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following tests by the White House medical team.

The condition develops when blood does not efficiently return to the heart and pools in the legs instead, which often happens as the result of damaged vein valves.

“The president underwent a comprehensive examination… [which] revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,” Ms Leavitt told reporters.

“Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.”

However, the condition can develop into more serious conditions if left untreated, such as deep vein thrombosis.

The White House said the bruising to Mr Trump's hands was a consequence of his frequent handshaking and aspirin consumption.

“Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hands,” Ms Leavitt told reporters.

“This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. This is a well known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.”

Mr Trump, who has been noted for his vigorous handshakes technique in meetings with world leaders, is in “excellent health” and not experiencing “any discomfort”, she added.

In a meeting in the Oval Office earlier this year with Emmanuel Macron, Mr Trump's right hand appeared badly bruised.

However, results of the president's annual medical examination in April said blood flow to his extremities was “unimpaired” and did not record any muscle swelling.

It noted that his right ear was scarred from a gunshot wound sustained during a botched assassination attempt during a 2024 campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

“President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,” the report concluded, noting his “active lifestyle” and “frequent victories in golf events”.

Presidential health has become a politically-charged issue in recent months, amid accusations that Joe Biden's mental state declined during his time in the White House.

Mr Biden allegedly forgot the names of close aides and people he had known for decades, and was later forced to suspend his re-election campaign following his disastrous performance in the first televised presidential debate.

In May, Mr Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which had seemingly been missed by White House doctors.

They cited the union's pledge to “defend democracy against Trump's embrace of fascism” and cutting ties with the ADL.

A group of congressional Republicans introduced legislation Wednesday that would revoke the federal charter of the National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the United States and an organization that has mobilized against the Trump administration's far-right agenda — which includes an ongoing effort to dismantle the Department of Education.

The bill, titled the National Education Association Charter Repeal Act, was introduced in the U.S. House by Rep. Mark Harris (R-N.C.) and in the Senate by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).

The GOP lawmakers pointed specifically to the union's recent decision to cut ties with the Anti-Defamation League and the NEA representative assembly's adoption earlier this month of a pledge to “defend democracy against [President Donald] Trump's embrace of fascism.”

Blackburn, a supporter of privatized charter schools who has endorsed Trump's effort to eliminate the Education Department, accused the NEA of embracing “radical left policies and antisemitism.” Harris declared that “it's time to remove Congress' seal of approval from this rogue organization.”

Becky Pringle, the union's president, hit back at Blackburn, Harris, and other supporters of the legislation, saying in a statement that “rather than supporting students and educators, some anti-public education politicians are now introducing legislation to repeal the National Education Association charter because the billionaires that fund their campaigns don't want educators to have a voice.”

“Let me be clear — public school educators will never stop advocating for our students and communities, and the National Education Association will never stop lifting up the voice of those educators who dedicate their lives to the success of all of our students,” said Pringle.

The NEA, which currently has around 3 million members across the U.S., was chartered by Congress in 1906 to “promote the cause of education in the United States” and “elevate the character and advance the interests of the profession of teaching.” The organization was originally founded in 1857.

Republican lawmakers have been working for years to strip the NEA of its federal charter to express disapproval of the organization's support for progressive causes.

Education Week noted that the legislation introduced Wednesday “echoes the Heritage Foundation's conservative Project 2025 plan that has guided much of the Trump administration's education policy, and it could find more traction in the current GOP-controlled Congress.”

The outlet observed that the the anti-union Freedom Foundation, which supports the GOP legislation, has called on Congress “to, among other things, bar the NEA from traditional labor union activities such as engaging in electoral politics, lobbying, or collecting dues, and require it to ‘actively intervene to prevent any strikes or work stoppages by its affiliates.'”

“Revoking the NEA's charter would not, on its own, do any of those things,” Education Week reported. “But Aaron Withe, chief executive officer of the Freedom Foundation, suggested that additional legislation would be introduced next week, ‘whether that be removing [the NEA charter] entirely, or stripping it, or changing how it operates.'”

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement Wednesday that the NEA is “one of the most powerful voices for public education” and warned that “some in Congress want to destroy them because they don't like what the NEA says and does.”

“This administration is trying to end the Department of Education and silence opposition, and it is attacking labor unions, law firms, news outlets, colleges and universities, philanthropy, and many of our members. We will not be silent,” said Wiley. “Congress must reject this attack on the NEA and defend the constitutional principles that guarantee all Americans the right to organize, advocate, and petition government.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

The church is among hundreds of religious sites Israel has attacked in its genocide.

Israel struck the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing three in the religious site that Pope Francis called every night of the genocide up until the final days of his life.

The parish priest for the Holy Family Catholic Church, Reverend Gabriel Romanelli, was injured in the strike. Romanelli used to speak with Pope Francis during his nightly calls, with the pope offering support and prayers for the small Catholic community in the besieged enclave.

Catholic charity Caritas Jerusalem identified the two people killed in the attack as the 60-year-old janitor for the parish and an 84-year-old woman who was receiving psychosocial support in a Caritas tent at the facility. Several others were wounded. They are among the dozens of people killed and wounded by Israel on Thursday alone.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which has a church in Gaza that has also been targeted by Israeli forces, said that approximately 600 Palestinians were taking shelter in the Holy Family church. The facility suffered “extensive damage,” it said in a statement.

The majority of those sheltering there are children. Fifty-four people sheltering there have medical needs and were put in jeopardy when they were forced to evacuate as a result of the attack, the patriarchate said.

“Targeting a holy site currently sheltering approximately 600 displaced persons, the majority of whom are children and 54 people with special needs, is a flagrant violation of human dignity and a blatant violation of the sanctity of life and the sanctity of religious sites, which are supposed to provide a safe haven in times of war,” it said.

Israel issued a statement expressing “deep sorrow” over the attack, saying that the Israeli military “never targets churches or religious sites,” despite having acknowledged targeting a church. 

In fact, Israel has attacked churches, mosques, and other religious sites countless times in its genocide, with nearly 1,000 mosques destroyed by Israeli strikes. This includes some of the most historically important holy sites on earth, like the Great Omari Mosque and the Church of Saint Porphyrius, which is believed to be the third oldest church in the world. The Holy Family church alone has suffered several attacks by Israeli forces.

“Even houses of worship are not spared: both mosques and churches have come under Israeli fire. In this war, no sanctuary is respected, and no place is truly safe,” said Palestinian journalist Anas Al-Sharif.

Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, expressed doubt over Israel's statement on the strike.

“What we know for sure is that a tank, the IDF says by mistake, but we are not sure about this, they hit the Church directly, the Church of the Holy Family, the Latin Church,” Pizzaballa told Vatican News. 

Pope Leo said he was “deeply saddened” to hear of the strike. “I renew my call for an immediate ceasefire. Only dialogue and reconciliation can ensure enduring peace!” he said.

﻿Kimberly's father's home in Mexico was a very small “tent looking” structure, she says. He spent most of his young life working, and never attended high school. Her mother also lived in poverty. They knew they wanted to have a family but after their own experience felt Mexico would not give their children the kind of future they deserved.
    


            So 22 years ago, when her mother was pregnant with her older sister, the couple made a long and tiring trek across the border to the US. Born in the United States, Kimberly, who requested anonymity, and her two sisters are now educated US citizens. Their parents remain undocumented; for more than two decades, they have lived under the radar working the low-paid jobs that keep America running – as cleaners, in childcare and in construction.

            But while Kimberly says her parents are safe for now, she worries that could change at any moment. She says life feels “unreal” and “like a nightmare” since US President Donald Trump began cracking down on illegal immigration, executing mass deportations since taking office in January –  reigniting her lifelong fear of losing her parents.
    


            “Now that I see how Trump is handling all of this, I think maybe it won't be OK,” she told CNN.
    


            “What I see now is that we're kind of losing humanity. Nobody's thinking or nobody's perceiving you as a person. They're just perceiving you as a thing,” she says. “My parents might not have papers or the legal documents to live here, but they are also human… a piece of paper doesn't make you human.”
    


            Her whole life, Kimberly says she and her sisters often imagined US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers knocking on doors and pulling families out.
    


            “I remember as a kid being in the car and always looking back to see if there were any police cars because there would be times when people would get pulled over and they wouldn't know where the police cars came from,” she told CNN.
    


            “My family and I were always on guard to make sure that we were not just driving safely, but also making sure that we look as normal as we can be.”
    


            As a child, she could tell her parents were nervous even though they tried to hide it. “It was most difficult to see how my parents reacted to the situation because as parents, you have to look like you're strong and that everything is going to be OK so that your kids aren't anxious or that they're not worried. But I could see all of my parents' emotions very clearly.”

            For years, her family tried to live in places with other Mexicans so they could help support each other and blend in. Her parents worked long hours, often arriving home late at night. Their employers gave them the paperwork to file taxes and Kimberly emphasizes that her parents have always contributed to the US economy by paying taxes, despite their undocumented status.
    


            When the girls were old enough to stay alone for a few hours after school, their mother started working two jobs. “We would spend around maybe two hours before my mom came home, and then my mom would cook dinner and she would make sure that we were OK before going off to her second shift and then throughout that time my sisters and I would do homework, study,” she said.
    


            “My youngest sister was around 4 or 5 at the time, and so when she would ask when my parents are coming home, I couldn't give her a definite answer. All I could say was she'll be home soon, and then an hour after she would ask again and I couldn't really give her a straight answer. All I could do is come up with games or try to put her to sleep.”
    


            Her parents thought about trying to file for green cards, but they heard that it could take years to become documented, and that they could be deported during the process – a risk they could not take with three young daughters.
    


            Today, Kimberly says she worries her parents will be swept up in an immigration raid and sent to a detention facility – or even deported – without any notice. In those circumstances, it would be difficult for her to communicate with them and make sure they get back to Mexico safely, she says.
    


            “Now when I see what's going on with ICE, it's exactly as I imagined it as a kid,” Kimberly said, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “My biggest worry was that my parents would feel like everything they did for us was in vain, when really it wasn't because my sisters and I got to get a great education.”
    


            But if it happened, she would consider moving to Mexico to be with them – a reluctant reversal after living so much of the American dream that her parents had for her.
    


            “There were many times when I was younger where my parents thought about going back to Mexico. And so my younger sisters and I would, all we could do was to cry and tell our parents that we didn't want to go back,” she recalls.
    


            Now a college student, she is preparing to do what she can to care for her parents, no matter what happens. “I'm a chemistry major and I'm about to start my clinical experience … and so I hope that at some point I will be able to provide for my parents the way they provided for me.”
    


            “I'm really grateful that I was able to get that education and build my skills. So even if we ever have to go back to Mexico, I know that I will be prepared for anything and I know how to work my way up for things now and I was able to build a lot more confidence here and so I hope that that confidence will stay with me.”

                                                                                Virtual YouTubers, or VTubers, have become a dominant force in online entertainment. Using avatars as their virtual representatives and motion capture technology to bring these figures to life with their own __1__, they have carved out their own space in the digital world. Alongside VTubers, “virtual idols” have also risen in popularity in recent years, particularly in South Korea.
  One successful virtual K-pop idol group is PLAVE. A combination of “Play” and the French word “Reve” (dream), their name reflects their __2__ to create a world where dreams come to life. Initially, PLAVE operated in a style similar to                                    



                                                                                A preliminary finding into last month's Air India plane crash has suggested the aircraft's fuel control switches were turned off, starving the engines of fuel and causing a loss of engine thrust shortly after takeoff. 
The report, issued by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on Saturday last week, also found that one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) asking the other why he cut off the fuel in the flight's final moment. The other pilot replied he had not done so. 
The Air India flight — a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner — crashed on June 12 and killed                                    



                                                                                What comes to mind when you think of a “mermaid”? For some, it may simply be a mythical creature, but being a professional mermaid is a real and fascinating career. This unique job not only involves creativity but also demands dedication and skill.
  Professional mermaids amaze audiences with breathtaking underwater performances. Whether they are gracefully swimming alongside marine creatures or educating spectators about manatee ecology, their movements evoke a sense of magic and wonder. But their work doesn't stop there. Many mermaids engage directly with visitors, taking memorable photos or guiding them through unique experiences, such as “mermaid for                                    



                                                                                Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日）

Besides PLAVE, other types of “virtual idols” have also emerged. AI-driven groups like SUPERKIND __5__ human and virtual idols, while MAVE: consists entirely of AI-generated members. These groups' different approaches to virtual entertainment __6__ the scope of what virtual idols can achieve.
  Virtual idols are capturing the hearts of fans for various reasons. Some fans find them __7__ due to their perfect appearance and the absence of real-world scandals. Virtual idols can maintain an idealized image, free from the __8__ that arise among human idols. Others are drawn to their creative stage productions.

            Across Africa, and in the tiny nation of Eswatini, fury has erupted over the arrival of foreign deportees from the United States, after its government confirmed that migrants described by a Department of Homeland security spokesperson as “depraved monsters” had been sent to its prisons.
    


            Roughly the size of New Jersey, Eswatini — formerly known as Swaziland — is governed by a monarch who has absolute power. On Wednesday, officials said that five deportees from the US were now being held in isolated units in its jails, acknowledging “widespread concern” but insisting the deported men “pose no threat to the country or its citizens.”
    


            The deportation, according to a statement by acting government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli, was the “result of months of robust high-level engagements” between the US and the southern African nation.
    


            Critics of the move say it is unacceptable for Eswatini to be treated as a “dumping ground” for people considered unfit to live in the US.
    


            While the Trump administration's mass deportations to the prisons of El Salvador have made headlines around the world, the White House has also been quietly attempting to strike agreements with a number of African countries to accept deportees originally from other nations.
    


            President Donald Trump's aggressive clampdown on immigration has run into logistical hurdles, with some countries refusing to take back their nationals, or doing so only on a limited basis.
    


            Some of those approached by the US, such as Nigeria, have decried being pressured to take in foreign deportees.
    


            “The US is mounting considerable pressure on African countries to accept Venezuelans to be deported from the US, some straight out of prison,” Nigeria's foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said in a televised interview last week, citing Washington's announcement of increased tariffs and recent reductions in the validity of visas.
    


            The US Mission in Nigeria insisted visa changes were “not the result of any nation's stance on third-country deportees” but rather “to safeguard US immigration systems.”
    


            “The Trump Administration is committed to removing criminal illegal aliens from the United States,” a White House official told CNN in a statement. “The Administration frequently engages in conversations with foreign nations on a variety of topics, but we do not share information on private discussions.”
    


            Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court paved the way for the Trump administration to deport certain migrants to countries other than their homeland with little notice. Soon after, eight third-country deportees said by the US to have criminal records landed in South Sudan, a nation on the cusp of civil war.
    


            DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X Wednesday that the five detainees flown to Eswatini were nationals from Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, Yemen and Vietnam.
    


            “This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” she wrote. “These depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities but thanks to @POTUS Trump @Sec_Noem they are off of American soil,” McLaughlin added.
    


            The prisoners were convicted of various crimes, including child rape, murder and robbery, she said.
    


            Eswatini government spokesperson Mdluli said the nation would now collaborate with the US and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “to facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.”
    


            She told CNN Thursday, however, that “there are no timelines at present” for their repatriation.
    


            Eswatini's decision to accommodate America's deportees has met with widespread public disapproval, both due to the perceived risk around their presence and the US portrayal of the nation as a “safe third country.”
    


            The landlocked country of just over one million people is already beleaguered by poverty, unemployment, high crime rates and congested prisons. Human rights are also deteriorating, according to Human Rights Watch, following a wave of crackdowns on pro-democracy movements. More than half its population lives on less than $4 a day, according to the World Bank.

            Opposition party PUDEMO said accepting foreign deportees from the US “poses a serious risk to our already vulnerable communities” which it said are “battling a severe scourge” of crime, including rape and murder.
    


            “Our country must not be treated as a dumping ground for those deemed unfit to live elsewhere,” the group said in a statement sent to CNN.
    


            Lucky Lukhele, of the Swaziland Solidarity Network, an exiled civil society group based in South Africa, told CNN it was “clear racism to think Africa is a dumping ground for Donald Trump.”
    


            Lukhele said he was informed by unnamed sources that more US deportees would be sent to Eswatini, warning that “Swazi prisons are (already) overcrowded” with prisoners who “get one meal a day.”
    


            The Multi Stakeholder Forum (MSF), a coalition of Eswatini's civil society groups, said in a statement that the country's “sovereignty and dignity must not be traded off for unclear deals or political expediency.”
    


            It's not clear how Eswatini stands to benefit from housing US deportees. Government spokesperson Mdluli told CNN that “the terms of the agreement (with the US) remain classified information.”
    


            Asked whether more foreign US deportees would arrive in Eswatini, she said there was currently no information to that effect.
    


            Eswatini's trade privileges with the US came under threat in April after it was included in Trump's list of tariffs, facing a rate of 10% on its exports. Its neighbor and biggest trading partner, South Africa, was also slapped with a 30% tariff, triggering panic from Eswatini's central bank on the “implications” for its economy. The tariffs are due to come into effect on August 1.

            Its intake of US deportees has similarly generated uproar in South Africa, whose relations with the US have deteriorated under Trump.
    


            A South African government source told CNN, “There is a feeling that some inside the Trump administration could be using this (the deportation of prisoners to Eswatini) to destabilize South Africa,” given its porous borders and Eswatini's struggling economy.
    


            “Everyone knows that these fellows (the deported convicts) will want to move to South Africa” another diplomatic source said, adding that the US “did (ask South Africa to accept migrants) and we refused.”
    


            The source said the deportations to Eswatini were a provocation by the US and a direct national security threat.
    


            Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington, DC, said African nations are being pushed by the Trump administration “into doing egregious things such as accepting migrants from random countries or giving them (the US) their mineral wealth in ambiguous deals that don't make much sense.”
    


            He cautioned: “It's foolhardy for African countries to think that they can make deals and expect a credible commitment from the White House, given their transactional nature, which means everything is subject to change.”

Residents of Minot, North Dakota, exasperated by proliferation of furry foot-long neighbors

The Richardson's ground squirrel weighs less than a pound, is about a foot long and is native to the northern Plains.

The little creature also is a ferocious tunneler, and it's exasperating the people of Minot, North Dakota, where it's burrowing everywhere from vacant lots to the middle of town, and growing more plentiful over the past two decades.

Now North Dakota's fourth-largest city is fighting back, but even the pest control guy leading the charge acknowledges that it will be difficult to turn the tide against the rodent.

Joshua Herman said fighting the squirrels is akin to “one guy standing against a massive storm”.

“If I'm trapping but my neighbor isn't, well then, we're really not going to get anywhere with it, long-term,” Herman said.

Ground squirrels have been an issue in Minot, a city of nearly 50,000 people, for at least 20 years, but the problem has dramatically worsened in the last few years, said the Minot street department superintendent, Kevin Braaten.

It's unclear how many of the squirrels live in Minot but it probably nears or even exceeds the city's population.

“Gosh, there's got to be tens of thousands of them in the area,” Herman said.

Officials in the city, a green spot along the winding Souris River surrounded by farmland and grassy prairie, know they cannot get rid of the squirrels, but hope to simply get the rodent numbers down.

“I don't see the population ever going to zero,” Braaten said. “I mean, it's almost impossible by the numbers that we have.”

Put another way, Minot will not be able to rid itself of the squirrels because the animals have lived on the prairie for centuries. Outside of town, predators like coyotes, badgers, owls and even snakes love to dine on the squirrels. But in residential neighborhoods and even downtown, where few of their predators live, the rodents can roam pretty freely.

Greg Gullickson, an outreach biologist with the North Dakota game and fish department, adds that the squirrels now have fewer grassland areas available to them and like the mowed spots they find in town.

Female squirrels typically give birth to litters of about six babies a year, so it's easy to see how their numbers can quickly soar.

Herman said he kills 3,500 to 5,000 of them a year, primarily by putting snares and carbon monoxide into the holes, and using an air rifle.

“I've had calls downtown, calls in the mall, along the highways, here at the airport – really every part of the city I've done trapping for ground squirrels here in Minot,” Herman said as he checked his traps along an apartment building and shoveled dirt over holes.

Herman says they damage driveways, sidewalks and lawns; create tripping hazards with their holes and can harbor disease from fleas.

Along an apartment building, the squirrels had dug under a concrete slab and against the foundation. Nearby in a vacant lot, the rodents popped in and out of holes.

Ground squirrels near Pashone Grandson's ground-level apartment dig holes near her door and eat her plants. One squirrel even got around her baby gate at the door and into her daughter's clothes in her bedroom.

“It was a little scary. You don't know what disease they carry. They're dirty. I have a young daughter ... I didn't know if it was going to bite her,” Grandson said.

North of town, Minot air force base, which houses bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, has fought the ground squirrels for years. Earlier this month, the base said it had trapped more than 800 “dak-rats”, a base name for the rodents.

Base officials declined to comment on the squirrels.

Jared Edwards, facilities director for Minot Public Schools, which has three schools on the base, said residential areas of the base and runways are overrun by ground squirrels. He called it “a continuous battle for them for the last 75 years since the base has been there”.

“I'm not going to exaggerate: they're by the millions out there,” Edwards said.

In town, three school properties have large populations of ground squirrels, he said. Last year, the school system began using snares, and for years before that had used poison.

“It's something you have to keep up with. It is Mother Nature,” Edwards said, adding that they had probably been in the area since homesteaders came through.

Still, not everyone sees the squirrels as a pest. Some find the critters cute and fuzzy.

Herman said people have sabotaged, stolen or thrown out his traps. They occasionally confront him when he shoots at ground squirrels with an air rifle, scolding him for hurting the wildlife, he said.

“They get that cute association, and they are, you know, adorable, but they're a vermin and a pest and dangerous when they are allowed to proliferate,” Herman said.

The tribe will keep fighting to “protect the land and save the land that saved us,” said the tribal council secretary.

The Miccosukee Tribe in Florida joined environmental groups on Tuesday to sue the federal and state agencies that constructed an immigrant detention center known as the “Alligator Alcatraz” and located in the Everglades National Park. 

In a motion to join a lawsuit, as one of the first tribes to potentially sue against the detention center, the case argues that the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Miami-Dade County, and the Florida Division of Emergency Management did not seek an environmental review.

The filing alleges the center's proximity to Miccosukee villages, ceremonial sites, and access to traditional hunting grounds, and “raises significant concerns about environmental degradation and potential impacts.”

“We are going to make sure that we fight this facility on whatever front is available to us,” said William “Popeye” James Osecola, who is the secretary of the Miccosukee tribal council. He hopes the lawsuit will “signify that the tribe will continue fighting to do what it's always done, which is protect the land and save the land that saved us.”

According to Osecola, since the facility's operation began, tribal members have been restricted from gathering plants and roots for uses such as medicine. “Obviously, that's not an option for us right now,” he said. “At the moment, it's the first time we've ever seen gates like that there, so it's very jarring for us.” 

Nearby the facility, 15 active tribal villages reside inside Big Cypress National Preserve, located within the Everglades. 

During the 19th century, the Seminole Wars, which the Seminole Nation and Miccosukee Nation view as one continuous conflict against the U.S., many members fled into the wetlands and used their natural environment as refuge. 

In a press conference at the detention center last month, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said there would be  “zero impact” on the wetland's environment. The site is located on an abandoned airstrip, once a controversial project that aimed to be the world's largest airport. Observers outside the facility said they could see lights on at all hours, attracting mosquito swarms. Recent satellite images also reveal that a freshly paved road has been laid down. 

Last year, the tribe and the National Park Service signed a co-stewardship agreement for Everglades National Park. The partnership aimed to collaborate on protecting tribal practices, restoration efforts for the land's vegetation, and protection. 

In these cypress swamps and toothy sawgrass marshes, wildlife alongside alligators includes bats, turtles, and panthers. Because species such as the panther are critically endangered, Osecola implied that the continuous traffic at Alligator Alcatraz will “see more deaths with the wildlife”. “It's taken decades just to get Everglades restoration going like it is now,” he said.

While the Department of Homeland Security distanced itself after promoting the facility for weeks, claiming Florida controls the facility under state hands, critics are not convinced. Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director at the Center for Biological Diversity, an organization that filed alongside Friends of the Everglades in the case last month, noted that “setting aside the funding for detaining immigrants is essentially a federal function. This is a federal project, regardless of what they say in their court filings.”

Last week, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a legal notice with an intent to sue that the construction also violates the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, raising concerns such as light pollution and the use of insecticide to mitigate mosquitoes on-site that could affect the area's wildlife and surrounding water. 

Each day since its opening, protestors and groups have noticed trucks coming in carrying diesel, generators, and caged vehicles holding detainees. There are currently 3000 beds inside the facility and at least 400 security personnel on-site. 

After state legislators were blocked from entering the Alligator Alcatraz's premises, Governor DeSantis invited legislators and the state's members of Congress to tour the facility over the weekend. According to Osecola, the Governor of Florida did not extend that invitation to tribes. 

Some Republican members claimed that the detention center was clean and safe. Others, such as Democratic State Representative Anna Eskamani, reported that, “The environmental impact of this facility cannot be overstated — there is new asphalt, thousands of gallons of water used every day and gas tanks powering generators. No alligators seen, but plenty of mosquitoes.”

A modernized Ukrainian An-124 Ruslan cargo aircraft was relocated from Ukraine to Germany last week in a rare wartime flight, according to a July 17 statement from the Antonov company.

The plane departed Kyiv on July 11, marking its first flight since Ukrainian airspace was closed for safety reasons following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The aircraft, originally produced in 1994 and bearing serial number 0706, was safely transferred abroad following years of extensive upgrades. The An-124 had logged more than 21,000 flight hours across over 5,500 flights before undergoing a major overhaul.

Antonov said the modernization project began in 2021 and focused on replacing critical components originally manufactured in Russia with modern parts sourced from Western and Ukrainian suppliers. 

Work was interrupted following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, when the aircraft was still disassembled. Despite wartime conditions, the Antonov team resumed and completed the project in June 2025.

"The relocation of the Ruslan is not just a technical achievement — it symbolizes the resilience, professionalism, and unity of Ukrainian aircraft engineers,"  the company said in its statement. The upgraded aircraft will now serve international operations.

Antonov confirmed that its current fleet has been moved to secure locations under internal safety protocols.

Another Antonov's aircraft, the world's largest cargo plane, the An-225 Mriya a was destroyed during a Russian air strike on Hostomel Airport near Kyiv in the early days of the invasion.

The former director of Antonov, Serhii Bychkov, was charged in April 2023 with negligence for allegedly failing to evacuate the Mriya despite repeated warnings.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) estimated the damage to the state at over Hr 8.4 billion ($227.8 million). Bychkov remains in custody.

Russia's 41st Combined Arms Army fighting in eastern Ukraine has suffered "catastrophic" losses, according to internal documents published on July 17 by Ukraine's "I Want to Live" government project.

Launched in September 2022 by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR), the 24-hour "I Want to Live" hotline helps Russian soldiers willingly surrender themselves or their units to the Ukrainian army.

"Russians who are not indifferent to the fate of Russia have given us documents that reveal the scale of losses of Russian troops in Ukraine," the project said in a post on social media.

The documents detail the toll on Russia's 41st Combined Arms Army, a major military formation made up of four motorized infantry brigades, with soldiers primarily drawn from Siberia and southern Russia.

As of June 1, 2025, at least 8,625 troops from this army had been killed in combat, 10,491 were listed as missing in action, and another 7,846 had deserted.

Most of the 41st Army's units are operating near the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast.

The worst-hit is the 74th Motor Rifle Brigade from Kemerovo Oblast in Siberia, which has lost 2,479 soldiers killed, 2,732 missing, and 2,789 deserting, more than double the brigade's original size of around 3,500 troops.

Other brigades show similar figures. The 35th Brigade from Altai Krai in Southern Siberia reported 1,975 killed, 3,163 missing, and 2,229 desertions.

The 55th Brigade from Tuva, bordering Mongolia, once a small formation of 1,600, has lost 1,430 troops killed, 1,467 missing, and 1,616 deserting.

The 137th Brigade reported at least 1,158 killed, 2,319 missing, and 948 deserting.

Desertion rates reportedly remain high. On a single day, May 31, 42 soldiers fled their units, according to the project. Over the course of one week, 175 deserted, nearly half the size of a typical battalion. Of those, 28% were former prisoners recruited into penal assault units known as "V companies."

"It is also worth noting that the 'V companies' exist exclusively in motorized rifle brigades, where prisoners are used as cannon fodder," the statement from "I Want to Live" said, describing the losses as "catastrophic."

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

Russian losses in Ukraine hit a massive, and grim milestone on June 12 — 1 million Russian soldiers killed or wounded during the 39-month-long full-scale war, according to figures from Kyiv.

Although hugely symbolic, the number is unlikely to prompt a change in tactics from Moscow as it gears up for more offensives this summer, and escalates drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians.

But behind the figure lies an economic time bomb that the Kremlin will find impossible to ignore.

"(Russian President) Vladimir Putin made a fundamental strategic mistake in deciding how to resource this war," George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told the Kyiv Independent.

"What Vladimir Putin has done is he has created a system in which he doesn't use the monopoly of violence of the Russian state to coerce Russians to go fight and die in Ukraine, as the Soviet Union might have. What Putin has done is he's created an alternative social contract where he pays you to go fight in Ukraine.

"That strategy can work if you're planning on running a short war. It does not work if you are running a multi-year protracted war."

In an interview with TASS, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev, both a politician and a lawyer, outlined the key lessons Russia has drawn from that historic event and explained its continued relevance in the context of the current situation around Ukraine.​

 

– Decisions from the Potsdam conference were almost immediately breached by the Soviet Union's allies in the anti-Hitlerite coalition. In parallel, London developed Operation Unthinkable, a war plan against the Soviet Union. Is perfidy the West's core?

– The anniversary of the Potsdam Conference provides an opportunity to reflect on the past as a mirror of the present. In doing so, we must use the "correct lenses", without being naive or considering the events of July 1945 in isolation from the centuries-long attitude of European, or, more broadly, Western elites toward our country.

Revising or breaching the decisions from the Potsdam Conference was just a continuation of Western policies regarding Russia from before the war or even earlier.

Since the time of Peter the Great, when Russia established itself as a European power, we have witnessed a consistent trend of hostility, distrust and attempts to weaken our country in Western actions. As part of various coalitions, they [Western countries] have sought to turn Russia into Europe's stepdaughter who was admitted only to the threshold the pan-European house for re-education. They have also sought to impose a subservient role on our country in European and, later, global affairs. But in vain.

To Western elites, an independent and strong Russia has always been a historical anomaly and a very effective rebuff to the idea of their supposed "civilizational superiority". Fear and reluctance to engage in dialogue with other nations gives rise to villainy and aggression. This is why Western elites have been making repeated attempts to isolate Russia and avenge their past failures.

So, in 1945, the Potsdam [Conference] was not a prelude to lasting peace, but rather it paved the way for the Cold War. And today's developments - a proxy war, or actually a full-out war involving the launch of Western-made missiles and satellite reconnaissance, sanctions packages, and loud statements on militarization in Europe – are yet another attempt to destroy the `historical anomaly' that the West hates so much, to destroy our country.

So, the Potsdam Conference taught us that relations with the West should not be based on illusions. The West's treacherous nature and its warped and very outdated sense of superiority are still evident. And we should therefore act accordingly, responding in full or even delivering pre-emptive strikes if need be.

The Potsdam Conference was an important history lesson for us.

We have learned the lessons of the Potsdam Conference. And today, as in 1945, our country is fighting not only to protect its borders, but also the idea of a just world order.

 

– At was at the Potsdam Conference that the Ds – demilitarization, denazification and democratization of Germany – were first formulated. Can the approaches outlined there be applied to present-day Ukraine? And which Ds could be added or adjusted, in your vision?

– The three 'D's – demilitarization, denazification and democratization – were developed to address Nazi Germany as an aggressor state that destroyed the world order. Of course, there are significant differences between the Reich of 1945 and present-day Ukraine, in terms of scale, global posture and even, formally, government ideology.

However, one clear similarity does exist.

Firstly, there is the identity crisis and the blatantly Nazi symbols. There is a cult of collaborationist and Nazi ideologists, as well as swastikas and Totenkopf prints on military uniforms and armored combat vehicles, not to mention other references to the Third Reich. Today's ideology is based on hatred of the neighbor and calls to continue ‘fighting to the end'. All of this is supported by the government and is rippling through society. The militarization of society adds to this, with armed groups acquiring not only military, but also political functions, some of which, in effect, are poorly controlled by the state.

Secondly, there is a tenure of power and increasingly obvious signs of dictatorship. Electoral procedures have been canceled under the pretext of war, opposition activists have been persecuted or jailed, and freedom of speech has been   annihilated.

Thirdly, the economy has been in decline. Like the Third Reich in its final months, present-day Ukraine is clearly experiencing an economic and management crisis that has been solely addressed through external funding and mobilization rhetoric.

All this makes the idea of using the three 'D's still relevant.

Demilitarization is not a punishment, but an opportunity for Ukraine to stop being used as a pawn in someone else's bloody geopolitical games, which often target Ukraine itself. For this reason, too, the country's non-aligned status is an essential part of its demilitarization. Furthermore, eliminating insane defense expenditures would provide additional funds for rebuilding its shattered economy.

Denazification or debanderization is not an act of revenge, but rather long-term work with public conscience and historical memory. The peoples of our countries and many other former Soviet republics share a common historical destiny. This shared heritage creates huge potential for not only peaceful neighborly relations, but also cooperation and joint development.

And democratization involves more than just elections. It involves restoring legal institutions, a free press, competition, and the separation of powers. Had these mechanisms been fully operational in Ukraine, its history since 2014 would have taken a far more favorable path.

To the three 'D's, I would add a fourth: deparasitization, or disinsection. Residents of the territories currently controlled by the so-called Ukraine must learn to live independently and take responsibility for their actions. Otherwise, a parasitic Ukraine has no chance of preserving its statehood.

 

– In violation of the Potsdam Agreements, the Western countries, unlike the Soviet Union, effectively failed to carry out the process of Germany's denazification. Should this fact not only be acknowledged but also emphasized in the Russian historical narrative? Can the postwar West be considered a covert accomplice in the preservation of Nazism after 1945?

– I have addressed this topic on numerous occasions in my speeches and articles. Before the war, the Western powers nurtured and supported Hitler's Nazi regime, and after the fascists were defeated in World War II, they made every effort to ensure that the ideology survived.

Rather than implementing genuine denazification measures in the territories under their control, our Western "allies" settled for superficial and perfunctory actions.

Most Nazi criminals tried with the participation of Western judicial authorities got off with little more than a slap on the wrist, receiving exceedingly lenient sentences or being granted amnesty just a few years after the war. Neither they, nor their descendants or close associates, were barred from entering positions of power.

The consequences of this astonishing "tolerance" toward Nazi criminals, combined with rabid and hysterical Russophobia, are being felt to this day. This is especially true in countries that served as Hitler's lackeys or expendable resources: the Baltic states, Poland, and Ukraine, which has embraced a Banderite identity.

Many high-ranking figures in Germany still take pride in their fascist forebears, emulating them in both rhetoric and policy. A striking example is the recent statement by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius about the country's readiness to "kill Russian soldiers" on the "eastern flank" and to always deal with Russia "from a position of strength." And the remarks of Chancellor Friedrich Merz, himself a direct descendant of Nazis, are no less appalling. All of this echoes the hypocrisy of those self-proclaimed "anti-fascists" who like to say their grandfather "heroically died in a concentration camp after falling from a guard tower."

Let me remind you that our president stated unequivocally: Russia does not intend to go to war with NATO or ‘attack Europe.' Such claims by Western politicians are utter nonsense. I would also like to add that this kind of drivel is deliberately injected into the information space to destabilize an already difficult situation. It is yet another front in the West's open war against us.

Without question, all such facts must be brought to light, not swept under the rug. The saying ‘history will be the judge' only holds true when all the facts and circumstances necessary for such judgment are known. After all, the principal judge for the Nazis in Hitler's Germany, as we know, was the soldier of the Red Army.

Of all the crises to hit the White House since Donald Trump returned it is one entirely of his own making that is arguably causing the most damage.

The US president's administration has accidentally deported the wrong people in sweeping immigration round-ups, overseen a power grab that has repeatedly butted up against the Supreme Court, leaked highly sensitive military information in a Signal chat and bombed nuclear sites in Iran.

But it is the once-fringe conspiracy theory about Jeffrey Epstein that is tearing at the White House and the Republican Party – and now threatening to damage the GOP's electoral prospects.

One source close to the administration spoke to The Telegraph and described a “blind mess” in the White House that falls squarely at the feet of the president himself.

“We could have seen this coming, Trump played into this without knowing what he was seeing,” they said.

Mr Trump has dabbled in conspiracies for years: Barack Obama was born in Kenya, Ted Cruz's father had a link to JFK's killer.

For years, Mr Trump had pandered to his loyal base's suspicion that the billionaire's death was anything but a suicide, while hinting at “knowing things” about the disgraced financier that the public did not.

And so when the Department of Justice concluded the Epstein had no “client list” and died by suicide, not murder, he faced a predictable rebellion.

The conclusion would never wash for the voters and followers who Mr Trump has taught not to accept the word of government at face value.

“He campaigned on an unknown,” the source said.

They added: “He would still like to [release material] but he would be forcing victims to become public that would not want to be public.”

It is now open season with officials at war with each other, once-loyal podcasters attacking the White House, and even the most moderate voices like Republican leaders in Congress weighing in.

And while the White House is reportedly wargaming solutions, the way out is not clear.

Benny Johnson, the hugely popular Maga commentator, told viewers on Wednesday of the crisis: “It's been abysmal and people aren't satisfied.”

Far-right conspiracy theorist and podcaster Alex Jones called Mr Trump's handling of the Epstein situation “the biggest train wreck I've ever seen”.

It has caused the US president to hit out at his own side, labelling them “weaklings” for believing the “hoax” about Epstein.

He said Maga loyalists had fallen “hook, line, and sinker” for conspiracy theories which began shortly after the disgraced financier was found dead in his Manhattan cell in 2019.

Loyalists from Megyn Kelly to Tucker Carlson have called for Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to resign over her failure to deliver, after she claimed in February that Epstein's client list was “sitting on [her] desk”.

“The biggest problem is Pam Bondi let too much out before she had even seen anything, right? This is an over-ambition to do the right thing,” the source added.

But it is the polling that might worry Mr Trump most.

The threat of a dismal midterm has forced some of the president's biggest allies to break ranks and call for the release of files related to Epstein, scared the base that elected them will turn on their heels.

More than six in 10 voters disapprove of how the Trump administration handled its investigation into the convicted sex offender, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday.

Just 17 per cent of voters surveyed said they were satisfied with the DOJs conclusions that Epstein kept no client list.

It may be perhaps why Mike Johnson, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, broke rank with the president and demanded his administration release “everything” on Epstein to the public.

“It's a very delicate subject but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it,” he told Benny Johnson's podcast.

The topic creates a dilemma for the president. Though Trump cannot legally run for another term, he will need strong support from a united party to pass his remaining legislative agenda in a narrowly divided Congress.

But trying to escape the corner he has backed himself into may be to do what he does best, throw more mud at the problem.

“I'd flood the zone with other news items,” Charley Cooper, a GOP strategist told The Telegraph, referring to a tactic the administration successfully deployed at the start of Mr Trump's second term.

“Change the story, and do stuff that the Maga people care about... play into something else that they care about and throw them off the scent.”

President battles rare backlash from supporters, many of whom say he is hiding vital information. Plus, a climate expert calls for AI and crypto tax

Good morning.

Donald Trump has turned on his Maga base, blasting his supporters as gullible “weaklings” for believing the government is holding out on crucial information about the disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The president is facing a crisis as his supporters suspect the administration is hiding details of Epstein's crimes to protect members of the child sex offender's elite circle – which, at one point, included Trump. In a post on Truth Social, the president claimed his voters had fallen for what he called a “radical left” hoax to discredit him.

It is unusual for his base to question Trump – but it comes after the president stirred up conspiracy theories during his election campaigns, including that the US is controlled by “deep state” elites.

What are his supporters upset about? A key sticking point has been the government's announcement that Epstein did not keep records of a “client list”. It's particularly contentious because the attorney general, Pam Bondi, had previously said such a list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, though she later claimed she was referring to other documents.

Europe's largest manufacturer of missiles, MBDA, is selling key components for bombs that have been used in multiple Israeli airstrikes that have killed Palestinian children and other civilians.

A Guardian investigation with the independent newsrooms Disclose and Follow the Money has examined the GBU-39 bomb's supply chain and how it has been used against Gaza.

The investigation identified 24 cases where the GBU-39 was deployed in attacks that killed civilians. Each attack included children among the dead, and many took place at night, without warning, on sites where displaced families were sheltering.

The UN rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has called for global corporations to be held accountable for “profiting from genocide”.

How were the findings verified? Using open-source information and through analysis by weapons experts.

The US Senate has passed Trump's plan to slash billions of dollars from foreign aid and public broadcasting budgets, as the president continues to face little resistance to his control of Congress.

The Senate voted 51 to 48 in favor of Trump's plan to cut $9bn in spending. Most of the funding cuts are to schemes to assist countries dealing with disease, war and natural disasters – but the move also scraps the $1.1bn that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was due to receive over the next two years.

Why cut public broadcasting budgets? Trump and many of his fellow Republicans argue that the expense is unnecessary and claim the news coverage has an “anti-right bias”.

Syria's president has condemned Israel for “wide-scale targeting of civilian and government facilities” after its strikes on Damascus on Wednesday, as Israel waded into a conflict between the Syrian army and Druze fighters.

A sex scandal among Buddhist monks has rocked Thailand, with allegations of blackmail and luxury gifts illuminating the privileges enjoyed by the clergy.

Mark Zuckerberg has said Meta will construct a data center nearly the size of Manhattan and spend hundreds of billions of dollars on developing AI.

Eight healthy babies have been born using IVF embryos with DNA from three people in a groundbreaking procedure to prevent the children from inheriting incurable genetic disorders.

Trump's 17% spending boost for the Pentagon will increase its funding to $1tn, and supercharge emissions by as much as Croatia's annual carbon footprint. It will push the Pentagon's total greenhouse emissions to a staggering 178 Mt of CO2e – more than the annual carbon footprint of Ethiopia, a country of 135 million people.

Lena Dunham's Girls, a tightly written send-up of a narcissistic group of young women living in Brooklyn during the Obama era, was sharply satirical and influenced shows such as Broad City and Fleabag. However, her latest offering, Too Much, falls flat, argues Adrian Horton, in part because comedy styles shaped by the internet, “where heightened bits and jarring phrases reign supreme” (actor Megan Stalter's experience is in front-facing camera internet comedy), do not work as well over a full-length television episode.

Governments should tax cryptocurrencies and consider levies on artificial intelligence to pay for climate action, one of the architects of the Paris agreement has said. “That could be a first step – again, it's the same rationale [for AI as taxing cryptocurrency], because they use a lot of energy,” Laurence Tubiana said. Generating bitcoin each year uses up the equivalent of Poland's annual energy consumption.

We might think of our preferences on how we like to make our dinner as particular to us – but a study has found that even Neanderthals had distinct ways of preparing their meals. Various groups of Neanderthals, living around the same time, butchered animals in different ways, the researchers found. The cut marks were “the gestures and movements of the Neanderthal people themselves, as evocative to us as footprints or hand marks on a cave wall”, one expert said.

Inside the Jostein Albert vessel at the cusp of a Norweigan fjord are 10,000 tones of Atlantic Salmon. Mitsubishi said on Thursday it would expand its salmon farming by acquiring additional businesses in Norway and Canada.Philip Halvorsen/The Globe and Mail

Japanese trading house Mitsubishi MSBHF said on Thursday it would expand its salmon farming by acquiring additional businesses in Norway and Canada, as Japanese companies continue to grow in the food sector, with a focus on protein. Faced with volatile fossil fuel markets and in search of stable revenue streams, Mitsubishi and its rivals have been diversifying into the food business, where demand is set to grow alongside a rising world population.

“In recent years, securing food resources has become a critical global challenge driven by population growth,” Mitsubishi said in a statement.

The acquisition of three companies from Norwegian Grieg Seafood ASA GRGSF was made via Cermaq Group, Mitsubishi's salmon farming company with assets in Norway, Canada and Chile. It will boost salmon production to around 280,000 tons in the 2027 fiscal year, up from some 200,000 tons produced by Cermaq annually now.

The acquisition price is NOK10.2-billion ($1.3-billion), Cermaq said in a separate statement.

Salmon is among the most popular sushi items in Japan, but the bulk of it is imported from other countries, including Norway and Chile. Japan aims to raise the share of locally sourced seafood it consumes to 94 per cent in 2033 from 54 per cent now.

In October, Marubeni MARUY began selling salmon from a farm operated near Mount Fuji by its Norwegian partner, adding to the seafood business where its rivals Mitsubishi and Mitsui MITSY are also present.

The Supreme Court issued an emergency order on July 16 temporarily blocking a lower court ruling that prevents voters in seven states from suing over alleged discrimination under the federal Voting Rights Act.

The lower court is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which covers Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

            Roy Wanyonyi steps into the dark and dusty living room, its armchairs still carefully adorned in white lace covers, though it has been many months since guests sat here.
    


            The last time he and his wife, Maximilla Mwanga, were in this home in Webuye, an industrial town in western Kenya, was a little over a year ago. It was also the last time he saw his daughter, Tiffany Wanyonyi, alive.
    


            Like her father, Tiffany was a police officer. She was stationed in the capital, Nairobi, where she lived with her two children. In March 2024, after her grandmother passed away, Tiffany returned to her childhood home to attend the funeral. After the service, Tiffany appeared in good spirits, reminiscing about her grandmother's long life before leaving the gathering with her husband.
    


            She never made it back to Nairobi.
    


            The next morning, Wanyonyi woke up to the most devastating phone call of his life. It was the local police commander: Tiffany had been murdered.
    


            “My head just went dizzy,” Wanyonyi told CNN. “I didn't believe…” he added, struggling to find the words to describe his shock, even now.
    


            At the morgue, Wanyonyi and Mwanga, Tiffany's stepmother, faced their worst nightmare. “The way I found my daughter… was not easy,” Mwanga said, her voice quivering. “She was in two pieces: her head and the body.”
    


            Tiffany's husband, Jackson Ololtele, is now awaiting trial, charged with her murder. He has pleaded not guilty.
    


            In a country facing a surge in violence against women, Tiffany's case underlines that even female police officers are not immune.
    


            Last year was the deadliest for women in Kenya, with 170 reported killed (including 127 murders labeled as femicides), according to Africa Data Hub in partnership with Odipodev and Africa Uncensored, which analyzed news reports and court records going back almost a decade.
    


            Already, 2025 is shaping up to be just as deadly. Between January and March 2025 alone, 129 women were killed according to Kenya's National Police Service, local media reported. The police service wouldn't confirm this figure or previous years to CNN and campaigners have argued a lack of centralized data is part of the problem in tackling femicide.
    


            The violence is so pervasive that several police officers working on “gender desks” – a special unit established a decade ago to address Kenya's gender-based violence – told CNN of female colleagues who had been victims of gender-based violence themselves. Such officers are often silenced by stigma, burdened by trauma and failed by the very system they serve, according to experts and female police officers who spoke to CNN.
    


            A dedicated counselling and chaplaincy department is available for officers, Kenya Police spokesperson, Muchiri Nyaga, told CNN. The force would not comment further on perceived failures in the system.
    


            After her death, Tiffany's parents moved from her childhood home in Webuye. In the garden today, a simple cross and plaque mark her grave.
    


            Inside their new home, Wanyonyi looks at a photograph of Tiffany in her police uniform, his fingers lingering over her khaki jacket. “It was her graduation day,” he said of his first-born child, his eyes crinkling fondly at the memory of watching the ceremony, which was broadcast on national television. It was also one of the proudest moments for their family of officers – Roy's second-born son is an intelligence officer.
    


            But behind these proud moments were deep struggles. Tiffany's uniform was no protection from violence in the home, her parents told CNN. She often clashed with her husband over his refusal to seek employment or provide financially for their children, said Wanyonyi and Mwanga.
    


            When asked if his daughter's job as a police officer offered her protection from domestic abuse, Wanyonyi shook his head. Tiffany's husband didn't see her as a police officer, he said. He saw her “as his wife.”
    


            Wanyonyi recalled how after one particularly violent confrontation he felt compelled to intervene. He reported the assault to the police. But just a few days later, the couple reconciled – and Tiffany, being the named victim, withdrew the case.
    


            When Mwanga asked Tiffany why she withdrew the case, she said: “‘Mommy, that's the man I love.'”
    


            Njeri Wa Migwi – a domestic violence survivor and leading activist in Kenya's fight against femicide – has heard countless stories like this over the years, including from women, like Tiffany, who are often seen as pillars of support for victims.
    


            “The saddest bit about my work,” Wa Migwi told CNN, “is that even the person you are reporting to could be a victim of gender-based violence,” referring to female police officers.
    


            Because Kenyan law requires that any crime be reported within the jurisdiction where it occurred, many female officers choose to remain silent themselves, afraid of the shame and stigma they might face from their own colleagues in reporting their own abuse.
    


            Tiffany's parents recounted how barely a year into her service as a police officer, she confided to them about her deep humiliation whenever her husband publicly quarreled with and abused her –– often in full view of her colleagues, both at the station and in the staff residential quarters.
    


            In her 20 years in the police service, Consolata – whose name has been changed to protect her identity – has seen many fellow female officers go to extreme lengths to hide their abuse.
    


            She recalled one colleague, a fellow officer, increasingly withdrawing from work, and later, turning to alcohol to cope. “When I pressed her to explain (her change in behavior), she simply said: ‘I'm scared when darkness comes. I don't want to go to the house,'” Consolata told CNN.
    


            The officer later revealed to Consolata that she was being sexually assaulted by a senior inspector, who in public posed as an attentive mentor. The officer did not report the abuse and the Kenya Police Service would not comment on the incident.
    


            Another fellow female officer repeatedly turned up to work with injuries, Consolata said, and explained them as accidents. Only after neighbors raised concerns did the truth emerge: She was being abused by her husband.
    


            The female officer did press charges against her husband. Though eventually she opted to drop the case, leave the relationship, and request a transfer to a different station.
    


            Consolata isn't surprised by her colleagues' initial silence. “Most officers are reluctant to speak up because of societal expectations,” she added.
    


            The high-risk nature of female police officers' work – from confronting criminals to handling dangerous investigations – means they are often seen as “strong women,” a perception that pressures many of them to hide any signs of vulnerability.
    


            But keeping up this public persona has its dangers, Consolata said.
    


            If female police officers entrusted with seeking justice for women and girls are afraid to speak out about their own abuse, “how can someone be sure that their case will be taken seriously?” Consolata said, adding: “I think it shakes the public's confidence.”
    


            Meanwhile, the number of female police officers is declining, according to Fatuma Mohamed, Commissioner at the Kenya-based Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA). She cites a report from UN Women which found that in March 2023, of the 106,830 Kenyan police officers, just 7,457 were women – roughly 6.9%.
    


            And yet nowhere are female officers needed more than on the gender desk.
    


            In Kenyan police stations, this is the first port of call for women and girls reporting gender-based violence –– and the face they are greeted with matters.
    


            Declining numbers of female police officers means that gender desks are sometimes solely manned by male officers, which can feel intimidating for women reporting intimate partner violence.
    


            “When it comes to sexual violation,” explained Dorcas Amakobe, executive director of the sports development organization Moving the Goalposts, there are things that “from a cultural perspective, a young woman or a parent would feel uncomfortable telling a man.”
    


            Public trust in the police has already taken a hit amid recent high-profile cases of alleged police brutality, including at most recent anti-government protests earlier this month where at least 31 people died and hundreds were arrested, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).
    


            While these clashes with police have been dominating headlines, campaigners against the femicide crisis are still working to keep their issue in the spotlight. That includes how reports of gender-based violence are handled by the police.
    


            For female victims of abuse, coming forward to report the crime might be more comfortable for women “when you find someone who looks like you,” Amakobe said of the need for female officers at gender desks.
    


            Gender desk officer Rehema Fondo told CNN, “We hear stories every single day, sometimes five cases in one shift. It's overwhelming,” of incidents which might span harassment, assault and rape. “At the end of the day, we're human too. We need psychological support.”
    


            In response, Kenya Police spokesperson, Muchiri Nyaga, pointed to the force's counselling service. Though he did acknowledge to CNN there is a growing concern within the force over the limited number of female officers in general – which he hopes to tackle with a recruitment drive later this year.
    


            Meanwhile Kenyan activists have criticized the government's disconnect between its rhetoric on femicide and its actions.
    


            Late last year, Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi launched the “Safe Homes, Safe Spaces” initiative, which aimed to address gender-based violence in the country.
    


            But his message was quickly overshadowed. The following day, the police cracked down on nationwide protesters rallying against femicide.
    


            “In Kenya, it feels like the right to assemble is no longer protected by the constitution,” Wa Migwi told CNN, recalling how she was tear-gassed while peacefully attending the protest. “We were simply crying out — stop killing us. And yet, in that very moment, for demanding our rights, we were beaten, humiliated, tear-gassed.”
    


            Kenya's principal secretary for Internal Security and National Administration, Dr. Raymond Omollo, described the police's actions as “unfortunate,” acknowledging that while the intent was to maintain order, the execution was “regrettable.”
    


            Wa Migwi believes the Kenyan government should declare the femicide crisis a national disaster, much like it did with the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the late 1990s. After it was declared a national disaster, “they put their resources into (fighting) it,” she added.
    


            Other human rights experts have called out the country's entrenched patriarchal norms and weak law enforcement, which they say has deepened the femicide crisis.
    


            In January, President William Ruto acknowledged in a special issue of The Kenya Gazette that there were “existing gaps in prevention, response, investigations, prosecution, data management, and survivor support systems in GBV and femicide cases.” He committed to enhanced legal, investigative, and institutional reforms  including a specialized task force, police and hospital gender desks, and support for survivors — while also calling on citizens and communities to take moral responsibility.
    


            But for Wanyonyi and Mwanga –– who are now left to raise Tiffany's two children –– these government pledges need to be followed with real change.
    


            Wanyonyi called for an urgent “way to finish it (the violence epidemic),” adding that women and girls are being “slaughtered, being killed.”
    


            The femicide crisis “leaves scars” on so many “innocent people,” he said.

Canada's main stock index rose to a record high on Thursday, aided by gains for financial and technology shares, as Alimentation Couche-Tard abandoned a major takeover bid and U.S. data pointed to economic resilience.

The S&P/TSX composite index ended up 233.96 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 27,386.93, surpassing Monday's record closing high.

“Market strength has been unexpected and pretty exceptional, and that can be attributed to data that shows both Canada and the U.S. are holding up despite ongoing tariff threats,” said Elvis Picardo, a portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth.

U.S. retail sales rebounded more than expected in June, but some of the increase likely reflected higher prices for some goods exposed to tariffs. 

“This rally has been relentless - hardly any pullbacks,” Mr. Picardo said. “The fear of missing out currently dominates the possibility that you may have some downside going into the volatile summer months.”

The technology sector rose 2.53 per cent, with e-commerce company Shopify Inc adding 6.43 per cent. Financials , which account for 33 per cent of the TSX's weighting, was up 1.12 per cent.

Alimentation Couche-Tard pulled its $46-billion bid to buy 7-Eleven's parent company Seven & i Holdings, saying the Japanese retailer did not engage constructively on the deal. Shares of the convenience store operator jumped 8.2 per cent.

The S&P 500 stock index and the Nasdaq Composite also both closed at record highs on Thursday, as investors embraced strong economic data and earnings reports that showed American consumers remained willing to spend.

The Nasdaq has ended at a record high in six of the previous seven sessions, and the S&P 500 has had six best finishes since June 27.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 35.32 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 6,299.02 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 157.25 points, or 0.76 per cent, to 20,887.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 247.64 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 44,502.42.

Wall Street has had a strong run since tumbling after President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcements in early April and then recovering. This week was seen as a proving ground for these gains though, with a number of key economic reports and the start of second-quarter earnings season.

Economic data and corporate earnings reports “are showing that the economic backdrop is still pretty solid, and so markets have been able to grind higher this week with some data to support where we are going,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.

U.S. retail sales bounced back sharply in June, data showed on Thursday. Investors saw renewed economic momentum and confidence among consumers, after mixed inflation data which showed stalled producer prices and a spike in consumer inflation in the same month.

Investors have been watching for signs of whether Trump's tariff policies are starting to permeate the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve has indicated it will hold off on interest rate cuts until it can see the inflationary impact of higher import taxes.

This was reiterated on Thursday by Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who said rate cuts are on hold for now, as Trump's tariffs begin to push up consumer prices.

Traders now peg the odds of a September rate cut at just over 54 per cent, with a July move nearly ruled out, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Accompanying strong retail sales was upbeat commentary from consumer-facing American companies.

PepsiCo jumped after forecasting upbeat results, fueled by demand for energy drinks and healthier sodas, helping offset concerns about a dip in annual core profit.

United Airlines gained after the carrier projected stronger demand since early July, offering a rare bright spot for an industry strained by Trump's budget cuts and trade tensions.

Rivals Delta and American Airlines also climbed.

Technology stocks were also buoyed, in particular U.S. chipmakers, after TSMC, the world's main producer of advanced AI chips, posted a record quarterly profit, saying demand for artificial intelligence was getting stronger.

U.S.-listed shares of TSMC gained, as did Marvell and Nvidia.

Ameriprise's Mr. Saglimbene said the blowout TSMC earnings bode well for chipmakers and the wider technology sector.

“Before we get all the Big Tech earnings in the next week or two, you're seeing the single source of production of those (AI) chips saying their demand is very strong. So the set-up for Big Tech is pretty positive, which is why technology is leading on the day today,” he added.

White House press secretary doubles down on Trump's partisan lines of attack about the Jeffrey Epstein case, which has caused turmoil among his Maga base

Trump supporters burn Maga hats after he dismisses Epstein files furor

Trump's allies have been pushing the president to name a special counsel in the Epstein case, but Leavitt says he's not interested in doing that.

“The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case. That's how he feels,” the White House press secretary says.

Asked why the administration can't simply release more information from the files, Leavitt says that would be up to the justice department, but if it includes grand jury information, “a judge would have to approve it. That's out of the president's control.”

The US House of Representatives voted 308-122 to pass a bill to create a regulatory framework for US-dollar-pegged cryptocurrency tokens known as stablecoins, sending the bill to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.

The No votes included 110 Democrats and 12 Republicans.

The vote marks a watershed moment for the digital asset industry, which has been pushing for federal legislation for years and poured money into last year's elections in order to promote pro-crypto candidates.

House lawmakers also passed a bill developing a regulatory framework for crypto. That will move on to the Senate for consideration.

The stablecoin bill, dubbed the Genius Act, received bipartisan support, with many Democrats joining Republicans to back the proposed federal rules. The 294-134 vote on the market structure bill, known as the Clarity Act, was also supported by dozens of Democrats.

Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say that they could be used to send payments instantly.

If signed into law, the stablecoin bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets - such as US dollars and short-term Treasury bills - and for issuers to publicly disclose the composition of their reserves on a monthly basis.

Among the most vigorous opponents of the Genius Act has been Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and one of the nation's top experts on bankruptcy.

Critics have slammed an agreement between Medicaid officials and Ice – which allows agents to examine a database of Americans' personal information, including home addresses, social security numbers and ethnicities – as a privacy betrayal carrying serious civil rights and health risks.

“This is about the weaponization of data, full stop,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic US representative from Washington state, who has worked extensively on US healthcare, in a statement on social media.

“Trump said he would go after the ‘worst of the worst' immigrants, yet now is giving ICE EVERYONE's Medicaid data, even as ICE targets US citizens. Oh, and undocumented immigrants can't even enroll in Medicaid.”

Undocumented migrants are generally not eligible for Medicaid and only some lawfully present migrants may obtain coverage under the program. Eligible noncitizen immigrants represent only about 6% of people currently enrolled in Medicaid, according to the healthcare research non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation. The Trump administration has deeply cut Medicaid by adding bureaucracy and red tape.

It is unclear whether Ice agents have already accessed Medicaid information, according to the Associated Press, which first reported on the agreement. However, even the existence of such an agreement could deter people from seeking needed medical care, including for children.

“This is a privacy violation of unprecedented proportions and betrayal of trust, as the government has explicitly said, for decades, that this information will never be used for immigration enforcement,” said Ben D'Avanzo, a healthcare strategist at the National Immigration Law Center, on social media.

Donald Trump will not name a special counsel in the Jeffrey Epstein case, his White House press secretary confirmed. And asked to clarify what aspect of the case Trump believes to be a “hoax” Karoline Leavitt said he was referring to “the fact that Democrats have now seized on this”. But Trump's efforts to dismiss the criticism over his administration's handling of the Epstein case has showed no sign of working today, with more prominent figures from across the political spectrum – including his own allies – have emerged to attack the president. Some of his supporters even recorded videos burning their signature “Make America great again” hats.

An evaluation of swelling in the president's lower legs have revealed chronic venous insufficiency, “a common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70”, Leavitt said, reading from a doctor's letter. she added: “Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”

The House of Representatives is expected to vote tonight on Donald Trump's $9bn funding cut to public media and to foreign aid, after the Senate delivered a victory for the president when it approved the package last night, though speaker Mike Johnson said it could slide to tomorrow. Congress faces a deadline tomorrow to approve the rescissions package if the Trump administration is to avoid having to spend the money.

Republican senators advanced through the judiciary committee Emil Bove's nomination to serve as a judge on a federal appeals court, after Democrats walked out of the session in protest of the GOP's refusal to call a whistleblower who alleged the nominee advocated for ignoring court orders. Erez Reuveni, a former justice department official who was fired from his post, alleged that during his time at the justice department, Bove told lawyers that they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you' and ignore any such court order” blocking efforts to remove immigrants to El Salvador. The GOP showed little indication of sharing those concerns, and voted to advance Bove along with 11 other nominees to federal judgeships nationwide.

Despite the Trump administration's claims to be focusing on the “worst of the worst” offenders in its highly aggressive and controversial deportation campaign, the latest Ice data suggests many undocumented immigrants without violent criminal records have been ensnared in the process, CBS News reports. Of the estimated 100,000 people who were deported between 1 January and 24 June by Ice, 70,583 were convicted criminals, but most of these documented transgressions were traffic or immigration offenses. Less than 1% had murder convictions and fewer than 2% had convictions for sex crimes or sexual assault. Around 15% were convicted of assault. Just under 30% had no criminal convictions at all.

On that topic, Ice officials will be given access to the personal data of the nation's 79 million Medicaid enrollees, including home addresses and ethnicities, to track down immigrants who may not be living legally in the US, according to an agreement obtained by The Associated Press.

Trump's huge spending boost for the Pentagon will produce an additional 26 megatons (Mt) of planet-heating gases – on a par with the annual carbon equivalent (CO2e) emissions generated by 68 gas power plants or the entire country of Croatia, new research reveals. The budget bonanza will push the Pentagon's total greenhouse emissions to a staggering 178 Mt of CO2e, resulting in an estimated $47bn in economic damages globally, according to new analysis by the Climate and Community Institute (CCI), a US-based research thinktank, shared exclusively with the Guardian. It comes amid worsening climate breakdown, and as Americans – many of them Trump voters – are being hit by destructive extreme weather events such as wildfires, extreme heat and the recent floods in Texas, as well as sea-level rise and other slow-onset climate effects.

A new US assessment has found that US strikes in June destroyed only one of three Iranian nuclear sites, NBC News reports, citing current and former US officials familiar with the matter. Trump rejected a military plan for further comprehensive strikes on Iran's nuclear program, which would have lasted several weeks, the report added.

Two months after Trump floated the farfetched idea of reopening Alcatraz as a federal prison, his attorney general Pam Bondi and interior secretary Doug Burgum visited the tourist site today. “The planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump administration's stupidest initiative yet,” California Democratic congresswomen and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

As we've just heard from his press secretary, Donald Trump will not name a special counsel in the Jeffrey Epstein case. And asked to clarify what aspect of the case Trump believes to be a “hoax” Karoline Leavitt said he was referring to “the fact that Democrats have now seized on this”.

But Trump's efforts to dismiss and deflect the criticism over his administration's handling of the Epstein case has showed no sign of working today, with more prominent figures from across the political spectrum – including his own allies – have emerged to attack the president. Some of his supporters even recorded videos burning their signature “Make America great again” hats.

Days after the Republican speaker of the House and Trump loyalist Mike Johnson called for the release of all documents relating to the late financier, a convicted sex offender and longtime former friend of Trump's, rebellion has continued to simmer within the president's normally diehard base.

Trump's former vice-president, Mike Pence, told CBS News yesterday: “I think the time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein's investigation and prosecution”. And far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, a frequent close adviser to Trump, called for the appointment of a special counsel to handle the Epstein files investigation.

“Obviously, this is not a complete hoax given the fact that [Epstein associate] Ghislaine Maxwell is currently serving 20 years in prison in Florida for her crimes and activities with Jeffrey Epstein, who we know is a convicted sexual predator,” Loomer said.

Donald Trump called Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address an Israeli strike on Gaza's sole Catholic church, Leavitt says.

Asked for Trump's reaction to the news, Leavitt says: “It was not a positive reaction.”

The strike killed three people and injured 10 others including the parish priest, who used to receive daily calls from the late Pope Francis.

Leavitt dismisses concerns about cuts to NPR's funding, saying “I'm not sure how NPR helps the public safety of our country”, calling the public broadcasting organization a “propaganda voice for the left”.

The European Union continues to be very eager in negotiating trade with the US, says Leavitt.

The bloc is seeking “ways to lower their tariff and their non-tariff barriers that we have long said harm our workers and our companies”, she said, adding that Donald Trump would not accept a postponement of the 1 August deadline when higher duties would come into effect.

Trump's allies have been pushing the president to name a special counsel in the Epstein case, but Leavitt says he's not interested in doing that.

“The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case. That's how he feels,” the White House press secretary says.

Asked why the administration can't simply release more information from the files, Leavitt says that would be up to the justice department, but if it includes grand jury information, “a judge would have to approve it. That's out of the president's control.”

Leavitt is asked by a reporter to clarify what aspect of the Jeffrey Epstein case Donald Trump believes is a hoax.

Leavitt says he's referring to “the fact that Democrats have now seized on this”.

She says the idea of Democrats wanting transparency on Epstein is an “asinine” suggestion, and claims that the Biden administration “didn't do a dang thing” about the case.

She goes on, getting to the crux of Trump's frustration:

The president has been transparent, he has followed through on his promises to the American people. What he doesn't like to see is Democrats and the mainstream media covering this like it's the biggest story that the American people care about.

Reading from a doctor's letter, Leavitt says that an evaluation of swelling in the president's lower legs have revealed chronic venous insufficiency, “a common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70”.

“Additionally, recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand,” Leavitt says. “This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”

Trump will also travel to the UK from 17-19 September for his unprecedented second state visit and will meet with King Charles at Windsor Castle, says Leavitt. (Parliament will be in recess and therefore Trump will not be addressing MPs).

Confirming reports earlier in the week, Leavitt says Donald Trump will travel to Scotland from 25-29 July to visit Turnberry and Aberdeen (he has golf courses there), and on this trip he'll meet Keir Starmer to “refine” the trading framework agreed with the UK.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is currently briefing reporters. I'll bring you any key lines here.

Republican senators have advanced through the judiciary committee Emil Bove's nomination to serve as a judge on a federal appeals court, after Democrats walked out of the session in protest of the GOP's refusal to call a whistleblower who alleged the nominee advocated for ignoring court orders.

Donald Trump nominated Bove, his defense attorney who he appointed as a top justice department official in the early weeks of his new administration, for a seat on the third circuit court of appeals overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin Islands. Bove's advancement through the judiciary committee clears the way for his confirmation to be voted on by the full Senate.

His nomination for the lifetime position has faced strident opposition from Democrats, after Erez Reuveni, a former justice department official who was fired from his post, alleged that during his time at the DoJ, Bove told lawyers that they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you' and ignore any such court order” blocking efforts to remove immigrants to El Salvador. In testimony before the committee last month, Bove denied the accusation, and Reuveni later provided text messages supporting his claim.

At today's hearing, the New Jersey senator Cory Booker attempted to formally delay the vote on confirming Bove, citing Reuveni's whistleblower complaint as well as letters from state and federal prosecutors opposing his nomination. “There is no need to vote on this nominee today. It is a false urgency,” Booker said.

His request was rejected by the committee's Republican chair, Chuck Grassley, and Democratic senators then walked out as the committee voted on Bove's nomination.

Booker, who remained in the committee's chambers and continued speaking as Republican senators called out their votes on Bove and other judicial nominees, continued:

What are you afraid of about even debating this, putting things on the record, hearing from every senator? Dear God, that's what our obligations are.

This is outrageous that you're not allowing senators to have their fair say before a controversial nominee is being done. This is unbelievable. This is unjust. This is wrong. It is the further deterioration of this committee's integrity with a person like this. What are you afraid of?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials will be given access to the personal data of the nation's 79 million Medicaid enrollees, including home addresses and ethnicities, to track down immigrants who may not be living legally in the US, according to an agreement obtained by The Associated Press.

The information will give Ice officials the ability to find “the location of aliens” across the country, says the agreement signed on Monday between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement has not been announced publicly.

The extraordinary disclosure of millions of such personal health data to deportation officials is the latest escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has repeatedly tested legal boundaries in its effort to arrest 3,000 people daily.

Lawmakers and some CMS officials have challenged the legality of deportation officials' access to some states' Medicaid enrollee data. It's a move, first reported by the AP last month, that health and human services officials said was aimed at rooting out people enrolled in the program improperly.

But the latest data-sharing agreement makes clear what Ice officials intend to do with the health data. “Ice will use the CMS data to allow Ice to receive identity and location information on aliens identified by Ice,” the agreement says.

Such disclosures, even if not acted upon, could cause widespread alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children. Other efforts to crack down on illegal immigration have made schools, churches, courthouses and other everyday places feel perilous to immigrants and even US citizens who fear getting caught up in a raid.
 Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon would not respond to the latest agreement. It is unclear, though, whether homeland security has yet accessed the information. The department's assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, said in an emailed statement to the AP that the two agencies “are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans”.

Two months after Donald Trump floated the farfetched idea of reopening Alcatraz as a federal prison, his attorney general Pam Bondi and interior secretary Doug Burgum are expected to visit the tourist site today, KQED reports.

Burgum, whose department controls the land, and Bondi, who oversees the Bureau of Prisons, plan to visit the shuttered prison before it opens for the day for tours, Nancy Pelosi's office confirmed to KQED.

“The planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump administration's stupidest initiative yet,” the California Democratic congresswomen and former House speaker said in a statement.

“Make no mistake: this stupidity is a diversionary tactic to draw attention away from this administration's cruelest actions yet in their Big, Ugly Law,” she said, referring to Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill.

The Trump administration cannot simply reopen Alcatraz. Current legislation places the island under the control of the Department of the Interior and designates it as part of a national park. Therefore, a member of Congress would need to propose a bill to change things.

“Should reason not prevail and Republicans bring this absurdity before the Congress, Democrats will use every parliamentary and budgetary tactic available to stop the lunacy,” Pelosi said.

Further to that, House speaker Mike Johnson has said that while the vote is still planned for tonight, it could end up taking place tomorrow.

“We're just looking at all the moving parts and the calendar and the timetable and all that,” Johnson said. The House is trying to fit all of the legislation planned for the entire week into one day after a group of Republicans blocked any action on crypto bills for two days.

“We know we've got a short fuse on rescissions for tomorrow, so we're figuring it out,” he said. Per my last post, Congress faces a deadline tomorrow to approve the rescissions package if the Trump administration is to avoid having to spend the money.

“It may be tomorrow, but we're doing it,” Johnson said when asked if the House could get it done tonight as planned. “We're moving as fast as we can.”

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz signed a landmark Anglo-German treaty in London on July 17, pledging mutual defense assistance in the event of an armed attack.

The treaty is the most significant bilateral pact between the two nations since 1945, according to Politico.

The agreement, described by Bloomberg as part of a broader reset in ties, reflects growing concerns across Europe over Russian military aggression and doubts about the U.S. commitment to NATO under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Though the treaty reinforces existing NATO obligations, officials from both governments emphasized it is not a substitute for the alliance's Article 5 collective defense principle.

Starmer described the agreement as a "historic document which really measures just how close our countries are and our ambition for the future," according to the BBC.

Merz said he was "surprised" to learn it is the first such agreement since World War II, adding: "We had you in the European Union and we thought that was enough, but we are now learning that it's not enough so we have to do more on that."

The accord, signed during a ceremony at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, is based on groundwork laid by Starmer and Merz's predecessor, Olaf Scholz, during a 2023 meeting in Berlin. The treaty marks a deepening of post-Brexit relations and growing strategic alignment between London and Berlin.

One of the key components of the deal is a joint pledge to deliver a new long-range missile system, the Deep Precision Strike capability, within the next decade. The system, with a range exceeding 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), is expected to drive substantial industrial investment into European defense sectors.

Although nuclear weapons are not explicitly mentioned in the text, the deal carries heightened importance for Germany, which lacks its own nuclear arsenal and relies on the deterrent umbrella of the U.S. and Europe's two nuclear states — the U.K. and France.

The treaty also addresses the broader fallout of Brexit, including agreements on trade, transport, and irregular migration. Germany will adopt legislation by the end of the year, making it illegal to facilitate irregular migration to the U.K., according to a statement from Starmer's office.

Anna Fratsyvir is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent, with a background in broadcast journalism and international affairs. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

Germany will provide Ukraine with new long-range missiles "very shortly, very soon," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, without mentioning the name of the weapons being supplied.





The "Test in Ukraine" initiative will allow foreign companies and governments to create solutions for real war challenges while receiving immediate feedback from military personnel and improving products based on combat experience.

Held under NATO auspices, the exercises aim to boost combat readiness and interoperability among allied and partner nations. 

"On one hand, it is very positive that President Trump is taking on a strong stance on Russia... On the other hand, 50 days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians," EU Special Envoy Kaja Kallas said.

Allied capabilities now allow NATO to "take that (Kaliningrad) down from the ground" faster than ever before, U.S. Army Europe and Africa commander General Chris Donahue said.

As part of the plan, the U.S. was weighing the sale of Patriot air defense systems from its own military stockpiles, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.





U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reviewed the drone, known as the Low-Cost Uncrewed Combat Attack System (LUCAS), during a July 16 demonstration at the Pentagon.



"The people of America need this technology, and you need to have it in your arsenal," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 



"The U.S. wants to strengthen its support to Ukraine... The U.S. has therefore decided to reprioritize the delivery of Patriot ground-based air defense systems," the Swiss Defense Ministry said in a statement.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced the cancellation of funding for California's High-Speed Rail project, citing delays and affordability issues, according to a late July 16 Truth Social post.

“To the Law abiding, Tax paying, Hardworking Citizens of the United States of America, I am thrilled to announce that I have officially freed you from funding California's disastrously overpriced, ‘HIGH SPEED TRAIN TO NOWHERE,'” Trump said.

The Aichi prefectural board of education fired a male teacher at a junior high school on Wednesday on disciplinary grounds after he was charged with non-consensual indecency with a female student attending the same school.

The teacher, who is in his 20s, was working at a public junior high school in the Owari area in Aichi Prefecture. According to the board, between December last year and March this year, he had been in contact with the girl privately and snuggled with and kissed her at an internet cafe in Nagoya. He also kissed her in a park near her home.

The board reported to the police, which last month referred the teacher's case to prosecutors on suspicion of non-consensual indecency.

Couche-Tard's efforts to take over Seven & i had dragged down its Canadian stock price.The Associated Press

Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. ATD-T has abandoned its roughly US$46-billion effort to take over 7-Eleven parent Seven & i Holdings Co. SVNDY, blasting its Japanese rival for failing to engage in meaningful talks toward a potential deal.

Laval, Que.-based Couche-Tard's move puts an end to its nearly year-long effort to pursue Seven & i, bringing finality to a situation that has dragged down the Canadian company's stock price. The Japanese company had been frosty to the proposal from the start, raising further questions about whether Japanese corporations remain as closed to mergers and acquisitions deal-making as they have been historically. 

“There has been no sincere or constructive engagement from 7&i that would facilitate the advancement of any proposal, contrary to comments made by 7&i representatives” as recently as this month, Couche-Tard chair Alain Bouchard and chief executive Alex Miller said in a note to the Japanese company's board released late Wednesday. 

“Rather, you have engaged in a calculated campaign of obfuscation and delay, to the great detriment of 7&i and its shareholders. We believe this approach reinforces our concerns about your approach to governance.”

The pulled bid is a big blow for Mr. Bouchard, who has twice previously eyed a purchase of his largest competitor and harboured ambitions to create one of the world's biggest retailers. But it will be a relief for Couche-Tard shareholders, with a probable jump in its shares on Thursday. 

“Investors have symptoms of deal fatigue,” Stifel analyst Martin Landry had said before Wednesday's news. 

Couche-Tard's all-cash offer was worth 2,600 yen per share, a 47.6 per cent premium to the date its interest became public. Seven & i shareholders will now be left hoping management can deliver something of equal or greater value. As part of their standalone strategy, Seven is selling its underperforming supermarkets and plans to list a portion of its U.S. retail operation to fund a massive stock buyback.

Couche-Tard, which controls the retail banner Circle K, struck a nondisclosure agreement with Seven & i in April, a crucial step. But in a sign things were not moving along as expected, Mr. Miller was cagey when asked last month about the likelihood of a deal and whether his Japanese counterparts were truly responsive. 

7-Eleven owner staves off Canadian takeover, but struggles remain as shares fall

In Wednesday's letter, the Couche-Tard executives pulled back the curtain on what was happening behind the scenes. 

They said they repeatedly sought to speak to Seven & i's founding Ito family, a major shareholder in the company, but that they have not been open to any conversation. They said that after 10 weeks of diligence, just 14 total files relating to Seven & i's U.S. business were provided, while “none of our critical questions” were answered. And they said that despite the fact both companies agreed there would be engagement with business leaders across the Seven & i organization, the two management meetings that were held yielded little in the way of insight and progress. 

One meeting in Tokyo lasted half the allotted time and was “tightly scripted,” Couche-Tard said, with their Japanese counterparts not willing to answer basic queries about industry dynamics. At the other meeting in Dallas, when one 7-11 executive attempted to thoughtfully address a question related to international licensees, he was “interupted and rebuked” by Seven & i CEO Stephen Dacus, “who pointed to his head as if to remind his colleague to ‘think,'” according to Couche-Tard's account. 

“As we have expressed many times, we do believe that fully combining our two companies is the most straightforward and effective way to maximize value to all stakeholders,” the Couche-Tard executives said in the letter. 

“We believe this combination has the ability to enhance that path. However, we are not able to effectively pursue this combination without deeper and genuine further engagement from 7&i leadership and the special committee.”

Seven & i confirmed that Alimentation Couche-Tard “unilaterally decided to end discussions” and withdraw its proposal. It denied it acted improperly. 

“While we are disappointed by ACT's decision, and disagree with their numerous mischaracterizations, we are not surprised,” the Japanese retailer said in a statement posted on its web, adding that there have been significant changes in the global economy, exchange rates and financing markets since Couche-Tard made its first proposal.

Seven & I's special committee “consistently engaged in good faith and constructively with ACT to explore the possibility of reaching a deal,” the Japanese company said. “At the same time, we were always honest about the extraordinary antitrust hurdles a potential transaction would face.”

Why this money manager is buying Nestle, Dollarama and selling Couche-Tard

It would have been a monster merger, combining the two biggest convenience-store players in the United States at a time the industry is facing mounting pressure from other retail rivals and consumers are closely watching their spending. The sector remains highly fragmented in that country, with the top 10 chains making up only 19 per cent of the total number of stores. 

Couche-Tard leaders revealed in the letter that they proposed alternatives to a takeover of Seven & i in its entirety, including buying the company's international business outside of Japan or taking a 40-per-cent minority stake in the Japanese business. That would have been a way for the Canadian company to learn more about the Asia market, one of its priorities. 

They said Seven & i proposed another option, offering its international business to Couche-Tard in return for equity ownership in the Canadian company's shares. That offer was rejected by Couche-Tard as undermining the “operational prospects of the combined business.” 

Japan has long been seen as resistant to foreign takeovers. 7-Eleven's status as a beloved institution and part of daily life in Japan made Couche-Tard's bid to win over the company's stakeholders all the more challenging. 

Japan's government in 2023 issued new guidelines to the corporate sector in an effort to loosen cultural barriers to foreign investment. But Couche-Tard's move to throw in the towel on its 7-Eleven vision after extensive overtures suggests the government's message did little to open doors to foreign interests.

The sheer size of the potential takeover had scared some Couche-Tard investors, who have expressed concerns about equity dilution if a big sale of shares is needed to fund the deal. The shares are down 20 per cent from their 52-week high.

At the moment, the key issue for Couche-Tard is that the company is “not delivering growth that investors have become accustomed to, it is not repurchasing shares, and there is an equity issuance overhang,” National Bank of Canada analyst Vishal Shreedhar said in a June 4 research note. 

“We anticipate these issues to resolve over the near term.”

PARIS, July 17. /TASS/. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Rally parliamentary faction, has announced plans to run for a seat in parliament if the snap elections are held.

"I will run in the elections and will defend my candidature in relevant instances - the administrative court, and then the Council of State," she said in an interview with Le Parisien.

According to Le Pen, the process in these instances will give her a possibility to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council, which will be obliged to check the decision banning her from taking part in elections for the compliance with the constitution. "I have said that I will use all possible means of appeal. I will do this," she stressed.

Early elections to the National Assembly, or the lower house of parliament, will be called if President Emmanuel Macron exercises his constitutional right to dissolve the lower house.

On March 31, a Paris court sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison in connection with the parliamentary assistants case. The court also ruled to bar her from holding elected office and participating in elections for five years. Unlike the prison term, this measure took immediate effect and can only be overturned if an appeal succeeds. This ruling disqualifies her from running in the French presidential election in 2027 or participating in parliamentary elections in the event of an early dissolution of the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament). Le Pen slammed the ruling as politically motivated and filed an appeal with a higher court. The appellate review is expected to conclude by summer 2026.

            Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell responded by letter Thursday to a senior Trump administration official who accused the head of the central bank of mismanaging an “ostentatious overhaul” of its Washington, DC, headquarters.
    


            Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, suggested in a social media post last week that Powell had broken the law by failing to comply with government oversight regulations related to the Fed's ongoing $2.5 billion renovation, which includes the historic marble Marriner S. Eccles Building on the National Mall.
    


            “The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,” Vought wrote in the letter he posted to social media last Thursday. “Instead of attempting to right the Fed's fiscal ship, you have plowed ahead with an ostentatious overhaul of your Washington D.C. headquarters.”
    


            He gave Powell “seven business days” to respond to the July 10 letter.
    


            Powell said in his response late Thursday that the renovation and its financing have always had careful oversight from the central bank's board and its own watchdog. He added that the Fed is “not generally subject to the direction” of the National Capital Planning Commission, a body that oversees construction projects for the federal government. Powell said the Fed voluntarily opted to collaborate with the NCPC.
    


            “We have taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen since it was first approved by the Board in 2017,” Powell wrote.
    


            Additionally, Powell said upgrades that were reflected in official planning documents submitted to the NCPC in 2021 were later taken out, but the Fed didn't need to resubmit paperwork because they weren't “substantial.”
    


            The changes were instead “intended to simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,” Powell wrote. “The Board does not regard any of these changes as warranting further review.”
    


            In his letter, Powell noted that both buildings needed “significant structural repairs and other updates… including the removal of asbestos and lead contamination, complete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and -2- suppression systems.”
    


            The letter is similar to a FAQ posted on the Fed's website last week.
    


            Vought is one of several officials in the Trump administration to criticize the rising costs of repair and renovation work on two major buildings in the Fed complex, seemingly as a pretext to justify firing the Fed chair.
    


            Powell, who cannot be removed except “for cause,” presides over the Fed's monetary policy committee that has been holding interest rates at current levels all year, contrary to President Donald Trump's wishes for lower borrowing costs.
    


            “When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,” Trump told reporters this week, adding that he believes it is “sort of” a fireable offense. He clarified on Wednesday morning that it was “highly unlikely” that he would fire Powell — “unless he has to leave for fraud.”
    


            Last month, Powell was asked about the central bank's renovation plans during his biannual testimony before Congress and pushed back on the assertion that he has overlooked the project's steep price tag to indulge in upscale design features.
    


            “There's no VPI [sic] dining room. There's no new marble. We took down the old marble while putting it back up,” Powell said. “There are no new water features. There's no beehives and there's no roof terrace gardens.”
    


            Vought's July 10 letter accused Powell of lying in his testimony. In his response Thursday, Powell clarified that some features, including new water features, had been eliminated in the years since the initial design proposal.
    


            “These changes were intended to simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,” Powell wrote.
    


            He clarified that while there are no “roof terrace gardens,” a parking lot is being constructed under the building, meaning the ground-level front lawn will serve as a “roof” for the parking structure. Marble sourced from Georgia would be used in places where the original marble structure was damaged, he said.
    


            Still, the project's cost has increased compared to earlier plans, which estimated it would cost $1.9 billion.
    


            A 2023 Fed budget document attributed some of the additional cost to “significant increases in raw materials… higher labor costs, and changes in construction schedule expectations which lengthen use of leased space.”
    


            The Fed has previously said materials and equipment for the project have been sourced from 32 states and Washington, D.C.

CHICAGO (AP) — Protests and events against President Donald Trump's controversial policies that include mass deportations and cuts to Medicaid and other safety nets for poor people have started Thursday at more than 1,600 locations around the country.

The “Good Trouble Lives On” national day of action honors the late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. Protests were being held along streets, at court houses and other public spaces. Organizers have called for them to be peaceful.

“We are navigating one of the most terrifying moments in our nation's history,” Public Citizen co-president Lisa Gilbert said during an online news conference Tuesday. “We are all grappling with a rise of authoritarianism and lawlessness within our administration ... as the rights, freedoms and expectations of our very democracy are being challenged.”

Public Citizen is a nonprofit with a stated mission of taking on corporate power. It is a member of a coalition of groups behind Thursday's protests.

Major protests were planned in Atlanta and St. Louis, as well as Oakland, California, and Annapolis, Maryland.

Lewis first was elected to Congress in 1986. He died in 2020 at the age of 80 following an advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

He was the youngest and last survivor of the Big Six civil rights activists, a group led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, a 25-year-old Lewis led some 600 protesters in the Bloody Sunday march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Lewis was beaten by police, suffering a skull fracture.




Within days, King led more marches in the state, and President Lyndon Johnson pressed Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act that later became law.

“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America,” Lewis said in 2020 while commemorating the 1965 voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.

Chicago will be the flagship city for Thursday's protests as demonstrators are expected to rally downtown in the afternoon. 

Betty Magness, executive vice president of the League of Women Voters Chicago and one of the organizers of Chicago's event, said the rally will also include a candlelight vigil to honor Lewis.

Much of the rest of the rally will have a livelier tone, Magness said, adding “we have a DJ who's gonna rock us with boots on the ground.”

Pushback against Trump so far in his second term has centered on deportations and immigration enforcement tactics

Earlier this month, protesters engaged in a tense standoff as federal authorities conducted mass arrests at two Southern California marijuana farms. One farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic raid.

Those raids followed Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard outside federal buildings and to protect immigration agents carrying out arrests on Los Angeles. On June 8, thousands of protesters began taking to the streets in Los Angeles.

And organizers of the June 14 “No Kings” demonstrations said millions of people marched in hundreds of events from New York to San Francisco. Demonstrators labeled Trump as a dictator and would-be king for marking his birthday with a military parade.

            Mexico City officials have announced a 14-point plan to address the capital's housing and gentrification problems, which sparked large and sometimes violent protests earlier this month.
    


            Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said officials will propose a law to regulate rental prices, strike a balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants, prevent people from being displaced and regulate short-term rental properties.
    


            Many residents say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods, in part because of overtourism, short-term home rentals and an influx of people and businesses with higher purchasing power.

            Brugada said on Wednesday that an “objective and rigorous methodology” will be worked out to regulate temporary housing rentals to prevent residents from being displaced and avoid “the loss of the community's roots and identity.”
    


            The city government will also set up an agency to enforce the rent law and penalize offenders.
    


            Brugada said living in Mexico City should not be a privilege for a few, but rather a guaranteed right for all its residents.
    


            “The issue of gentrification is one of the most important issues in the city today, but it is not new either. It is not only an issue for the city, but also for the entire world, and it means the displacement of thousands of families,” the mayor said.
    


            The proposal comes days after residents demonstrated on July 4 against gentrification and the rising cost of living in the Mexican capital, which some have blamed on an influx of foreigners from the United States and Europe.
    


            While the demonstration was largely peaceful and reflected growing anger about inequality in the city, some protesters vandalized stores in wealthier neighborhoods and used anti-immigration language that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized as xenophobic.
    


            Frente Anti Gentrificación Mx, one of several groups that helped organize the protest, pushed back against Sheinbaum's characterization, saying the demonstration was meant to highlight the plight of those priced out of their homes and to demand reforms from the government.
    


            “We are not against migration because gentrification is not a problem of migration (which is) a human right. We are against violence as a government model,” spokesperson Yessica Morales told CNN last week.
    


            Housing costs in the country have soared to 286% since 2005 while real wages have gone down by 33%, according to Morales, citing data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography and the Federal Mortgage Society.
    


            Mexico City's mayor on Wednesday called on protesters to engage in dialogue.
    


            “To the people who are promoting the marches and mobilizations, I say that with all the more reason we will open the necessary discussions with them on this issue,” she said.
    


            Experts say gentrification in Mexico City has been happening for decades and can't be blamed on immigration alone. But the arrival of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb and remote work policies during the Covid-19 pandemic turbo-charged the gentrification debate in recent years.
    


            Airbnb defended its activities in Mexico City last week, saying it helped generate more than $1 billion in the local economy last year, and argued that guests who booked accommodations also spent money on shops and services in the capital.
    


            The issue is not unique to Mexico City. Across Europe, residents of tourist destinations have also protested gentrification, while local governments have announced restrictions on short-term rentals in several cities.

WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions. 

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There's no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.'' 

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”




That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use. 

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans' utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation's electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn't oversight. It's obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy. 

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum's order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management. 

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law's enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

Denise Richards has accused her estranged husband Aaron Phypers of “repeatedly” physically abusing her throughout their marriage, according to court documents.
    


            Richards was granted a temporary restraining order against Phypers, the documents state, which were filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday and obtained by CNN.
    


            The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star alleged in her declaration that throughout their relationship, Phypers would “frequently violently choke me, violently squeeze my head with both hands, tightly squeeze my arms, violently slap me in my face and head, aggressively slam my head into the bathroom towel rack, threaten to kill me,” and that he hacked into her laptop and phone to download “all of my text messages,” the filing read.
    


            CNN has reached out to a representative for Richards for comment.
    


            In a statement to People magazine on Thursday, Phypers denied the allegations, saying, “Let me be unequivocally clear: I have never physically or emotionally abused Denise — or anyone.”
    


            “These accusations are completely false and deeply hurtful. Denise and I, like many couples, have faced our share of challenges, but any suggestion of abuse is categorically untrue,” his statement continued. “I have always tried to approach our marriage with love, patience, and respect.”
    


            CNN has been unable to reach Phypers for further comment.
    


            Richards said in her filing that until now, she'd been “afraid” to report Phyper to authorities because “he has repeatedly threatened to kill himself and me if I reported him to the police, among his other threats of harm to me and himself if he is reported for his abuse to anyone.”
    


            “As with most of Aaron's abuse of me, I felt fearful Aaron may kill me or cause me serious bodily harm,” the filing read.
    


            A photo of Richards with what appears to be a black eye is included in one of the exhibits of the filing.
    


            Richards' allegations come weeks after Phypers filed for divorce from Richards, according to publicly available court records online.
    


            The former couple were married in 2018 and do not share any children together.

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports on Sarah Grace Patrick turning herself in for allegedly murdering her mother and stepfather on 'Fox News Live.'

After spending years in a mental health center, a Wisconsin woman involved in the infamous 2014 "Slender Man" stabbing case will be released, a judge ruled after several months of deliberation, according to The Associated Press.

Morgan Geyser, now 22, confessed in 2017 to stabbing her friend, Peyton Leutner, when Geyser was just 12 years old, as part of a disturbing plan she and co-defendant Anissa Weier devised to appease "Slender Man," a fictional internet figure.

As part of a plea deal, Geyser was committed to a psychiatric institution, where she has spent the past eight years. On Thursday, a Waukesha County judge approved her conditional release, the AP reported.

The decision follows a lengthy legal process that included expert testimony, prosecutor's objections and a judicial review of Geyser's mental health status. In January, mental health professionals testified in favor of her release, which the judge initially approved.

However, in April, Leutner's mother voiced concerns over Geyser potentially being placed in a group home roughly 8 miles from their home. Prosecutors opposed the release based on these concerns.

The judge then required the Department of Health Services to develop a revised resettlement plan, which was eventually approved, paving the way for Geyser's conditional release.

Geyser and Weier drew national attention in 2014 after luring Leutner into a wooded area after a sleepover and stabbing her 19 times. All three were just 12 years old at the time. 

During police interviews, Weier and Geyser told authorities they felt they had to kill Leutner to become Slender Man's "proxies," or servants, and protect their families from him.

Leutner was left for dead but miraculously survived the attack after she crawled out of the woods and was found by a bicyclist. 

In 2017, Geyser pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in Leutner's attack but claimed she was not responsible due to her mental illness. She was sentenced in 2018 to a maximum of 40 years of state mental health supervision.

Geyser has been at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute for nearly a decade but asked the court to consider her conditional release every six months. 

Weier also pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree intentional homicide with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to 25 years in a mental hospital. In 2021, she was released on the condition she must live with her father and wear a GPS monitor.

"Slender Man" started with an online post in 2009 as a mysterious specter whose image people edit into everyday scenes of children at play. He is typically depicted as a spidery figure in a black suit with a featureless white face. He was regarded by his devotees as alternately a sinister force and an avenging angel.

As of now, specific details regarding the timing of Geyser's release and the final placement plan remain undisclosed. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Geyser's lawyer but did not immediately receive a response.

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins joins Americas Newsroom to discuss sanctuary cities pushing back on President Donald Trumps illegal immigration crackdown amid the rise in assaults on immigration enforcement agents. 

The release of a twice-deported rapist in Virginia is putting renewed focus on the dangers posed by Democrat-led sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Guatemala national David Cabrera was collared by ICE last week after being set free by sanctuary-aligned jurisdiction Arlington County, who refused to honor a federal detainer and released him without notifying ICE. 

In a video obtained by Fox News, Cabrera is seen roaming a local street before ICE agents initiate his arrest.

Cabrera entered the U.S. illegally in 2014 and was convicted of felony rape in 2015. He was sentenced to more than seven years in prison, although a portion of it was suspended. 

He was released into ICE custody in 2017 and subsequently deported to Guatemala, but re-entered the U.S. again at an unknown time and date. He was then arrested again for a probation violation and deported again in 2020, only to re-enter again.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons blasted the release, telling Fox News it puts agents and the public at risk.

"This is the whole reason why sanctuary jurisdictions do not keep America safe," Lyons said. "It lets criminals back on the street to reoffend again. If Arlington had cooperated, we could have arrested him in a secure facility — instead, our agents had to track him down in the community, where they could have encountered others."

Arlington's 2022 trust policy allows police to comply with state and federal law — but restricts voluntary detainer holds and information-sharing with ICE unless required by law.

In May, the county board removed a provision which had allowed limited police cooperation with ICE, including in cases involving terrorism, gangs, or felony arrests). Since then, local police cannot proactively contact ICE in such cases, though they must comply with legal orders.

The Cabrera underlines the dangers posed to the public when jurisdictions do not comply with federal law enforcement, Lyons said. 

Cabrera was arrested on June 4 for a probation violation and released from Arlington County Adult Detention Center on July 11 despite an active ICE detainer.

"You have an individual that is the worst of the worst, someone convicted of rape, and we had the opportunity to deport him. We did deport him… and they don't want to turn that individual over the right way," Lyons said.

"Here you have an aggravated felon that's been deported multiple times… and Arlington County is releasing him back into the community. To reoffend again. It's just not right and it doesn't keep the public safe."

Lyons said that Arlington County's actions put agents at risk. This comes at a time when agents are being doxxed, and attacks on them have skyrocketed by 830% since January. 

"We wouldn't have to send ICE agents into the community, where they run the chance to run into someone else that we might arrest," Lyons said. "We would much rather arrest someone in a secure, safe environment. It's safer for my officers and agents… It is safer for that individual we're arresting, but it's safer for the community as well."

Anti-ICE activists across the U.S. have been protesting immigration enforcement, sometimes harassing ICE agents and demanding their badge numbers and the removal of their masks.

At times, the protesters have turned violent.

ICE agents were attacked and had rocks thrown at their moving vehicles during a raid on a marijuana farm last week, while ICE agents have also come under attack outside an ICE detention facility in Portland. Law enforcement vehicles were also pelted with rocks during deportation-linked rioting in Los Angeles.

DHS accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., of showing a violent mob an ICE employee's business card, prompting a mob to attack him. The official was struck by a rock and sent to the emergency room, where he received multiple stitches, DHS said.

President Donald Trump reportedly has chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition of the blood vessels.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner on Thursday about the condition after Trump was seen with makeup on his hand, apparently covering a bulge or discoloration.

Physician to the President Dr. Sean P. Barbabella issued a statement Thursday afternoon indicating that he had evaluated Trump after noticing “mild swelling in his lower legs.” 

CVI is a relatively common condition, particularly for older adults over age 70. Barbabella's report indicated that other tests to determine the severity of the condition came back within the normal range.

The physician's report also addressed the viral images of the president's hands, saying that the “minor bruising on the back of his hand … is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent shaking” and being on aspirin as a blood-thinning medication.

Here is everything to know about Trump's CVI diagnosis.

BREAKING: Trump has "chronic venous insufficiency," as revealed by a recent medical exam, per @PressSec  — Trump has noticeably exhibited swelling in his ankles and bruising on his hand in recent days

CVI occurs when veins in the legs and arms become damaged and cause blood to pool in a particular area instead of flowing toward the heart. 

When blood pools under the skin, it can result in blue or reddish-brownish patches on the skin that can easily break open if scratched or bumped.

Symptoms include aching or tired limbs, discolored skin, and swelling in the affected areas, usually in the lower legs and ankles.

CIV itself is usually not life-threatening, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but it is a progressive condition that can cause more pain and discomfort over time if left untreated.

The physician's report said there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a potentially dangerous blood clot most commonly in the legs or pelvis that can be fatal if left untreated.

CVI most commonly affects the legs because of gravity, with blood in the legs having to travel a greater distance to reach the heart. However, the condition can also affect the hands and arms.

A variety of causes could contribute to why the president may be experiencing CVI symptoms in his hands, including blood clots, trauma to the hand or arm, or an underlying blood vessel disorder.

Other chronic conditions, including high blood pressure or kidney problems, also affect overall vascular health. 

The White House did not respond to the Washington Examiner's request for comment when asked for more details about the president's diagnosis. 

According to the Cleveland Clinic, CVI affects roughly 1 in 20 adults in the United States, but milder forms of the condition are much more common.

Varicose veins, also known as spider veins, are caused by damaged blood vessels that bulge under the skin's surface.

One in three adults has varicose veins, and 1 in 50 people who have varicose veins will go on to develop more serious CVI. 

The goal of treating CVI is to improve blood flow and reduce pain and swelling associated with the condition, according to Johns Hopkins Medical Center.

Lifestyle changes, including improved diet and regular exercise, are the first-line treatment recommendations for CVI. Weight management is critical to relieve pressure on veins and damaged valves.

Keeping the affected limbs elevated is also recommended to reduce pressure on the veins. Compression stockings or bandages are also common to reduce swelling. 

Treatment does not reverse damage, but it can improve quality of life.

The ‘Outnumbered' panel previews Lara Trump's interview with ICE agents about the growing dangers they face and the role rhetoric plays in fueling anti-ICE sentiment. The full interview airs this Saturday on ‘My View with Lara Trump.'

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent was dragged for nearly a block in Oklahoma by an illegal alien from Honduras attempting to escape federal custody, authorities said. 

Jose Melgar-Rivas, 34, of Honduras, has since been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer resulting in bodily injury, U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester of the Western District of Oklahoma announced Wednesday. 

ICE agents pulled over a vehicle in Oklahoma City Tuesday, and Melgar-Rivas, a Honduran national and an ICE fugitive, refused the officer's demands to exit the vehicle, court documents say.

A struggle ensued as officers attempted to remove him, and Melgar-Rivas shifted the vehicle into drive and fled, according to a complaint. An ICE officer became trapped in a door of the vehicle as it accelerated.

The officer was dragged on a road for nearly a block as Melgar-Rivas tried to escape, the complaint says. The officer ultimately freed himself and sustained multiple injuries. 

ICE said its Enforcement and Removal Operations agents from Dallas were involved in the incident. The agency shared two photos showing the injured agent's scraped, bloodied upper thigh and a bruised and bandaged arm. 

Melgar-Rivas was arrested several hours later, prosecutors said. ICE also shared a photo with an agent holding each arm of a handcuffed Melgar-Rivas once he was taken into custody.

"Ensuring the safety of law enforcement personnel in executing their lawful duties is paramount, and it remains a top priority of the Justice Department," Troester said in a statement. "Those who assault or interfere with members of law enforcement for simply doing their job enforcing the law must and will be held accountable."

"Those who assault federal officers will face swift and stern accountability for their actions," Travis Pickard, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Dallas special agent in charge of North Texas and Oklahoma, added. "Violence and any threats of violence to a federal officer in the performance of their duties will result in an immediate and collaborative law enforcement response to track down the perpetrator."

DHS: ASSAULTS ON ICE NOW UP NEARLY 700% OVER SAME TIME LAST YEAR

"Assaults on federal agents will not be tolerated by the FBI," FBI Oklahoma City acting Special Agent in Charge Joe Ogden said. "We will continue to aggressively support and defend our fellow public servants so they can safely carry out their sworn duties."

The Department of Homeland Security has reported a 700% increase in assaults against ICE agents and other immigration enforcement officers in the first six months since President Donald Trump returned to office. 

The Trump administration has pledged to hold perpetrators accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The Justice Department brought charges against more than a dozen defendants in the July 4 attack against an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas, where a police officer was shot in the neck defending the center holding prospective deportees. 

The FBI on Wednesday captured a Marine Corps reservist believed to have opened fire at the officer and correctional officers that night. 

Los Angeles has seen a rash of anti-ICE demonstrations since June, but the Pentagon this week removed about half of the 4,000 National Guard troops federalized to protect the city, arguing most "lawlessness" had subsided.

Melgar-Rivas appeared Thursday in U.S. District Court in Oklahoma City and was ordered to be detained in federal custody pending further proceedings.

Prosecutors say Melgar-Rivas faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted.

The U.S. Attorney's Office said the case is part of Operation Take Back America, "a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime."

Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.

“Elected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,” said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture. 

Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology. 

Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.

He's hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.

“The idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,” Mahan said in an interview. “It's always bumpy with new technologies.”

By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes. 




One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city's transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.

Arjona Amador set up a customized “AI agent” to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.

So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.

“The way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,” she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.

Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings. 

With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms. 

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft's Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with “robust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances — not replaces — human judgment.”

San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.

ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s “Make America Healthy Again” commission. 

In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document. 

While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches. 

“Historically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,” he said. “You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.”

He added, however, that “you still need a human being in the loop. You can't just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.”

Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such “AI agents” is now a key focus for the tech industry. 

More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent.

Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes. 

Six months later, however, after completing a proof-of-concept phase, the city didn't buy a full license for the technology due to the cost. 

The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of “agentic AI” projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, “due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.”

San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers “in the bowels of bureaucracy” to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork.

“There's just an amazing amount of bureaucracy that large organizations have to have,” Mahan said. “Whether it's finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy clashed with Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., Wednesday over slashing DEI, climate initiatives.

EXCLUSIVE: An environmental advocacy group accused of trying to manipulate judges organized a years-long, nationwide online forum with jurists to promote favorable info and litigation updates regarding climate issues – until the email-styled group chat was abruptly made private, Fox News Digital found.

The Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) was founded in 2018 by a left-wing environmental nonprofit, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI), and pitches itself as a "first-of-its-kind effort" that "provides judges with authoritative, objective, and trusted education on climate science, the impacts of climate change, and the ways climate science is arising in the law."

But critics, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, say CJP is funded by China and left-wing activists for one purpose.

"They fund CJP to train judges," Cruz said during a June hearing. "So, quote, unquote, train in climate science and make them agreeable to creative climate litigation tactics. Then, these left-wing bankrollers turn around and fund the climate litigators who will bring these bogus cases before those same judges that they've just indoctrinated.

"This is like paying the players to play and paying the umpire to call the shots the way you want."

The group, however, says it provides "neutral, objective information to the judiciary about the science of climate change as it is understood by the expert scientific community and relevant to current and future litigation."

SUPREME COURT LIMITS JUDGES' AUTHORITY TO BLOCK INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

One of the efforts CJP launched included rolling out an email-styled listserv by which leaders from the Climate Judiciary Project could message directly with judges, documents obtained by Fox News Digital show. The listserv was launched in September 2022 and maintained until May 2024, according to the documents. A portal website page for the forum was previously publicly available, with an archived link saved in July 2024 showing there were 29 members in the group. 

"Judicial Leaders in Climate Science," the archived website link reviewed by Fox Digital reads, accompanied by a short description that the group was a "Forum for Judicial Leaders in Climate Science to share resources."

A link to the forum now leads to an error warning, stating, "Sorry, but that group does not exist." 

Fox News Digital obtained the archived chat history of the forum, which detailed numerous messages between at least five judges and CJP employees trading links on climate studies, congratulating one another on hosting recent environmental events, sharing updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts, and encouraging each other to participate in other CJP meet-ups. 

One message posted by Delaware Judge Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, features a YouTube video of a 2022 climate presentation delivered by a Delaware official and a Columbia University professor that focused on the onslaught of climate lawsuits since the mid-2000s. It also included claims that such lawsuits could one day bankrupt the fuel industry. 

Laster shared the video in the group with a disclaimer to others: "Please do not forward or use without checking with me" as the video is "unlisted" on YouTube and not publicly available. 

A handful of other judges responded to Laster's video and message, praising it as "great work."

"This is great work/great stuff, Travis; congrats on a job well-done, & thank you so much for sharing this!," Indiana Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Scheele responded, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Another judge in a Nebraska county court added that he had not watched the video yet but said the state court administrator's office was interested in a similar program focused on "litigation and climate change." The Nebraska judge said he "may need to lean on all of you for guidance and direction."

The judges' correspondence on the forum included their typical email signatures, showcasing their job titles as "judge" as well as which court they preside over. 

The climate activists also posted messages directed to the judges on the listserv, Fox News Digital found, including a science and policy analyst at the Environmental Law Institute posting a lengthy message on Nov. 15, 2023. The message encouraged judges and climate activists alike to review the government's publication of the Fifth National Climate Assessment that year, which the environmental crusader said contained "good news and bad news."

"The bad news is that the impacts of climate change are being felt throughout all regions of the United States, and these impacts are expected to worsen with every fraction of a degree of additional warming. The report finds that climate change will continue to affect our nation's health, food security, water supply, and economy," the message read.

"The good news is that the report also notes that it isn't too late for us to act," the message continued, before encouraging the 28 other members of the group to go over CJP's climate curricula, such as "Climate Science 101" and "Climate Litigation 101," and send over any feedback. 

"As you know, our Climate Judiciary Project exists to be as beneficial to judges as possible, so any insights you might have for us would be very helpful!" the message added when asking members to review the curricula. 

In another message, CJP's manager, Jared Mummert, sent a message to the group in May 2024 praising the judges for their mentorship of a second group of "Judicial Leaders in Climate Science" – which included 14 judges from 12 states and Puerto Rico – as part of a partnership between CJP and the National Judicial College. The National Judicial College provides judicial training for judges across the country from its Reno, Nevada, campus. 

"We want to give a special ‘thank you' to those who are serving as mentors to this second cohort!" the message read. It added that CJP was ramping up its number of "engagement opportunities" to "every six months for both cohorts of judges to come together to share updates and connect with one another."

Fox News Digital reached out to five of the judges on the listserv for comment, four of whom did not respond. 

Scheele's office told Fox News Digital on Thursday that he first joined the 2022 National Judicial Conference on Climate Science, more than two years before he was appointed to the Court of Appeals of Indiana, after another delegate was unable to attend. 

"At the last minute, when another appointed delegate was unexpectedly unable to attend, Judge Scheele was asked by Indiana's state court administration to fill in as Indiana's representative, and he accepted the invitation. As is normal in conferences attended by our judges, this conference addressed emerging, hot button issues that might come before the courts," Scheele's office said. 

It added: "Judge Scheele does not recall any substantive communication on the ‘listserv' mentioned. He, like all of our Court of Appeals of Indiana judges, is dedicated to the unbiased, apolitical administration of justice in the State. He, like all of our judges, educates himself on emergent topics in the law and applies his legal training to evaluate the legal issues before him."

CJP, for its part, said the now-defunct email list was created in September 2022 to help members of its Judicial Leaders in Climate Science program communicate and network with one another for the duration of the program.

The one-year program, established by CJP in coordination with the National Judicial College, "trains state court judges on judicial leadership skills integrated with consensus climate science and how it is arising in the law," the group told Fox News Digital.

Judges quietly working behind the scenes with climate and environmental activists have drawn criticism from conservative lawmakers in recent years as climate-focused suits increased, including those who have accused CJP of manipulating the justice system.

Cruz, for example, has been at the forefront of condemning CJP for joining forces with the National Judicial College. Cruz argued in a 2024 opinion piece that he is "concerned that this collaboration means court staff are helping far-left climate activists lobby and direct judges behind closed doors."

Cruz again railed against CJP during a Senate subcommittee hearing in June, called "Enter the Dragon – China and the Left's Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance," where the Texas Republican argued there is a "systematic campaign" launched by the Chinese Communist Party and American left-wing activists to weaponize the court systems to "undermine American energy dominance." CJP, Cruz said, is a pivotal player in the "lawfare" as it works to secure "judicial capture." 

Cruz said CJP's claims of neutrality are bluster, and the group instead allegedly promotes "ex parte indoctrination, pressuring judges to set aside the rule of law, and rule instead according to a predetermined political narrative."

Judges have previously landed in hot water over climate-related issues in group forums, including in 2019, when a federal judge hit "reply all" to an email chain with 45 other judges and court staff regarding an invitation to a climate seminar for judges hosted by the Environmental Law Institute. The judge was subsequently chastised by colleagues for sharing "this nonsense" and suggested it was an ethics violation, while others defended that flagging the event to others was not unethical. 

Fox News Digital spoke with Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Zack Smith, who explained there has been an overarching increase in courts promoting trainings for judges on issues they would eventually be asked to preside over impartially, pointing to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' DEI trainings for judges during the Biden era. The office works as the administrative agency for the U.S. court system, handling issues from finances to tech support.

"There's a problem right now with many courts putting forward, seeming to take sides on issues they will be asked to address through the trainings that they're putting forward. And this was a particular problem with the DEI trainings that different federal district courts were putting on, that the Administrative Office of U.S. courts were sponsoring. It appeared that the judiciary itself was encouraging violations of the Constitution, violations of federal law, and most problematically was taking sides in issues they would eventually be asked to sit and preside over impartially," he said. 

Justice Department officials did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on the CJP program in question, or other efforts to educate judges more directly on climate issues. 

Still, news of the program's outreach comes as the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in climate-related lawsuits in recent years, including cases targeting oil majors Shell, BP and ExxonMobil for allegedly engaging in "deceptive" marketing practices and downplaying the risks of climate change, as well as lawsuits bought against state governments and U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department, for failing to adequately address risks from pollution or adequately protect against the harm caused by climate change, according to plaintiffs who filed the suits.

DARK MONEY FUND POURED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO ECO ACTIVIST GROUPS BLOCKING HIGHWAYS, DESTROYING FAMOUS ART

CJP's educational events are done "in partnership with leading national judicial education institutions and state judicial authorities, in accordance with their accepted standards," a spokesperson for the group said in an emailed statement. "Its curriculum is fact-based and science-first, grounded in consensus reports and developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards."

"CJP's work is no different than the work of other continuing judicial education organizations that address important complex topics, including medicine, tech and neuroscience," this person added.

The number of climate-related lawsuits in the U.S. has increased significantly in recent years, including during the last two years of the Biden administration. To some extent, the educational efforts led by CJP appear to have been enacted in earnest to address real questions or concerns judges might have in presiding over these cases for the first time – many of which seek tens of millions of dollars in damages.

The Supreme Court agreed earlier this month to grant a request from ExxonMobil and Chevron to consider whether to transfer two Louisiana lawsuits from state to federal court. 

While the move itself is not immediately significant, it will be closely watched by oil and gas majors, as they look to navigate the complex landscape of environmental lawsuits, including lawsuits filed by state and local governments. Oil majors typically prefer to have their cases heard by federal courts, which are seen as more sympathetic to their interests. 

CLIMATE JUSTICE GROUP HAS DEEP TIES TO JUDGES, EXPERTS INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AMID CLAIMS OF IMPARTIALITY

Since Trump's re-election in 2024, the cases appeared to have died down, at least to an extent. U.S. appeals courts have declined to take up many challenges filed on behalf of plaintiffs in several states who have sued claiming government inaction and failure to act to protect against known harms from fossil fuel extraction and production in the U.S.

CJP's program is run by ELI in partnership with the Federal Judicial Center, the latter of which bills itself as the "research and education center" for judges across the country.

Their work includes partnerships with myriad outside groups beyond the CJP aimed at informing and educating judges on a range of issues, including neuroscience and bioscience, constitutional law, and bankruptcy, among other things.

According to their website, the effort is important to help judges understand relevant case law and ethics, sentencing guidelines, and other types of issue-specific programs they might be encountering for the first time. 

Fox News Digital has previously reported on CJP's cozy relationship with judges, including when the group's president, Jordan Diamond, detailed in a Wall Street Journal letter to the editor in September that the group "doesn't participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case."

A subsequent Fox News Digital review published in December found that several CJP expert lawyers and judges continued to have close ties to the curriculum and are deeply involved in climate litigation, including tapping insight from university professors who have also filed several climate-related amicus briefs. 

"CJP doesn't participate in litigation, support or coordinate with any parties in litigation, or advise judges on how they should rule in any case," an ELI spokesperson defended in a comment to Fox News Digital in December. "Our courses provide judges with access to evidence-based information about climate science and trends in the law."

The United Kingdom is lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 before the next national elections – a move which opposition figures decry as a way to sway the electorate to benefit the left. 

The U.K. government, controlled by the Labour Party, announced Thursday that 16- and 17-year-olds will be given the right to vote as part of other new "seismic changes." Other election reforms include extending voter ID to bank cards, issuing new rules meant to "guard against foreign political interference and abuse of campaigners," and tightening laws restricting foreign donations to British political parties. 

In an accompanying policy paper included in the announcement, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said that "declining trust in our institutions and democracy itself has become critical, but it is the responsibility of government to turn this around and renew our democracy, just as generations have done before us."

"I think it's really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote because they're old enough to go out to work, they're old enough to pay taxes, so to pay in. And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go," British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on Thursday. "I'm really pleased that we're able to bring more young people into our democracy." 

"Young people already contribute to society by working, paying taxes and serving in the military. It's only right they can have a say on the issues that affect them," Rayner wrote on X. The deputy prime minister also elaborated in a statement, adding: "We cannot take our democracy for granted, and by protecting our elections from abuse and boosting participation we will strengthen the foundations of our society for the future." 

The minimum age of service in the British Armed Forces is 16, but those under 18 need written consent from a parent or guardian and may not be deployed to combat zones. 

British opposition politicians accused the Labour Party of trying to manipulate the electorate in their favor by lowering the voting age. 

"Why does this government think a 16‑year‑old can vote but not be allowed to buy a lottery ticket or an alcoholic drink, marry or go to war, or even stand in the elections they're voting?" Member of Parliament (MP) Paul Holmes, a conservative, said in the House of Commons on Thursday. "Isn't the government's position on the age of maturity just hopelessly confused?"

Holmes accused Labour of "governing by press release" and questioned whether allowing bank cards – which do not include photographs – as a form of voter ID will undermine security measures at the ballot box. 

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK Party, said giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote "is an attempt to rig the political system." 

"The problem with this is, not only do half of youngsters not want the vote, but they have to stay at school now until they're 18," Farage said in a video shared to X. "The educational establishment is full of left-wing prejudice, is full of anti-reform bias, and frankly, if 16 to 18 year olds at school are going to be able to vote, we're going to have to make sure that our education system is teaching kids to make their own minds up and not indoctrinating them." 

The change still requires parliamentary approval but was a campaign promise by the Labour Party, which won last year's general election and holds majority control. The next general election is in 2029. 

Rayner noted that 16- and 17-year-olds can already vote in Scotland and Wales in local elections and country-level parliamentary elections. The minimum voting age for local elections in England and Northern Ireland is 18.

In an opinion piece in the British newspaper "The Times," Rayner, who was a single mother at the age of 16, said the change makes 1.6 million 16- and 17-year-olds eligible to vote in the United Kingdom, which has a population of roughly 68 million.

"This is about fairness and transparency and giving the young a stake in our country's future, bringing them into our communities, not excluding them," Rayner wrote. "It's about delivering on our manifesto to commitment to secure votes at 16. But it's also about strengthening our electoral system so that it is fit for the 21st century — because we cannot take our democracy for granted."

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Caitlin Clark is out of All-Star weekend.

The Indiana Fever guard injured her right groin on Tuesday night in the final minute of the team's win over the Connecticut Sun. She said Thursday in a message posted on X that she had to rest her body.

“I am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can't participate in the 3-Point Contest or the All-Star Game,” Clark said in the message posted by the Fever. “I have to rest my body. I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action and I'm looking forward to helping (Liberty coach Sandy Brondello) coach our team to a win.”

Clark was supposed to compete in a loaded 3-point contest Friday night and is captain of one of the All-Star teams. The second-year guard was the leading vote getter from the fans and has been a huge reason the league has had a boon in attendance and ratings over the last two seasons.

The WNBA announced that Brittney Sykes of Washington will replace Clark in the All-Star Game. They haven't announced a replacement for her in the 3-point contest.

Clark sat out the Fever's 98-77 loss against New York.

Fever coach Stephanie White said Clark had imaging done Wednesday afternoon and deferred to the team's training staff for more details except to say that she considered it good news.

Clark got hurt with under a minute left. She walked downcourt holding her right groin after assisting on the Fever's final basket. As teammate Aliyah Boston tried to console her, Clark walked to the basket stanchion and banged her head against it before heading to the bench. During the timeout, she covered her head with a towel and appeared to be holding back tears.




Clark had been durable throughout college and her first season in the WNBA, never missing a game. Now she's had four different muscle injuries so far this year.

She missed the preseason opener with tightness in her quad but played the next day in an exhibition game at her alma mater, Iowa. She suffered a quad strain against New York on May 24 that kept her out for five games. Clark returned June 14 and played in five games before suffering another injury to her left groin that kept her out for four contests and the Commissioner's Cup final.

President Donald Trump's desire to have Coca-Cola use cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in its products could cost jobs, a corn industry group warned on Wednesday.

Trump suggested Wednesday that Coca-Cola had agreed to use “REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States.” However, Coca-Cola has not publicly confirmed it will move to use cane sugar. 

The company did reply to a comment related to the post, saying, “All Coca-Cola brand products are wholesome beverages manufactured in compliance with the federal law.”

Trump's announcement prompted the Corn Refiners Association to warn that the move could have unintended consequences.

“Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit,” John Bode, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement on the group's website.

A switch to cane sugar could result in an economic hit to Iowa, the largest producer of corn in the U.S. Cane sugar is largely produced in southern states, including Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, but Brazil is the largest producer in the world.

In the U.S., Coke is typically sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, a decision shaped in large part by agricultural subsidies to the corn industry and its cheaper cost. Some international versions of the company's signature beverage use cane sugar.

SODA COMPANIES PUSH BACK AGAINST MAHA EFFORTS TO CUT THEM OUT OF FOOD STAMPS

Coca-Cola additionally pushed back on claims that high fructose corn syrup is worse for the body than sugar.

“The name sounds complex, but high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) – which we use to sweeten some of our beverages – is actually just a sweetener made from corn,” the company said. “It's safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body. The American Medical Association has confirmed that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a press briefing Thursday afternoon, as the Trump administration faces pushback from its supporters over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

President Donald Trump has increasingly been distancing himself from the debacle, calling Epstein's client list a “hoax” created by Democrats. He even suggested that any conservatives who are outraged over the Epstein case are no longer his supporters.

TRUMP STRUGGLES TO CONVINCE MAGA EPSTEIN FILES A RUSSIA-LIKE ‘HOAX'

Despite his dismissive answers, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release any information in the Epstein files she deems credible.

The press briefing is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Thursday.

Lena Dunham's new series makes falling in love look almost utilitarian.

The first time I watched Too Much, Lena Dunham's return to scripted television after a seven-year hiatus, it felt impossibly disappointing—visually flat, almost defiantly unfunny, more cringeworthy in its reliance on Anglo-American culture clashes for charm than Mary-Kate and Ashley trying to get a royal guard to crack a smile. The premise: Jess (played by Hacks' Megan Stalter) is a New Yorker working in advertising production who's offered the chance to move to London when her relationship catastrophically implodes. (Dunham, as ever daring us to try to like her characters, has Jess, in the first episode, breaking into her ex's apartment and terrorizing his new influencer girlfriend while brandishing a garden gnome.) Arriving in London, Jess has a chance encounter with Felix (Will Sharpe), a broke musician, in a particularly vile pub toilet. Both are hapless in different but complementary ways—Jess tells Felix how to wash his hands, Felix helps Jess get home when she accidentally orders her Uber to Heathrow.

These are hard times to be a romantic, especially on Netflix. Two years ago, on a New Yorker podcast lamenting the modern state of the rom-com, Alexandra Schwartz noted that the most crucial quality for any romance is this: “You have to believe that these two people want to be together, and you have to buy in.” On this front, Too Much barely even tries. Stalter is wackily endearing as Jess, and Sharpe adds brooding complexity to Felix's offhand charm. But as screen lovers, the pair have almost negative chemistry, coming together with a shrug and staying together out of what feels like inertia. Initially, this set my teeth on edge—two characters with seemingly little interest in each other being paired off with the chaotic insistence of a child making her soft toys kiss. But the more I've come back to the show, the more its slack, unromantic approach to love looks intentional. Jess and Felix couple up not because they're giddy with feeling, drunk on proximity and intimacy and connection, but because each offers something specific that the other person needs. Too Much is co-produced by Working Title, and the names of its episodes nod to some gooier rom-coms served up by the company in bygone days: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill. But in the place where the show's heart should be is instead pure pragmatism: This is love for a cold climate.

If you compare Too Much with Celine Song's recent film, Materialists, in which every character sizes up romantic prospects with the agenda of a hiring manager, you can sense a theme. Can we afford to actually fall in love now? In this economy? Dunham presents infatuation as nonsensical, or even destructive: The best episode of Too Much is one that details the breakdown of Jess's seven-year relationship with Zev (Michael Zegen), a wannabe music writer who appears like a white knight in a bar one night when she's lost her friends and her pizza (nobly, he secures another slice) and immediately dazzles Jess into submission, charming her family, devising kissing rituals scored to songs, even massaging her grandmother's feet. Quickly, though, he sours. When she moves in with him, he's outraged by the fact that so much of her stuff is pink. He sneers at her love for Miley Cyrus power ballads and mocks her need for affection. “I swear you dress as a fuck you to people sometimes, Jess,” he tells her, when she puts on a sailor smock to go out. The longer she loves him, the more contemptuous he becomes.

Felix, by contrast, is cool from the start. No one is better than Dunham at writing sympathetic fuckboys, men in varying stages of arrested development who are unpleasant in uniquely beguiling ways. At the pub, Felix treats Jess like a kind of curiosity (she is, in fact, wearing the very same sailor smock that we later learn Zev had been so cruel about). It isn't until he sees the coziness of Jess's rental apartment that something seems to click in his mind in an enticing way, like a modern-day Elizabeth Bennet reconsidering her feelings for Mr. Darcy after she first visits Pemberley. Jess, somewhat randomly, tries to kiss Felix; Felix, perturbed, admits that he has a girlfriend and leaves. He walks around for a bit listening to Fiona Apple and smoking, then goes back to Jess's place, where he finds her being hosed down in the shower by a baby-faced paramedic after having accidentally set her nightgown on fire. Somewhat incredibly, he stays.

Too Much gestures at the rom-com, but it seems more enamored with the sitcom, particularly the low-fi, edgy, slightly manic mode of British comedies on BBC Three: Fleabag, Pulling, Coupling. Compared with Dunham's Girls, whose direction and cinematography specifically emulated Woody Allen and Mike Mills, it's a strangely unprepossessing show, the kind that more typically gets pulled together cheaply on the British taxpayer's dime. In a bottle-ish episode early on, Jess and Felix stay up all night in her apartment, having sex, eating takeout pho, and ignoring each other's emotional cues. (He tells her about being grossed out by an ex when he once saw her eating cold Chinese food with a look of blank desperation; later, in secret, Jess shovels cold noodles into her mouth with the same vacancy.) The characters do antic, no-stakes things that require little explanation and often defy logic. Felix goes to claim unemployment, telling the officer assessing him that if he gets a job, he won't have time to write music. Jess goes location scouting with a hotshot director, almost has sex with him in a firelit four-poster bed, then shows up outside Felix's window, begging him to move in with her. Late in the series, Jennifer Saunders appears playing a character identical to Absolutely Fabulous's Edina, down to the selfsame styling and vocal delivery.

But with help from flashback episodes, the show also starts to lay out why Felix and Jess might be drawn to each other. Jess, still devastated from her breakup and friendless in London, finds instant stability in Felix as someone who'll care for her, even if, subliminally at least, she seems to see through him. Like so many Dunham heroines, Jess is a perplexing mix of intuition and delusion; she offers Felix a joint bank account after they've been together barely a week, but also correctly identifies that his total lack of ambition fits awkwardly with her pride in her work. If, as an actor, Stalter sometimes seems less convincing than Dunham was at pulling the combination off, it's because it's an exceedingly difficult register to play in. Walking up to a guest at a wedding, Jess introduces herself by saying, “Wearing neutrals is like a way of saying you've given up, right?”—a line so thoughtlessly rude that even Hannah Horvath might blanch. Felix, whose childhood is revealed to have been unloving and unstable, seems to see in Jess something like instant security: not just a warm person with a home that's much more welcoming than his chaotic squat full of eco-warriors, but an insta-family. If their relationship skips the heady, obsessive crush phase to get straight into a comfortable, stolid, domestic mode, maybe it's because that's what both of them are really yearning for.

Initially, something about Too Much's insistence on citing rom-coms in its episode titles while so stubbornly resisting romance felt galling to me. The quality that draws us to, say, the tortured off-on dynamic of Connell and Marianne on Normal People or the unbreakable bond between Nora and Hae Sung in Past Lives is the idea that love is somehow transcendent, that it elevates humans above the level of mere existence. But realistically, what is love if not care and attention? And what are care and attention if not expressions of tenderness and regard? Dunham buries clues throughout Too Much that seem to suggest what she thinks about men and women: Matrimony, Felix's father tells his wife late in the show, comes from the Latin words mater, meaning “mother,” and monia, meaning “activity”—it's about preparing a girl to be a mother, and in many ways, a maternal dynamic is exactly what both Felix and Jess are craving. “You're like this alien,” Jess tells him in the final episode, “but you also feel like home.”

As authorities try to piece together what happened during the deadly flooding at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas, new questions are emerging about how the camp owner tracked the storm and whether he saw the emergency alert.

Richard "Dick" Eastland reportedly began taking action after more than two inches of rain fell along the Guadalupe River, according to the Associated Press, which cited Jeff Carr, a spokesperson for the family and the camp. Carr said Eastland had a "home weather station" and was monitoring the rainfall on July 4, the Associated Press reported.

Despite portraying to the media that Eastland got the weather alerts about the flash flood, Carr told the Associated Press that no one in the family or camp staff could say whether the camp owner got the alert at 1:14 a.m., making the timeline of the tragedy murky.

At 1:14 a.m. on July 4, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Kerr County, sending alerts to broadcast outlets, weather radios and cell phones. The warning was escalated to a flash flood emergency just under three hours later at 4:03 a.m.

This apparent shift in narrative by Carr comes after some criticized Eastland for waiting to evacuate campers.

The Washington Post reported on Monday, citing Carr, that the camp owner waited until 2:30 a.m. to begin evacuating campers, more than an hour after the initial alert went out. This prompted criticism over the camp's evacuation procedures. However, Carr pushed back on those raising concerns.

Carr blamed communication failures, saying that cell phone service at Camp Mystic is spotty even in clear weather.

"Communication was a huge deficiency," Carr told the Associated Press. "This community was hamstrung, nobody could communicate. The first responder, the first rescue personnel that showed up was a game warden."

Heritage Foundation acting director for Education Policy Jonathan Butcher weighs in on the Trump administration's 'wins' in education and addresses a study showing A.I. degrades critical thinking skills on 'One Nation.'

The National Urban League is sounding the alarm, asserting that there is a "state of emergency" in the country.

The organization's "State of Black America" report for 2025 titled "State of Emergency: Democracy, Civil Rights, and Progress Under Attack," takes aim at the Trump administration.

"Almost daily, since January 20, 2025, the federal government, at the direction of the White House, has set fire to policies and entire departments dedicated to protecting civil and human rights, providing access to an equal education, fair housing, safe and effective healthcare, and ensuring that our democratic process is adhered to across the nation," the report claims.

White House spokesman Harrison Fields pushed back in a statement to Fox News Digital.

"These so-called civil rights groups aren't advancing anything but hate and division, while the President is focused on uniting our country, improving our economy, securing our borders, and establishing peace across the globe," Fields said in the statement. "This is the same vision for America that a record number of Black Americans supported in the resounding reelection of President Trump. The Democrats have sold out Black voters to appease their base, which consists of illegals, the pronoun police, purple-haired lunatics, and radical anti-Semites."

National Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial declared in the report, "The notion that we are living through a ‘state of emergency' is not rhetorical flourish. It is an honest reckoning with a government increasingly determined to sacrifice its founding principles—equality, liberty, and justice—rather than accept the truth of a diversifying nation and deliver equitable opportunity to all."

The report claims that the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department has been twisted "into a tool for political retribution."

"Under its new leadership, the Civil Rights Division has been hollowed out and repurposed— transforming from a guardian of justice into a tool for political retribution," the report asserts. "The radicalization of the DOJ is more than bureaucratic rot—it is an existential threat to civil rights enforcement, allowing discrimination to flourish unchecked under the false guise of ‘reverse racism.'"

The report, which includes House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. and several other U.S. lawmakers among the list of contributors, speaks favorably about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.

"In short, DEI policies don't just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself. By expanding opportunities, ensuring equitable access to information, and creating leadership pipelines, DEI helps guarantee that every American—not just the privileged few— can contribute to the nation's future," the report declares.

Fox News host Sean Hannity discusses the state of the Democratic Party on ‘Hannity.'

Just 19% of voters questioned in a new national poll give Democrats in Congress a thumbs up on how they're handling their duties, with 72% disapproving.

That's an all-time low since Quinnipiac University first began asking congressional approval questions in their surveys 16 years ago.

The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black, Hispanic and younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.

Since President Donald Trump's return to power earlier this year, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial second-term agenda. Their anger is directed not only at Republicans, but at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump.

And that's fueled a plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit historic lows in several surveys this year.

FOUR MONTHS INTO TRUMP'S SECOND TERM, DEMOCRATS REMAIN DEEPLY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR PARTY

The trend is reflected in the new Quinnipiac poll, which was conducted July 10-14.

Just 39% of Democrats approve of the way Democrats in Congress are handling their jobs, with 52% disapproving and 9% not offering an opinion.

"The approval numbers for Democrats can be characterized as flat out terrible," Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

While the approval ratings for Republicans in Congress aren't as "terrible" as the Democrats, they're nothing to brag about.

Only a third of voters questioned in the poll said they approved of the way congressional Republicans were handling their duties, with 62% giving them a thumbs down.

But just over three-quarters of Republicans (77%) said they approved of the way GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill were handling their jobs, with just one in five disapproving.

Forty percent of respondents approved of how Trump is handling his job as president, with 54% disapproving.

A Trump administration proposal could put more than a million low-income households at risk of losing their government subsidized housing. That's according to new research from New York University - obtained exclusively by The Associated Press.

WOODINVILLE, Wash. (AP) — More than 1 million low-income households — most of them working families with children — who depend on the nation's public housing and Section 8 voucher programs could be at risk of losing their government-subsidized homes under the Trump administration's proposal to impose a two-year time limit on rental assistance.

That's according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The NYU report, which was published Thursday, also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots.

“If currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,” for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities “would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.”

Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump's administration is determined to reshape HUD's expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations.

At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency.

“It's broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,” Turner said. “HUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.”

Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there's little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented — how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined.

The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD's nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years.

HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study.

“There is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,” Lovett said in a statement.

The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area's median income.

“Housing assistance is especially impactful for children,” said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can “change in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,” Aiken said.

Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and “able-bodied” for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction.

Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent — 30% of her household income — for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington.

Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: “I like that I can afford it.”

Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits — the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals.

Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling.

“Any conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,” said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities.

Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn't have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent.

Shawnté Spears of the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo in California said the agency's five-year time limits have “given folks motivation” to meet their goals in tandem with self-sufficiency programs funded by dollars Trump wants to cut. Time limits also give more households the chance to use vouchers, she said.

But with the Bay Area's high rents, some tenants still have to spend more than half of their income on rent once their time is up or end up back on waitlists.

“I believe the program is very helpful in getting folks prepared but there lies this really, really significant rent burden here in our county,” said Spears. “When folks do leave our time-limited program, they are facing an uphill battle.”

Los Angeles police officers have begun working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement once again despite warnings from the city's mayor that ICE is a disruptive force threatening the community. 

For the first time since early 2020, Los Angeles County authorities in May began handing over jail inmates to ICE, transferring eight prisoners said to be illegal residents to federal agents that month, and a dozen more in June. 

Los Angeles is a sanctuary city, generally preventing local authorities from assisting ICE with carrying out immigration enforcement efforts through actions such as detaining or deporting illegal immigrants. 

However, the Trump administration is using a loophole to resume some level of cooperation between the Los Angeles police and ICE, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

The Trump administration obtained federal judicial warrants to secure the transfer of prisoners from local jails to ICE custody, capitalizing on a provision marking an exception to sanctuary policies that allows city authorities to cooperate with the government on cases that involve criminal offenses.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the recent transfers involved federal warrants for prisoners who reentered the country illegally after having been previously deported, a federal crime that can carry a multiyear prison sentence, per the outlet. 

The sheriff's cooperation with federal agents comes despite Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass's public animosity toward ICE, which she has accused of disrupting immigrant communities through raids targeting illegal immigrants for deportation, including many working in industries heavily reliant on migrant labor. 

“Maybe we are part of a national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor, power from a local jurisdiction, and, frankly, leaving our city and our citizens, our residents, in fear,” Bass said in June. 

The following month, Bass made an in-person appearance at MacArthur Park, a local immigrant hub, to stop ICE from carrying out a raid in the area. The tense standoff ended without any arrests made by agents, who were accompanied by National Guard troops and military vehicles. 

“Minutes before, there were more than 20 kids playing—then, the MILITARY comes through,” Bass said following the encounter. “The SECOND I heard about this, I went to the park to speak to the person in charge to tell them it needed to end NOW. Absolutely outrageous.” 

Anger over the Trump administration's deportation effort was highlighted during anti-ICE protests in June, some of which turned into riots where demonstrators attacked law enforcement officials. 

Amid the unrest, federal officials, “border czar” Tom Homan among them, have warned that ICE agents are at risk of murder, as assaults on officers surge.

Cudahy Vice Mayor Cynthia Gonzalez, a southern California city councilwoman, is among those who have been criticized for stirring tensions due to a video she recently posted on social media that appeared to call on gang members to “help out and organize” resistance efforts against ICE. She apologized after posting the video, which referenced Florencia 13 and 18th Street, two violent street gangs in Los Angeles with a history of murdering police officers. 

Immigrant advocates in California have accused ICE of racial profiling to carry out arrests, mounting a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging “individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from.” 

DHS TELLS ICE TO TARGET FARM AND HOTEL WORKERS AGAIN

ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens detained during a disputed ICE operation in the Golden State, was “physically assaulted … for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.”

A federal judge ruled last Friday that ICE officials cannot rely on profiling factors, such as race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, to form reasonable suspicion for a detentive stop. The decision was hailed by Bass as a major victory, and by the DHS as a “ridiculous” stunt.

A conversation with Julie K. Brown, the investigative reporter who knows more than almost anyone else about Jeffrey Epstein

Elvis is dead. American astronauts really did leave footprints on the moon. And the end of the world has come and gone, over and over again, without the world ever actually ending. When you're a true-blue conspiracy theorist, none of that matters. What's real is only what you want to believe, not what the evidence shows.

But when it comes to one of the most popular conspiracy theories in American history—the explosive case of Jeffrey Epstein—the rules of conspiracism only partly apply. The Epstein story seems practically lab manufactured to appeal to conspiracy theorists (incidentally, things manufactured in labs are also something conspiracy theorists love to talk about).

The Epstein saga hits on practically every theme of every major conspiracy theory, going back for centuries: It entails allegations of horrific child abuse. There are multiple mysterious deaths involved. Missing tapes. Hidden documents. Claims about a shadowy cabal. Backtracking politicians. Celebrities. Plus, Epstein was Jewish—so the whole affair is inevitably laced with anti-Semitism, a key feature of conspiracism since the Crusades.

The thing is, only some parts of the Epstein story are conspiracy theories, and it's surprisingly difficult to suss out which ones. Epstein really did commit awful crimes. People in positions of tremendous power really did let him off easy back in the Bush administration.

So where is the line between conspiracy theory and actual conspiracy? In an attempt to make sense of all of this, I talked with Julie K. Brown, an investigative reporter at the Miami Herald and the reporter who knows more about Epstein than almost any other person on the planet.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

News host 1: The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. Will that really happen?

Attorney General Pam Bondi: It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump.

News host 2: Would you declassify the Epstein files?

President Donald Trump: Yeah. Yeah, I would. All right. I guess I would.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino: I'm not ever gonna let this story go, because of what I heard from a source about Bill Clinton on a plane with Jeffrey Epstein. I'm not letting it go.

FBI Director Kash Patel: Why is the FBI protecting the greatest pederast, the largest scale pederast in human history?

Alina Habba: We have flight logs. We have information, names that will come out.

Piers Morgan: Is it gonna be shocking?

Habba: I don't see how it's not shocking.

Adrienne LaFrance: This is Radio Atlantic. I am Adrienne LaFrance, executive editor of the Atlantic, filling in for Hanna Rosin, who is away this week.

For years, President Trump and his allies have promised to make bombshell news on the Jeffrey Epstein case. Many conspiracy-theory-obsessed Americans are preoccupied by Epstein, and MAGA world has long promised that Trump would be the one to release secret files about him. The saga is catnip for conspiracy theorists.

The thing is, there are legitimate questions about Epstein, so it's hard to tell what's real and what's made up. Until recently, Pam Bondi, the attorney general, repeatedly said that she had specific new information about Epstein. But over the past two weeks, things got a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated.

[Music]

News host 3: The Department of Justice and FBI released a memo today, saying there was no Jeffrey Epstein client list, contradicting previous promises to provide it.

LaFrance: Last week, the FBI released a memo, saying it had reviewed all of its evidence on Epstein, some 300 gigabytes of material, and it announced that it does not plan to release any more information. The Department of Justice now says there is no Epstein client list, and they say there's no evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.

This is pretty much the exact opposite of what Trump world has been claiming all along. Now, Americans are accustomed to Trump and his allies making outrageous claims without evidence. But this particular about-face has MAGA tearing each other apart, with some major influencers turning on previous allies and many Trump supporters criticizing Trump himself for what seems to them like a cover-up.

News host 4: President Trump facing unprecedented criticism from some of his biggest supporters.

Trump: He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is.

LaFrance: This is a wild story politically, so wild that it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that there are real crimes underlying the larger scandal. Like many people, I feel like I'm losing the thread on all of this. It's extremely hard to understand which aspects of this are known to be true, known to be false, or somewhere in the muddy middle.

So on this episode, we're going to try to make as much sense of this as we possibly can.

Julie Brown: This is gonna be like the [John F. Kennedy] assassination. Long after you and I are gone, there's gonna be people that are gonna be writing and looking at this, and writing books about it. I just know it.

LaFrance: That's Julie K. Brown. She's an investigative reporter at the Miami Herald, and she probably knows more than anyone in the world about this case. In 2018, Julie published a series of deeply reported stories about Epstein that led to the effective reopening of the case. The next year, Epstein was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges. Then a month after his arrest, he was found dead in his jail cell.

Julie, hi.

Brown: Hello.

LaFrance: Let me start by asking you about last week. Are you surprised by all of this drama? Or have you been basically waiting for this moment, where Trump world says, Oh, just kidding. Nothing to see here?

Brown: I've been waiting for this moment. I could see this like it was a train wreck that you can't take your eyes from, because you know what's going to happen, and this does not surprise me. What would've surprised me is if they had really released files, because I really didn't think they were going to.

LaFrance: And is that because there aren't files to release, or because of what might be in them?

Brown: Both. I mean, there are files to release, but I knew that they probably contain a lot of sensitive information and that there would be a lot of hand-wringing over what they could release, if they could release them.

The other thing is: There is an ongoing criminal appeal of a criminal conviction attached to some of these files, which are the files that contain the Ghislaine Maxwell case. And so I would think that, legitimately, there might be some things there that they probably couldn't release, because the case is still on appeal.

But nevertheless, there's still a lot of files that date back to probably 2005 even that they could have released if they elected to do so.

LaFrance: And the Maxwell case is the affiliate of his who is in prison now. Is that right?

Brown: That's correct.

LaFrance: Well, let's establish some of the basics. I find myself watching all of this unfold, and beginning to sort of lose sight of what actually is true, what is speculation. Talk about what Epstein was accused of, what he was indicted for. What do we know for sure?

Brown: Well, let's start with something that almost no one really starts with in this whole scandal that's been happening over the past week, and that is the victims.

Jeffrey Epstein abused probably at least 200 young girls, some of them reportedly as young as 12 years old, over a span of decades. He also sexually abused young women who are in the area of 18 to 25 years old. But this is a case about a man who used these women as pawns to further his own ambition and finances, in that he used them not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others that he had hoped to do business with. And this was all part of the sex-trafficking operation. He had several different offices, so to speak, with this operation. He had a whole staff that helped him with this. He had legal people that helped him with this. So this was just not Epstein having sex in his mansion with a couple of underage girls. This was a whole operation.

And I think people sometimes lose sight of the fact that he was able to continue doing that because our federal government and our criminal-justice system failed these victims, and never really pursued this case with the seriousness and intensity that they should have from the very beginning. And that's why he got away with it. It's why he was released way back in 2009, and he was able to continue doing the same things all over again after his release from this plea deal that he initially negotiated two decades ago with the federal government.

LaFrance: Talk about that time period. When you think about the lag in taking this operation seriously, does that cross different presidential administrations in terms of the DOJ? Or is there one period in which it was particularly egregiously ignored? How should we think about that?

Brown: Sexual assault doesn't discriminate based on political party. There were bad people on both sides of the political aisle in this story. And focusing on the political part of it misses the point. And the point is that our justice system is terribly broken. Our system is weighted unfairly in favor of people who have a lot of power and a lot of money and a lot of influence.

LaFrance: It's such an important point. And when you hear all of these conspiracy theories, how do you sort between, you know, the theories that are just totally outrageous and you think are not worth dwelling on, versus, you know, perhaps an example of what might be called a conspiracy theory but you, as an investigative reporter, think is actually a legitimate line of questioning?

Brown: That is this scandal, in a nutshell, in that we have some competing forces here. We have the forces of truth and facts, versus the forces of conspiracy that want to fan theories in order to further some kind of agenda, whether that's a political agenda or—there's a million agendas. Some of these influencers, their agenda is to get more viewers or more listeners.

So there's these competing forces here with journalism today, and it's not just with the Epstein story, but with almost everything. And it's a real struggle, to be honest with you. That's why I always try to bring these questions back to what I know based on my reporting, based on court records, based on, you know, police records, based on interviews that I've done.

And so when I'm asked about some of these conspiracy theories, I sort of direct it toward “Here's what I do know.”

LaFrance: Let's talk about the client list, or what's sometimes called the “Epstein client list.” Is it real? Where did this idea that it exists come from? What do we know?

Brown: That whole thing about the so-called list is really a red herring. I think it morphed out of sort of a phone directory that Ghislaine Maxwell actually is responsible for compiling on a computer way back in 2005, 2006. And it's public. The phone numbers are redacted out of it, but if you Google it, you could find—they used to call it the “black book.” That was sort of the nickname that it was given. And it was these copies that were printed out from a computer, and every time Epstein or Maxwell met somebody important, they would get their contact information, and they would put it in this file. There were people like Donald Trump on that list and celebrities. But there were also his gardeners who were on that list, his hairdresser, his barbers, his electrician. I mean, it was a comprehensive list. So it was pretty clear that this was not a black book in the sense that these were all his clients. It was just a phone directory.

But the reason why they called it a black book is because when the FBI first got its hands on it, there was someone who was trying to sell it to one of the lawyers who represented the victims. He sort of circled some names on that list, of people that he was trying to say were somehow connected to Epstein in a more nefarious way, whether it was business or whether it was sex trafficking.

People just started then on social media, started to refer to something called a client list. It took a life of its own, into that, Oh, Epstein had a client list. He actually had a list of clients that he sent girls to, or that he sent women to. I never believed that there was ever a list like that, because, quite frankly, Epstein didn't need to do a list like that. The bad actors here, the people that he sent some of these victims to, they know who they are. And he really only used this whole sex-trafficking operation as a way to pressure them to help him in some way, to either invest in, or give them his money to invest, or just to make money. So as long as they were cooperating with him and doing that, there was no reason to say, I have you on a list. That wasn't the way he operated.

But that said, there are still names in those files, of people who were involved with Epstein's operation. He could never have done this all by himself. He had people. We know he had assistants. We know he had lawyers. We know he had people helping him get visas for women that he was recruiting from overseas countries. So there was a network here of people that were working for him and helping him.

LaFrance: We're going to take a quick break. More with Julie in just a moment.

[Music]

[Break]

LaFrance: Let's talk for a moment about the Donald Trump of it all. You know, there are some conflicting data or information to reconcile here, and I'm really interested to hear how you think about this, because we're talking about a man, in Trump, who has bragged about grabbing women without their consent, who is credibly accused of rape and sexual assault.

And so, on one hand, you have, you know, this—you point out that the Epstein list is a red herring, that, you know, Elon Musk claimed without evidence that Trump is on this list, which you're saying probably doesn't even exist.

On the other hand, there's good reason, empirically grounded reason to question Trump's record of sexual or alleged sexual abuse. And so I'm curious how you think about, you know, in this moment, when you have the Trump administration waving this away, saying, There is no list, you know, Trump saying, This whole line of questioning is boring.

What do you make of this? How should we think about how he fits in (or doesn't) to this larger scandal?

Brown: Well, it's hard to know. You don't really know how he fits completely into this scandal. I was finally forced to say something during the election, when there were so many of those conspiracy theorists out there on the left who were trying to directly link him with Epstein's crimes. And there's absolutely no evidence that he was involved in Epstein's crimes. There isn't. And I've pretty much read almost everything that's out there. But that doesn't mean that it's not possible. And I would say that with everything that's happened in the past week, it certainly raises suspicions that maybe there is more to his, you know, friendship with Epstein than maybe we know.

LaFrance: Right. And to your point about them having had a relationship, you know, Trump himself has said that they were friends. In 2002, there was an interview that Trump did with New York magazine. I'm going to read this quote from Donald Trump at the time. It says—he says, quote, “I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

So given that, and given everything, you know, more importantly, do you think it's possible that Donald Trump didn't know what Epstein was up to?

Brown: No. He had to know. Yeah, I think he absolutely knew. The reason why he knew is, one of the impetuses for their alleged falling out was: Epstein went to Mar-a-Lago at one point, and he hit on one of the young daughters of one of the other club members. And we were told by multiple sources that that's why Trump and him broke it off, because Trump banned him from Mar-a-Lago because of that.

I honestly think, back in the culture that existed back then and to some degree, of course, still today, that some of these powerful men really believed they were helping these girls and women. They really felt that by paying them, this was a good thing: We're helping this woman, you know. We're helping this girl to get an education. They still sometimes look at these cases and say, What's the problem here? The women got paid. They had to know what they were doing. There is still this cultural problem that we have in this country that powerful men who take advantage of vulnerable women or younger women don't do anything wrong.

LaFrance: You're someone who has spent years trying to understand the truth about all of this. If you had a magic wand and could wave it and, you know, get the question you most want answered answered, or see the document, or whatever it is, what is the thing that you most wish you could know, once and for all, about all of this?

Brown: I think the one nagging question for me—because, you know, I know so much about the case, to be honest—goes all the way back to 2008, and I wanna know the person in the Department of Justice who said, Don't charge Epstein. If you're gonna charge him, charge him with just something minor, and let's get this done.

LaFrance: And that 2008 case—remind us how that came about.

Brown: Well, there was intense political pressure because, you know, initially, the case was a local police case. It was the Palm Beach police who found a litany of girls that were going in and out and having sex with Epstein at all hours of the day and night.

And they wanted to, of course, charge him with sexual battery or rape or, you know, something like that, on a local charge. And initially, the state attorney in Palm Beach County, where this happened, was completely on board with the police case and their investigation, said, Go after him. We're gonna nail him. We're gonna arrest him.

And then somebody got to him. Epstein lawyered up with some pretty powerful lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, and they started getting dirt on the girls, trying to show that they didn't live, you know, the best lives. It was intense. Epstein mounted an unbelievable pressure campaign.

And I think he thought that it would end with the local police once the state attorney—which the state attorney finally did sort of say, I am not going to charge him. But the police, to their credit, never gave up on it. They did everything they possibly could have done to try to move the needle and get him put away. And, you know, of course, at that point, once the feds took over, then Epstein had a bigger problem, and then he needed to hire more lawyers who were politically connected in Washington.

Then at that point, it rose and rose to the White House, really, where the case just kept rolling. And that was part of my—really, the biggest part of my investigation was looking at how Epstein and his lawyers manipulated our Justice Department in a big way.

They basically got almost everything they wanted, except they wanted the case to completely disappear. They wanted him to walk away without anything. And what they ultimately got was this sweetheart deal that they kept secret for a year. You know, the victims never even knew exactly what happened until a year later, when finally, a judge unsealed the agreement.

LaFrance: So for you, it's not the Epstein list or the jail-cell video or the circumstances around his death, but really: Who was that person in the first place who decided that he should walk, basically?

Brown: Yeah.

LaFrance: That's really interesting.

Brown: Yeah, who were the people behind that in the beginning? Because if they had done their jobs, of all these people in 2006, 2007, and 2008—if all those people working for us, the American public, had done their jobs, we wouldn't be sitting here right now. A lot of those victims would've never been victimized.

LaFrance: So it sounds like under the Bush administration, primarily, or does this go into Obama's DOJ as well?

Brown: No, it was primarily initially Bush's administration.

LaFrance: What should happen now, if there's any possibility of justice or truth or any sense of closure in this scandal? What is it going to take, and what do you think should happen next?

Brown: I go back to when I took up this case initially. It had been written about. A lot of people knew. There had been tons of stories about the “Lolita Express,” “Epstein Island.” You know, this conspiracy-theory cycle started way back before I even took up the investigation, but I was looking at it from a different vantage point, as a journalist, about exactly what happened.

I looked at it sort of like a cold-case detective, just pretend that I know nothing about the case and start all over. And I think at this point, that's probably the same thing that the Justice Department, in an ideal world, should do. Because this is never going to end. This is going to be like the JFK assassination. Long after you and I are gone, there's gonna be people that are gonna be writing and looking at this, and writing books about it. I just know it.

And so I think in an ideal world, we should just step back and look at everything from the start and examine what happened. I just don't think there's the courage or the political will to do something like that, because a hearing where you're bringing a couple people before Congress isn't going to do that, isn't gonna get you those answers. What will get your answers if you get a really good prosecutor to really examine this.

LaFrance: I want to end where we started, which is with the victims, and we're talking here about some 200 people whose lives are forever changed by these crimes. Have you talked to any of those victims in the past week or so? I'm curious what they're saying now, how they're responding to this latest drama. What have you heard?

Brown: I try not to bother them, you know, every time you call them—even one of the lawyers I spoke with who represented nine victims, I spoke with this morning, I said, Have you spoken with your clients? And he said no. He said, I do not call them unless it's something really big, because you just open that wound every time they get that phone call.

And so I've been very respectful of their privacy. I rarely ever call them. I figure if they need me, they'll call me. I did think about them after Trump made the comments that this was boring—and I can't remember the other word he used—but I just cringed because I thought, Oh, gosh. You know, I felt their pain when he said those words. This is just a nightmare for them.

You know? This is just a horrible nightmare for them because all they want is for the government to do its job. I might get emotional here because I feel bad for them because I know them so well, some of them. And the interviews I did with them were very painful to do. And I just feel that our government is just failing them over and over again. And, you know, even though I'm a journalist, I am a human being too. And I just think that what they went through and they're still continuing to go through is painful. Painful.

LaFrance: Well, Julie, thank you so much for all of your extraordinary reporting and, especially, for your time today.

Brown: Thank you.

            Copper is at the core of the American economy. It's in the wires of our pervasive electronics, in the walls of homes and in the engines of cars. Experts say President Donald Trump's plan for tariffs on the red metal could stymy the goal of boosting American manufacturing while potentially igniting inflation.
    


            Trump's July 8 announcement of a 50% tariff on copper imports beginning August 1 sent prices surging 13% in one day, up to a record high of $5.69 per pound.
    


            It was the biggest single-day increase in copper prices on record going back to 1968, according to FactSet.
    


            And those prices could just be a sign of things to come. A 50% tariff would be a “massive tax on consumers of copper,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.
    


            While Trump says his copper tariff is needed to spur domestic production due to national security concerns, there is no quick fix.
    


            The US imports over 50% of the copper it needs, primarily from South America, Hansen said, “with no clear path to improving that for years to come.”
    


            That's because it takes almost 32 years, on average, from the discovery of mineable copper in the US to production, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. And the end result of a big and fast copper tariff could simply be higher prices for many items, economists say.
    


            “A tariff-induced price premium risks making copper—and by extension, US manufacturing and infrastructure—materially more expensive,” Hansen said.
    


            Copper is highly conductive, making it a critical input for electrical and electronic products. Copper can be found in the chips in mobile phones, plumbing in houses and in the engines of cars.
    


            “This is a vital metal for everyday use,” Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank's asset management group, told CNN. “You probably don't go a day where you haven't used something that has copper in it.”
    


            As Trump's self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches, businesses and investors don't know what will happen in the wake of a massive tariff on a key component of the economy — let alone if the president will follow through with it at all, considering his history of backing off tariff threats.
    


            Copper is one of the most widely used metals in the world. The typical American-made car has over 50 pounds of copper, according to the Copper Development Association, a trade group.

The Trump administration just doubled the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Here's what that means



            And the price of copper has been rising in recent years. The growing market for electric vehicles and the expansion of data centers thanks to the artificial intelligence boom have helped drive global demand for copper.
    


            Copper prices this year have smashed through previous records amid Trump's threat of tariffs. Copper futures in New York have soared almost 39% this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 6% gain, bitcoin's 24% gain and gold's 26% gain.
    


            Trump's tariffs on metals, including steel and aluminum, are intended to bolster US supply chains. His administration also cited national security concerns for levying a tariff on copper.
    


            But an import tax on copper would raise production costs for manufacturers in industries including construction, electronic goods and automobiles, according to Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics.
    


            “All these tariffs raise costs and therefore injure downstream manufacturing,” Maurice Obstfeld, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley and member of former president Barack Obama's council of economic advisers, told CNN.
    


            “For the US, this seems like a fairly pointless act of self-harm,” Obstfeld added.
    


            Businesses would face higher costs because there aren't many viable substitutes for copper, according to Brandon Parsons, a practitioner of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. While aluminum can be a substitute, it is more flammable and does not have the same conductivity, making it less viable for using in items like semiconductor chips.
    


            “There isn't really a good way for businesses or consumers to avoid these higher costs,” he said. “It's going to be felt widespread through the economy.”
    


            Chile, Canada and Peru provided over 90% of US copper imports in 2024, according to the US Geological Survey.
    


            The United States in 2024 mined an estimated 1.1 million tons of copper, according to the US Geological Survey, meeting just under half of its consumption. Arizona was home to more than 70% of domestic copper production in 2024.
    


            Shifting economic incentives in the modern era and the opening of free trade have both contributed to a decline in US copper production, according to Pepperdine's Parsons.
    


            The United States in recent decades has produced less copper as the global economy liberalized, enabling the country to import relatively cheap copper from countries like Chile and allowing the US economy to expand to other industries.
    


            Industrial buyers and Wall Street traders in recent months have shipped enormous amounts of copper to the United States to get ahead of potential tariffs. Morgan Stanley estimates 400,000 tons, or roughly six months' worth of “extra” copper was front-loaded and delivered to the US in the early months of 2025.
    


            The copper stockpiles could “temporarily buffer” the market when tariffs go into effect, according to Ewa Manthey, a commodity strategist at Dutch bank ING.
    


            However, the buildup of copper won't last forever, and it'll be difficult for the US to produce enough copper domestically. At some point, the US will likely need to import more copper under the 50% tariff, which could risk a resurgence in inflation, Manthey said.
    


            “Higher copper prices also risk higher inflation, raising costs for US manufacturers without a domestic alternative available,” Manthey said.
    


            It remains to be seen whether companies will absorb the higher costs or pass the costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, although economic theory suggests businesses would pass on higher costs to consumers when possible.

Here's how Trump's tariffs could be impacting prices for US consumers



            Wall Street and corporate America have been expecting  tariffs on copper — just not 50%.
    


            “Investors were caught off guard, as the market had been expecting a much lower tariff rate,” Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said in an email.
    


            Smaller tariff rates such as 10% can be used strategically to encourage domestic manufacturing, economists say. But a rate as high as 50% could send a shock to markets, even leading to a drop in demand because prices are just too high.
    


            That could lead to slower economic growth across industries, such as a lull in home building.
    


            Trump has espoused using tariffs as a means to boost US manufacturing. But tariffs are not a panacea that will revive the manufacturing industry, Pepperdine's Parsons said.
    


            “The rationale for this is to encourage production and investment in copper in the United States,” Parsons said. “The issue is it's not like producing water, where you just open up the faucet. It could take years and years to open up a new copper mine, or even to expand production. So, while this does provide some incentive, it's something that's more long-run. You're going to feel the short-run pain.”
    


            Incentives like direct government subsidies or credits could promote domestic production of copper and fortify US supply chains, according to Parsons. While tariffs can help domestic companies sell more in the market, the higher prices can create unwanted ripple effects throughout the supply chain.
    


            Trump in February signed an executive order opening a Section 232 investigation into copper imports. That section of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act gives the president the authority to impose import duties to protect industries deemed vital to US national security.
    


            “The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain, with increasing reliance on foreign sources for mined, smelted and refined copper,” the executive order said.
    


            A Section 232 investigation comes with a 270-day deadline for an investigation, which means the Trump administration had until November to complete its review of copper, according to ING's Manthey.
    


            “There are many foreign suppliers of copper, including close allies like Canada, so a national security rationale seems contrived,” Berkeley's Obstfeld said.

Trump invokes wartime powers to increase production of critical minerals



            Trump said in a social media post on July 9 confirming his intent to impose tariffs on copper that the metal is the second most-used metal in the Defense Department.
    


            But copper was not one of the 50 critical minerals designated by the US Geological Survey in 2022. The US Geological Survey is expected to publish an updated classification list for critical minerals this year.
    


            However, copper is considered a “critical material” for energy, according to the Energy Department.
    


            “The US has very limited current mining capacity,” Obstfeld said. “It will take a decade or more to onshore copper production substantially. That will still leave copper prices much higher in the US, and in the meantime, American consumers and businesses will suffer even more.”

            Another major championship means another opportunity for Scottie Scheffler.
    


            The 29-year-old world No. 1, who won his third major at May's PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Golf Club, is favored to win this week's Open Championship at Royal Portrush.
    


            By winning, Scheffler would continue the trajectory he has been on over the last three-and-a-half years, aided by a patient approach to the game that's led to 16 PGA Tour wins, three majors and counting.
    


            If he were to capture a fourth major title in Northern Ireland, Scheffler would add to his growing resume. The list of men's golfers capturing four major titles includes Old and Young Tom Morris – the father-son duo that hailed from the home of golf in St. Andrews, Scotland – and South African Ernie Els.
    


            It would also be the third different major Scheffler has won, leaving him a US Open victory shy of the career grand slam. Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy have won all four men's professional majors.
    


            That doesn't mean all that much to Scheffler, who rarely discusses the historical stakes of his victories. During his news conference at Royal Portrush on Tuesday, he discussed how quickly the satisfaction of winning dissipates.
    


            “It's great to win tournaments. It's a lot of fun,” Scheffler told reporters. “Sometimes, the feeling only lasts about two minutes, it seems like, when you're celebrating, and then it's like, OK, now you've got to go do all this other stuff, which is great, but sometimes the feeling of winning only lasts a few seconds. It's pretty exciting and fun, but it just doesn't last that long.”
    


            Scheffler's unique admission hinted at a trait of his that has helped him reach his very best on the course.
    


            One reason why Scheffler got to this point, and why he is the favorite this week, is his patience on the course. It is a mindset that was evident during his latest major victory.
    


            Through two rounds of the PGA Championship in May, Scheffler was three strokes back of leader Kim Si-woo. He had not played superbly: he doubled bogeyed the 16th hole on the Thursday and admitted after his opening round he had room for improvement.
    


            In the third round, Scheffler played his first 13 holes in one-under and sat two shots back of Bryson DeChambeau. But he took advantage of the next five holes, carding eagle on the drivable par-four 14th and birdie on 15, 17 and 18.
    


            Scheffler put, and kept, himself in contention over the first 49 holes. However, those final five holes on the Saturday are what put him in control.
    


            The final round was a challenge, as Scheffler was two-over on the front nine and briefly fell into a tie with Spain's Jon Rahm.
    


            Once again, though, he closed strong with a two-under 34 on the back nine. When he tapped in to close out the five-stroke win, Scheffler hugged his caddie, Ted Scott, raised his arms in the air and slammed his cap on the ground.
    


            His focus and patience had, once again, paid off.
    


            “When I stepped on the tee on Thursday, I'm not thinking about what's going to happen on Sunday,” Scheffler told reporters after winning the tournament. “I'm preparing for a 72-hole event. That's what I tell myself on the first tee: it's 72 holes. That's a lot of time. That's a lot of holes. That's a lot of shots.”
    


            Scheffler's patient approach has garnered praise from his peers. In a documentary released by the PGA Tour chronicling Scheffler's 2024 season, a host of pros – including two-time major winner Collin Morikawa and Sweden's Ludvig Åberg – heaped adulation on Scheffler's patience and focus.
    


            Woods, a winner of 82 PGA Tour events and 15 majors, even compared Scheffler's mindset to his own.
    


            “It's over 72 holes, it's not a sprint, this is over a marathon,” Woods said. “I think there's the similarity between how we play the game.”
    


            That mentality has shined throughout the last three-and-a-half years. It took a while, though, for Scheffler to develop it.
    


            “I think when I was young, I would either hold it in or kind of blow up,” Scheffler said Tuesday. “Now, I think I do a better job of holding it in but also getting it over to the next shot and almost sharpening my focus to where I'm in a better spot after a bit of frustration than I am before, if that makes sense.”
    


            Before the 2022 WM Phoenix Open, Scheffler was one of the best players on the PGA Tour without a victory. He won Rookie of the Year honors in 2020 and finished in the top 20 in all six majors he competed in across 2020 and 2021. He was also part of the victorious US team at the 2021 Ryder Cup, knocking off Rahm, then the top player in the Official World Golf Ranking, in the singles portion.
    


            But Scheffler's playoff victory against Patrick Cantlay in Phoenix was a launching pad.
    


            “Definitely nice to get my first win under the belt, and I think the first one is probably always the hardest,” Scheffler told reporters at the time.
    


            Scheffler won three more tournaments in 2022, including his first major at the Masters, and two tournaments in 2023, including the Players Championship.
    


            In 2024, Scheffler was a machine. He won eight times, including a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, the Masters, the Players Championship and the Tour Championship – the last of which netted him the FedEx Cup and its $25 million payout. He became the first player to win at least seven events since Woods did so in 2007.
    


            His encore this year was delayed by a month, due to a hand injury he suffered while making ravioli for Christmas dinner. While Scheffler hadn't nabbed a victory by the end of April – he already won four times by that point a year prior – his worst finish was a tie for 25th at the WM Phoenix Open. He also finished fourth in his title defense at the Masters, three shots behind the victorious McIlroy.
    


            In early May, Scheffler won the CJ Cup Byron Nelson tournament  by eight strokes; his 31-under-par 253 total is the lowest 72-hole mark in PGA Tour history.
    


            His PGA Championship victory two weeks later in Charlotte made him the third player since World War II to win three majors and 15 or more PGA Tour events before turning 29. The other two? Nicklaus and Woods.
    


            His repeat victory at Nicklaus' Memorial Tournament made it three wins in four tournaments. He and McIlroy are the only players to win three times on tour this season.
    


            If Scheffler were to win this weekend, his 2025 season would match up favorably to 2024. This would be his first season with two major victories and would continue the rise that Scheffler himself cannot fully comprehend.
    


            However, he has maintained that golf is not his primary focus. His wife, Meredith, son, Bennett, and his faith all usurp his day job.
    


            “To have that kind of sense of accomplishment, I think, is a pretty cool feeling,” Scheffler said Tuesday. “To get to live out your dreams is very special, but at the end of the day, I'm not out here to inspire the next generation of golfers. I'm not out here to inspire someone to be the best player in the world because what's the point?
    


            “This is not a fulfilling life. It's fulfilling from the sense of accomplishment, but it's not fulfilling from a sense of the deepest places of your heart.”
    


            One thing is for sure – all eyes will be on the favorite Scheffler to earn his first Open Championship this weekend.

CHICAGO (AP) — Protests and events against President Donald Trump's controversial policies that include mass deportations and cuts to Medicaid and other safety nets for poor people are planned Thursday at more than 1,600 locations around the country.

The “Good Trouble Lives On” national day of action honors the late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. Protests are expected to be held along streets, at court houses and other public spaces. Organizers are calling for them to be peaceful.

“We are navigating one of the most terrifying moments in our nation's history,” Public Citizen co-president Lisa Gilbert said during an online news conference Tuesday. “We are all grappling with a rise of authoritarianism and lawlessness within our administration ... as the rights, freedoms and expectations of our very democracy are being challenged.”

Public Citizen is a nonprofit with a stated mission of taking on corporate power. It is a member of a coalition of groups behind Thursday's protests.

Major protests are planned in Atlanta and St. Louis, as well as Oakland, California, and Annapolis, Maryland.

Lewis first was elected to Congress in 1986. He died in 2020 at the age of 80 following an advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

He was the youngest and last survivor of the Big Six civil rights activists, a group led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, a 25-year-old Lewis led some 600 protesters in the Bloody Sunday march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Lewis was beaten by police, suffering a skull fracture.




Within days, King led more marches in the state, and President Lyndon Johnson pressed Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act that later became law.

“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America,” Lewis said in 2020 while commemorating the 1965 voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.

Chicago will be the flagship city for Thursday's protests as demonstrators are expected to rally downtown in the afternoon. 

Betty Magness, executive vice president of the League of Women Voters Chicago and one of the organizers of Chicago's event, said the rally will also include a candlelight vigil to honor Lewis.

Much of the rest of the rally will have a livelier tone, Magness said, adding “we have a DJ who's gonna rock us with boots on the ground.”

Pushback against Trump so far in his second term has centered on deportations and immigration enforcement tactics

Earlier this month, protesters engaged in a tense standoff as federal authorities conducted mass arrests at two Southern California marijuana farms. One farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic raid.

Those raids followed Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard outside federal buildings and to protect immigration agents carrying out arrests on Los Angeles. On June 8, thousands of protesters began taking to the streets in Los Angeles.

And organizers of the June 14 “No Kings” demonstrations said millions of people marched in hundreds of events from New York to San Francisco. Demonstrators labeled Trump as a dictator and would-be king for marking his birthday with a military parade.

The largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth was sold for just over $5 million at an auction of rare geological and archaeological objects in New York on Wednesday. But a rare young dinosaur skeleton stole the show when it fetched more than $30 million in a bidding frenzy.

The 54-pound (25-kilogram) rock named NWA 16788 was discovered in the Sahara Desert in Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, after having been blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveling 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth, according to Sotheby's. The estimated sale price before the auction was $2 million to $4 million.

The identity of the buyer was not immediately disclosed. The final bid was $4.3 million. Adding various fees and costs, the official sale price was about $5.3 million, making it the most valuable meteorite ever sold at auction, Sotheby's said.

The live bidding was slow, with the auctioneer trying to coax more offers and decreasing the minimum bid increases.

The dinosaur skeleton, on the other hand, sparked a war among six bidders over six minutes. With a pre-auction estimate of $4 million to $6 million, it is one of only four known Ceratosaurus nasicornis skeletons and the only juvenile skeleton of the species, which resembles the Tyrannosaurus rex but is smaller.

Bidding for the skeleton started with a high advance offer of $6 million, then escalated during the live round with bids $500,000 higher than the last and later $1 million higher than the last before ending at $26 million. 

People applauded after the auctioneer gaveled the bidding closed.

The official sale price was $30.5 million with fees and costs. That buyer also was not immediately disclosed, but the auction house said the buyer plans to loan the skeleton to an institution. It was the third-highest amount paid for a dinosaur at auction. A Stegosaurus skeleton called “Apex” holds the record after it was sold for $44.6 million last year at Sotheby's.

Parts of the skeleton were found in 1996 near Laramie, Wyoming, at Bone Cabin Quarry, a gold mine for dinosaur bones. Specialists assembled nearly 140 fossil bones with some sculpted materials to recreate the skeleton and mounted it so it's ready to exhibit, Sotheby's says. It was acquired last year by Fossilogic, a Utah-based fossil preparation and mounting company.

It's more than 6 feet (2 meters) tall and nearly 11 feet (3 meters) long, and is believed to be from the late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago. Ceratosaurus dinosaurs could grow up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) long, while the T. rex could be 40 feet (12 meters) long.

The bidding for the Mars meteorite began with two advance offers of $1.9 million and $2 million. The live bidding slowly proceeded with increases of $200,000 and $300,000 until $4 million, then continued with $100,000 increases until reaching $4.3 million.

The red, brown and gray meteorite is about 70% larger than the next largest piece of Mars found on Earth and represents nearly 7% of all the Martian material currently on this planet, Sotheby's says. It measures nearly 15 inches by 11 inches by 6 inches (375 millimeters by 279 millimeters by 152 millimeters).

It was also a rare find. There are only 400 Martian meteorites out of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth, the auction house says.

“This Martian meteorite is the largest piece of Mars we have ever found by a long shot,” Cassandra Hatton, vice chairman for science and natural history at Sotheby's, said in an interview before the auction. “So it's more than double the size of what we previously thought was the largest piece of Mars.”

It's not clear exactly when the meteorite was blasted off the surface of Mars, but testing showed it probably happened in recent years, Sotheby's says.

Hatton said a specialized lab examined a small piece of the red planet remnant and confirmed it was from Mars. It was compared with the distinct chemical composition of Martian meteorites discovered during the Viking space probe that landed on Mars in 1976, she said.

The examination found that it is an “olivine-microgabbroic shergottite,” a type of Martian rock formed from the slow cooling of Martian magma. It has a course-grained texture and contains the minerals pyroxene and olivine, Sotheby's says.

It also has a glassy surface, likely due to the high heat that burned it when it fell through Earth's atmosphere, Hatton said. “So that was their first clue that this wasn't just some big rock on the ground,” she said.

The leader of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather before the deadly Texas floods, but it is now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesman for camp's operators said Wednesday.

Richard “Dick” Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, began taking action after more than 2 inches of rain had fallen in the area along the Guadalupe River, said Jeff Carr, a spokesman for the family and the camp. He said Eastland had a “home weather station” and was monitoring the rain on July 4. 

But after initially portraying to the media this week that Eastland got the weather alerts about a flash flood, Carr told The Associated Press that critical moment in the timeline of the tragedy isn't as clear as the family and staff first thought. No one in the family or camp staff, Carr said, could now say whether Eastland got the alert at 1:14 a.m. 

“It was assumed that just because he had a cellphone on and shortly after that alert, he was calling his family on the walkie-talkies saying, ‘Hey, we got two inches in the last hour. We need to get the canoes up. We got things to do,' ” Carr said. 

The new account by the family comes as Camp Mystic staff has come under scrutiny of their actions, what preventive measures were taken and the camp's emergency plan leading up to a during the catastrophic flood that has killed at least 132 people. 




The flash-flood warning that the National Weather Service issued at 1:14 a.m. on July 4 for Kerr County triggered an emergency alerts to broadcast outlets, weather radios and mobile phones. It warned of “a dangerous and life-threatening situation.” The weather service extended the warning at 3:35 a.m. and escalated it to flash-flood emergency at 4:03 a.m.

Eastland died while trying to rescue girls and was found in his Tahoe that was swept away by the floodwaters, Carr said.

Even without a storm, the cellphone coverage at Camp Mystic is spotty at best, so campers and staff turn on their Wi-Fi, Carr said. He called ridiculous criticism that Eastland waited too long before beginning to evacuate the campers, which he said appears to have begun sometime between 2 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. 

“Communication was a huge deficiency,” Carr said. “This community was hamstrung, nobody could communicate. The first responder, the first rescue personnel that showed up was a game warden.”

According to Carr, Eastland and others started evacuating girls from cabins nearest the overflowing river and moved them to the camp's two-story recreation hall. Of the 10 cabins closest to the river, the recreation hall is the furthest at 865 feet (264 meters) with the closest cabin about 315 feet (96 meters), according to an Associated Press analysis of aerial imagery.

To reach Senior Hill, which was on higher ground , they would have had to cross an overflowing creek, Carr said. At times the young campers were climbing hills in bare feet, he said. 

Some of the camp's buildings — which flooded — were in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency considered a 100-year flood plain. But in response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county's flood map to remove 15 of the camp's buildings from the hazard area. Carr said there were “legitimate” reasons for filing appeals and suggested that the maps may not always be accurate.

Just before daybreak on the Fourth of July, destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and vehicles. Crews in helicopters, boats and drones have been searching for victims. 

Officials say 97 people in the Kerrville area may still be missing.

Netflix's Future:

While rival media companies are unloading assets and cutting costs, Netflix Inc. continues to thrive.

The owner of the world's most popular paid streaming service on Thursday reported second-quarter results that exceeded investor expectations in every major metric, saying revenue grew to $11.1 billion and earnings jumped to $7.19 a share. The company also raised its forecast for full-year sales and profit margins.

President Donald Trump underwent a comprehensive medical exam that revealed he has a common vein disorder but cleared him of more serious illnesses, the White House said Thursday.

The White House disclosed the 79-year-old president's medical information in response to speculation after photos showed Trump with swollen ankles.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump noticed the swelling in recent weeks and received a thorough evaluation by the White House medical unit.

He was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which Leavitt described as a "benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70."

Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when a person's leg veins are damaged, restricting circulation and causing blood to pool in the legs, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Chronic venous insufficiency affects about 1 in 20 adults, and the risk increases with age, according to the clinic.

Leavitt said Trump was not in any pain from the condition.

Leavitt also addressed bruises periodically visible on the back of Trump's hand. She said they were caused by irritation from "frequent handshaking," coupled with his aspirin regimen.

The medical exam found no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, Leavitt said.

Trump's blood test results were all within "normal limits," and an echocardiogram confirmed "normal cardiac structure and function" with "no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness," she added.

Leavitt said in Thursday's briefing that bruising like that seen on Trump's hands is a common side effect of regularly using aspirin, which Trump takes as part of a "standard cardiovascular prevention regimen."

"The president remains in excellent health, which I think all of you witness on a daily basis here," she said.

White House physician Sean Barbabella wrote in an April memo that Trump "remains in excellent physical health" and is "fully fit" to perform the duties of the presidency.

SECAUCUS, N.J. — As customers walk the aisles of Walmart stores, there are some early signs that higher tariffs are changing pricing.

The nation's largest retailer warned in May that it would have to raise prices for its shoppers as President Donald Trump's new duties drive up the cost of many imported goods. About two months later, some household items on Walmart's shelves have higher prices, according to a CNBC analysis.

CNBC tracked prices of about 50 products across merchandise categories including apparel, electronics, toys and groceries over seven weeks at Walmart's Secaucus, New Jersey, location. About a dozen of the items CNBC followed increased in price during that time, including a frying pan, a pair of jeans and a car seat, according to the analysis. Many of those items are manufactured in countries that face significant tariff rates. Even in cases where prices on imported items increased, it's unclear if the moves were all or partly due to cost increases from tariffs.

The price analysis offers a snapshot into what Trump's duties mean for consumers' wallets, a key concern since he started rolling out tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners earlier this year. While nationwide inflation data had seen a muted effect from tariffs in recent months, that showed some signs of changing in June. Though the consumer price index increased by 0.3% for the month and 2.7% year over year, the prices of tariff-sensitive segments like apparel and household furnishings rose at higher rates of 0.4% and 1%, respectively, from May.

Walmart is a critical indicator of pricing trends for multiple reasons. It's the largest retailer in the U.S., a place where millions of Americans buy not only their regular groceries but also purchase furniture, shoes and other general items. It also explicitly warned that the tariffs were so high, it would be forced to raise prices.

"We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC. The discounter's comment sparked criticism from the White House, with Trump telling the company in a social media post to "EAT THE TARIFFS."

Walmart is a single company. The store where CNBC tracked prices is one among more than 4,500 locations across the U.S., and its suppliers play a role in whether prices rise. Even so, the areas where CNBC saw price hikes at Walmart in many cases reflected trends in national data tracked by the government and research firms.

It isn't just Walmart. Other retailers said this spring that they have raised or expect to hike prices, including Best Buy, Costco, Nike and E.l.f. Beauty.

In a statement, Walmart said "pricing fluctuations are a normal course of business and are influenced by a variety of factors."

"We're committed to keeping prices as low as possible for as long as possible, including the over 6,500 rollbacks we're currently offering, in addition to managing inventory and reducing cost," its statement said.

Most of the items that CNBC tracked at Walmart stayed the same price. However, some products saw a noticeable increase.

The price of a 12-piece set of pots and pans from Beautiful, a private-label kitchenware brand that's exclusive to Walmart and co-founded by Drew Barrymore, rose from $99 to $149. A 12-inch frying pan from Beautiful climbed from $24.97 to $31.97.

In addition, the price of a Graco convertible stroller and car seat increased in price from $199.99 (then noted as a Walmart rollback, or limited-time discount from the $249 original price) to $299.

Some items' packaging offered clues that tariffs could play a role in the hikes. The Beautiful pots and pans and Graco car seat are all made in China, according to labels on their packaging. Trump has put new 30% tariffs on goods imported from the country this year.

Graco's parent company, Newell Brands, declined to comment on the price increase at Walmart. In its earnings call in late April, the company, which also owns Yankee Candle, Rubbermaid and other brands, said it has raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%. Most baby gear sold in the U.S. is made in China.

The price of Levi Strauss Signature Jeans for Men increased by a dollar from $23.98 to $24.98 at the Secaucus Walmart, bringing it in line with the cost of similar women's jeans.

On an earnings call in July, the company said it is absorbing some of the tariff costs and anticipates new duties will impact the business by $25 million to $30 million for the rest of the year, or 2 to 3 cents on earnings per share. 

Levi's CFO, Harmit Singh, told CNBC in an interview that most of Levi's goods come from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Goods from all of those countries currently face 10% tariffs, and Trump has proposed higher rates for some of those nations as of Aug. 1.

Tags of the signature jeans sold by Walmart, which came in multiple styles and washes, said they were made in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Lesotho.

Across retailers, prices have increased in some key categories, but their impact hasn't been as dramatic as some feared when Trump implemented new tariffs, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for Circana, a market research company that tracks consumer spending patterns across merchandise categories. Those items with elevated prices include coats and jackets, casual shorts, golf shirts, plush toys, and small household appliances, he said.

Here's how much prices rose in some categories as of the week ended May 31, relative to the week ended March 8, according to Circana data:

Despite some price pressures, consumer spending has held up, Cohen said. Unit sales of food and beverage at retailers are roughly flat in terms of units so far this year, according to Circana's data that runs through July 5 and compares with the year-ago period. Sales of discretionary general merchandise or nonfood items are down by about 1% in units compared with the year-ago period, the firm found.

Early imports and supply chain strategies have helped retailers and brands tamp down on the number and magnitude of tariff-related price increases, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, a major industry trade group. He said many retailers imported goods early after hearing Trump's plans for tariffs on the campaign trail. And he said companies have used U.S. Customs-sanctioned foreign trade zones and so-called bonded warehouses to store goods duty-free until they head to shelves, in the hopes that the tariff rate may fall.

Gold added companies are trying to predict if tariffs may go up or down, which will factor into their costs and their pricing decisions. Tariff levels have remained in flux as Trump delays some duties and announces others.

"Companies are just kind of scratching their heads trying to figure it out," Gold said.

However, there were price decreases at Walmart, too: Mattel-owned Barbie Swim dolls dropped in price from $7.97 to to $5.97. The Barbies are made in Indonesia, according to their packaging. Mattel did not respond to a request about the reasons behind the price drop.

Dolls, including Barbies, are one of the items that have come up in tariff policy debates after Mattel said it may have to raise prices. Trump said that American children "could be very happy" with fewer dolls under his trade proposals.

Tariffs aren't the only dynamic driving prices, however. Some items that are not imported increased or decreased in price, too.

Eggs prices dropped at Walmart. A dozen large eggs from Walmart's Great Value brand dropped in price from $3.47 to $2.72. They show how factors outside of tariffs are affecting consumers' wallets, since egg prices have risen and more recently fallen after an avian flu outbreak spread and then eased.

The price of gallons of Walmart's Great Value milk also rose. And several brands in Walmart's coffee aisle, including its Great Value Donut Shop brand, increased in price.

Coffee has been vulnerable to price rises because of droughts and frost hitting the global coffee supply. On top of that, some of the top suppliers of coffee could face steep tariffs. Trump recently proposed a 50% duty on Brazil, the largest U.S. supplier of green coffee beans and the source for about a third of the country's total supply, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The cost of a 40.3-ounce container of Folgers coffee climbed from $16.43 to $19.24 at the Secaucus Walmart during the time CNBC tracked prices.

J.M. Smucker, which owns coffee brands including Dunkin Donuts and Folgers, did not respond to a request for comment. On an earnings call in June, however, the company told investors that tariffs on coffee were weighing on its profits. Coffee accounts for roughly a third of J.M. Smucker's revenue.

Circana's Cohen said some brands have phased in price increases, hiking them by a more tolerable level of no more than 10% to 12% or focusing on infrequent purchases.

While tariff-related price jumps haven't been as noticeable yet, Cohen said he expects more meaningful increases to come in the upcoming months. He said consumers may feel more of the pinch during the holiday season, since many Christmas decorations and toys are made in China or other parts of Asia.

The Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor who was abruptly fired by the Justice Department as President Donald Trump comes under pressure to release files on Epstein suggested Thursday that she was being targeted by a "tyrant."

"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain," the prosecutor, Maurene Comey, wrote in a farewell note to staff at the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. "Do not let that happen."

"Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought. Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place," she wrote in the note. "A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims."

Comey was fired Wednesday from the U.S. Attorney's Office, where her high-profile prosecutions included cases against Epstein; Epstein's procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell; and Sean "Diddy" Combs.

Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump has considered an enemy since he fired the director in 2017.

Hours before Maurene Comey was fired, Trump lashed out at Republicans who are demanding that the Justice Department release more files about the Epstein case.

"Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bull----,' hook, line, and sinker," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

A number of Trump's supporters have criticized the recent decision by Attorney General Pam Bondi not to release previously undisclosed evidence that was assembled during the Justice Department's investigation of Epstein.

The well-connected financier killed himself in jail in August 2019, a month after he was arrested on federal sex-trafficking charges.

To get ahead at Ring and other Amazon smart-home businesses, you'll need to show your AI chops.

Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who also oversees Amazon's Blink security cameras, Key in-home delivery service, and Sidewalk wireless network, announced on Wednesday that all promotion applications at his RBKS organization must now explain how employees are using AI at work.

Siminoff, who returned to Amazon in April after a 2-year hiatus, said the new policy aims to reward "innovative thinking" and reinforce a culture of speed and efficiency.

"When we combine innovative technology with our missions, we create something truly special," Siminoff wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider.

A Ring spokesperson told BI the changes only apply to Amazon's RBKS employees, and not the rest of the company.

The change underscores a growing trend among tech companies to incorporate AI use into their talent-evaluation process.

Shopify announced in April that managers must prove AI couldn't do a job better before hiring anyone new. Microsoft is asking some managers to evaluate employees based on how they use internal AI tools. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, meanwhile, warned last month that AI will reduce the company's workforce because of efficiency gains.

Siminoff, in his email, said employees seeking a promotion must now describe how they have used generative AI or other AI technologies to improve customer experience or increase operational efficiency. They are also asked to cite specific AI projects they've worked on and the measurable impact achieved.

Those in management positions are also required to show how they used AI tools to accomplish "more with less," while reducing or not growing headcount, according to the email.

"In the spirit of Day 1 culture, we will keep learning, iterating and improving this," Siminoff wrote.

Defense manufacturing startup Hadrian on Thursday announced the closing of $260 million Series C funding round led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Lux Capital.

The machine parts company said it will use the funding to build a new 270,000 square foot factory in Mesa, Arizona, and expand its Torrance, California, location as it looks to beef up its shipbuilding and naval defense capabilities.

"What we really need in this country is this quantum leap above China's manufacturing model," said CEO Chris Power in an interview with CNBC's Morgan Brennan. "It's about supercharging the worker versus replacing them."

Defense tech startups like Hadrian are disrupting the mainstay defense contracting industry, which is led by leaders such as Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, and battling it out to boost U.S. defense production while scooping up Department of Defense contracts.

Hadrian said the Arizona space will be four times the size of its California facility and start operations by Christmas. The factory will create 350 local jobs. The Hawthrone, California-based company said it is working on four to five new facilities to support production over the next year to support Department of Defense needs.

Hadrian said it uses robotics and artificial intelligence to automate factories that can "supercharge American workers."

Power said demand is rapidly growing, but the lack of U.S.-based talent is a major hurdle to building American dominance in shipbuilding and submarines.

Using its tools, the company said it can train workers within 30 days, making them 10 times more productive. Its workforce includes ex-marines and former nurses who have never set foot in a factory.

"We have to do a lot more ... but certainly we're able to keep up with the scale right now, and grateful to our team and customers for letting us go and do that," he said. "As a country, we have to treat this like a national security crisis, not just the economics of manufacturing."

The fresh raise also includes investments from Andreessen Horowitz and new stakeholders such as Brad Gerstner's Altimeter Capital.

The company closed a $92 million funding round in late 2023.

Amazon laid off employees in its cloud-computing unit, the company confirmed on Thursday, and employees are trying to piece together the details in internal messages.

Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the company is laying off employees in AWS, but did not specify which teams were affected or how many employees were cut.

Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest the affected teams include frontline support, training and certification, and the AWS Worldwide Specialist Organization, which works with customers and product teams. Some of the employees who wrote on Slack that they were laid off said their roles included work on marketing, analytics, and even generative AI. Amazon did not respond to a request to confirm.

"After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said. "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers."

The cuts come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains." Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, said the cuts aren't primarily due to AI and the company has thousands of job listings posted in areas it deems more strategic.

Glasser also said U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, and will be eligible for a severance payment. The company has yet to respond to a request about what makes an employee eligible.

Amazon is laying off some staffers in its cloud computing division, the company confirmed Thursday.

"After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in a statement. "We didn't make these decisions lightly, and we're committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition."

The company declined to say which units within Amazon Web Services were impacted, or how many employees will be let go as a result of the job cuts.

AWS' training and certification unit was one of the groups to see cuts, according to a memo sent out by division head Michelle Vaz and viewed by CNBC.

Reuters was first to report on the layoffs.

In May, Amazon reported a third straight quarterly revenue miss at AWS. Sales increased 17% to $29.27 billion in the first quarter, slowing from 18.9% in the prior period.

Amazon said the cuts weren't primarily due to investments in artificial intelligence, but are a result of ongoing efforts to streamline the workforce and refocus on certain priorities. The company said it continues to hire within AWS.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a cost-cutting mission for the past several years, which has resulted in more than 27,000 employees being let go since 2022. Job reductions have continued this year, though at a smaller scale than preceding years. Amazon's stores, communications, and devices and services divisions have been hit with layoffs in recent months.

AWS last year cut hundreds of jobs in its physical stores technology and sales and marketing units.

Last month, Jassy predicted that Amazon's corporate workforce could shrink even further as a result of the company embracing generative AI.

"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," Jassy told staffers. "It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce."

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company CEO C.C. Wei on Thursday said the company is seeing "strong interest" from its leading U.S. customers and is working to speed up its volume production schedule by several quarters.

TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, and the company has pledged to invest a total of $165 billion in advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. The company shared updates to its global manufacturing plans during its second-quarter earnings call on Thursday.

"TSMC will continue to play a critical and integral role in enabling our customers' success, while also maintain a key partner and network of the U.S. semiconductor industry," Wei said on the call.

As part of its investment in the U.S., TSMC is building six advanced wafer manufacturing fabrication facilities in Arizona, two advanced packaging fabrication facilities and an R&D center. 

Wei said the first fabrication facility in Arizona is already complete, the second has been built and construction is underway at the third.

The company reported $31.7 billion in revenue for the period, as well as nearly a 61% rise in profit year over year, hitting a record high and beating estimates.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened steep "reciprocal tariffs" of 32% in Taiwan, but the country is carrying out trade talks with the U.S., according to local media reports. Trump warned of potential additional tariffs on semiconductors earlier this month.

"Looking into second half of 2025, we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far," Wei said. "However, we understand the uncertainties and risk from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially on consumer-related and the price-sensitive, end-market segment."

Mark Zuckerberg and current and former directors and officers of Meta Platforms agreed on Thursday to settle claims seeking $8 billion for the damage they allegedly caused the company by allowing repeated violations of Facebook users' privacy, a lawyer for the shareholders told a Delaware judge on Thursday.

The parties did not disclose details of the settlement and defense lawyers did not address the judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery. McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day and she congratulated the parties.

The plaintiffs' lawyer, Sam Closic, said the agreement just came together quickly.

Billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a defendant in the trial and a Meta director, was scheduled to testify on Thursday.

Shareholders of Meta sued Zuckerberg, Andreessen and other former company officials including former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in hopes of holding them liable for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company paid in recent years.

The Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019 after finding that it failed to comply with a 2012 agreement with the regulator to protect users' data.

The shareholders wanted the 11 defendants to use their personal wealth to reimburse the company. The defendants denied the allegations, which they called "extreme claims."

Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. The company was not a defendant.

The company declined to comment. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"This settlement may bring relief to the parties involved, but it's a missed opportunity for public accountability," said Jason Kint, the head of Digital Content Next, a trade group for content providers.

Zuckerberg was expected to take the stand on Monday and Sandberg on Wednesday. The trial was scheduled to run through the end of next week.

The case was also expected to include testimony from former Facebook board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix.

Meta investors alleged in the lawsuit that former and current board members completely failed to oversee the company's compliance with the 2012 FTC agreement and claim that Zuckerberg and Sandberg knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation.

The case followed revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. Those revelations led to the FTC fine, which was a record at the time.

On Wednesday, an expert witness for the plaintiffs testified about what he called "gaps and weaknesses" in Facebook's privacy policies but would not say if the company violated the 2012 agreement that Facebook reached with the FTC.

Jeffrey Zients, a former board member, testified on Wednesday that the company did not agree to the FTC fine to spare Zuckerberg legal liability, as shareholders allege.

On its website, the company has said it has invested billions of dollars into protecting user privacy since 2019.

The trial would have been a rare opportunity for Meta investors to see Zuckerberg answer probing questions under oath. In 2017, Zuckerberg was expected to testify at a trial involving a lawsuit by company investors opposed to his plan to issue a special class of Facebook stock that would have extended his control over that company. That case also settled before he took the stand.

"Facebook has successfully remade the 'Cambridge Analytica' scandal about a few bad actors rather than an unraveling of its entire business model of surveillance capitalism and the reciprocal, unbridled sharing of personal data," Kint said. "That reckoning is now left unresolved."

If you've worked with Gen Z — or managed them — you've probably seen it: that facial expression that somehow manages to mix disdain, defiance, and utter disinterest all in one (oddly) blank look.

It's been dubbed the "Gen Z stare," and it's the facial equivalent of an eye-roll. Managers everywhere are letting out a sigh of relief because, finally, there's a name for the behavior that's left them scratching their heads since "quiet quitting" became a badge of honor during the pandemic.

I've been studying intergenerational dynamics in the workplace for years as the director of the NYU Stern Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing, and even among academics (who tend to avoid stereotyping generations), there's an unspoken consensus: Older managers find Gen Z ... well, frustrating.

When I first heard about the stare on TikTok, I thought: That just about sums it up. But then I remembered something else that does, too — a striking data point from my own research.

As part of my research, we developed a scientifically validated tool called The Values Bridge, which ranks an individual's core values from 1 to 15. Since May, over 30,000 people have taken the test. (You can take it yourself here.)

While we are in the process of publishing conclusive findings on generational differences in values, early statistical trends are emerging strongly, and I have come to believe one of them explains The Gen Z Stare all too well.

Gen Z ranks Achievement, defined as the desire to be seen as successful or impressive, shockingly low. On average, they place it 11th out of 15 values. Even more telling? 65% of Gen Z respondents say Achievement already plays too much of a role in their lives.

Let that sink in. Not only is Gen Z less motivated by winning, competition, and status — they're actively pushing it away.

The stare usually shows up at work when a Gen Z employee is asked to do something, or told there's something they don't yet know but need to.

They rarely respond with words. But if the expression could talk, it might say: "Don't impose your value of Achievement on me, boss. I don't want it near me already, and I'd have less of your workaholic, winner-take-all BS in my life if I could."

Yes, I'm generalizing. But I've heard versions of that sentiment countless times from the thousands of Gen Zers I've interviewed and surveyed. In a recent college focus group I ran, one student asked me, "Not to be confrontational, but … why does business need to win all the time?"

That same group ranked Achievement as a bottom-tier value. So what does Gen Z value? Instead of Achievement, they are leaning into values like Eudaimonia (which we define as self-care and inner balance) or Voice (our term for self-expression and authenticity).

According to our early results, up to 85% of Gen Z respondents rank one of those two values in their top five.

During the "quiet quitting" wave, companies scrambled to accommodate Gen Z's demand for boundaries and better work-life balance. This time, I'm not so sure the workplace will bend so quickly.

Here's why: AI is reshaping the labor market. Official employment numbers might look steady, but anecdotally, the job market feels different, especially for early-career workers. It's shifting from a buyer's market to a seller's market, and employers are noticing.

Many hiring managers, the same ones who now finally have a label for this phenomenon, are starting to adjust their filters. Achievement-driven candidates might have once been seen as overly ambitious. Now? They're the ones companies will chase.

There may not be many Gen Zers out there who value Achievement, but managers are likely going to be looking for them now more than ever.

And one way they will know them is by how they look back.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has formally terminated $4 billion in federal funding for the California High-Speed Rail Authority, weeks after putting the CHSRA's bullet train project on notice.

In a termination letter to the authority's CEO, Ian Choudri, dated Wednesday, Federal Railroad Administration acting Administrator Drew Feeley wrote that the CHSRA "breached the commitments" it made in its original agreements, specifically by displaying an "inability to complete" the goals it set out to reach.

"After over a decade of failures, CHSRA's mismanagement and incompetence has proven it cannot build its train to nowhere on time or on budget," Duffy said in a statement. "It's time for this boondoggle to die."

The railroad authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a social media post, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will be "exploring all options to fight this illegal action."

President Donald Trump praised his administration's work in terminating the project in a Truth Social post Wednesday night, calling Newsom "incompetent."

"The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will," Trump wrote. "This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED."

The high-speed rail efforts began in 2009 with the goal of building a train that could travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco in under three hours. Newsom trimmed that vision a decade later, setting out to connect just a 170-mile stretch of land between Merced and Bakersfield.

The current iteration of the project was projected to cost around $22 billion, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, with a projected end date of 2033.

A June report produced by the Trump administration concluded that the project had "no viable path" to completion, and alleged breaches of its federal contracts, including overdue deadlines and funding gaps.

The railroad system told CNBC at the time that most of the project's funding is provided by the state, not the federal government.

A 21-year-old from Boston thinks the "Gen Z stare" is overblown. A 20-year-old from the Bay Area said she sees it all the time. A 17-year-old heard from her parents that she had been inadvertently doing it.

Conversations with seven Gen Zers indicate young people are divided on the idea that their generation often responds to questions with blank, wide-eyed stares, as many millennials on TikTok have gleefully suggested.

Some told Business Insider they flatly rejected the idea that there is such a thing as the "Gen Z stare" — others said they'd seen it firsthand.

Those who said there could be some truth to it floated potential contributing factors, such as the lingering effects of COVID lockdowns, an adolescence spent online, or simply being high.

While not everyone agreed, they all had thoughts on the viral debate.

So listen up, millennials. It's time to pass Gen Z the mic.

On a recent visit to Coldstone Creamery, Brenda Alarcon asked a young worker for their favorite flavor. The employee stared back. "The transaction was made with minimal words," Alarcon said.

Alarcon said she'd seen the "Gen Z stare" in professional settings, too. At a recent networking event, she noticed that the other Gen Z networkers would "freeze up."

"I'm the one that's keeping the conversation going," she said. "It's not just one time, it's multiple."

She has her suspicions as to the root cause. The COVID-19 pandemic is an obvious answer, she said. Another theory stems from her earlier days as a waitress, when she would serve blank-looking young customers.

"It's because they hit their pen," she said, referencing the slim THC oil vape pens that have become popular in the past five years.

Trinity Starr Rutledge said she thought the trend was "pretty stupid." Working as a cashier and desk assistant, she's had many millennials stare back at her requests at small talk.

"I think you're just talking to a rude person," Starr Rutledge said. "I don't think it's right to label our generation as people who have this stare."

To the millennials posting about the stare, Starr Rutledge had a message: "It's not our fault that we're cooler."

Megan Easton said she accepts the idea that her generation is more socially awkward than the others, especially the younger members of Gen Z who grew up on social media. (At 26, Easton identifies as a "zillennial.") Still, Easton said she mostly believes her generation's stare is an air of nonchalance.

"It comes from a lack of caring as much what people think," Easton said. "Where an older generation might think it's rude or not socially acceptable, Gen Z is more to the point, and their humor's a little drier."

Easton said the stare shouldn't make older generations think Gen Z is "disrespectful or unintelligent." It's merely a difference in how different generations communicate, she said.

Lindsey Cook likes to start her interactions with Gen Z baristas by saying, "I'm ready to order when you are — no rush." That way, if the barista does have social anxiety, it allows them to work on their own timeline and not just stare back.

"It's very uncomfortable," Cook said. "Things need to be relearned now that we're resuming life as normal as possible after COVID."

Online, some young people have retorted that small talk isn't mandatory or that they didn't consent to a conversation. "But when they take a job in hospitality or customer service, it's their job to make people feel welcome," Cook said.

Emerson Hubbard thought she was too nervous to give off a "Gen Z stare." Then, she talked about it with her parents.

"I was talking to my family today, and they were like, 'You have done it before,'" Hubbard said. "I get it. Sometimes I just zone out in the conversation, and I'm just staring at them."

Hubbard said she doesn't think of the stare as much of a problem. She sees a "one-sided" debate between millennials and Gen Z, she said, especially in her TikTok comments, where a lot of millennials are "going ham."

Eli Toy was raised by Gen Xers, not millennials. Toy said that she's "open to conversation" — but that other Gen Zers might be less fluent in small talk because of that generational difference.

"From what I've seen, a lot of Gen Zers that were raised by millennials had more technology in their childhoods, so that could impact it," Toy said. "The biggest tech I had was a pink Nintendo."

Netta Dar has seen the "Gen Z stare" before.

She referenced the character April Ludgate from the TV show "Parks and Recreation," who often stared down her colleagues with non-responses. Interestingly enough, April, played by actor Aubrey Plaza, is a millennial in the show.

That could suggest the "Gen Z stare" isn't specific to Gen Z, but to people who are still developing their social skills.

While Dar hasn't seen the stare among her college-age friends, she said she had noticed some social awkwardness in her younger sister's friends.

"It definitely depends on the age as well, and how far along you are in your development, where the frontal lobe is at," Dar said.

Tech companies are fiercely competing to build the best AI coding tools — and for xAI, the top rival to beat seems to be Anthropic.

Elon Musk's AI company used contractors to train Grok on coding tasks with the goal of topping a popular AI leaderboard, and explicitly told them they wanted it to outperform Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet tool, documents obtained by Business Insider show.

The contractors, hired through Scale AI's Outlier platform, were assigned a project to "hillclimb" Grok's ranking on WebDev Arena, an influential leaderboard from LMArena that pits AI models against each other in web development challenges, with users voting for the winner.

"We want to make the in-task model the #1 model" for LMArena, reads one Scale AI onboarding doc that was active in early July, according to one contractor who worked on the project. Contractors were told to generate and refine front-end code for user interface prompts to "beat Sonnet 3.7 Extended," a reference to Anthropic's Claude model.

xAI did not reply to a BI request for comment.

In the absence of universally agreed-upon standards, leaderboard rankings and benchmark scores have become the AI industry's unofficial scoreboard.

For labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, topping these rankings can help attract funding, new customers, lucrative contracts, and media attention.

Anthropic's Claude, which has multiple models, is considered one of the leading players for AI coding and consistently ranks near the top of many leaderboards, often alongside Google and OpenAI.

Anthropic cofounder Benn Mann said on the "No Priors" podcast last month that other companies had declared "code reds" to try to match Claude's coding abilities, and he was surprised that other models hadn't caught up. Competitors like Meta are using Anthropic's coding tools internally, BI previously reported.

The Scale AI dashboard and project instructions did not specify which version of Grok the project was training, though it was in use days before the newest model, Grok 4, came out on July 9.

On Tuesday, LMArena ranked Grok 4 in 12th place for web development. Models from Anthropic ranked in joint first, third, and fourth.

The day after Grok 4's launch, Musk posted on X claiming that the new model "works better than Cursor" at fixing code, referring to the popular AI-assisted developer tool.

You can cut & paste your entire source code file into the query entry box on https://t.co/EqiIFyHFlo and @Grok 4 will fix it for you! This is what everyone @xAI does. Works better than Cursor.

In a comment to BI, Scale AI said it does not overfit models by training them directly on a test set. The company said it never copies or reuses public benchmark data for large language model training and told BI it was engaging in a "standard data generation project using public signals to close known performance gaps."

Anastasios Angelopoulos, the CEO of LMArena, told BI that while he wasn't aware of the specific Scale project, hiring contractors to help AI models climb public leaderboards is standard industry practice.

"This is part of the standard workflow of model training. You need to collect data to improve your model," Angelopoulos said, adding that it's "not just to do well in web development, but in any benchmark."

The industry's focus on AI leaderboards can drive intense — and not always fair — competition.

Sara Hooker, the head of Cohere Labs and one of the authors of "The Leaderboard Illusion," a paper published by researchers from universities including MIT and Stanford, told BI that "when a leaderboard is important to a whole ecosystem, the incentives are aligned for it to be gamed."

In April, after Meta's Llama 4 model shot up to second place on LM Arena, developers noticed that the model variant that Meta used for public benchmarking was different from the version released to the public. This sparked accusations from AI researchers that Meta was gaming the leaderboard.

Meta denied the claims, saying the variant in question was experimental and that evaluating multiple versions of a model is standard practice.

Although xAI's project with Scale AI asked contractors to help "hillclimb" the LMArena rankings, there is no evidence that they were gaming the leaderboard.

Leaderboard dominance doesn't always translate into real-world ability. Shivalika Singh, another author of the paper, told BI that "doing well on the Arena doesn't result in generally good performance" or guarantee strong results on other benchmarks.

Overall, Grok 4 ranked in the top three for LMArena's core categories of math, coding, and "Hard Prompts."

However, early data from Yupp, a new crowdsourced leaderboard and LMArena rival, showed that Grok 4 ranked 66 out of more than 100 models, highlighting the variance between leaderboards.

Nate Jones, an AI strategist and product leader with a widely read newsletter, said he found Grok's actual abilities often lagged behind its leaderboard hype.

"Grok 4 crushed some flashy benchmarks, but when the rubber met the road in my tests this week Grok 4 stumbled hard," he wrote in his Substack on Monday. "The moment we set leaderboard dominance as the goal, we risk creating models that excel in trivial exercises and flounder when facing reality."

Uber is turning to Lucid as it looks to play catch-up in the robotaxi wars.

More than four and a half years after Uber sold off its autonomous vehicle division, the company is investing $300 million into Lucid as part of a new robotaxi deal.

Lucid will make the vehicles for Uber's robotaxis, based on its Gravity EV. Uber is also partnering with self-driving technology company Nuro, which will power the autonomous driving capabilities. Uber expects the tech to launch "later next year in a major US city."

"Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better," said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. "We're thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world."

Lucid's stock price jumped more than 43% in pre-market trading following news of the partnership, while Uber's stock price was slightly up before the opening bell.

Uber said it plans to deploy a fleet of 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. The company said its first prototype is "already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds."

The robotaxi wars have been heating up over the last year, with market leader Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, operating autonomous rides in multiple states.

Tesla launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi program in Austin earlier this summer. While the cars drive themselves, Tesla employees still ride in the vehicles with passengers for safety reasons.

Lyft also plans to launch rides with AVs in Dallas as soon as next year, TechCrunch reported in February.

Uber agreed to sell its autonomous vehicle division to startup Aurora in December 2020. At the time, it was grappling with a pandemic-induced downturn in its ride-hailing business.

Since then, Uber has offered rides in autonomous vehicles in Atlanta and Austin through a partnership with Waymo. Riders can request a ride in an AV through Uber's app in those cities.

If adopted widely, robotaxis would present a way for Uber and other ridesharing services to bypass human drivers. In January, Khosrowshahi said that Uber doesn't expect robotaxis to replace the company's gig-worker drivers for the next decade.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

The value of cryptocurrencies stolen by criminals surged in the first six months of 2025 after a high-profile hack and a wave of physical attacks targeting crypto holders and their relatives.

So far this year, $2.17 billion has been stolen from crypto services — already eclipsing the $1.87 billion of funds stolen from platforms in 2024 — and this is expected to reach $4 billion by the end of 2025, according to a report published Thursday by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.

Overall, the combined value of digital tokens stolen from both crypto platforms and individuals hit more than $2.8 billion and is already approaching the $3.4 billion in crypto stolen last year.

The bulk of the funds stolen from services came from February's cyberattack on Dubai crypto exchange Bybit, which saw North Korea-linked hackers make off with $1.5 billion. It's estimated to be the largest crypto heist in history.

However, the rise in stolen crypto assets was also driven by a spike in attacks on individual crypto wallets. Personal wallets accounted for over 23% of total thefts, with attackers increasingly turning to physical violence and coercion to access funds, Chainalysis said.

In January, David Balland, a co-founder of crypto wallet firm Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France. Before they were freed, the attackers cut off Balland's finger and sent footage of it to his fellow co-founder Eric Larcheveque demanding ransom money.

Separately, in May, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was taken in broad daylight by four men wearing ski masks. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros and cut off one of the man's fingers. He was freed by police days later.

Eric Jardine, cybercrimes research lead at Chainalysis, told CNBC that the rise in crypto-related thefts was primarily being driven by increasing crypto adoption and price appreciation.

"Adoption means there are more services and users in the crypto ecosystem, making thefts more common. Price appreciation means that services and individuals in crypto have more USD value to lose, even if the total assets stolen are relatively constant over time," Jardine said via email.

Jardine suggested that the uptick in attacks on individual crypto holders could relate to the fact that crypto trading services are beefing up their security.

"If services become better at security, malicious actors will potentially move to targeting individual wallet holders and trade off a single large-scale heist in favor of a large number of smaller-scale victimizations," he said.

Meanwhile, rising wealth accumulated through holdings of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has resulted in a rise in crypto influencers flaunting their lifestyle on social media platforms.

Jardine stressed it was important not to blame the victims of physical crypto-related attacks, adding that "showy displays of wealth can quite obviously attract the attention of a bad actor when compared to a more modest outward facing lifestyle."

Shares of high fructose corn syrup producer Archer-Daniels-Midland fell on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced that he had persuaded Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its drinks in the U.S.

"I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so. I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola," the president wrote in a Truth Social post published Wednesday.

"This will be a very good move by them — You'll see. It's just better!" Trump also wrote.

ADM shares were down close to 1%. But the stock tumbled as much as 6% in the premarket on the comments. Global ingredients provider Ingredion shares were 0.6% lower, but that stock fell as much as 7% before the market's open.

The move comes as ADM's stock has seen gains over the past few months, having risen about 12% over the last three. It's jumped 6% in 2025.

When asked about Trump's announcement, Coca-Cola did not explicitly agree to the change.

"We appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm for our iconic Coca-Cola brand," the company said in a statement. "More details on new innovative offerings within our Coca-Cola product range will be shared soon."

Coca-Cola shares rose almost 2% on Thursday. That put its year-to-date climb at more than 13%, outperforming the broader market.

Meanwhile, the Corn Refiners Association, an industry trade group, issued a statement warning about the potential job losses that could follow such a switch.

"Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar doesn't make sense," John Bode, the group's president and CEO, said. "President Trump stands for American manufacturing jobs, American farmers, and reducing the trade deficit. Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit."

The Trump administration has previously called on food companies to reformulate products. Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told executives that he wants "the worst ingredients" out of food.

"Food and beverage is super important, and it's normal that governments pay attention to what people eat and drink," PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." He noted 60% of the company's U.S. beverages don't have corn syrup and instead either have sugar or no sugar.

The Coca-Cola rival plans to remove artificial ingredients from its Lays and Tostitos brands by the end of the year, Laguarta said.

"Sugar is more expensive in the U.S. than in many parts of the world, so I think there is a conversation with the government probably on how do we make sugar more affordable in the U.S., how do we have a farming strategy probably that reduces the cost of sugar and that will facilitate a lot of the transition for us [and] for the whole industry," the CEO continued. "We have choices for the consumer, which, at the end, that's what we as a responsible company need to do in the marketplace."

Raw sugar futures popped on the heels of Trump's announcement.

Thanks to President Donald Trump, your retirement plan could soon include a mix of stocks, bonds—and private equity investments.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Trump is expected to sign an executive order in the coming days allowing 401(k) plans to invest their assets in private equity.

It's a proposal that's raising red flags among some investment experts, who say a 401(k) should typically be a simple and relatively low-risk investment vehicle. Private equity investments, meanwhile, are often concentrated in a small number of portfolio companies, illiquid, and carry valuations that can be difficult to measure day-to-day. They're also much less liquid than stocks and bonds.

Trump's green light doesn't come as a surprise to those monitoring the private equity space, but it's concerning nonetheless.

"Private equity kind of always gets what it wants in Congress, but I think it's a bad idea," Jeffrey Hooke, professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, said. "It's illiquid, the fees are very high. Private equity funds, for the most part, don't beat the stock market."

"I don't think it's a good investment for the rank and file retail market," Hooke added.

The push to include private equity in retirement plans is just the latest development in a long-running trend of combining public and private markets.

The private equity industry experienced explosive growth during the pandemic as firms bought up portfolio companies with cheap debt. But now, as higher rates stymie private equity dealmaking, firms are eyeing a liquidity opportunity: gaining access to the $12 trillion 401(k) market.

Brian Payne, chief private markets and alternatives strategist at BCA Research, described this development as "an exit ramp for the current situation going on for private equity."

Traditional exit opportunities — such as selling to a public company, another private equity firm, or going public — have dried up.

According to a PwC analysis, between 4,000 to 6,500 private equity exits have been delayed in the last two years, and the firm believes funds will soon be forced to sell off their portfolio companies as limited partners demand capital distributions.

As a result, private equity firms have been lobbying the Trump administration for access to retirement vehicles. It won't just be private equity looking for retail exposure — Hooke expects other alternatives like private credit and real estate to follow suit.

Private equity tends to generates higher returns than the market as a result of the illiquid nature of the asset class, as investments can be locked up for a decade or longer. Retail investors require more liquidity, which will eat into private equity returns over the long term, according to Payne.

Private equity investments also come with steep management fees that could decrease returns.

"It'll make the retirement plans suboptimal," Hooke said. "When people retire 20 to 30 years after investing in private equity, returns are going to be a little less than one would expect."

While retirement vehicles typically have longer timelines, reducing the need for immediate liquidity, Payne sees a risk if an economic downturn increases unemployment and forces more people to tap into their 401(k)s.

Moody's Investors Service recently raised a similar concern, noting that retail investor participation in the private markets poses systemic risks.

While Payne and Hooke are skeptical about the increased presence of private equity in retail portfolios, it's unlikely that private equity will comprise a large portion of people's retirement plans. Experts project around 10% of retirement assets could go toward private equity over time, which means Americans will probably be shielded from dramatic price swings.

Glenn Schorr, senior research analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note on Wednesday that corporate sponsors may also be hesitant to invest in private equity vehicles.

However, mixing complicated assets like private equity into retirement vehicles is certainly a risky choice.

"When you get retail involved in opaque markets, with very different liquidity structures, very different risk, and ultimately different assets and strategies, it doesn't end well," Payne said.

Amazon's Ring division is re-embracing founder mode, part of a broader cultural and operational crackdown by CEO Andy Jassy.

In April, Ring founder Jamie Siminoff rejoined Amazon to run the internet-based doorbell company again. He replaced former CEO Liz Hamren.

Just months into his return, Siminoff is making sweeping changes.

One of his first moves: scrapping Ring's socially driven mission — "Keep people close to what's important" — which Amazon introduced last year.

In its place, Siminoff reinstated Ring's original mission statement, "Make neighborhoods safer," which suggests the business is going back to its founding identity as a crime-prevention tool.

"So excited to be back working on our mission to make neighborhoods safer!" Siminoff wrote in a companywide email on his second day back. A copy of the memo was viewed by Business Insider.

The shift marks the beginning of a broader reset led by Siminoff, who returned after a two-year hiatus. Alongside the mission reboot, he's pushing for faster execution, greater efficiency, and a deeper reliance on AI, according to internal emails and conversations with current and former employees. These individuals asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to discuss internal matters.

Ring's transformation reflects broader shifts within Amazon, where Jassy emphasizes productivity and cost-efficiency across the sprawling e-commerce and cloud giant. Other Big Tech companies, from Google and Meta to Microsoft, are making similar changes.

"We are reimagining Ring from the ground up with AI first," Siminoff wrote in a recent email to staff. "It feels like the early days again — same energy and the same potential to revolutionize how we do our neighborhood safety."

A Ring spokesperson declined to comment.

While Siminoff was away, Ring softened its public image under Hamren's leadership. The company leaned into a more community-focused brand and distanced itself from the surveillance tools that previously sparked privacy concerns.

Hamren retired a controversial feature that allowed law enforcement to request footage from Ring users through the Neighbors app and introduced a more approachable mission statement last year.

Now, Siminoff is rolling back much of that vision, steering Ring back to its original role as a neighborhood crime watchdog.

As part of that pivot, Ring announced a partnership with Axon in April that effectively revives the video-request feature for police. The company is also exploring a new integration with Axon that would enable livestreaming from Ring devices for those who consent, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Privacy and civil liberties groups have criticized Ring's video-sharing capabilities, citing a lack of transparency and concerns about unethical use. In 2023, Amazon agreed to a $5.8 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations of privacy violations. Amazon denied wrongdoing.

Several Ring employees told BI they remain uneasy about the partnership with Axon, which is famous for making Tasers, which are used by law enforcement to zap people with electric shocks.

These Ring employees said customers may not don't fully understand what they're opting into, and it's unclear how video footage will ultimately be used. Data security also remains a concern, they added.

Siminoff's influence is also showing up in Ring's product roadmap and internal policies.

The long-delayed home surveillance drone, originally unveiled in 2020, is expected to launch soon, according to people familiar with the plans. Siminoff has been testing the drone in the office, though it's likely to debut in limited quantities, they said.

In June, Ring introduced a new text alert feature that provides real-time updates about activity captured by its devices. According to a recent internal email, Siminoff told employees the alerts would soon be refined to notify users only when "something unusual happens."

"My vision has always been that Ring would help super power our neighborhoods for good," Siminoff wrote in an April email.

Siminoff, who founded Ring in 2011, sold the company to Amazon in 2018 for about $1 billion. His official title now is VP of product, but he signs off his emails as Ring's "Chief Inventor and Founder."

In practice, he oversees not only Ring but also Amazon's Blink security cameras, Key in-home delivery service, and the Sidewalk wireless network. Ring doesn't have a formal CEO anymore.

When Siminoff returned, some staffers were apprehensive about changes he might make. That concern was reinforced when he introduced a new travel policy in April requiring employees to email the company about the purpose of each business trip. He cited high travel costs and said the emails would serve as documentation when "auditing things."

After some employees pushed back, Siminoff doubled down in a follow-up message, reaffirming the policy. That second time, he pointed to a recent Jassy annual shareholder letter, which emphasized building a culture that encourages employees to ask "why" as a path to smarter decision-making.

"If we all keep doing this, I am certain we will be able to have such a bigger impact on the world," Siminoff wrote.

Since his return, Siminoff has also made changes to Ring's leadership and operations. In late April, Chief Product Officer Mike Harris and Chief Technology Officer Mike Balog both exited. In their place, Siminoff brought back longtime lieutenant Jason Mitura to lead the product and technology teams across Ring, Blink, and Sidewalk, according to an internal email.

Siminoff has also consolidated Rings office footprint for "speed" and "efficiency." Ring's Santa Monica office is shutting down, while Amazon's Hawthorne and Amsterdam locations have become headquarters for the combined Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk teams.

Internally, Siminoff has scrapped Ring's monthly all-hands meetings and replaced them with a steady stream of companywide emails. Many of these messages focus on eliminating bureaucracy and encouraging creativity with AI.

In April, he launched a dedicated inbox where employees could submit new ideas (something Jassy has also done since becoming CEO of Amazon). While praising some of the more unconventional submissions, Siminoff also urged employees to vet their ideas through AI tools first to avoid duplication, and to consider the resources required and messaging clarity before pitching.

Siminoff has made it clear that AI will be central to Ring's future.

Starting in the third quarter, every promotion will have to prove that the employee used AI to improve operational efficiency or customer experiences, according to a recent email. They will also have to explain how they "accomplished more with less," the email said.

In mid-June, Siminoff also encouraged employees to use AI at least once a day to improve productivity. The following day, he circulated a memo from Jassy that warned job cuts could result from AI-driven efficiencies.

"If we all lean in on AI, could we launch 10% or 10 times more shit?" Siminoff asked in a recent email. "My guess is if we really all fully leaned in on AI and pushed ourselves hard to create constraints that only could be overcome with the use of AI, we could double our output immediately."

Not all of Siminoff's communications focus on technology. In one instance, he addressed a cultural issue: the excessive use of acronyms in meetings.

He noted that acronyms often obscure meaning and slow down decision-making.

"The best thing we can do is use data and clear language," he wrote. "It allows for faster and more accurate decisions."

There's one thing that former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce will never say to his wife, Kylie Kelce.

"I have never ever, and I will never ever, tell Kylie to do something around the house, because, I don't know, she does enough," Kelce said on the Wednesday episode of the "New Heights" podcast, which he cohosts with his brother, Travis Kelce.

"If something doesn't get done, it's like, yeah, well, I should be helping out on this. Tell me what I can do because I am worthless unless you tell me that," Kelce said.

Kelce has been married to his wife since 2018, and they share four daughters: Wyatt, Elliotte, Bennett, and Finnley, who was born in March.

While he will never tell his wife what to do, he doesn't mind if the roles are reversed. In fact, the retired NFL player says he responds to being nagged at "really well."

"Tell me to get my lazy ass up, and take the goddamn trash out. If you tell me to take the trash out, I'm not going to be like, 'Oh, I can't believe she's telling me to take the trash out.' I'm like, 'Yeah, you're right. I should be doing that. OK, I'm sorry,'" he said.

Kelce says he "likes the nagging" and needs it because he can be forgetful sometimes.

"She's like, 'Jason, I don't want to tell you to do these things.' And I'm like, 'I get that. I'm just like, you know, it's not going to get done unless you tell me to do it,'" Kelce said.

"I am pro-nagging. I think nagging is a great thing to do," he added.

After all, Kelce says he's used to being told what to do after years of playing on the field.

"I like coaching. I've been coached my whole life. I want people to tell me. I need that," Kelce said.

Kelce's comments highlight a common relationship challenge: dividing responsibilities without resentment.

Splitting household chores 50/50 with a partner might not be the most effective, per couples therapist Lori Gottlieb.

"You can't treat a relationship like a spreadsheet. It has to be more organic than that. Each couple needs to find their own rhythm, where each person is participating in a way that makes you both feel like you're getting a good deal," Gottlieb told Jo Piazza, author of "How to Be Married."

In a personal essay for Business Insider, Melissa Petro wrote that she and her husband struggled with an uneven division of household chores until the pandemic prompted them to ditch traditional gender roles and switch to a shared family to-do list.

In another personal essay for BI, Maria Polansky wrote that she and her husband divide household chores based on the tasks they both enjoy and care about most — a method that's worked well for them.

A representative for Kelce did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by BI outside regular hours.

Oops, something went wrong

House passes Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, blocks digital dollar rollout originally appeared on TheStreet.

The House of Representatives has officially passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a sweeping bill designed to block the Federal Reserve from issuing or testing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) without explicit congressional approval. The move signals strong Republican resistance to what they view as a potential tool for state surveillance.

A CBDC is a digital form of a country's national currency, issued and backed directly by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and controlled by the government.

They are designed to function like cash but in digital form — with potential for programmability, surveillance, and tighter monetary control.

The House of Representatives passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act by a narrow vote of 219–217, making it the third major crypto bill to clear the chamber during what's being called Crypto Week in Washington.

Join the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.

With the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act now passed, this marks the third major crypto bill cleared by the House during Crypto Week, following the CLARITY Act (defining digital assets as securities or commodities) and the GENIUS Act (establishing rules for stablecoins).

The bill, introduced by Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), prohibits the Fed from directly or indirectly issuing a CBDC to individuals. As outlined in the bill, a Federal Reserve bank “shall not offer products or services directly to an individual,” nor “maintain an account on behalf of an individual.” Additionally, the Fed is barred from creating any digital currency that is “substantially similar under any other name or label.”

Notably, the act also prohibits the use of a CBDC as a monetary policy tool. It states: “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall not use any central bank digital currency… to implement monetary policy.” This restriction reflects broader fears that a programmable digital dollar could grant the government intrusive control over individual financial activity.

The bill also offers protections for open, permissionless, and private dollar-denominated currencies, ensuring they remain outside the scope of the restrictions. It explicitly bans the Fed from running CBDC pilot programs or testing initiatives without future Congressional approval.

The legislation now moves to the Senate, where its future remains uncertain.

Hong Kong police have arrested four individuals in connection with an alleged cryptocurrency investment ring that defrauded victims of over 3 million Hong Kong dollars. The operation was linked to a bogus platform posing as affiliated with the Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX). However, the alleged ringleader escaped and publicly mocked victims for their supposed lack of intelligence in falling for the scam.

The arrests are part of a wider fallout from the collapse of the so-called “DGCX XinKangJia” platform in mainland China. On June 25, the platform abruptly froze withdrawals for its 2 million users. By the next day, it had gone completely offline.

Marketed as the Chinese branch of the Dubai organization, XinKangJia promised investors 1% fixed daily returns on USDT-denominated investments in gold and oil. Before shutting down, the platform allegedly transferred around 1.8 billion USDT (roughly 13 billion yuan) through Tornado Cash to offshore wallets, according to blockchain security firm SlowMist.

The scheme employed a paramilitary-style pyramid structure, dividing members into nine ranks from “squad leader” to “commander.” Users were encouraged to recruit new investors to climb ranks and earn USDT bonuses.

On July 7, authorities in Taojiang County, Hunan Province, officially classified the platform as a suspected case of fundraising fraud and illegal network-based pyramid selling. The real Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange publicly disavowed any affiliation with the Chinese platform on April 8, warning that any platforms, apps or promotional material using its name were unauthorized and likely fraudulent.

All XinKangJia's deposits, returns and withdrawals were conducted in USDT, placing the operation outside the scope of China's traditional financial oversight.

Public outrage intensified after XinKangJia's founder reportedly fled abroad and mocked victims in group chats.

“Everyone's wealth should match their intelligence. Since your wealth didn't match your intelligence, I helped balance it out for you. I only took what didn't belong to your level of intelligence. I hope you can be grateful,” reads a machine translation of a message from the founder, as shown in a screenshot shared by local media.

Once known mainly to knife collectors and factory insiders, the quiet Japanese city of Sanjo is now running a blockchain-powered experiment in civic identity.

On Tuesday, Sanjo launched the Digital Sanjo Citizen ID, an NFT that allows anyone in the world to become a digital resident of the city. Holders gain access to a private community and perks like hot spring stays, virtual town hall meetings and even voting rights in December's digital mayoral election. They can also propose initiatives for Sanjo's digital future.

The NFTs, recognized by the local government, are designed by students at a nearby anime college. Each token features a “Guardian of the Artisans” that represents a real-world manufacturer from the Tsubame-Sanjo industrial cluster, famous for its knives, pliers and stainless steel tools.

Like many rural regions in Japan, Sanjo is grappling with population decline and youth migration to bigger cities. In response, officials are turning to the concept of kankeijinko — a “related population” of outsiders who engage meaningfully with the community without living there.

Last year, Cointelegraph reported that Yamakoshi, a village in the Niigata mountains, attracted 1,700 digital citizens through a similar NFT initiative. Japan's government has also been exploring metaverse applications to address broader social issues, including “hikikomori,” or socially withdrawn individuals.

Breaking into Liberland: Dodging guards with inner-tubes, decoys and diplomats

Shinhan Bank, one of South Korea's largest commercial banks, has become the first mainstream financial institution in the country to launch a dedicated cryptocurrency section within its mobile app.

The new feature allows users to track real-time crypto prices, explore beginner-friendly educational content, and access professional research reports. It's part of Shinhan's broader effort to make digital assets more approachable and transparent for the general public.

The app integrates with local exchange Korbit, enabling customers to link real-name verified accounts, view crypto holdings and request higher transaction limits.

Shinhan is one of five South Korean banks that have partnered with licensed exchanges, offering customers compliant pathways to trade crypto through their bank accounts. The bank has long positioned itself at the forefront of the country's digital asset adoption.

The launch comes as South Korea accelerates efforts to regulate the crypto sector under President Lee Jae Myung's administration. His campaign included proposals for a won-pegged stablecoin. In late June, eight major banks — including Shinhan — announced a joint initiative to issue a fiat-backed digital currency.

The attacker behind the $50 million exploit of crypto card company Infini has begun laundering stolen funds, capitalizing on Ethereum's recent price rally to secure multimillion-dollar gains.

On Feb. 24, the attacker drained $50 million in USDC from Infini's vaults and quickly converted the funds into 17,696 ETH. With Ethereum now trading above $3,400, the stash has grown to roughly $61 million — an $11 million unrealized profit.

Onchain data analyzed by blockchain sleuth EmberCN shows the hacker has started to offload a portion of the holdings. So far, 1,770 ETH has been swapped for $5.88 million in DAI, and 5,001 ETH has been funneled into Tornado Cash, a privacy tool frequently used to obscure fund movements.

Infini had previously offered a bounty for the return of the funds and initiated legal proceedings. In June, the company announced it would shut down its stablecoin card business.

The attacker still controls around 10,925 ETH in their wallet.

U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to allow retirement accounts for alternative investments including cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.

The order, which could be signed as soon as this week, would to allow 401(k) accounts to invest in a broader set of assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds such as digital assets, gold and private equity, and would direct regulators to clear any hurdles.

Bitcoin jumped above $120,000 on the report, up 1.7% through the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, XRP surged to a fresh all-time high, breaking its 2018 record.

The first significant crypto bill is on its way to being signed into law after the U.S. House of Representatives passed stablecoin-regulating legislation known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which now gets forwarded to President Donald Trump.



The landmark legislative achievement for the crypto industry marks a sharp turnaround from recent years in which the sector languished under resistant U.S. regulators and a Congress unable to finish policy efforts. And it follows close behind another major House action to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act  (known as "CLARITY") — a bill that will establish a full set of rules over the wider crypto markets.



The GENIUS Act passed 308-122. Because it arrived as a Senate bill with a 68-30 approval in that chamber, all it needs now is a presidential signature before it becomes the law of the land. Regulators can then begin establishing regulations for the conduct of stablecoin issuers — a field currently dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC but which has drawn a high level of attention from traditional financial institutions, including Wall Street banks.



The legislative process again showed a large number of Democrats joining the Republican majority in favor of tailored regulations for the U.S. crypto industry. The Democrats in opposition argued the rules as proposed remained too dangerous for investors and potentially allowed for abuse by financial firms.



The Clarity Act remains the more important of the industry's two legislative goals for this Congress, but lobbyists will now focus their entire attention on that more complex effort. The House's market structure bill passed with a 294-134 vote on Thursday. But the issue now gets taken up by the Senate, which is widely expected to go its own way and remains in the drafting process.



Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that he wants the Senate to complete market structure legislation by Sept. 30, and that the House's work will offer a "strong template."



Industry lobbyists were concentrating closely on the scale of Democratic support on the bill, considering that number to be a controlling factor in how much pressure the Senate will feel to act. In the end, the cause didn't disappoint on its significant support from Democrats. A third bill, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, saw more partisan support, passing on party lines with just two Democrats in favor. This bill will be attached to the National Defense Authorization Act, as it's unlikely to win sufficient bipartisan support in the Senate on its own.



Earlier this year, when he invited crypto leaders to a summit at the White House, Trump had set a deadline before the August congressional break for finishing both of the industry's top legislative priorities. The stablecoin effort marks the first step, though market structure remains the more important legislation, and policy analysts have predicted the work could miss Trump's deadline considerably, potentially dragging later into the year.



The president's influence over crypto policy has been considerable — a point of contention for Democrats who say his personal stake in the industry is inappropriate. However, an 11th-hour negotiation with holdout Republicans on Tuesday's "Crypto Week" procedural actions ended with Trump boasting that he'd brought them back on board, only to find later that they'd continue their opposition for most of a day.

 Staking for crypto exchange-traded funds has been a feature long sought by traditional financial institutions and asset managers. 

The Nasdaq stock exchange filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday on behalf of BlackRock to add staking to the asset manager's iShares Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).

If the application is approved, the fund would give investors exposure to staking rewards accrued from using the underlying Ether as collateral security for Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.

In May, the SEC released guidance classifying staking rewards earned from validation services on proof-of-stake blockchain networks as earned income rather than securities transactions subject to capital gains tax.

The SEC staking guidance opened the doors for institutional investors to earn yield on their ETH holdings, a major feature for TradFi institutions that must produce income or cash flow for shareholders.

“Ethereum starts to look like a hybrid between tech equity and digital currency,” Ray Youssef, CEO of finance app NoOnes told Cointelegraph in July. “This appeals to treasury strategists looking beyond passive storage.”

Ethereum treasury companies scooped up 540,000 ETH, valued at $1.6 billion using current market prices, in the last month for their corporate reserves.

In June, the amount of staked ETH hit an all-time high, with 28% of the circulating supply dedicated to the network's security.

The amount of staked ETH reached a new all-time high of 36,036,981 in July, accounting for over 29% of the circulating supply, according to Dune.

Rising demand for ETH is also reflected by Strong ETF flows during June and July, following stunted performance earlier this year due to macroeconomic fears and a flight to safety from risk assets.

Capital flows into Ether investment vehicles were positive for 11 out of the last 12 trading days, according to Farside Investors, with over $726 million flowing into the ETFs on Wednesday. 

Attracting institutional interest is a major priority for the revamped Ethereum Foundation, which backed the creation of Etherealize, a marketing firm tasked with exposing institutional investors to the layer-1 smart contract network.

The United States Congress passed the country's first major standalone crypto bill on Thursday. 

The landmark vote signals a sea change in the U.S. stance toward these digital currencies.

The House approved the GENIUS Bill with a 308-122 vote with significant Democratic support, adopting regulations for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins that proponents believe will fundamentally change the world of commerce. 

It was a remarkable win for the crypto industry — and for President Trump, who campaigned on making the U.S. "the crypto capital of the planet." He, along with his family, also stand to benefit from this, given their financial interests in a crypto company that has issued its own stablecoin.

In fact, the president had a key role to play in its passage. Although the House easily had the votes to pass the bill during what it had dubbed "Crypto Week," it came after an arduous process when some Republican lawmakers objected to the way leaders had intended to pass two other crypto bills.

It ultimately required President Trump's intervention to convince the lawmakers and then a really long vote to clear all the procedural hurdles.

The GENIUS Bill, which stands for "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin" now heads to the president's desk for his signature, since the Senate had already approved it last month. 

With its passage, the U.S. is now formally adopting a new set of rules for cryptocurrencies — ones that critics view as far too easy. It also marks a sharp turn from the Biden administration's approach of seeking to get crypto companies follow the far tougher rules for Wall Street.

More crypto legislation is expected to follow the GENIUS Act. There's another bill intended to provide more clarity about which regulatory agencies will oversee the different aspects of crypto. Another seeks to ban the U.S. from adopting a digital version of the dollar. Those, however, now need to be passed by the Senate.

The new legislation will put more formal regulations around stablecoins, which is viewed by many as a safer type of cryptocurrency. That's because companies selling stablecoins have to hold the equivalent dollars in reserve.

So if you buy $1 in stablecoin, the issuer that provided you with one has to keep $1 in reserve. That means that when you want to cash it, you can get paid back promptly.

Stablecoins are a hot emerging part of the crypto sector. Key industry players believe stablecoins will allow people and companies the ability to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous and expensive bank or money transfer fees. They believe that the world of credit cards or wire transfers will be completely upended once they are adopted widely.

It's attracted a lot of interest from banks such as JPMorganChase and retailers like Amazon and Walmart, all of whom are said to be considering launching their own stablecoins. For the retailers it could mean avoiding the credit card fees they pay when customers make purchases.

Controversially, even President Trump now stands to benefit financially from stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, in which his family has financial interests, has issued a stablecoin called USD1 (though it's market share is miniscule).

Passage of the bill came after intense lobbying from the crypto industry, which spent over $100 million in Congressional races last year and is building an even heftier war chest ahead of next year's midterms. That kind of spending had critics calling foul.

"This is what political power can buy you," says Corey Frayer, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America.

The crypto sector's war chest not only helps win supporters, Frayer says, they also silence Democrats and other lawmakers who might be opposed but "are just plain scared that crypto is going to come to their town and spend enormous amounts of money against them."

Among other aspects, the bill seeks to formalize rules for stablecoins, mandating that companies must ensure they are holding proper reserves and are providing information about their holdings. It also introduces anti-money laundering rules and other regulations intended to address concerns that stablecoins are being used by criminals such as ransomware hackers, drug cartels or even regimes under sanction.

But critics warn the rules are not strong enough, and they add that the bill would allow non-financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins without having to follow all the rules that banks and other financial firms must follow. 

"The stablecoin industry has claimed that it is a new payment system with better infrastructure than the payment system we've been using for years," says Frayer. "But the purpose of the bill is to give them the veil of regulation."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House has passed three bills intended to boost the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry with new regulations as President Donald Trump has pushed to make the U.S. the “ crypto capital of the world.” 

One of the three bills, legislation to regulate a type of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, had already passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support and will now head to Trump's desk. The other two bills — a broader measure to create a new market structure for cryptocurrency and a bill to prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency — will go to the Senate. 

The stablecoin bill, passed on a 308-122 vote, sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for the cryptocurrency, which is tied to a stable asset, often the U.S. dollar, to reduce price volatility. It passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June.

“Around the world, payment systems are undergoing a revolution,” said House Financial Services Chair French Hill of Arkansas as lawmakers debated the stablecoin legislation Thursday morning. Hill said the bill will “ensure American competitiveness and strong guardrails for our consumers.” 

After Trump declared it “crypto week,” the bills were stalled for more than a day amid disagreements among House Republicans about how to combine the legislation. In the end, GOP leaders put the three bills for a separate votes, leaving the fate of the other two bills unclear in the Senate. The internal dissent could foreshadow challenges ahead for the more sweeping crypto legislation that Trump has demanded and the industry has poured millions into advancing.

The stablecoin measure is seen by lawmakers and the industry as a step toward adding legitimacy and consumer trust to a rapidly growing sector. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in June that the legislation could help that currency “grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade.”

The bill outlines requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and mandates that issuers hold reserves backing the cryptocurrency. Without such a framework, Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee in a statement warned, “consumers face risks like unstable reserves or unclear operations from stablecoin issuers.”

After the votes, House Republicans strongly urged the Senate to take up the second bill, which would create a new market structure for cryptocurrency. 

Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said the 294-134 vote on that legislation shows broad bipartisan support and a “massive energy” on the issue. But it is so far unclear whether the Senate would consider the House bill or try to write its own. 

That legislation aims to provide clarity for how digital assets are regulated. The bill defines what forms of cryptocurrency should be treated as commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and which are securities policed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In general, tokens associated with “mature” blockchains, like bitcoin, will be considered commodities.

The third bill, passed on a narrower 219-210 margin, prohibits the U.S. from offering what's known as a “central bank digital currency,” which is like a government-issued form of digital cash.

The crypto industry has long complained that unclear laws have made it difficult to operate in the U.S. and that the Biden administration tried to regulate it through enforcement actions rather than transparent rulemaking. Getting this bill passed has been a top priority for the industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to heavy campaign donations and lobbying.

Advocates said the passage of the bills marks a key moment in cryptocurrency's winding path toward mainstream adoption.

Patrick McHenry, the former chair of the House Financial Services Committee and now vice chair of the crypto firm Ondo Finance, said the legislation will have a “massive generational impact,” similar to the securities laws Congress passed in the 1930s that helped make Wall Street the center of the financial world. “These bills will make the United States the center of the world for digital assets,” he said.

While the bill has significant bipartisan support, it has also faced pushback from Democrats who say the legislation should address Trump's personal financial interests in the crypto space.

“No one should be surprised that these same Republicans' next order of business is to validate, legitimize, and endorse the Trump family's corruption and efforts to sell the White House to the highest bidder,” said California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the Financial Services panel. 

A provision in the stablecoin bill bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. 

In May, the Republican president hosted a private dinner at his golf club in Virginia with top investors in a Trump-branded meme coin. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin, USD1.

Trump reported earning $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty Financial in 2024, according to a public financial disclosure released in June. A meme coin linked to him has generated an estimated $320 million in fees, though the earnings are split among multiple investors.

Some Democrats also criticized the bill for creating what they see as an overly weak regulatory framework that could pose long-term financial risks. They've also raised concerns that the legislation opens the door for major corporations to issue their own private cryptocurrencies.

“If this bill passes, it will allow Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to issue their own money. The bill still permits Big Tech companies and other conglomerates to issue their own private currencies,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

This strategic shift comes with support from crypto investor Robert Leshner, who has acquired a stake in the company but no longer seeks controlling interest.

The company has already approved allocating part of its treasury to Bitcoin and is exploring potential mining infrastructure investments through partnerships with Bitmain and Polaris Capital. Key financial metrics include 6,809,578 shares outstanding, over $20 million raised through ATM offerings, and zero debt.

Questa svolta strategica è supportata dall'investitore crypto Robert Leshner, che ha acquisito una quota nella società ma non cerca più il controllo.

L'azienda ha già approvato l'allocazione di una parte della sua tesoreria in Bitcoin e sta valutando investimenti in infrastrutture di mining attraverso partnership con Bitmain e Polaris Capital. I principali indicatori finanziari includono 6.809.578 azioni in circolazione, oltre 20 milioni di dollari raccolti tramite offerte ATM e nessun debito.

Ce virage stratégique est soutenu par l'investisseur crypto Robert Leshner, qui a acquis une participation dans l'entreprise mais ne cherche plus à en prendre le contrôle.

L'entreprise a déjà approuvé l'allocation d'une partie de sa trésorerie en Bitcoin et explore des investissements potentiels dans des infrastructures de minage via des partenariats avec Bitmain et Polaris Capital.

LQR House (NASDAQ:YHC), eine E-Commerce-Plattform mit Fokus auf Spirituosen und Getränke, hat Pläne angekündigt, Kryptowährungen und Blockchain-Technologie in ihr Geschäftsmodell zu integrieren. Dieser strategische Wandel wird von Krypto-Investor Robert Leshner unterstützt, der eine Beteiligung am Unternehmen erworben hat, aber keine Mehrheitskontrolle anstrebt.

Das Unternehmen hat bereits die Verwendung eines Teils seiner Rücklagen für Bitcoin genehmigt und prüft mögliche Investitionen in Mining-Infrastruktur durch Partnerschaften mit Bitmain und Polaris Capital. Wichtige Finanzkennzahlen sind 6.809.578 ausstehende Aktien, über 20 Millionen US-Dollar durch ATM-Angebote eingeworben und keine Schulden.

LQR House signals strategic expansion into crypto with blockchain integration plans and key investor support, representing significant business model evolution.

This announcement represents a substantial strategic shift for LQR House, a company previously focused exclusively on spirits and beverage ecommerce. The planned integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology potentially transforms their business model and risk profile. The support from Leshner, described as a significant voice in decentralized finance, adds credibility to this initiative.

The company's financial position appears relatively stable with zero debt and having raised over $20 million through its at-the-market offering. With 6,809,578 shares outstanding, investors should note the company retains flexibility for future capital raises if needed for this expansion.

What's particularly noteworthy is management's characterization of digital assets as potentially "foundational" rather than merely diversification. This suggests a far deeper integration than simply holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The previous board resolution to allocate treasury to Bitcoin and explore mining infrastructure investments with Bitmain and Polaris Capital indicates this strategy has been developing for some time.

However, investors should recognize the speculative nature of this announcement. The press release contains multiple contingencies and disclaimers about the execution of definitive agreements, approvals, and regulatory considerations. The lack of specific timelines, investment amounts, or concrete implementation details creates significant uncertainty about execution. This strategic expansion, while potentially transformative, introduces substantial new risks alongside opportunities in the volatile cryptocurrency sector.

Company Sets Sights on Becoming a Crypto-Integrated Brand Platform, Leveraging Strong Ecommerce Foundation and Industry Collaboration

MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA / ACCESS Newswire / July 17, 2025 / LQR House Inc. (the "Company" or "LQR House") (NASDAQ:YHC), a niche ecommerce platform specializing in the spirits and beverage industry, today announced its strategic intent to broaden its corporate focus by integrating cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into its long-term business model.

This forward-looking shift has been spurred by Leshner, a significant voice in decentralized finance and the open market buyer of a stake in LQR House. Leshner has publicly expressed his interest in having the Company pursue a more crypto-native strategy. The Company plans to seek advice from Leshner, or members of the community that Leshner may suggest. Leshner no longer intends on pursuing a controlling interest in the Company.

This announcement follows the board's previously approved resolution to allocate a portion of the Company's treasury to Bitcoin, along with its stated intention to explore a potential investment in mining infrastructure through a partnership with Bitmain and Polaris Capital.

The move follows a high-level meeting between Minister Bilal Bin Saqib and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele

Pakistan and El Salvador have agreed to establish formal cooperation on Bitcoin and blockchain initiatives, following a high-level meeting between Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in San Salvador.

The engagement, described as the first official meeting between the Miinster of State and the Salvadoran head of state, culminated in the signing of a Letter of Intent (LoI) between the Bitcoin Office of El Salvador and the Pakistan Crypto Council.

The agreement aims to facilitate technical cooperation and knowledge exchange in key areas such as public sector applications of Bitcoin, blockchain-based financial inclusion, sovereign digital asset reserves, and regulatory innovation in emerging economies.

The Bitcoin Office signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council yesterday:

"The purpose of the LOI is to outline the mutual intention of the Parties to explore and establish a strategic collaboration in the fields of Bitcoin education, Bitcoin mining,… pic.twitter.com/gD90PTJ0Wi

According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance, the meeting centred exclusively on digital asset collaboration and was seen as a landmark in what officials termed “Biplomacy” — a blend of Bitcoin and diplomacy reflecting the growing role of decentralized technologies in international engagement.

“El Salvador's bold Bitcoin experiment has inspired governments around the world,” said Bilal Bin Saqib, who also heads the Pakistan Crypto Council. “This visit marks the beginning of a strategic relationship rooted in innovation, inclusion, and shared learning.”

President Bukele welcomed Pakistan's outreach, commending its forward-looking approach to digital assets and reaffirming El Salvador's support for emerging economies exploring Bitcoin as a tool for financial sovereignty.

El Salvador, which made headlines in 2021 as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, has become a focal point for nations assessing digital currencies to expand financial access and reduce reliance on traditional monetary systems.

Pakistan is similarly working to establish a structured digital asset economy. Earlier this year, the government created the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) via presidential ordinance to regulate the crypto sector, curb illicit finance, and promote responsible innovation.

The State Bank of Pakistan also announced plans to complete a pilot project for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) within the current fiscal year.

Officials believe the Pakistan–El Salvador agreement will help advance policy dialogue on sovereign digital asset frameworks, encourage public-private collaboration, and position Pakistan as a serious participant in global crypto governance.

Financial analysts estimate that ongoing reforms, including the integration of virtual assets into the formal economy, could bring up to $25 billion into the country's tax net.

Prediction markets offer users the opportunity to test their knowledge about real-world events spanning diverse topics like crypto, politics, pop culture, and sports. 

On Myriad Markets, users can place predictions in these categories using USDC or points, collecting their share of profits if and when they predict correctly. 

This week, some of the top markets on Myriad involve the next move for the surging XRP, whether Ethereum (ETH) is poised to spike to a new all-time high price, and whether the newly launched Pump.fun (PUMP) token will be airdropped to users this month.

(Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt parent company, DASTAN). 

Market Open: July 10Market Close: July 31Volume: $38.4K

One of the biggest on-chain events of the year took place last weekend when Solana token launchpad Pump.fun hosted an initial coin offering (ICO) for its PUMP token. The platform sold 15% of its total supply ($600 million worth) to eligible parties and enabled trading on Monday, which led to a quick burst to more than a $2 billion market cap for the PUMP token. 

But details remain outstanding about exactly when the platform might airdrop the 24% of its supply it set aside for community and ecosystem initiatives. Myriad users asked to predict whether or not it would take place by the end of July have changed their mind during the week. 

On July 13, odds got as high as 79% that “Yes,” the platform would airdrop its token before July 31 concluded. But just four days later, that number stands at 26.9%, a more than 50% decline as no further information has come from the platform. 

Interestingly, a scenario in which tokens are airdropped to participants before the end of July but they are locked and not tradeable will result in the market resolving “no.”

What's Next? Pump.fun users and PUMP token traders are eagerly awaiting the next announcement from the platform, which may indicate its plans for additional token distributions.

Bitcoin has stolen the show this year, including making new all time-highs above $120,000 earlier this week—but Ethereum has also been in the spotlight this week. 

Now, a new market on Myriad asks users whether or not the momentum and recent weekly gain of 21% will spur the second-largest crypto asset (by market cap) to set a new all-time high by the end of 2025. 

As of Thursday afternoon, predictors think ETH will hit a new all-time high, with odds standing at 53.7% despite the fact that it's still trading nearly 30% below its all-time high of $4,891. 

One analyst told Decrypt on Thursday that the asset's current setup is the “strongest in years,” pointing to sentiment improvement and increased institutional interest, which is evidenced by major ETF inflows and accumulation from publicly traded firms like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine. 

Former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes previously predicted that the price of ETH could reach $4,000-$5,000 this year. Will he and Myriad predictors be right?

What's Next? Predictors have time to monitor this market, as ETH sits nearly 30% off its all-time high with the market closing on December 31.

Ripple-linked asset XRP is the best-performing cryptocurrency this week among those in the top 10 by market capitalization, jumping 32% to $3.28. 

Amid the surge, XRP reclaimed the $3.00 mark for the first time since January and is rapidly approaching its all-time high mark of $3.40 set more than 7 years ago. 

Thanks to the boost, most predictors on Myriad think the token is more likely to rise to $3.50 next than fall back to $2.00, a 39% dive from its current price. 

As of Thursday afternoon, 84.5% of predictions were on “moon” to at least $3.50, a 11% jump since the day prior and a 34% weekly rise. 

Investment bank Standard Chartered is with predictors, calling the asset “uniquely positioned” and calling a target price of $5.50 by year end. 

What's Next? XRP needs to jump just over 7% to reach the “moon” prediction that the bulk of users have made.

					VERACITY IN GAMING				


					VERACITY IN GAMING				

Fumito Ueda praised Keita Takahashi's To a T for not relying on mechanics, stating that the age of coming up with new mechanics is long over. 

Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi released his brand-new game, To a T, on May 28 this year. To celebrate its release, Takahashi got together for a chat with another game industry legend – Fumito Ueda, the director of Shadow of the Colossus and ICO.

In a three-way discussion with Denfaminicogamer, the two creators shared their thoughts on the new game, with Ueda praising it for “not relying on unique gameplay mechanics.” As odd as those words of praise may sound, what Ueda is actually saying is – “the age of coming up with new gameplay mechanics with each release has long passed.”   

To a T is a puzzle adventure game developed by Takahashi's indie studio Uvula, and it follows the odd coming-of-age story of a boy stuck in a T-pose. When its trailer was first released, Ueda apparently reached out to Takahashi to ask him – “How do you play this game?” Takahashi remembers answering that the game didn't have any special mechanics – to which Ueda replied with: “That's great.” The Katamari Damacy creator jokingly remarks that he thought “Ah, these are the words of a professional” when he first heard that comment. While Ueda's reply may not seem that serious at first glance, what he was actually trying to suggest is that current day games could benefit from focusing on more than just gameplay mechanics.

“While I don't know why I replied with ‘That's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – The age of gameplay mechanics had already passed. I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.”

Ueda explained that, in his opinion, mechanics don't necessarily need to be “new” or “innovative,” because the game's art and story are there to build the experience. “Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork. Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition.”

If we take into account Ueda's previous works, the logic behind his reasoning becomes much more obvious. In his cult classic game ICO, rather than focusing on gameplay mechanics that would make the game entertaining and comfortable for players, Ueda decided to bring the art and the atmosphere to the forefront. Other prominent creators like NieR: Automata director Yoko Taro have praised Ueda's games exactly for this reason – by using already existing gameplay elements and deliberately ignoring playability in favor of conveying the message through the story and worldbuilding, the game ended up being one-of-a-kind experience for Yoko, and many others.   

This is the same reason why Ueda believes To a T to be a great game – rather than offering gimmicks, the game is story driven, with an emphasis on visual presentation and aesthetics and heavy messaging about living with disability. He said that the “loose gameplay” felt fresh to him, and that it was just the right amount to make the game feel great overall. He even jokes that this is the first game in a while that actually captivated him so much that he played it to the end.

To a T is currently out for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X❘S.

XRP is fast approaching a historic milestone, with its
market capitalization set to breach the $200 billion mark for the first time.
As Bitcoin consolidates near recent record highs, XRP has emerged as one of the
biggest altcoin gainers in July, reinforcing the broader shift of investor
interest toward non-Bitcoin digital assets.

Over the past 30 days, XRP's market cap has surged by
51%, reaching $194.83 billion by Thursday. According to CoinMarketCap, this is the highest market
cap XRP has recorded year-to-date since peaking at $189 billion early this year.

The gains come amid a significant rally in the XRP/USD
pair, up over 32% on the weekly chart. In comparison, Ethereum has gained
roughly 23%, ahead of Bitcoin, which has gained 6% in the same period. 

This rising momentum among large-cap altcoins has
reignited the “altseason” narrative, a term used to describe phases when
capital rotates from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies.

In the last 24 hours alone, XRP and Ether posted over 9% and 5% gains, respectively, while Bitcoin remained range-bound, suggesting traders increasingly seek higher returns beyond the flagship crypto.

The recent rally in XRP aligns with a bullish
technical breakout from a descending triangle—a pattern often associated with
significant upward moves when confirmed by rising volume.

Adding to the optimism are similarities between the
current market setup and XRP's strong performance in late 2024. At that time,
XRP entered overbought territory on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and
stayed elevated for several weeks, leading to a 200% increase in market cap
that peaked around $195 billion.

The current rally in XRP and other large-cap altcoins
comes when Bitcoin appears to be losing its near-term momentum. As
BTC trades sideways following its record highs, altcoins are capturing
attention with stronger relative gains.

XRP and Ether now account for about 16% of the total
crypto market, and their outperformance compared to Bitcoin in July suggests a
strategic reallocation by investors. With rising trading volumes and positive
technical indicators, XRP's trajectory could further reinforce the growing
trend of diversification within crypto portfolios.

Whether XRP ultimately breaks through the $250 billion
mark will depend on continued investor appetite and broader market conditions.
But with its current setup and historical patterns in play, the asset appears
well-positioned to test new highs in the weeks ahead.

Recently, Grayscale Investments challenged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the regulator
halted the approval of its Digital Large Cap Fund. The product, which holds a
basket of top digital assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and
Cardano, had initially received a green light from the SEC's Division of
Trading and Markets.

However, the approval was later halted pending
an internal agency review. Grayscale's legal team contends that the SEC missed
its statutory deadline to intervene and is now calling for the approval to be
treated as final.

Taipei, Taiwan--(Newsfile Corp. - July 17, 2025) -  Lootex, a Web3-native platform known for its multi-chain NFT marketplace, has officially launched its new homepage at Lootex.io, marking a strategic evolution into a unified NFT Solutions Platform.

The redesigned website reflects Lootex's broader mission: to empower users to create, trade, and play with NFTs across multiple touchpoints - including marketplaces, games, and developer tools - in one seamless ecosystem.

"NFTs are no longer just collectibles. They're becoming building blocks for games, communities, and digital experiences," said Justine Lu, Co-founder and CEO of Lootex. "With this new platform launch, we're creating a home for the next generation of creators, builders, and players who want to unlock real utility from their NFTs."

The new LTX brand identity reflects Lootex's vision to “Make Virtual Assets Real,” with core features like modularity, gasless transactions, and cross-chain interoperability.

A Closer Look at the Lootex Ecosystem

Each product within the new Lootex.io plays a role in turning NFTs into interactive, accessible experiences:

Lootex Plus

Lootex Plus is an AI-powered toolkit that lets you add a fully featured digital-asset layer to any product in minutes. Its battle-tested APIs, Trading & Studio SDKs, and agentic workflow (Lootex MCP + AI Agents) underpin top platforms like Lootex Marketplace, Biru, and TiltPlay. Whether you're launching a brand site, game, mini-app, RWA solution, creator hub, or gifting feature, Lootex Plus delivers fast, secure NFT infrastructure that unlocks new value for your business.

Biru

An immersive, storytelling-driven NFT world that explores the evolving possibilities of what NFTs can become. From artist collaborations like the PFP collection Birunoko to the newly launched browser-based match-3 game FizzPop, Biru explores dynamic NFT use cases with creativity and on-chain innovation.

TiltPlay

A Web3 gaming layer built directly into LINE and Telegram. It currently features three casual mini-games - Block Party, Tidal Rush, and Xynth88 - designed for quick play and light NFT integration, making blockchain gaming feel intuitive and fun.

Lootex Studio

A no-code toolset for NFT creators to launch collections from smart contract deployment to collection management. Artists and brands can now mint and manage NFTs without touching technical infrastructure.

Lootex Marketplace

The platform's original multi-chain NFT trading hub, now accessible via lootex.io/marketplace, remains a core part of the Lootex experience with an improved interface and broader token standard support.

A unified home for the Lootex ecosystem, bringing together Lootex Plus, Biru, TiltPlay, Lootex Marketplace and Lootex Studio — all accessible through the new Lootex.io.

A New Identity, A Unified Future

The launch also debuts Lootex's refreshed brand identity, including a new LTX logo and simplified navigation across all products. This consolidation allows Lootex.io to serve as the single entry point for users to explore its full suite of Web3 offerings.

With an expanded ecosystem and commitment to creator and community empowerment, Lootex continues to reimagine how NFTs can drive real interaction and value in the digital world.

LUXEMBOURG, July  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin Swift (BTC3), a next-generation blockchain protocol, has officially launched Stage 1 of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), introducing a novel approach to early-stage participation with programmable mining rewards that activate immediately.

Unlike traditional ICOs that require investors to wait for mainnet or roadmap deliverables, Bitcoin Swift's Proof-of-Yield system is already live. Early contributors who purchase BTC3 during Stage 1 receive programmable mining contracts that begin distributing rewards from day one, a move designed to reshape how value is delivered in token presales.

A Short Presale With Immediate Impact

Bitcoin Swift's presale is structured into ten fast-paced stages, each lasting fewer than ten days. Stage 1 is currently live at $1 per token, offering the highest programmable mining output before the next stage doubles the token price to $2. The platform has allocated 50% of its total token supply toward programmable mining, with early participants gaining access to the most lucrative reward cycles.

“Programmable mining begins the moment a buyer enters Stage 1,” said a spokesperson for Bitcoin Swift. “We're not just rewarding early access—we're activating a system where rewards are governed transparently by smart contracts and delivered automatically.”



Hybrid Consensus With AI-Driven Efficiency

Bitcoin Swift operates on a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model. Miners create blocks, while validators finalize checkpoints every 100 blocks. A layer of AI oracles monitors energy metrics and adjusts mining rewards in real time to prioritize sustainable, low-carbon usage.

Key features include:

Governance and Privacy at the Core

BTC3 is more than a mining protocol—it incorporates governance mechanisms powered by AI, where votes are scored for risk and participation is linked to both token holdings and verified identity. Meanwhile, zk-ledger technology ensures that transactions are shielded and private, while maintaining institutional-grade compliance for transparency.

Tokenomics and Distribution

Bitcoin Swift's fixed supply of 45 million BTC3 is designed to support long-term value through a transparent allocation model:

All rewards are executed through smart contracts and are based on activity levels, clean energy metrics, and decentralized ID verification.



About Bitcoin Swift

Bitcoin Swift is a programmable Layer 1 blockchain designed to deliver real-time mining, AI-enhanced consensus, and privacy-first decentralized finance. By combining Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake with AI agents and programmable rewards, Bitcoin Swift enables a secure, efficient, and transparent blockchain ecosystem from the first day of its ICO.

With only 63 days left in the presale, the project invites early participants to engage in an active ecosystem where programmable mining and real-time payouts are already live.

In ongoing proceedings of the $1 billion money laundering and sanctions trial against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, an admitted cryptocurrency fraudster revealed how he used the decentralized crypto mixer to conceal the proceeds of a $1.1 million NFT rug pull.

Andre Llacuna, 23, testified Wednesday that he and coconspirator Ethan Nguyen orchestrated a fraudulent scheme involving the sale of 8,888 “Frosties” NFTs on the OpenSea exchange in January 2022. Despite promising access to a metaverse game, the project was a sham. After collecting approximately $1.1 million from investors, Llacuna and Nguyen abruptly shut down the Frosties website and attempted to obscure their illicit gains.

Facing mounting scrutiny on the public Ethereum blockchain, Llacuna admitted they turned to Tornado Cash as the “best option” to hide the stolen funds and evade detection. He explained, “It was valuable because people would be unable to trace back the original way we got the cryptocurrency.” Despite efforts, authorities arrested both individuals within two months, with Nguyen sentenced to probation and ordered to forfeit nearly $579,000.

The testimony forms part of prosecutors' broader case alleging that Storm and his associates operated Tornado Cash as a “washing machine” for illicit funds, enabling criminals—including fraudsters and the North Korean Lazarus hacking group—to launder more than $1 billion over four years.

Additional testimony from Joseph Evans, partner at McDermott Will & Emery, detailed his efforts to recover stolen assets linked to a $196 million heist of crypto exchange BitMart, further highlighting Tornado Cash's role in facilitating anonymous transactions.

The trial continues in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under case number 1:23-cr-00430.

Bitcoin, fresh from hitting an all-time price of $123,000 per bitcoin at the beginning of the week, could be about to make another major move.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can “uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!”

The bitcoin price, up around 60% from its April lows, has powered a huge ethereum and XRP rally that's pushed the combined crypto market to just under $4 trillion (with a Congress game-changer predicted to unleash trillions more).

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirms wild bitcoin rumors, traders are turning toward next week as the “next big catalyst” for the bitcoin price, ethereum, XRP and crypto market looms.

“U.S. policy is the next big catalyst," Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, chief investment officer with XBTO, said in emailed comments, pointing to U.S. president Donald Trump's digital asset task force's report that's due July 22 and “could introduce sweeping policy changes, with speculation around a potential bitcoin reserve strategy.”

Trump's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has until July 22—180 days after Trump's January 23 executive order establishing the group—to submit its final report on a proposed federal framework for the regulation of crypto, including stablecoins, market oversight, and consumer protection.

This week, Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has cleared a final procedural hurdle after a record near-10 hours of talks that sets up a final vote on closely-watched stablecoin legislation.

If the stablecoin Genius Act is passed, it will go to U.S. president Donald Trump's desk for his signature, while the crypto market structure Clarity Act may receive a vote next week, Punchbowl News reported.

Meanwhile, the Trump's digital asset task force's report could reveal plans for the U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve that Trump ordered in March, mandating federal agencies transfer their holdings to the Treasury Department, which would oversee the reserve, as well as a crypto stockpile that's had ethereum, XRP, solana and cardano named to it.

David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, has been working on “budget-neutral” strategies for acquiring bitcoin while bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Cynthia Lummis, a champion of the bitcoin reserve who has introduced bitcoin acquistion bills to Congress, has said that following the passage of the stablecoin and market structure bills, the Trump administration will then turn to the bitcoin reserve.

“Investors are watching closely for signs of a policy shift that could unleash the next wave of inflows,” Rodriguez-Alarcon added.

“Crypto Week is a historic moment for both Bitcoin and crypto as a whole,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin layer two network BOB, said in emailed comments.

“With bitcoin breaking past $122,000 over the weekend, a new all-time high, the price is reflecting the convergence of increased institutional inflows, growing confidence in digital assets as foundational infrastructure, and importantly, a call for regulatory clarity.”

With a faltering economy, rising inflation, geopolitical instability and a foreign exchange crisis, Pakistan is turning increasingly toward cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as a potential economic life raft. The country's recent high-profile engagements—particularly with El Salvador and the Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLF)—signal a radical policy shift that many see as a desperate embrace of digital assets to stave off economic collapse.

But does this emerging crypto love offer salvation, or is it a risky gamble by a nation with limited options?

Pakistan's economy is in dire straits. As of April 2025, the country held just $10 billion in foreign exchange reserves—barely enough to cover three months of imports., a News18 report said. With over $131 billion in external debt and ongoing tensions with India, including military engagements and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan faces severe risks to agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been keeping the country afloat with a $7 billion bailout package. However, experts warn that even this lifeline could snap if geopolitical risks escalate. The fragility of Pakistan's economy is an open secret, with a piece in the Financial Times warning that it could collapse anytime despite the lifeline from the IMF.

In this economic climate, traditional tools have limited utility. Inflation peaked at 38 per cent in 2023, while the rupee has lost 165 per cent of its value since 2017, a study conducted by the Asian Development Bank said. For a population whose savings are rapidly being eroded, the appeal of decentralised financial systems has grown dramatically.

Despite an official ban on cryptocurrency trading, Pakistan ranks 8th globally in crypto adoption. Citizens are said to hold between $20–25 billion in digital assets, driven by desperation for financial security in a rapidly depreciating fiat system, Geo News reported.

Crypto assets have effectively become a parallel financial system for many Pakistanis. In April 2023, the government doubled down on its prohibition, citing capital flight risks. Nevertheless, crypto continues to thrive in grey markets as Pakistanis turn to Bitcoin and stablecoins to preserve wealth and transact across borders.

This popular adoption is happening against the will of regulators but reflects a grassroots shift toward decentralised finance. For many, crypto is no longer speculative; it is essential.

After years of resistance, the Pakistani government is formalising its stance on digital assets. The establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority and plans to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency by this year mark a significant policy reversal.

Further legitimising this shift is the Pakistan Crypto Council, led by Bilal Bin Saqib, who recently signed Letters of Intent with both El Salvador and World Liberty Financial.

The El Salvador partnership is particularly symbolic. El Salvador was the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. With its Bitcoin reserves now valued at over $760 million—nearly triple their original investment—Pakistan sees a model of financial sovereignty and growth through crypto.

Saqib described the partnership as a “strategic relationship rooted in innovation, inclusion, and shared learning,” adding that El Salvador's “bold Bitcoin experiment has inspired governments around the world.”

El Salvador's experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender has failed. The country has reversing its decision to make Bitcoin a mandatory form of payment. While the initiative aimed to revolutionise the financial system and boost the economy, it faced significant challenges.

Bitcoin adoption rates remained low, concerned over volatility reigned supreme, and technical issues with the Chivo wallet could never really be fixed.

The question is this: Is Pakistan really looking up to the right example to emulate cryptocurrency in the country?

More controversial is the deal with WLF, a DeFi platform backed by US President Donald Trump's family. According to the Pakistani Ministry of Finance, WLF has committed to accelerating blockchain innovation and stablecoin adoption in Pakistan.

High-level meetings took place between executives of the World Ledger Foundation (WLF) and Pakistan's most influential institutions, including the army chief, prime minister, deputy prime minister and the governor of the State Bank.

These discussions led to an agreement that outlines key areas of cooperation aimed at advancing Pakistan's digital finance ecosystem. Central to the deal is the testing of blockchain-based financial products through regulatory sandboxes, allowing for innovation under controlled conditions.

The agreement also includes the tokenisation of real-world assets such as real estate, enabling greater liquidity and transparency. Further, it seeks to expand the use of stablecoins for cross-border remittances and trade to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

In addition, the partnership will focus on the development of decentralised finance (DeFi) infrastructure, laying the groundwork for a more inclusive and resilient financial system.

The optimism from the government and crypto leaders is palpable, but this rapid embrace of digital currencies is not without serious risks.

Pakistan faces several critical risks as it moves toward deeper integration with cryptocurrency initiatives. The country remains in the early stages of developing a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework, creating a regulatory vacuum that could allow for unchecked growth.

Without strong oversight, the rapid adoption of digital assets might facilitate fraud, capital flight and money laundering. Another major concern is the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Sudden price crashes could wipe out billions in perceived wealth, potentially triggering widespread financial panic and undermining public trust in emerging financial technologies.

Geopolitically, Pakistan's close alignment with the Trump-backed WLF may carry unintended consequences. A shift in political leadership in Washington could weaken support, while global institutions such as the IMF—already critical of Pakistan's fiscal management—may view the partnership as a destabilising move.

Additionally, an overreliance on cryptocurrency as a singular economic solution risks sidelining broader, long-term economic reforms. This could detract from critical efforts to strengthen traditional industries, enhance export capacity and build a more resilient and diversified economy.

Yet, despite these risks, Pakistan's limited options are pushing it toward cryptocurrency. As traditional finance mechanisms fail to meet citizens' needs, the decentralised economy offers both hope and hazard.

At this moment, it appears that Pakistan is not just experimenting with cryptocurrency—it is banking on it. The deals with El Salvador and WLF reflect a government strategy that increasingly sees crypto as a pillar of future financial stability, not a passing trend.

However, this step is born more out of necessity than choice. Soaring inflation, geopolitical pressures and a weak rupee have made crypto a survival tool for citizens and an innovation imperative for the state.

Pakistan's economy is not at the mercy of cryptocurrency—yet. But it is undeniably tethered to it and the government's growing entanglement with blockchain and DeFi may determine whether the country navigates through crisis or plunges deeper into instability.

In a world where digital assets are reshaping global finance, Pakistan may be among the first developing nations to bet its economic future on the blockchain. Whether that bet pays off—or explodes—is a question that only time, policy clarity and global cooperation can answer.

But if Pakistan must go the crypto way, is El Salvador the model it wants to follow?

A Manhattan federal jury is now seeing firsthand the crazy, emoji-ridden crypto scam as the trial of the Tornado Cash laundering case continues.

Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash, is responsible for the crypto "mixing" service. He is charged with laundering more than $1 billion in dirty cash—money linked to North Korean hackers.

The last witness was Andre Marcus Quiddaoen Llacuna, a 23-year-old convicted NFT scammer, who testified as part of a government cooperation agreement. Llacuna gave an inside perspective on how Tornado Cash supposedly aided him and other actors to mask the source of stolen crypto.

Llacuna admitted to defrauding investors in a now-defunct NFT initiative named Frosties, selling 8,888 NFTs under pretenses of an impending game and breeding mechanics with a partner.

The tokens, priced at about $200–$300 per token, sold out fast, then the devs disappeared, wiping the project's website, Discord, and Twitter, leaving purchasers with zero.

According to Coindesk, he informed the jury that he laundered more than $1 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from selling the Frosties through Tornado Cash, labeling it as the "best way to hide the money and get away with it." Asked how he "cleaned" the money, Llacuna replied matter-of-factly:

"By using Tornado Cash."

He even used the "washy washy" phrase at the time as part of his joke to his girlfriend.

Prosecutors also introduced testimony from victims and investigators who tried to reclaim stolen money, only to be ignored or dismissed by Tornado Cash.

Hanfeng Lin, a Georgia court interpreter, described how she lost her $250,000 life savings to a crypto scheme. A private investigator tracked $150,000 of her money to Tornado Cash, but when she wrote hello@tornado.cash, she heard nothing.

In another case, crypto exchange BitMart's lawyer, Joseph B. Evans, testified that hackers made off with $196 million on the platform in 2021. Having tracked funds to Tornado Cash, Evans approached Storm in writing, asking for assistance in freezing the funds.

However, he was greeted with a dry reply, which only says that "Tornado Cash is a decentralized computer software program that no one can control." With that, the team cannot help him.

Storm, who is running an unlicensed money transfer business and evading federal sanctions, has refuted that he didn't do anything wrong. His defense contends that Tornado Cash is merely open-source code that provides financial privacy, not a money-laundering service.

His attorney, Keri Curtis Axel, defended that Roman can't do anything to prevent bad actors because he just wrote the software.

Editor's Note (7/17/25): This story has been updated with additional reporting and expert commentary.

President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a disease of the vessels that carry blood back to the heart from elsewhere in the body.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt disclosed the diagnosis during a press conference on July 17 in response to public concern raised by photographs of the president with significant swelling around his ankles and bruises on his hands.

A July 17 letter from Sean Barbabella, the president's physician, notes that the Trump underwent several diagnostic tests, including bloodwork and an echocardiogram, which did not identify any signs of systemic illness or heart failure. “President Trump remains in excellent health,” Barbabella wrote.

Chronic venous insufficiency is “a very, very common thing, and for [President Trump's] age it's totally understandable that he has it,” says Monara Dini, a treating physician at the University of California, San Francisco Center for Limb Preservation.

Chronic venous insufficiency—a subset of a larger category of conditions called venous disorders—predominantly affects the legs and causes only pain rather than more serious harm or systemic issues. The condition is quite common—affecting perhaps 5 percent of U.S. adults, according to Cleveland Clinic—and the risk of developing it increases as people age.

The network of vessels that carries blood throughout the body includes two main types of tubing. Arteries carry freshly oxygenated blood away from the core of your body to the extremities while veins carry blood back to the heart and lungs. Arteries need to withstand high pressure and only contain between 10 and 15 percent of the body's blood at a time.

Veins are under much less pressure and therefore can have thinner walls and hold more blood. In addition, they contain one-way valves that keep blood flowing in the proper direction, back toward the internal organs. Chronic venous insufficiency is characterized by weakened valves in leg veins allowing blood to flow backward and pool under the force of gravity, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. These valves leak more often as people age, Dini says.

The most common cause of chronic venous insufficiency is a blood clot that damages the valve. Symptoms of the condition predominantly affect the legs and include achiness, cramping at night, swelling and discoloration, leathery looking skin and open sores called ulcers.

“The worst outcome of having this condition is ulcers that can develop,” Dini says. “The skin is retaining so much fluid that it can at some point burst and break the skin, and you develop ulcerations. It happens a lot, and that's more devastating in the sense that it requires wound care. It can be painful and life-altering.”

Bruising of the hands is not a symptom of chronic venous insufficiency, Dini says. In his letter about Trump, Barbabella attributes this to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”

Chronic venous insufficiency is more likely to occur in people who are overweight or pregnant, who have had a leg injury or blood clots or who have family members who have also dealt with chronic venous insufficiency. Other risk factors can include smoking and insufficient exercise.

Typically, management of chronic venous insufficiency relies on keeping the legs elevated, increasing exercise and reducing weight. Compression therapy, which could include using compression socks or pumps, can also help alleviate symptoms, Dini says. In certain cases, doctors may recommend minor surgical interventions to either repair or remove damaged tissue. Chronic venous insufficiency is a progressive condition that cannot be healed or reversed, however.

 To be fair to Washington, he did try his best to stop it. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

Today, George Washington is remembered as one of America's greatest military leaders. But decades before the American Revolution, when Washington was just a 26-year-old colonel in the Virginia Regiment, his military career was jeopardized by one big mistake.

Numerous locales from Washington's life are preserved as historic sites throughout the United States—from his Mount Vernon home in Virginia to the various headquarters he occupied during the Revolutionary War. But the exact site of this early skirmish, which transpired amidst the fog of the French and Indian War, was unknown to historians until now.

According to Arkeonews, decades worth of research and years of fieldwork have culminated in the discovery of the exact spot where, on November 12, 1758, two factions of British colonial troops opened fire on one another.

That an instance of friendly fire occurred under Washington's supervision shouldn't impugn his leadership abilities too greatly in our minds today. The French and Indian war was rife with chaos, and indeed, a prior incident of friendly fire on the part of the British had already occurred roughly three years earlier during the Battle of the Monongahela (a battle best remember today for its depiction in the painting Washington the Soldier by Reǵnier).

But the incident in 1758 stands out, both for an act of heroism on the part of young Washington, and for the surprising strategic advantage the incident provided.

Serving under General John Forbes, troops led by Colonel George Mercer were sent to try and thwart a raid on what is now known as Fort Ligonier. At the sound of musket fire, Washington led 500 of his troops to the site in the hopes of providing support to Mercer's men. But on arrival, the chaos in the dusk hours led to the two British factions opening fire on one another instead of the enemy.

To the future President's credit, Arkeonews wrote that “Washington, realizing the error, risked his life by galloping through the line, knocking muskets aside with his sword, and shouting for a ceasefire.” As the website for Fort Ligonier notes, this would mark “the last time Washington was under fire before the American Revolution.”

Though the friendly fire incident claimed 40 lives, and Washington in his own account would claim he was “never was in more imminent danger by being between two fires, knocking up with [my] sword the presented pieces,” it did yield a positive result for the British forces: French prisoners were able to provide information that Fort Duquesne was not well defended, and General Forbes was able to seize the opportunity and strike it. 

The ultimate discovery of the site in the modern day is the culmination of the concerted effort of numerous archeologists under the leadership of Jonathan Burns of Juniata College, as well as avid campaigning on the part of Fort Ligonier board member Charles “Charlie” Fagan III. The late Fagan, in the words of his son Chas, “…believed we owed it to the men who died here—not just to locate where they fell, but to remember them properly.”

That memory is now preserved—not just in the act of identifying the site, but indeed, in the myriad of personal items and other artifacts recovered from the site. During the four years of fieldwork that transpired at the site (which is roughly two miles away from the fort), the team recovered “over 350 artifacts” ranging from musket balls and uniform buttons to a French officer's pocket watch key “adorned with a fleur-de-lis.”

As the site of the incident is on private land, its exact location has not been disclosed to the public. But the artifacts found during the excavation are currently on display at Fort Ligonier to both commemorate the event and educate a curious public about an early event in the military career of one of the most revered Founding Fathers.

Millions of people live with vision loss that we thought was permanent. This may change the equation.

What if your eyes could fix themselves? Turns out, your body might already have what it takes to regrow the cells you need to see better—and scientists may have found the switch to simply turn it back on.

Researchers in South Korea found a protein, PROX1, that acts sort of like a molecular gatekeeper, suppressing your body's natural ability to regrow damaged retinal cells. When the scientists blocked PROX1 in mice, something incredible happened: they regenerated essential vision cells for a whopping six months.

For mice, that's a huge milestone. Zebrafish and amphibians have done this naturally for ages, but the regenerative implications for mammals—and maybe humans—are seismic. 

Watch Pop Mech editors Andrew Daniels and Manasee Wagh discuss the new discovery that could reshape how we treat blindness. 

Andrew and Manasee break down why this is such a groundbreaking moment in regenerative medicine, how retinal cells are basically extensions of your brain, and what this new study could mean for millions of people (and Andrew's dog) suffering from degenerative eye diseases. 

They also explore other mind-blowing methods for restoring eyesight, including one that uses gold nanoparticles and lasers—yes, really.

Many former leaders of the world's nine nuclear-armed nations were impaired by health conditions while in office, raising concerns over their decision-making abilities while they had access to nuclear weapon launch codes, a study from the University of Otago, New Zealand, has found.

The study analyzed the health information of 51 deceased leaders of nuclear-armed countries: China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Eight of the leaders died from chronic disease while still in office, five from heart attacks or strokes. Many of the leaders had multiple serious health issues while in office, including dementia, personality disorders, depression and drug and alcohol abuse.

The research was led by Professor Nick Wilson, from the Department of Public Health at the University of Otago, Wellington - Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka, Pōneke, with Associate Professor George Thomson and independent researcher Dr Matt Boyd. Professor Wilson says that of the leaders who left office while still alive, 15 had confirmed or possible health issues which likely hastened their departure.

"Probably all of this group of 15 leaders had their performance in office impaired by their health conditions. In some cases, the degree of impairment was profound, such as in the case of two former Israeli Prime Ministers: Ariel Sharon, who became comatose after suffering a stroke in office, and Menachem Begin, whose depression was so severe he spent his last year as leader isolated in his home. Impairment during crises was also seen in the case of Richard Nixon's bouts of heavy drinking - including during a nuclear crisis involving the Middle East.

"There have also been occasions where health information about leaders has been kept secret at the time."

This was the case for multiple US presidents, including Dwight D Eisenhower, whose doctor described his 1955 heart attack as a digestive upset; John F Kennedy, whose aides lied about him having Addison's disease, a serious, chronic condition; and Ronald Reagan, whose administration hid the extent of his injuries after he was shot in 1981, and the likely signs of his dementia near the end of his term.

Professor Wilson says Kennedy was in poor health during his first two years in office in 1961 and 1962, with his performance likely impaired from Addison's disease, back pain, and his use of anabolic steroids and amphetamines. It was in 1961 that he authorized the failed CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and that his poor performance at a Cold War summit with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna was noted. In turn, Khrushchev's poor mental health probably contributed to him triggering both the Berlin Crisis and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In France, long-serving President François Mitterrand clung onto power until the end of his term in 1995, despite keeping secret his advanced prostate cancer and after his doctor had concluded in late 1994 that he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties. This latest study follows previous research involving Professor Wilson on the health of former New Zealand Prime Ministers. It found the performance of at least four of the leaders was impaired, in three cases by poor health, and, in the case of Robert Muldoon, by his heavy drinking.

Professor Wilson says with the rise in international instability following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 it has become even more important to ensure there is good leadership and governance in those countries with nuclear weapons.

"This is particularly the case for the United States, where a leader can in principle authorize the release of nuclear weapons on their own, a situation referred to as a 'nuclear monarchy'."

He says there are a range of measures which could reduce global security risks from leaders whose judgement is in question. They include removing nuclear weapons from 'high alert' status, adopting 'no first use' policies where nations refrain from using nuclear weapons except as a retaliatory second strike, ensuring any weapon launches need authorization by multiple people, and progressing nuclear disarmament treaties.

Professor Wilson says democracies could consider introducing term limits for their leaders, as well as recall systems, so voters could petition for politicians to step down. Requirements for medical and psychological assessments could be introduced for leaders before they take office, and during their terms.

"Maintaining a strong media with investigative journalists can also help expose impairment in leaders."

Professor Wilson says politicians in general are exposed to high levels of stress, which can affect their mental well-being. A study of UK Members of Parliament has found they were 34 per cent more likely to experience mental health problems than other high-income earners.

"Finding ways to reduce stress on politicians and better address their mental health needs is another way global security risks can be reduced."

New findings beneath the desert floor hint at entrances to long-lost chambers.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the world of archeology, few tools have revolutionized the field as much as ground-penetrating radar (GPR). This geophysical technique uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. Similar techniques have uncovered Viking longships in Norway, revealed lost civilizations in the Amazonian jungle, and even entire Roman cities without ever putting a shovel into dirt. 

And GPR has once again delivered near one of the most well-excavated sites in the world—the Great Pyramids of Giza. 

Researchers led by Tohoku University's Motoyuki Sato used GPR—along with a method known as electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), which uses electrical resistance to map underground structures—to discover what's being described as an “L-shaped anomaly” in the western cemetery near the world-renowned pyramids. 

According to the team's research paper, published in the journal Archeological Prospection, the structure is roughly 6.5 feet from the surface, measures 33 feet in length, and was backfilled after construction.

“The Western Cemetery at Giza is known as an important burial place of members of the royal family and high-class officers,” the paper reads. “In the initial survey by GPR and ERT we found an anomaly in the north of the survey site. The area of the anomaly could be established approximately, but the structure and the location were unclear.”

Below this L-shaped structure was an anomaly, lying 16 to 33 feet down, that the researchers described as “highly electrically resistive.” Such an anomaly could have a few explanations, but the team identified two main possibilities—a mixture of sand and gravel, or “sparse spacing with air voids.” While we know that the surrounding area (built roughly 4,500 years ago, around the same time as its adjacent pyramids) is filled with flat-roofed tombs known in Arabic as mastaba, the stretch of sand where the anomaly was found has not been nearly as intensely excavated, largely because the area sported no impressive structures to warrant a thorough investigation.

So, what exactly could this L-shape structure and its lower anomaly represent? Speaking with Live Science, Sato said the structure is likely not natural, as the shape is too sharp. 

“It may have been an entrance to the deeper structure,” Sato and his colleagues wrote in the paper. That deeper structure sounds suspiciously like a tomb. “We believe that the continuity of the shallow structure and the deep large structure is important. From the survey results, we cannot determine the material causing the anomaly, but it may be a large subsurface archaeological structure.”

7 Big Mysteries about Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS

Scientists are racing to learn as much as possible about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS before it fades from view forever

By Jonathan O'Callaghan edited by Lee Billings

The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS appears as a blurry, dust-shrouded dot in this image from the Gemini North telescope. Future observations should reveal much more about this mysterious object, the third known visitor from beyond our solar system.

Earlier this month astronomers were thrilled to discover only the third known interstellar object ever seen in our solar system. Now dubbed 3I/ATLAS, the suspected comet has just zoomed past the orbit of Jupiter, traveling so fast that it's bound to slip through our sun's gravitational grip. The high speed and hyperbolic trajectory of 3I/ATLAS means it must have come from another star and was cast adrift in the Milky Way by some unknown process before it eventually, by chance, briefly swooped by our sun. It will reach about the orbit of Mars before it boomerangs back toward interstellar space, never to be seen again, at the end of this year.

That's why astronomers have been racing to study 3I/ATLAS since July 1, when Larry Denneau of the University of Hawaii first spied it using a telescope in Chile that's part of the globe-spanning Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Soon more powerful observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope, will scrutinize the object—which, thanks to its alien, interstellar provenance may be the oldest comet anyone has ever seen.

“I didn't get any sleep for like 35 hours,” says Bryce Bolin of Eureka Scientific in California, who rushed to release a preprint paper and arrange additional observations following 3I/ATLAS's discovery. “It ruined my weekend.”

Stefanie Milam of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is part of a group that had reserved time on JWST to observe an interstellar object—if the researchers were fortunate enough for one to be discovered. But the group's luck was tested when it couldn't reach the lead of its program—Martin Cordiner, also at Goddard—to kick the observations into action. “He was hiking in Maine when the object was discovered, and we could not reach him—he was completely off the grid,” Milam says. “When he finally got back, his phone just blew up. I said, ‘You're never allowed to go on vacation again!'”

So why exactly are astronomers so eager to observe this object, and what do they hope to learn?

The first major question to answer about 3I/ATLAS is its origin. Tracing it back to an individual star is likely impossible, given the mixing of myriad stars in their orbits around our galaxy across billions of years. But we might be able to work out roughly the region it came from.

One team of astronomers has already begun doing just that, using the high velocity of the object with respect to our sun—60 kilometers (37 miles) a second—to argue that it might have come from the vicinity of our galaxy's thick disk. This is a puffy torus of older stars moving at high velocities above and below the main flat plane of the Milky Way—which is where our sun serenely orbits.

A thick-disk origin might mean that 3I/ATLAS is extremely ancient, more than eight billion years old. “It's from a star that's potentially not even there anymore,” says Michele Bannister of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, a co-author on the work.

Aster Taylor of the University of Michigan performed a different age analysis based on the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and suggests the object is 11 billion to three billion years old. “We get similar answers,” Taylor says. Such estimates might soon be revised if subsequent observations can show just how much space weathering the object has endured during its interstellar sojourn.

This image shows the observation of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS when it was discovered on July 1, 2025.

Currently, 3I/ATLAS is inside the orbit of Jupiter and approaching the orbit of Mars, which it will cross in October, passing about 0.2 astronomical units (one fifth the Earth-sun distance) from the Red Planet.

Although early observations have led astronomers to categorize 3I/ATLAS as a comet, at the moment, it's not behaving exactly like one. The object doesn't display a large tail or enveloping coma of cast-off gas, only a hint of dust—but that is expected to change soon. As it traverses the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and basks in the sun's radiance, its surface should warm enough to sublimate ice, venting sufficient material to form a large coma and perhaps a prominent tail.

A substantial coma would be like a curtain drawn over astronomers' eyes, obscuring their view of the object and complicating efforts to gauge its dimensions. Before that happens, a team led by David Jewitt at the University of California, Los Angeles, is hoping to pin down its size with Hubble in August. (Other telescopes might be able to determine the size of 3I/ATLAS, too.)

Initial estimates suggested 3I/ATLAS might be up 20 kilometers (12 miles) across—very big for a comet—but most astronomers now think it is much smaller. “It's probably somewhere in the range of one or two kilometers,” says John Noonan at Auburn University in Alabama. That would be somewhat comparable in size to our first two interstellar visitors: 1I/ʻOumuamua, which was discovered in 2017 and was up to about 400 meters (0.25 mile) long, and 2I/Borisov, which was found in 2019 and was about one kilometer (0.6 mile) wide.

If 3I/ATLAS turns out to be much bigger, 10 kilometers (six miles) or more, this would pose problems for preexisting estimates of how many big interstellar objects reside in the galaxy. “It's statistically extremely unlikely we should ever see something that size,” Noonan says. “Theorists don't like that. But as an observer, I would love to see a really weird, big object.”

As well as its size, one of the key properties astronomers want to know about 3I/ATLAS is its rotation rate—something they might discern by watching the object's changing brightness as it spins. The spin of 3I/ATLAS could carry clues as to how the object was ejected from its home star in the first place.

“Certain ways of kicking these objects out tend to make them spin up,” Taylor says. A close pass of a gas giant planet, for instance, could easily set the object twirling while hurling it away from its home star. Conversely, a slow rotation period would suggest the object experienced a more gentle ejection.

“You could do this when stars die,” Taylor says. “They lose a lot of mass, and so the gravitational force on objects at the outer edge of their system goes away. Those objects become unbound and just flow out into the galaxy.”

The rotation period can also tell us more about the shape of 3I/ATLAS—a steady rotation suggests a fairly spherical form, whereas a fluctuating rotation speed might suggest a “wonky shape,” Taylor says, like that of ‘Oumuamua, which was estimated to be cigar- or pancake-shaped.

If 3I/ATLAS really is an ancient cometary castaway that has been drifting through the galaxy for eons, it might be full of ice that has never been heated by a star. If so, then as it gets closer, the object might suddenly erupt into activity. While that could be bad news for measuring its size, it would aid efforts to determine 3I/ATLAS's chemical composition.

JWST and Hubble would be best suited for the task of picking apart the different species of molecules that might erupt from 3I/ATLAS. Unfortunately, however, in October, when the object will be at its warmest, closest point to our star (called perihelion), Earth will be on the other side of the sun. This will make observations from our planet almost impossible.

In November, post-perihelion, Noonan will use Hubble to study 3I/ATLAS and its emissions, looking for signs of substances such as hydroxide and hydrogen that can help clarify its composition.

3I/ATLAS streaks across a dense star field in this image captured by the Gemini North telescope's Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-N). The image is composed of exposures taken through three filters, shown here as red, green and blue.

If the object is several billion years old, as predicted, then it might be rich in water because of the suspected formation environment around older stars. “You would expect a lot of hydrogen coming from these water-rich irradiated objects, if this is really as old as [thought],” Noonan says.

Milam and her colleagues, meanwhile, will use JWST in August and December to observe 3I/ATLAS before and after perihelion. Thanks to its keen infrared vision, JWST is better suited for teasing out the presence of molecules such as water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and ammonia.

“We can really home in and see what this thing looks like,” she says. “Borisov had a pretty boring chemistry, but it wasn't like any object in our solar system—there was hardly any water at all but a lot of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. With JWST, we're hoping to see a lot of carbon dioxide [on 3I/ATLAS], maybe even water, if it's as pristine as people are projecting.”

Although the overall view from Earth degrades as the object approaches perihelion, some telescopes will be less visually impaired. Those operated by the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, for instance, are primed to observe 3I/ATLAS at dawn and dusk, when the sun is below the horizon. This will allow for studies even when the object will be close to our star from our planet-bound perspective. “The Lowell Discovery Telescope is really well suited to observations close to the horizon,” says Nick Moskowitz, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory. “We will be able to track it closer in to perihelion than other facilities.”

An unlikely additional capability will be at Mars, where spacecraft such as NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter may be able to see 3I/ATLAS as it passes about 30 million kilometers (19 million miles) from the planet. “It'll be pretty large and apparent in the sky,” Noonan says, providing the object kicks into activity as hoped. “They'll be able to see the coma,” giving us an insight into 3I/ATLAS's activity near the sun that would otherwise be impossible to see from Earth.

A big unknown about 3I/ATLAS is whether it will actually survive its close encounter with our sun. While ‘Oumuamua did so, Comet Borisov was not so fortunate, with the object appearing to split and break apart on its way out of our solar system.

The same fate could befall 3I/ATLAS. “Borisov fragmented, which is pretty usual for comets,” Bannister says. All eyes will be on our latest visitor to see if the same thing happens again.

An additional quirk of 3I/ATLAS's survivability is the impact of solar wind, which may snip away any cometary tail as it is ejected. By chance, the object is entering our solar system at quite a shallow angle, much flatter than that of most comets and thus much closer to Earth's orbital plane, allowing careful comparisons between the solar wind in both places.

Sarah Watson of the University of Reading in England and her colleagues are using this quirk to study how the solar wind traverses into the outer solar system. “We can potentially calculate the speed of the solar wind,” she says, by noticing the impact of the solar wind on the purported comet's tail, if one materializes.

No spacecraft will be able to reach 3I/ATLAS. It is moving too fast and is too far from Earth for us to consider launching something in time.

Yet an upcoming European Space Agency (ESA) mission called Comet Interceptor, set to launch in 2029, might attempt to visit another interstellar object, if we find one within its reach. The spacecraft will be positioned past the moon's orbit away from the sun and, if a suitable target is found, will be commanded to fire its engines and try and intercept the incoming alien object.

If no suitable interstellar object is found, Comet Interceptor will instead be sent to one of several intriguing comets of our solar system. “It is possible we could get an interstellar object, but we have to be really lucky,” says Colin Snodgrass, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, who is deputy lead on the mission.

One of our biggest outstanding questions about interstellar objects concerns their unknown abundance. The object 3I/ATLAS is our third interstellar visitor in eight years—a real but weak hint of how many are out there, waiting to be found.

Predictions estimate there are trillions upon trillions of interstellar objects drifting around our galaxy, and perhaps one in our solar system at any given time—but they're typically just so faint that they're unlikely to be found by most telescopes. This is expected to change when a new telescope called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begins a 10-year survey of the sky later this year.

Rubin is expected to see somewhere between six and 51 interstellar objects in its 10-year survey. Seeing such a population will tell us “how unique, or varied, planetesimal formation is across different parts of the galaxy,” Bannister says, referring to kilometer-scale objects thought to coalesce around newborn stars that become the feedstock for planets—and, when kicked to a system's hinterlands, become a reservoir of comets.

One puzzling question is why we haven't seen much smaller interstellar objects, Moskowitz says. If smaller objects are more plentiful than larger objects, as scientists expect, then we should have seen some small interstellar objects entering our atmosphere, appearing as meteors streaking across Earth's skies at speeds and trajectories that clearly convey their interstellar origins.

Detections of such objects have been claimed, but the evidence behind them has failed to convince most experts. The apparent absence of small interstellar interlopers “is telling us something, but we don't know what that is yet,” Moskowitz says. “I think that's going to be one of the major questions: Why are we seeing these big cometlike things coming through the solar system, but we're not seeing things that are smaller? It may have to do with the survivability of stuff out there in the galaxy, but we need more data.”

The mysterious goo, which a marine superintendent found in a ship's rudder shaft housing comprised a whole new order of archaea.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Typically in Hollywood movies—no matter the genre—mysterious black goo isn't a good thing. The 1992 animated film FernGully: The Last Rainforest? Evil black goo. The Alien franchise prequel Prometheus? Evil black goo. Basically the entire 2018 Marvel film Venom is about evil black goo. The trope is everywhere, and it almost always portends ill fortune.

Luckily, when Doug Ricketts—Marine Superintendent at the Large Lake Observatory (LLO)—found a mysterious black goo tucked away in the R/V Blue Heron's rudder shaft during some routine maintenance, he disregarded these cultural warnings and brought a cup of the substance to researchers at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD). The sample eventually received the name “ShipGoo001” by LOO and UMD researcher Cody Sheik, who discovered that the mysterious substance actually contained microbial species unknown to science. 

“The biggest surprise was that the ship goo had life in it at all,” Sheik said in a press statement. “We thought we'd find nothing. But surprisingly, we found DNA and it wasn't too destroyed, nor was the biomass too low.”

It turns out that the rudder shaft of the Blue Heron provided the perfect habitat for a particular kind of archaea that prefers a semi-warm, stable environment with no oxygen. One big head-scratcher is how these anaerobic creatures got into the ship—which, after all, sails the oxygenated waters of the Great Lakes. Sheik's current theory is that the microbes could've lain dormant in an oil used to grease the rudder and simply waited for the perfect conditions to proliferate. 

Amazingly, the research team reconstructed 20 genomes from the goo. They then compared those genomes to a database of previously identified organisms, and according to Popular Science, one of the species represents an entire new order of archaea, while another might represent a new bacterial phylum. The team plans to make these genomes available to the public, as well as publish their results in a peer-reviewed journal in the near future. 

This isn't just a novel discovery. Some of the organisms appear to produce methane, which could be used in the production of biofuels. But the find shows that science often overlooks how the natural world interacts with human-made infrastructure. Sheik even mentions that he's explored extreme environments like hydrothermal vents or hot springs, but not so much ship rudder housings and other artificial structures. “ShipGoo001” is also a living, anaerobic testament to what can happen when scientists are allowed to explore their inherent curiosities.

“Scientists don't often have time to be playful—we're focused and have projects to complete,” Sheik said in a press statement. “Time and resources for exploratory work can be daunting. But this shows why it matters.”

The “missing link” helps adults grow new neurons—something long thought to end after childhood—and that discovery could lead to novel neurodegenerative treatments.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

It's well-understood that brain plasticity in children—including a process known as “neurogenesis,” which describes the creation of new neurons—is significantly greater than adults. And it doesn't take too much imagination to understand why evolution took this course. After all, children need to learn a lot of things really quickly, so forming new neurons (particularly in the hippocampus where learning, memory, and emotional regulation are located) makes a lot of sense. However, scientists have long wondered whether neurogenesis is an exclusive feature of growing up, or if adults continue to generate new neurons as well (albeit at lower rates).

In 2013, a team of scientists led by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, found evidence of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and other studies discovered the presence of stem cells and immature neurons. However, there remains a missing link: “neural progenitor cells,” which can differentiate into different neurons and glial cells. Now, the search is over. 

A new study—published earlier this month in the journal Science and featuring some of the same scientists who worked on the 2013 paper—reported evidence of these progenitor cells in adult brains, aged 20 to 78. A variety of examination methods and machine learning techniques allowed the researchers to identify the cells in an area of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus, which features prominently in learning, memory, and cognitive flexibility. 

“This gives us an important piece of the puzzle in understanding how the human brain works and changes during life,” Jonas Frisén, the senior author of the study from the Karolinska Institutet, said in a press statement. “We have now been able to identify these cells of origin, which confirms that there is an ongoing formation of neurons in the hippocampus of the adult brain.”

Identifying these well-hidden cells was far from a simple process. Frisén and his team first created a machine learning algorithm that could accurately identify neural progenitor cells by using the hippocampus samples from the brains of children donated for research after death. Because these cells look remarkably similar to progenitor cells found in mice, the team developed an AI that can spot the “molecular fingerprints of childhood progenitors and use that to identify these cells in adults,” Frisén told New Scientist.

When tested on mice, the model successfully identified 83 percent of the progenitor cells, and when tested on areas of the brain unaffiliated with neurogenesis (such as the cortex), it accurately recorded an absence of progenitor cells. The researchers then turned the model onto 14 hippocampus samples belonging to recently deceased donors between the ages of 20 and 78. To help things along, they used an antibody that identified dividing cells at the time of death, which helped to narrow things down by excluding mature neural cells. Once the samples had been run through their AI models, the team found that nine of those samples contained progenitor cells. Because they weren't universally present, and concentrations of the cells varied between individuals, scientists theorized that the presence of these cells in adults could be influenced by genetics or environment.

But the discovery of these progenitor cells is definitely good news for scientists hunting for effective ways to treat neurodegenerative diseases. If the means to create new neurons exist, future therapies might be able to use that biological fact to its advantage.

“Our research may also have implications for the development of regenerative treatments that stimulate neurogenesis in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders,” Frisén said in a press statement.

Turns out it's never too late to learn something new—our biology tells us so.

The Scottish Cafe, now in Lviv, Ukraine, housed mathematical discussions in the 1930s.Credit: Сергій via Wikimedia (CC BY 3.0)

On a Monday afternoon in April, the Szkocka Restaurant and Bar in Lviv, Ukraine, seems empty, except for two waiters, a maintenance worker on a ladder and the ghost of Frank Sinatra, whose song asks us to hold him in our arms. He's not the only ghost in the place, though.

I'm in Ukraine, researching the history of Stanisław Ulam, a mathematician, physicist and computer scientist who was born in Lviv, then in Poland, in 1909. Ulam went on to work on the US Manhattan Project, designing nuclear weapons. He also developed the Monte Carlo method for solving computational problems and established many proofs in pure and applied mathematics.

But it was in this restaurant — known in the 1930s as the Scottish Cafe — that Ulam, along with other prominent mathematical figures such as Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, sat for hours, bandying about ideas. Together, the group contributed to many areas of mathematics, including set theory, probability, functional analysis, group theory and topology.

Why probability probably doesn't exist (but it is useful to act like it does)

Why probability probably doesn't exist (but it is useful to act like it does)

They would write their calculations in pencil on the marble tabletops. But Banach's wife, Łucja Braus, dismayed that the work was getting wiped away by waiters, bought them a present: a lined notebook that would eventually be filled with mathematical challenges.

Any cafe patron could propose a solution to a problem for the chance to win a prize —often something small, such as a cup of coffee or a bottle of wine, or sometimes something more opulent or strange, such as, famously, a live goose.

These oddities helped to spread the book's fame. And the collection of 200 or so problems became known as The Scottish Book, a version of which can still be purchased today.

In its pages are workings that led Ulam to later co-author a paper elaborating on the ‘hairy ball theorem', which shows that, on any sphere in n dimensions, if there is a hair-like substance or current on it that is ‘combed' in one direction, there will always be a place where the directional combing cannot continue — a cowlick, in other words. Far from being a barbering quirk, the theorem has had applications in fields such as meteorology and fusion energy. The seeds of Banach's general theory of functional analysis are also in the Scottish Book.

Thus, in the 1930s, the Scottish Cafe became “the centre of [Lviv's] — and for a while the world's — mathematical universe”, as writer Chris Zielinski described in Histories of Computing in Eastern Europe (2019). Since then, universities, cities and companies have been trying, with varying success, to replicate this environment of a loose, productive exchange of ideas.

When I returned to the cafe the next day, Iryna Banakh (no relation), a mathematician at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, a few blocks away, told me a little bit about what went right.

Banach, who mentored Ulam and was the social centre of the group, “liked to work when it was very noisy”, she said, sitting at a table in the Szkocka. There was “a lot of music, a lot of conversations, and sometimes they played chess at the different tables”.

He “would spend most of his days in cafés, not only in the company of others but also by himself”, said the mathematician Andrzej Turowicz in Roman Kaluza's book Through a Reporter's Eyes (1996). “He liked the noise and the music. They did not prevent him from concentrating and thinking. There were cases when, after the cafés closed for the night, he would walk over to the railway station where the cafeteria was open around the clock. There, over a glass of beer, he would think about his problems.”

If this emphasis on controlled chaos, social interaction and free-wheeling exploration sounds familiar, it's because it is the basis for everything from child-led learning at Montessori schools to some courses at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, in which unconventional lecture-delivery models have been implemented.

But this is not necessarily a recipe for success in everyone's hands. Although Ulam had wonderful things to say about environments full of genial geniuses in his autobiography, Adventures of a Mathematician (1976), he was scathing about the 1930s mathematical community at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He found it full of overdone formality, bloated egos and people performing the act of work, rather than working productively and informally. However, he did find a better environment at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he taught in the 1940s.

There are some steps to nudge an academic community towards this type of collaboration.

Richard Florida's 2002 urban-construction manual, Rise of the Creative Class, says that well-built communities — such as the walkable square around the Scottish Cafe — are more likely to provide people with places to exchange ideas than are automotive exurbs that encourage isolation. After traversing eight lanes of suburban traffic to reach a cafe, you're unlikely to want to discuss Fourier transforms for five hours over coffees or beers.

Universities are beginning to see the importance of good infrastructure and quality of life for attracting students and faculty members. US college towns are increasingly working to replicate the pedestrian-accessible cafe environments found in Lviv and other European cities, such as Vienna and Prague. And some large institutions in small US cities, such as the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and the University of Maryland, College Park, have been encouraging the construction of tram and light-rail systems, viewing them as providing a competitive advantage.

Even in modern-day Lviv, which is already vibrant, there have been moves — in the middle of war, no less — to enhance that vibrancy with even better urban-rail infrastructure.

However, cities need to be positive, liveable places for everyone, not just those who can afford the latest Macbook. Indeed, the academics I talked with in Lviv made the point that the Scottish Cafe is now too expensive for late-night maths chats. Those have moved to a cheap pizza place elsewhere in the city, among other places, with Szkocka filling a more ceremonial niche for formal dinners in recent years.

In the 1930s, Banach chose the Scottish Cafe partly because it was cheap and would give him a lenient tab, unlike the cafe across the street, from which he fled when his debts grew too great. He was known to often linger over a single cup of coffee for hours at a time, spending barely any money.

Nickel-based materials can facilitate the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction to generate hydrocarbons up to C6. Here we show that fluorine doping alters the nature of the Ni active sites, which proves instrumental in tuning the selectivity of the CO2R. We interrogate the CO2R reaction mechanism using intermediate surrogates, including aldehydes, alkyl iodides and acetylene. Aldehydes are electroreduced to alcohols and deoxygenated intermediates. Among the latter, unsaturated hydrocarbon intermediates (RCH2−x*, where the asterisk represents surface-bound species and x = 1 or 2) reacting with *CO dictate chain propagation, modulated by competitive C–C coupling and C–H hydrogenation reactions. Compound branching in the hydrocarbons initiates from *CO coupling with two *CH2 species, and the branch-to-linear hydrocarbon ratio can be doubled using a pulsed potential strategy. An inverse H/D kinetic isotope effect promotes deuterated hydrocarbon formation with a Faradaic efficiency of 22.2%. This work reveals mechanisms and strategies for the conversion of CO2 into linear and branched hydrocarbons, thus advancing electrosynthetic fuel development.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) drug discovery has been hampered by patient heterogeneity, and the lack of sensitive tools for precise stratification. Here, we demonstrate that our robust and interpretable AI-guided tool (predictive prognostic model, PPM) enhances precision in patient stratification, improving outcomes and decreasing sample size for a AD clinical trial. The AMARANTH trial of lanabecestat, a BACE1 inhibitor, was deemed futile, as treatment did not change cognitive outcomes, despite reducing β-amyloid. Employing the PPM, we re-stratify patients precisely using baseline data and demonstrate significant treatment effects; that is, 46% slowing of cognitive decline for slow progressive patients at earlier stages of neurodegeneration. In contrast, rapid progressive patients did not show significant change in cognitive outcomes. Our results provide evidence for AI-guided patient stratification that is more precise than standard patient selection approaches (e.g. β-amyloid positivity) and has strong potential to enhance efficiency and efficacy of future AD trials.

Dementia presents a major global healthcare challenge, affecting more than 55 million individuals around the world, with a projected threefold increase over the next 50 years1. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant cause of dementia, accounts for 60–80% of dementia cases2. Effective treatments to prevent the onset, delay the progression, or modify the course of AD are urgently needed to reduce the global burden3. Despite decades of research and development, clinical trials of potential disease-modifying treatments for dementia have been largely unsuccessful. Cumulative expenditure on clinical-stage AD research and development is estimated to have reached $42.5 billion since 19954,5, and the cost to develop a treatment for AD from the preclinical stage to FDA approval is estimated to be $5.7 billion6. Recruitment and patient selection from diverse and qualified pools of volunteers7,8 often cause significant delays and contribute to the high failure rates of these trials4,5.

Recent positive phase three clinical trial results (i.e., lecanemab, donanemab)9,10 highlight the need for interventions earlier in the progression of disease when treatments may be maximally effective11,12 and have the potential to enhance patient outcomes. Yet, we still lack effective tools for precise stratification of patients at risk or early disease stages for inclusion in clinical trials. In particular, patient selection often relies on biomarkers (e.g., β-Amyloid) that are limited in predicting AD progression and treatment outcomes due to variability in amyloid binding and immune activation3,4,13,14. Further, up to a third of patients at early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stages may be misdiagnosed due to a lack of sensitive tools for early diagnosis. Including patients with symptoms due to comorbidities (e.g., anxiety or mood-related disorders) rather than dementia pathology in clinical trials may impact trial efficiency and costs (i.e., larger numbers of patients and longer recruitment are necessary), as well as confound efficacy signals due to increased heterogeneity in the patient sample. Further, including patients who have progressed to advanced disease stages may reduce the potential of targets (e.g., amyloid removal targets) to be effective3,15,16,17.

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) algorithms provide a turning point in precise patient stratification in early dementia stages. We have developed and validated a robust and interpretable predictive prognostic model (PPM) that extends beyond binary patient classification approaches and predicts not only whether but also how fast individuals at early stages of the disease (MCI) or even pre-symptomatic stages (Cognitive Normal, CN) may progress to AD18,19. PPM has been tested on independent real-world patient data from memory clinics and validated against longitudinal clinical outcomes20. PPM delivers an AI-guided marker of future cognitive health that predicts progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical assessments (i.e., cognitive data, MRI scan)20 and biomarkers typically used for patient inclusion in clinical trials (i.e., β-Amyloid positivity)19, offering potential to reduce misdiagnosis and optimize patient stratification.

Here, we test whether employing the PPM to improve patient stratification may change the outcome and efficiency of a randomized phase 2/3 clinical trial (AMARANTH, NCT02245737). AMARANTH tested the effect of lanabecestat (AZD3293, LY3314814), a brain-permeable inhibitor of human beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1/β-secretase)21. BACE1 was considered to be a promising therapeutic target for slowing disease progression in AD by preventing the generation of Aβ peptides, reducing the effects of Aβ toxicity and the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. The objective of the trial was to test the efficacy of lanabecestat in slowing cognitive decline in patients diagnosed with MCI due to AD or mild AD. Despite lanabecestat reducing β-amyloid, the readout of the trial was deemed unsuccessful, and the trial was terminated early due to a lack of significant changes in primary cognitive outcomes.

We employed the PPM— trained on research data (ADNI) —to re-stratify individuals in the AMARANTH trial data (independent test data) into slow vs. rapid progressive based on baseline data (i.e., week 1, before treatment). In contrast to the futility assessment, we demonstrate significant treatment effects on primary trial outcomes. In particular, we test the effect of lanabecestat (20 mg vs. 50 mg) on outcomes (β-amyloid, cognition: CDR-SOB, ADAS-Cog13) separately for slow vs. rapid progressive individuals. Our results demonstrate 46% slowing of cognitive decline (as measured by CDR-SOB) for the slow rather than the rapid progressive group following treatment with lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo. That is, patients stratified by the PPM as slow progressive at earlier stages of neurodegeneration showed slowing of cognitive decline related to β-amyloid reduction due to treatment. Further, we show that using PPM for patient stratification substantially decreases the sample size necessary for identifying significant changes in cognitive outcomes. Our results suggest that using PPM to stratify patients for clinical trials has strong potential to enhance their efficiency (faster and cheaper) and efficacy (more reliable outcomes), as the right patients are included in the trials at the right time.

PPM adopts a trajectory modeling approach based on Generalized Metric Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ)18,19 that leverages multimodal data to make predictions about future cognitive decline at early dementia stages by iteratively adjusting class-specific prototypes and learning class boundaries (Supplementary Material: Predictive prognostic model). GMLVQ incorporates a full metric tensor to provide a robust distance measure (metric) tuned to the classification task. We trained the PPM on baseline data from ADNI (n = 256) to discriminate Clinically Stable (n = 100) from Clinically Declining (n = 156) patients, using β-Amyloid, APOE4, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) GM density. Employing ensemble learning with cross-validation and majority voting showed 91.1% classification accuracy (0.94 AUC: Area Under Curve) with sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 94.2% (Supplementary Table S1; Precision: 93.8%, F1 score: 90.5%). Note that discriminating Clinically Stable vs. declining individuals comprises a finer classification task compared to previous work focusing on patient (AD) vs. healthy (cognitive normal) classifications22,23, where signals are more discriminable and may result in higher model performance. The difference between sensitivity and specificity is likely due to weaker signals for the clinically declining compared to the stable class. Thus, achieving higher than 90% accuracy and precision provides evidence for PPM robustness.

Further, the PPM architecture is transparent and interpretable. First, interrogating the metric tensors allows us to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction (Fig. 1A). In particular, the metric tensors indicate that β-amyloid burden is the most discriminative feature compared to MTL GM density and APOE4. This is consistent with the role of β-amyloid and MTL atrophy as markers of Alzheimer's pathology, consistent with the NIA-AA 2018 diagnostic framework of AD24

A PPM metric tensor based on training the PPM on MTL Gray Matter (GM) Density, β-Amyloid, and APOE 4 for model training. The color scale represents values for each cell in the metric tensor, with diagonal terms summing to 1. The diagonal terms show strong contribution of β-amyloid burden (weight: 0. 51) compared to Gray matter density (weight: 0. 34) and APOE 4 (weight: 0. 15). B PPM-derived prognostic index for an independent ADNI validation dataset (n = 419): Box plots of PPM-derived prognostic index showing significant differences between Cognitive Normal: CN, Mild Cognitive Impairment: MCI, Alzheimer's Disease: AD (Kruskal-Wallis H two-sided tests, p < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected). Notches in the box plots indicate the median, the solid black box represents the 25th to 75th percentile, the black horizontal lines represent the range of the data, black circles indicate outliers, and non-overlapping notches indicate significantly different medians (p < 0.05). PPM-derived prognostic index below 0 indicates stable, above 1 indicates rapid progressive, and between 0 and 1 indicates slow progressive individuals. Dashed lines indicate boundaries between stable vs. slow progressive (red) and rapid progressive (green) based on a multinomial logistic regression testing the relationship of the PPM-derived prognostic index to the rate of future tau accumulation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Second, interrogating the off-diagonal terms of the metric tensor allows us to understand the feature interactions that contribute to the model's prediction. In particular, we observed a positive interaction between baseline β-amyloid burden and APOE 4, while a negative interaction between baseline β-amyloid burden and MTL GM density, consistent with the role of β-amyloid and APOE 4 as risk factors for progression to AD.

Third, the PPM prototypes (one per class: clinically stable, progressive) indicate the most discriminative class representatives and allow us to predict an individual's trajectory. That is, using the GMLVQ-Scalar Projection method, we estimate the distance (based on the learnt metric tensor) of an independent test dataset from the Clinically Stable prototype and determine the PPM-derived prognostic index for each individual, allowing individualized prognosis beyond binary clinical labels (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Material: GMLVQ-Scalar Projection). In particular, we extracted the PPM-derived prognostic index for each individual in an independent ADNI sample (out-of-sample validation, n = 419; cognitive normal individuals n = 119, patients with MCI n = 150, patients with AD n = 150). We then used multinomial logistic regression to capture the relationship of the PPM-derived prognostic index to the rate of future tau accumulation and determine boundaries for quartile classes that differ in likelihood of disease progression. We scaled the boundaries so that PPM-derived prognostic index indicates individuals who are more likely to: (1) remain stable (PPM index values below 0 fall within the 20th percentile of the future tau accumulation slope), (2) experience rapid progression (PPM index values higher than 1 fall above the 60th percentile of future tau accumulation), (3) experience slower progression (PPM index between 0 and 1)18,19. Our results (Fig. 1B) showed that the PPM-derived prognostic index was significantly different across groups (Kruskal-Wallis H test χ(2) = 121.46, p < 0.001), with a significantly higher index (Bonferroni corrected) for AD vs. MCI and CN (p < 0.001), MCI vs. CN (p < 0.001). This validation against clinical outcomes (i.e., diagnosis) provides evidence that the PPM-derived prognostic score is clinically relevant.

We used the PPM trained on ADNI data to extract the PPM-derived prognostic index from AMARANTH patients (Supplementary Tables S2, S3 for sample sizes) with: APOE4 at week 1, structural MRI (MTL GM density), florbetapir PET (β-amyloid) scans at three time points (week 1, 52, 104), and cognitive measures (CDR-SOB, ADAS-Cog13) at three time points (week 1, 52, 104). In particular, using the GMLVQ-Scalar Projection method, we estimated the distance of each patient in the AMARANTH dataset at baseline (week 1) from the Clinically Stable prototype, determined the PPM-derived prognostic index for each individual in the AMARANTH sample and stratified individuals as slow vs. rapid progressive based on baseline (week 1) data (Fig. 2A; the sample size for stable was small (n = 5) and these data were excluded from further analysis). There were no significant differences in the PPM-derived prognostic index between treatment groups at baseline (Kruskal-Wallis H test χ(2) = 2.9733, p = 0.2261; Fig. 2B). Interestingly, individuals in the slow progressive group showed lower β-amyloid burden (t (330.22) = 11.833, p < 0.001), higher MTL GM density (t (326.33) = −17.351, p < 0.001) and better performance in cognitive tests (i.e., lower CDR-SOB (t(911.03) = 6.38, p < 0.001) and ADAS-Cog13 (t (806.77) = 5.23, p < 0.001)) compared to the rapid progressive group at baseline. These results suggest that individuals stratified as slow progressive by the PPM were at earlier stages of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline compared to individuals stratified as rapid progressive, corroborating the link of the PPM-derived prognostic score to cognitive decline and disease progression. Note that only 7.5% of the patients included in the trial had β-amyloid less than 50 centiloid, indicating intermediate or high likelihood of AD, and making it harder to stratify into subgroups based on β-amyloid alone. However, training the PPM on multimodal data (rather than β-amyloid alone) allowed a more precise stratification to subgroups at earlier vs. later disease progression stages.

A Scatter plot of β-Amyloid against MTL GM density for AMARANTH baseline data (week 1) for placebo, lanabecestat 20 mg, lanabecestat 50 mg. Red dots indicate data for Slow progressive; green dots indicate data for Rapid progressive individuals. Individuals with higher β-Amyloid and lower GM density are stratified as Rapid progressive by the PPM model. Individuals with lower β-Amyloid and higher GM density are stratified as Slow progressive by the PPM model. B PPM-derived prognostic index for AMARANTH data at baseline (week 1): Box plots showing no significant differences in the PPM-derived prognostic index between treatment groups (placebo, lanabecestat 20 mg, lanabecestat 50 mg) at baseline (sample size: Supplementary Table S2, S3). Notches in the box plots indicate the median, the solid black box represents the 25th to 75th percentile, the black horizontal lines represent the range of the data, and black circles indicate outliers. PPM-derived prognostic index below 0 indicates stable, above 1 indicates rapid progressive, and between 0 and 1 indicates slow progressive individuals. Dashed lines indicate boundaries between stable vs. slow progressive (red) and rapid progressive (green) based on a multinomial logistic regression testing the relationship of the PPM-derived prognostic index to the rate of future tau accumulation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We tested whether stratifying the AMARANTH dataset based on the PPM-derived index at baseline (week 1) shows treatment effects on β-Amyloid. In particular, we used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM; Supplementary Table S4), to test Treatment (placebo, 20 mg, 50 mg) effects across timepoints (week 1, 52, 104) for each PPM-stratified group (Slow vs. Rapid progressive).

We observed (Fig. 3A) a significant decrease in β-Amyloid for lanabecestat 20 mg and lanabecestat 50 mg treatment compared to placebo over time (week 104 compared to week 1). This decrease in β-Amyloid was observed for both PPM-stratified groups (Slow, Rapid progressive). In particular, MMRM analysis including fixed effects for treatment, timepoint, PPM-stratified group showed significant main effect of Timepoint (F(2, 485.43) = 37.01, p < 0.001) and PPM-stratified group (F(1, 489.19) = 84.04, p < 0.001), significant interactions for Treatment × Timepoint (F(4, 484.87) = 10.27, p < 0.001) and PPM-stratified group x Timepoint (F(2, 485.46) = 8.38, p < 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons showed that this PPM-stratified group x Timepoint interaction was significant for the lanabecestat 20 mg (F(2, 184.22) = 5.36, p < 0.01) and lanabecestat 50 mg (F(2, 146.80) = 3.47, p < 0.05) but not the placebo (F(2,152.76) = 1.20, p = 0.3033) group.

Further, computing change in β-Amyloid burden over time (week 104 minus week 1) corroborated these results showing significantly higher reduction in β-Amyloid for lanabecestat 20 mg and lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo for both the slow and rapid progressive group (Fig. 3B). In particular, we observed significantly higher reduction of β-Amyloid for a) lanabecestat 20 mg vs. placebo (Welch's Two Sample t test: Slow progressive group: t(55.289) = 2.95, p < 0.001; Rapid progressive group: t(154.29) = 4.10, p < 0 0.001) b) lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo (Welch's Two Sample t test: Slow progressive group: t(62.362) = 3.86, p < 0.001, Rapid progressive group: t(112.53) = 5.00, p < 0.001). Further, we observed stronger reduction in β-Amyloid due to treatment for the rapid (21.91 % change) than slow (17.14 % change) progressive group (Welch's Two Sample t test: lanabecestat 20 mg: t(73.062) = 3.31, p < 0.01; lanabecestat 50 mg: t(94.62) = 2.54, p = 0.013). This result was potentially due to the higher β-Amyloid burden for the rapid compared to the slow progressive group at baseline (week 1; t(330.22) = 11.83, p < 0.001).

Finally, similar analyses in the All Progressive group (n = 434, including individuals from the slow and rapid progressive groups) showed a significant reduction in β-Amyloid due to treatment over time compared to the placebo group. In particular, MMRM analysis showed a significant main effect of timepoint (F(2,482.33) = 55.65, p < 0.001) and significant interactions of treatment x timepoint (F(4,481.95) = 12.87, p < 0.001). Comparing Least-square means (LSM) for treatment effects over time (week 104 vs. week 1) across progressive groups showed lower LSM for the Rapid progressive than the All Progressive group for treatment (lanabecestat 20 mg, lanabecestat 50 mg) compared to placebo (Supplementary Table S5). In particular, we observed the lowest LSM for lanabecestat 50 mg for the Rapid Progressive group (LSM = − 25.38, SE = 3.28; placebo group: LSM = − 3.71, SE = 2.90) compared to the Slow Progressive group (LSM = −14.04, SE = 3.10; placebo group: LSM = 3.48, SE = 3.21) and All Progressive group (LSM = − 19.674, SE = 2.43), consistent with the result previously reported for the AMARANTH trial21 (LSM = − 19.74, SE = 1.97).

Taken together, these results suggest that PPM-derived stratification provides a more sensitive tool for assessing treatment effects, showing stronger β-Amyloid reduction due to lanabecestat treatment in the rapid progressive group than across all progressive individuals or the whole sample considered in the AMARANTH trial.

We tested whether stratifying the AMARANTH dataset based on the PPM-derived index at baseline (week 1) shows treatment effects on cognitive outcomes (CDR-SOB, ADAS-Cog13). In particular, we used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM; Supplementary Table S4), to test Treatment (placebo, 20 mg, 50 mg) effects across timepoints (week 1, 52, 104) for each PPM-stratified group (Slow vs. Rapid progressive).

We observed an overall increase in CDR-SOB scores over time (week 104 vs. week 1), suggesting progression in dementia symptoms (Fig. 4A). However, for the Slow progressive group, we observed a significant decrease in CDR-SOB scores for lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo at week 104, suggesting slowing down of dementia progression (Fig. 4A). In particular, MMRM analysis showed: a) significant interactions: PPM-stratified group x Treatment x Timepoint (F(4, 2173.3) = 2.62, p < 0.05), Treatment × Timepoint (F(4, 2172.8) = 2.20, p = 0.067), PPM-stratified group x Treatment (F(2, 1866.4) = 2.51, p = 0.08), PPM-stratified group x Timepoint (F(2, 2163.7) = 14.72, p < 0.001); b) significant main effects of PPM-stratified group (F(1, 1809.1) = 35.70, p < 0.001), Treatment (F(2, 1870.5) = 3.00., p = 0.05), Timepoint (F(2, 2190.7) = 24.08, p < 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons showed that PPM-stratified group x Timepoint interaction was significant for the lanabecestat 20 mg (F(2, 716.64) = 4.301, p = 0.014) and lanabecestat 50 mg (F(2, 709.67) = 15.28, p < 0.001) but not the placebo (F(2, 720.26) = 0.96, p = 0.38) group.

Asterisks indicate significant differences between slow progressive individuals in the 50 mg treatment group vs. placebo. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Further, computing change in CDR-SOB scores over time (week 104 minus week 1) corroborated these results showing significant reduction in CDR-SOB scores (Welch's Two Sample t test, t (84.762) = 2.4475, p = 0.016) for lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo for the slow progressive group (Fig. 4B). In particular, the slow progressive group showed 33.64 % change in CDR-SOB scores over time compared to higher change in the a) Rapid progressive (80.84%) in the lanabecestat 50 mg group, b) the Slow (77.13%) and Rapid (70.41 %) in the placebo group. That is, the slow progressive group treated with lanabecestat 50 mg showed 46% reduction in cognitive decline compared to the placebo group, suggesting slowing of dementia progression for individuals stratified by the PPM as slow progressive. In contrast, no significant differences in CDR-SOB scores were observed for a) lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo in the rapid progressive group t(153.96) = − 0.26, p = 0.80, b) lanabecestat 20 mg compared to placebo in the slow (t(66.073) = 0.41, p = 0.68) or rapid (t (186.19) = − 0.53, p = 0.60) progressive group.

Similar MMRM analyses for the All Progressive group (n = 1354, including individuals in the slow and rapid progressive groups) showed significant main effects of Timepoint (F(2,2195.0) = 23.68, p < 0.001) and Treatment (F(2,1883.7) = 3.68, p = 0.03), but no significant Treatment x Timepoint interaction (F(4, 2176.9) = 2.00, p = 0.09). Further, we did not observe significant changes in CDR-SOB scores over time (week 104 minus week 1) for lanabecestat 20 mg (Welch's Two Sample t test, t (266.93) = − 0.35, p = 0.72) nor lanabecestat 50 mg (Welch's Two Sample t test, t (242.09) = 1.16, p = 0.25) compared to placebo. These results are consistent with the lack of significant slowing of cognitive decline due to treatment, as previously reported for the AMARANTH trial21.

Comparing Least-square means (LSM) for treatment effects over time (week 104 vs. week 1) across progressive groups showed lower LSM for the Slow progressive than the Rapid and All Progressive group for treatment compared to placebo (Supplementary Table S5). In particular, we observed the lowest LSM for lanabecestat 50 mg in the Slow Progressive group (LSM = 1.03, SE = 0.25; placebo group LSM = 2.21, SE = 0.24), compared to the Rapid Progressive group (LSM = 2.86, SE = 0.20); placebo group LSM = 2.74, SE = 0.18) and the All Progressive group (LSM = 1.97, SE = 0.16), consistent with the result observed when the whole clinical trial sample was previously analyzed (LSM = 3.17, SE = 0.18).

Finally, MMRM analyses showed a similar reduction (39%) in ADAS-Cog13 scores for the slow progressive group compared to placebo (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In particular, we observed a significant PPM-stratified group x Timepoint interaction (F(2, 2162.8) = 10.37, p < 0.001) but no other significant interactions (Supplementary Table S4). Post-hoc comparisons showed that PPM-stratified group x Timepoint interaction was significant across all groups (lanabecestat 20 mg: F(2, 719.95) = 3.31, p = 0.03, lanabecestat 50 mg: F(2, 706.74) = 6.83, p < 0.001, placebo: F(2, 720.14) = 4.53, p = 0.011), suggesting that the lack of significant treatment effect may be due to differences over time in ADAS-Cog13 in the placebo group. For lanabecestat 50 mg, computing change in ADAS-Cog13 scores over time (week 104 minus week 1) showed lower change (18.62 %) for the Slow progressive group than the Rapid progressive (42.99 %) and for Slow (30.77%) and Rapid (33.62%) in the placebo group; that is, for the Slow progressive group we observed similar treatment effects as for CDR-SOB. However, this reduction in ADAS-Cog13 scores (39% reduction compared to placebo) was not statistically significant (Welch's Two Sample t test, t (78.854) = 0.90, p = 0.37) for lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo for the slow progressive group (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

Considering LSM for treatment effects over time (week 104 vs. week 1) showed similar results with the analysis of CDR-SOB. That is, LSM was lower for the Slow progressive than the Rapid progressive, All Progressive group and the whole clinical trial sample for lanabecestat 50 mg compared to placebo (Supplementary Table S5). Taken together, these results suggest that PPM-derived stratification provides a more sensitive tool for assessing treatment effects, providing evidence for slowing of cognitive decline in the slow rather than the rapid progressive group; that is, lanabecestat 50 mg may slow disease progression at earlier stages of neurodegeneration.

We asked whether treatment has an effect on PPM-guided stratification; that is, whether patients stratified as slow progressive using the PPM-derived prognostic score at baseline (week 1) remain in the slow progressive or transition to the rapid progressive group when stratified based on the PPM-derived prognostic score at week 104. For the placebo, we expected that individuals will transition from the slow to the rapid progressive group due to neurodegeneration. We reasoned that treatment may slow dementia progression, resulting in a lower number of individuals in the slow group transitioning to rapid progression.

Our results showed that treatment decreased the PPM-derived score compared to placebo, suggesting that treatment slowed cognitive decline (Fig. 5). In particular, a three-way ANOVA on the PPM-derived scores showed a significant Treatment x Timepoint interaction (F(2, 562) = 3.16, p < 0.05) but not a significant PPM-stratified group x Treatment x Timepoint x (F(2, 562) = 0.08, p = 0.92). That is, we observed a higher increase in the PPM-derived scores in the placebo group rather than the treatment (lanabecestat 20 mg, lanabecestat 50 mg) groups over time. In particular, for the placebo group, 60% of individuals in the slow progressive group transitioned to rapid progressive, consistent with increased neurodegeneration over time. Treatment with lanabecestat 20 mg decreased this to 44.4% (χ² (1) = 7.36, p < 0.01) while lanabecestat 50 mg to 33.3% (lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo: χ² (1) = 7.36, p < 0.001). In contrast, individuals in the placebo group stratified as rapid progressive at baseline (week 1) remained mostly in this group rather than transitioning to the slow progressive group; that is, the percentage of individuals that remained in the rapid progressive group across weeks (week 1, 104) were 98.5% for the placebo, 95.8% for the lanabecestat 20 mg and 96.2% for the lanabecestat 50 mg group. Taken together, these results provide additional evidence that lanabecestat 50 mg may slow dementia progression at earlier stages of neurodegeneration, that is for individuals stratified by the PPM at baseline as slow rather than rapid progressive.

Percentage of patients in each treatment group (placebo, lanabecestat 20 mg, lanabecestat 50 mg) transitioning between PPM-stratified groups (slow vs. rapid progressive) from baseline to week 104. There is a reduction in the percentage of patients transitioning from the slow progressive group (red) at baseline to the rapid progressive group (green) at week 104 compared to placebo. Conversely, there is an increase in the percentage of patients transitioning from the rapid progressive group at baseline to the slow progressive at week 104 compared to placebo. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In light of our findings showing that lanabecestat 50 mg may slow dementia progression as measured by a decrease in CDR-SOB scores in the slow progressive group, we asked whether PPM-guided stratification reduces the sample size necessary for future clinical trials. We conducted power calculations to estimate the sample size needed when comparing lanabecestat 50 mg to placebo (i.e., decrease in CDR-SOB change between week 104 and week 1). Figure 6 shows that including slow progressive individuals based on PPM-guided stratification, reduces drastically the sample size necessary.

Power (1-beta) of detecting a significant treatment effect (lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo) for CDR-SOB change (week 104 minus week 1) at different sample sizes and alpha level of 0.05. Smaller sample size (90% redcution) is needed to detect treatment effects on cognitive outcomes for the Slow (red; effect size: Cohen's d = 0.51) compared to the All Progressive (blue; effect size: Cohen's d = 0.15) group. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In particular, for the slow progressive group, we observed a significant moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.51) for CDR-SOB change in lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo (t(84.76) = 2.45; p = 0.016). We estimated that for this effect size, a sample size of n = 82 per group (lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo) would be required for 90% power at alpha 0.05, (n = 117 at alpha = 0.01, n = 164 at alpha 0.001). In contrast, power calculations for all progressive group (i.e., including both slow and rapid progressive individuals) showed that a sample size of n = 762 per group would be required for a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.15); i.e., significant change in lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo and 90% power at alpha 0.05 (n = 1198 at alpha = 0.01, n = 1760 at alpha 0.001). This is consistent with the lack of significant treatment effect on cognitive outcomes that was observed in the AMARANTH trial (n = 1380 for both lanabecestat 50 mg and placebo). Redesigning the AMARANTH trial to include only individuals stratified by the PPM at baseline as slow progressive would result to 90.00% reduction in sample size at alpha 0.01 (lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo at week 104), compared to the sample size for the all progressive group included in the AMARANTH trial.

Recruiting the right patients at early disease stages is key to efficient clinical trials, maximizing the potential to reveal treatment effects. Patient heterogeneity and lack of sensitive tools for stratification at early stages of dementia pose a major challenge for AD drug discovery. To address this challenge, we built a robust and interpretable clinical-AI tool (PPM) based on a multimodal machine learning approach that supports feature extraction, precise patient classification to clinically stable vs. progressive and trajectory modeling to derive individualized patient prognosis. We have previously shown that the PPM predicts progression to AD at early dementia stages more precisely than standard clinical markers (i.e., gray matter atrophy, cognitive decline, β-amyloid positivity) or clinical diagnosis18,19,20. Here, we demonstrate that the PPM provides a robust tool for patient stratification and inclusion/exclusion in clinical trials with strong potential impact for drug discovery in the following key respects.

First, we demonstrate that the PPM provides a more sensitive tool for patient stratification than standard approaches used for patient selection in clinical trials (e.g., β-amyloid positivity). It is important to know that the PPM was pretrained on research data (ADNI) and tested on the AMARANTH data (independent sample), supporting its utility as a patient stratification tool for clinical trials. Using the PPM to re-stratify the patients included in the AMARANTH trial showed treatment effects on outcomes, despite the fact that the trial had been deemed futile. In particular, the PPM predicted whether patients would progress to AD slowly vs. rapidly based on baseline data (i.e., week 1 before treatment). Testing the effect of treatment over 24 months (lanabecestat 20 mg vs. lanabecestat 50 mg) provides evidence that the slow progressive group showed not only a reduction in β-amyloid but, importantly 46% reduction in cognitive decline (i.e., decrease in CDR-SOB) compared to placebo. This is in contrast to the rapid progressive group that showed higher reduction in β-amyloid but no significant difference in cognitive outcomes compared to placebo. We observed a similar slowing of cognitive decline (39%) for ADASCog-13, consistent with previous trials suggesting that ADAS-Cog may be less sensitive in capturing cognitive decline at early dementia stages25. Our results are consistent with the findings from—recently FDA and MHRA approved—anti-amyloid antibody target (lecanemab, donanemab) phase 3 trials9,10; e.g., lecanemab was shown to slow the rate of cognitive decline by 27%9. Although these are independent trials that cannot be directly compared, our results suggest that our AI-guided patient stratification has strong potential to enhance the efficacy of trials and aid the discovery of new treatments.

Second, individuals stratified by the PPM as slow progressive were shown to be at earlier stages of neurodegeneration based on baseline measurements (i.e., higher gray matter density, lower β-amyloid and better cognitive scores) compared to individuals in the rapid progressive group. AD develops gradually, involving a cascade of pathophysiological events beginning with the deposition of β-amyloid that may promote widespread pathological tau protein accumulation, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment26. It is likely that individuals in the rapid progressive group had progressed to later stages of neurocognitive decline, when it was too late for the lanabecestat treatment to be effective in slowing cognitive decline, despite the fact that it resulted in β-amyloid reduction. Interestingly, most patients in the trial were stratified by the PPM as rapid progressive; therefore, when all individuals in the trial were considered, the results were similar to the rapid progressive group; that is, reduction in β-amyloid but no significant changes in cognitive decline were observed. This is consistent with recent work suggesting that the timing of β-amyloid removal during a clinical trial is key for the trial success. If patients are too advanced at the start of the trial, or the underlying disease has progressed to a more advanced stage during the course of treatment because β-amyloid was not removed early enough, treatments may be less effective3. Evidence from previous trials of both successful and unsuccessful anti-β-amyloid therapies suggests that there is little clinical effect of amyloid removal if patients progressed past the mild dementia phase16,27. Further, recent clinical trial results (i.e., lecanemab, donanemab)9,10 showing decline in cognitive symptoms highlight the importance for treatments earlier in disease progression before damage has settled in the brain and when treatments may be more likely to be effective11,12. Finally, previous phase II and III trials of BACE inhibitors have shown a robust relationship between dose and degree of β-amyloid reduction, suggesting that a lower dose may be more effective at early stages of the disease28. Our results showing slowing of cognitive decline for the higher lanabecestat dose (50 mg vs. 20 mg) for the slow progressive group suggest that higher dose of BACE inhibition may be more effective over a 24-month treatment period, as in the AMARANTH trial.

Our modeling approach has the potential to redefine inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials, reducing patient heterogeneity that is known to hamper statistical power29. We have previously shown20 that our multimodal clinical AI marker (i.e., PPM-derived prognostic index) that captures the multivariate relationships across predictors is more sensitive in early prediction and prognosis of AD than standard clinical markers (β-amyloid, gray matter atrophy, cognitive scores). This is consistent with previous work demonstrating the benefit of integrating multimodal biomarkers for predicting future changes in cognition23,30,31,32,33,34. Further, PPM implements a trajectory modeling approach extending beyond binary classifications22 based on clinical labels (e.g., CN vs AD) that are poorly constrained; that is, individual patients at the class boundary that differ only slightly in their trajectory may be misclassified35. In contrast, our PPM-derived clinical AI marker provides a continuous index of future cognitive health from baseline data, reducing misdiagnosis associated with clinical labels and aiding patient stratification based on prognosis (i.e., predicted progression to AD).

Third, the GMLVQ framework with ensemble learning that we adopt in our PPM enables us to develop: a) robust models36,37by combining data from multiple disease-relevant modalities, rather than considering single data types, b) interpretable models for early dementia prediction and prognosis, that is key for trusted clinical-AI solutions. In particular, interrogating the model metric tensors allows us to assess the contribution of different features (i.e., predictors and their interactions) to patient stratification and determine the most predictive data types to include in clinical trials. Further, estimating the distance (based on the trained PPM metric tensors) of an independent test dataset (AMARANTH sample) from the Clinically Stable prototype allows us to predict individual patient trajectories, re-stratify the trial sample and test treatment effects in slow vs. rapid progressive groups. This has the potential to accelerate clinical trials and reduce the costs associated with data collection by (a) focusing on key data types to be collected for patient stratification and treatment outcome assessment, (b) tailoring treatment targets to the right patient groups at different stages of disease progression. Integrating novel markers (e.g., blood biomarkers, digital markers from wearable technologies) for dementia diagnosis into our multimodal modeling approach provides the potential to move to less-invasive and more cost-effective clinical trials.

Finally, we show that using PPM for patient stratification substantially decreases the sample size necessary for identifying significant changes in treatment outcomes. Recruitment and retention of a large number of qualified, diverse volunteers to participate in clinical research studies remain key barriers to the successful completion of AD clinical trials7,8. Thus, identifying the right patients at earlier stages for neurodegeneration to include in clinical trials decreases sample heterogeneity and size with strong potential to enhance trial efficiency (faster and cheaper). A possible limitation is that the PPM was trained with biomarker data (β-amyloid, gray matter density) from PET and MRI scans. We have previously shown that PPM reliably predicts cognitive decline when trained with cognitive data alone; yet, adding biomarker data enhances the precision of patient18,19,20. Future work is needed to test whether training the PPM with less-invasive and cost-effective data types (e.g., blood markers, cognitive tests) would provide a reliable stratification tool, reducing further costs and patient burden, and enhancing the efficiency of AD clinical trials.

In sum, there is increasing interest in adopting AI tools for clinical trial optimization and drug discovery13,38,39,40,41,42. With trials lasting around 18 months for dementia that typically spans decades, enriching clinical trials with the right patients for specific targets is fundamental to clinical trial outcomes, may account for past failures43 and inform go / no-go decisions44. Clinical AI tools have the potential to play a key role in improving trial design by assisting trial enrichment with the right patients classified prior to enrollment based on AI-guided stratification. Further, including data from underrepresented groups that may be disproportionately affected by dementia is key for tackling the global dementia challenge and developing precision medicine interventions. Our vision is to scale up our predictive prognostic modeling approach to a responsible AI-guided stratification system that will support smarter multi-arm multi-stage trials, accelerating new target discovery for dementia treatment.

We used data from: (1) a research cohort (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI) for PPM training with within-sample cross-validation (n = 256) and independent test (n = 419), (2) a Randomized Clinical Trial cohort (AMARANTH, n = 1354), as independent test dataset for out-of-sample validation (see Supplementary Material for more information on ADNI and AMARANTH samples, including Patients, Randomization, and Blinding). All data were collected in accordance with ethics approvals at each site and following ethical guidelines (Declaration of Helsinki), including informed consent from participants and approved by the ethics committees at each site.

AMARANTH is a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global clinical trial of Drug Substance: lanabecestat21. Lanabecestat is a brain-permeable inhibitor of human Beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BRACE1/β-secretase). Patients enrolled in the trial were diagnosed with MCI due to AD or mild AD. The objective of the trial was to test the efficacy of lanabecestat 20 mg lanabecestat and lanabecestat 50 mg (compared to placebo) in slowing AD decline at the end of the double-blind, placebo-controlled period compared to baseline. AD decline was measured by changes in cognition (primary outcome: ADAS-Cog13: 13-item Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale; secondary outcomes: CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating–sum of boxes, MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination). AMARANTH was terminated early (approximately 16 months prior to planned completion) due to futility analysis. Because of this early termination, we included data from the placebo-controlled periods of the study (weeks: 1, 52, 104; Supplementary Table S2, S3) from patients with: APOE4 at week 1, structural MRI, florbetapir PET (β-amyloid) scans at three time points (week 1, 52, 104), and cognitive measures (CDR-SOB, ADAS-Cog13) at three time points (week 1, 52, 104).

ADNI and AMARANTH datasets differ in patient demographics and data collection tools, allowing us to test PPM interoperability across research cohorts and clinical trial data. In particular, for ADNI, patients were selected with specific criteria related to amnestic MCI and Alzheimer's disease and MRI data were collected across MRI acquisition sites in the US. For AMARANTH, data were collected from patients diagnosed with early AD (i.e., patients with MCI; MCI due to AD) and patients diagnosed with mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the USA, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and Poland. We have previously demonstrated PPM interpretability across diverse research and clinical cohort data collected across sites and countries20.

We have developed a trajectory modeling approach based on Generalized Metric Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ)18,19,20 that leverages multimodal data to make predictions about future cognitive decline at early dementia stages by iteratively adjusting class-specific prototypes and learning class boundaries (Supplementary Material: Predictive Prognostic Model).

Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) is a supervised classification method that iteratively modifies class-specific prototypes to identify boundaries between discrete classes. The GLVQ classifiers are defined by a set of vectors known as class prototypes that represent the classes within the input space. During the training phase, the prototypes are updated iteratively based on the training examples. For each training example, the GLVQ classifier determines the closest prototype for each class. The prototypes are then adjusted so that the prototype representing the same class as the input example (the closest ‘correct' prototype) is moved closer to the example, while the closest prototype among the prototypes representing different classes (the closest ‘incorrect' prototype) is moved further away. During training, for each class, the GLVQ algorithm aims to minimize the distances between the training examples of the given class and the prototypes that share the same class label, while maximizing the distances to the prototypes of the other classes. This process helps to form class boundaries with large classification margins. Once the training is completed, the GLVQ classifier can be used for classifying test data. Given a previously unseen input vector, the classifier assigns to it the class label of the closest prototype.

GMLVQ is an extension of the GLVQ algorithm that learns the metric to be used in the input space that enhances class separation. The learnt metric is determined through the corresponding metric tensor. GMLVQ incorporates a full metric tensor to provide a robust distance measure (metric) tuned to the classification task. This metric defines a distance that naturally groups together members of the same class while separating the different classes away from each other. Mathematically, it provides specific feature scaling and quantifies pairwise task-conditional dependencies of the input features. Diagonal elements of the metric tensor identify key predictors, while the off-diagonal terms reveal pairwise feature interactions contributing to the classification task.

Following our previous work18,19, we trained GMLVQ models to discriminate Clinically Stable (CN individuals who remain stable for 4+ years following baseline; n = 100) vs. Clinically Declining (individuals have a baseline diagnosis (at date of FBP scan) of either CN (n = 17) or MCI (n = 139) but received a diagnosis of dementia in future clinical evaluation (i.e., progressed to dementia (n = 75)), or had been diagnosed with dementia in a clinical evaluation prior to baseline (i.e., reverted (n = 81); n = 156) using ADNI data at baseline: medial temporal lobe gray matter (MTL GM) density18,19 (see Supplementary Material: MRI analysis: extracting medial temporal gray matter density), β-Amyloid and APOE4. All data were adjusted by regressing out potential confounding covariates (i.e., age, sex, and education). Following our previous work,18,19, we used the steepest descent method to minimize the cost function through online learning and performed hyperparameter tuning for the model using a nested cross-validation approach45, considering two hyperparameters. To evaluate the model's performance, we employed 10 iterations of a 10-fold cross-validation45. To mitigate any potential biases due to class imbalance in the dataset (Clinically Stable, n = 100; Clinically Declining, n = 156), we resampled the data to generate balanced classes. For each training fold, we repeatedly (n = 400) randomly down-sampled the majority class (i.e., Clinically Declining) to match the size of the minority class (i.e., Clinically Stable). Further, we used ensemble learning46, combining multiple models (n = 400) for robust learning of unbalanced classes. We selected the top 20% (n = 80) models based on their training set performance and estimated the class balanced accuracy based on (a) majority vote, i.e., the class label that receives the most votes from the ensemble models is selected as the final prediction46, (b) the average performance across the selected classifiers47. This ensemble learning approach with cross-validation helps mitigate potential individual model biases, resulting in more robust and accurate predictions36,37.

Moving beyond binary classifications, we extended the GMLVQ framework to generate continuous predictions for each individual in the test dataset. In particular, we extracted a PPM-derived prognostic index employing a GMLVQ-Scalar Projection18,19 that extracts distance information (based on the learnt metric tensor) between the sample vector and the learnt class prototypes (representing Clinically stable vs. Declining). GMLVQ-Scalar Projection thus measures the distance as defined by the learnt metric tensor, between an individual and the prototype representing Clinically Stable along the direction separating Clinically Stable vs. Declining (the line connecting stable and progressive class prototypes). We extracted the scalar projection using the average prototypes and metric tensors of the selected top 20% classifiers to capture robust information across the ensemble of trained classifiers. The scalar projection yields a large positive value for Clinically Declining individuals and a zero or negative value for Clinically Stable individuals. That is, the scalar projection index captures information about how far an individual is from the Clinically Stable prototype, serving as an individualized PPM-derived prognostic index. We have previously shown that this index relates significantly to the rate of memory decline18,20and future tau accumulation19, allowing us to estimate how fast an individual progresses from MCI to AD.

Following our previous work 18we next used multinomial logistic regression to test the relationship of the PPM-derived prognostic index to the rate of future tau accumulation (e.g., future Tau slope in fusiform gyrus that showed significant tau accumulation for Clinically Declining individuals) and determine quartile classes (based on boundaries) that represent different levels of progression. We estimated the probabilities of each quartile class for a range of boundary values and identified the boundaries based on the quartile class with the highest probability at each value. The lower boundary (at the 20th percentile of the future tau accumulation slope) indicates individuals who are more likely to experience slower progression (slow progressive), while the higher boundary (at the 60th percentile of future tau accumulation) indicates individuals who are more likely to experience faster progression (rapid progressive). This multinomial logistic regression model allows us to stratify individuals based on their PPM-derived prognostic index (i.e., scalar projection score) and future tau accumulation slope.

We extracted the PPM-derived prognostic index for each individual in the ADNI test dataset and the AMARANTH dataset. All available data for the PPM input features were used (Supplementary Table S2, S3 for sample size); no statistical method was used to pre-determine the PPM test sample size. We used the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test (SPSS) for comparisons of the PPM-derived prognostic index across groups, as the index data were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test).

To ensure direct comparison to the analysis previously performed on the AMARANTH data21, we used a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM), that is typically used in individual-randomized trials with longitudinal continuous outcomes and missing data. We tested the efficacy of lanabecestat 20 mg and lanabecestat 50 mg (compared to placebo) across time points (week 1: baseline, week 52, week 104) on: (a) biomarker outcome: β-amyloid, (b) cognitive outcomes: CDR-SOB, ADAS-Cog13. We conducted this analysis separately for each group (slow progressive, rapid progressive) and for the full sample (All progressive: slow and rapid progressive), including fixed effects for treatment, timepoint, PPM-stratified group. We included the following covariates in the MMRM: covariates for disease status at baseline, age at baseline, APOE4 genotype, baseline outcome measure, AChEI use at baseline, and pooled country. We calculated Least-square means (LSM; emmeans R package) from the MMRM model (mmrm, lme4 R packages) that represent model-adjusted means, including fixed effects for treatment, timepoint and their interactions, while accounting for covariates and unbalanced data. Pairwise comparisons of LSM across treatment groups and timepoints were performed using post-hoc tests, correcting for multiple comparisons. This approach ensures that reported means accurately reflect treatment effects while accounting for within-subject correlations and repeated measurements over time. We repeated these analyses with non-parametric ANCOVA tests (same fixed effects and covariates as for MMRM analyses) to account for deviations from normality (Supplementary Fig. S2, Supplementary Material: Non-parametric Statistical analysis), with similar results as the MMRM analyses.

Further, for each group (slow progressive, rapid progressive) we computed change in outcomes (β-amyloid, cognitive data) at week 104 from baseline (i.e., week 104 minus week 1). We used Welch's t test to test for differences in outcomes across groups (i.e., lanabecestat 20 mg, lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo), as it does not assume equal variances between the groups and allows adjusting the degrees of freedom used in the test to accommodate differences in variance. MMRM, post hoc comparisons and Welch's t tests were conducted in R.

Finally, we conducted power analysis, using the ‘pwr.t.test‘ function (pwr package in R), to estimate sample size for change in CDR-SOB (week 104 minus week 1) for lanabecestat 50 mg vs. placebo. A power level of 0.90 (1-β) was chosen to minimize the risk of Type II error, ensuring a high probability of detecting a true treatment effect. We used a standard significance threshold of α = 0.05, and more conservative estimates of α = 0.01, α = 0.001.

The npmA gene, encoding a 16S rRNA methyltransferase, confers resistance to all clinically available aminoglycosides, posing a significant threat to effective antibiotic therapy. We analyze 1,932,812 bacterial genomes to investigate the distribution and mobilization of npmA variants. npmA is not found in Gram-negative bacteria, where it was originally described, but is identified among Gram-positive bacteria, predominantly as the npmA2 variant in the globally distributed Clostridioides difficile ST11 lineage. We also detect npmA2 in two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates from a Dutch hospital. Upon sequencing and phenotypic analysis, we determine that E. faecium isolates are pan-resistant to aminoglycosides. Genomic characterization links npmA2 to a composite transposon, Tn7734, which is integrated within a previously uncharacterized Integrative and Conjugative Element (ICE) Tn7740, present in both npmA2-carrying C. difficile and E. faecium clinical isolates. Tn7740-like, but not npmA2, appears across diverse taxa, including human microbiome members. Here, we show that Tn7740 likely facilitates cross-species npmA2 mobilization between these Gram-positive bacteria and emphasize the risk of mobile genetic elements transferring pan-aminoglycoside resistance between clinically important bacterial pathogens.

Aminoglycosides represent an essential family of antibiotics possessing wide activity spectra against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria1. Their introduction marked a significant advancement in antimicrobial therapy and made aminoglycosides a first line of defense against bacterial infections. However, in the 1980s, aminoglycosides lost their preferential status to alternative classes of antibiotics such as cephalosporins, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones due to concerns about their associated toxicity and the development of resistance1. The persistent and escalating threat of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens has recently renewed the interest in aminoglycosides2,3. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of aminoglycosides is compromised by multiple aminoglycoside-resistance mechanisms, particularly the 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases). These enzymes target the 30S ribosomal subunit by methylating the 16S rRNA to prevent aminoglycoside binding, conferring a high level of resistance to multiple antibiotics of this class, including novel agents like plazomicin4,5.

The npmA gene encodes a 16S-RMTase that modifies the adenine residue at the nucleotide position 1408 of the decoding site of 30S ribosomes6. npmA is of particular concern as it provides high-level cross-resistance to nearly all clinically available aminoglycosides4,7. This gene was originally identified in an Escherichia coli isolate from Japan in 2003, located on a transferable IncF plasmid (pARS3) and flanked by IS26 elements7. Despite the impact it may have on aminoglycoside therapy, reports of npmA were scarce in the following years. This could be explained by the fitness costs npmA may impose to the cell, as it significantly inhibits ribosome assembly and translation, suggesting an evolutionary trade-off between resistance and cellular fitness8.

The presence and expression of the 16S-RMTases was thought to be limited to Gram-negative bacteria9. However, npmA, and its variant npmA2, differing from npmA (re-designated as npmA1) by only 3 nucleotides, resulting in a single amino acid change, were discovered in Clostridioides difficile clinical isolates from the USA in 201810. This finding has raised several questions that remain unresolved, including the possibility that the acquired npmA genes emerged from the chromosomally encoded npmA genes carried by some C. difficile strains. The limited data available suggest a notable difference between the genomic context of npmA1 in E. coli and npmA1 and npmA2 in C. difficile. However, the high genetic similarity among C. difficile isolates in the regions flanking npmA2 suggests a conserved genomic environment10.

The increasing availability of bacterial genomes from genomic surveillance studies opens new opportunities to study the immediate genetic context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes systematically at an unprecedented scale and resolution across bacterial populations. Bioinformatic analyses of bacterial genomes can be used to identify the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) carrying AMR genes and to reconstruct the mobilization events that led to the acquisition, maintenance and spread of such genes11,12. The recent identification of npmA1 and npmA2 in C. difficile highlights the need for the characterization of their genomic context and the identification of the mechanisms of acquisition and mobilization of these genes across bacterial species and populations.

In this work, by systematically identifying and analyzing the whole-genome sequences of all available npmA-carrying strains, we demonstrate that npmA2 is widespread across diverse hosts and geographic regions in C. difficile. We discover that npmA2 is integrated within a conserved composite transposon, Tn7734, which in most isolates is, in turn, embedded in a previously unreported integrative and conjugative element (ICE) designated ICE Tn7740. We also report npmA2 in Enterococcus faecium isolates from a Dutch hospital linked to ICE Tn7740, underscoring the potential for cross-species mobilization of this aminoglycoside resistance gene among Gram-positive bacteria.

We identified 103 genomes harboring the npmA gene from a combined total of 1,932,812 bacterial genomes in the AllTheBacteria dataset and our dataset of 33,253 non-overlapping C. difficile genomes (Supplementary Fig. 1). Following QC filtering, 71 of these genomes met the high-quality criteria (see Methods). These were predominantly C. difficile isolates (n = 69), as detailed in Supplementary Data 1, alongside a minority of E. faecium (n = 2). We did not identify any npmA-carrying Gram-negative isolates. To date, the sole npmA1-carrying isolate is the E. coli plasmid pARS3 (AB261016.2), absent from our initial dataset. A striking observation was the predominance of the npmA2 variant, present in 66 of the C. difficile genomes, in contrast to the npmA1 variant, differing by 3 nucleotides and a single amino acid, found in only three genomes. The origin of these isolates was diverse, mainly sourced from humans (n = 42), pigs (n = 19), and environmental sources (n = 8), which underscores the cross-niche distribution of the gene. Geographically, npmA was globally distributed and isolated from a total of six countries (Fig. 1a): the UK (n = 26), Germany (n = 25), USA (n = 13), Australia (n = 2), China (n = 2), and France (n = 1). The isolates were collected over a prolonged period of 20 years (2001-2021), with a notable majority (n = 57/69) obtained between 2008 and 2021.

The MLST and cgMLST analyses of npmA-carrying C. difficile genomes uncovered limited genetic diversity. This was evident from the few predominant clusters among the 69 genomes analyzed (Fig. 1b). ST11 emerged as the most common ST, since 69.5% (n = 48) of the isolates belonged to this ST. We further demonstrated that the npmA2 gene significantly increases resistance to gentamicin (>256 mg/L) in ST11 strains (SAMEA5846557 and SAMEA5846561), relative to the npmA-negative lab strain 630Δerm (Supplementary Table 1A). Its broad geographical and ecological presence make ST11 as a pivotal carrier of npmA across niches, with the earliest npmA2-carrying ST11 isolate dating back to 2001 from a pig sample (Fig. 1c). Conversely, ST161 (n = 8 isolates) and ST36 (n = 4) exhibited a more localized distribution, as all these isolates were collected from pigs in Germany within a narrow time frame (Fig. 1c). ST54 (n = 8 isolates) showed a more diverse distribution but restricted to humans, predominantly in the USA (n = 6), but also in China (n = 1) and Australia (n = 1). The first identification of a C. difficile npmA-carrying ST54 isolate was in 2016 (Fig. 1c). There was also a single detection of one ST109 isolate from an Australian pig in 2008.

To contextualize these findings, we queried the C. difficile EnteroBase database (30,415 genomes, accessed January 15, 2025). Ribotype (RT) 078, the dominant RT within ST11, was among the most prevalent lineages (7.85%, n = 2387), whereas ST36, ST54, and ST161 represented < 1% of the dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2). npmA was not detected in other well-represented lineages (e.g., RT027, RT014, RT001, RT002), underscoring the particular significance of ST11. Source analysis indicated that ST11 and ST54 isolates were derived from multiple distinct studies (n = 13 and n = 4, respectively), locations, and timepoints (Fig. 1c). In contrast, ST161 and ST36 originated from a single German study13, likely representing a single farm population, suggesting potential under-sampling of these lineages (Supplementary Data 1).

To determine the genomic context of npmA and its potential events of integration and mobilization of this gene, we incorporated contextualized genomes lacking npmA in our analysis that shared identical core-genome alleles with npmA-carrying isolates and created maximum likelihood phylogenies for each ST (see Methods). In ST11, our study of 48 npmA-carrying isolates and 520 related genomes revealed extensive dissemination of this lineage, especially in humans and pigs, across 19 countries, particularly in the United Kingdom and Germany. The phylogenetic analysis of the ST11 cluster showed the distribution of npmA-carrying isolates across multiple clades, suggesting multiple independent npmA gene acquisition events within the ST11 lineage (Fig. 2a). Applying a 10-SNP threshold commonly used to infer recent transmission14, we identified clonal expansions within certain npmA-positive clades, indicating genetic relatedness and likely recent transmission events (Supplementary Data 1).

Both trees are midpoint rooted. Metadata columns show isolation niche, country of origin, npmA variant and presence of mobile genetic elements Tn7734 and ICE Tn7740.

ST54 isolates, which were primarily sourced from human clinical specimens, were mainly restricted to China (n = 41), the United Kingdom (n = 34), and the United States (n = 21). A distinct clade of npmA2-carrying isolates in the USA, separate from sporadic npmA1 and npmA2-carrying isolates in Australia and China, indicates local circulation of npmA2 within a defined timeframe (Fig. 2b). Contrarily, ST161 and ST36 clusters exhibited a restricted ecogeographic distribution linked to pigs from Germany. The ST161 cluster was particularly restricted, with no additional related genomes identified, revealing a highly exclusive lineage. The ST36 cluster, albeit slightly more expanded, included just two additional genomes. Despite their geographical and ecological diversity, these ST36 genomes showed remarkable genetic similarity, with only 7-8 SNPs differentiating them, indicating a close genetic relatedness (Supplementary Fig. 3). There is a notable scarcity of information regarding these STs, and existing literature lacks evidence of their association with either pigs or humans.

We conducted an in-depth analysis of the genomic context of npmA2 to identify the MGEs carrying and mobilizing this gene (see Methods). We found an identical ~ 5 kb genomic region across all isolates, irrespective of ST, source, or geographic origin, flanked by two identical sequences of a newly characterized IS30 family member, named ISCld1. This arrangement suggested mobilization through a putative composite transposon, which we termed Tn7734 (Fig. 3a). Most npmA2-carrying C. difficile isolates (64 out of 66) also shared a common and broader mobilizable entity of ~ 33 kb that contained Tn7734, annotated as a complete Integrative and Conjugative Element (ICE) by ICEscreen15, designated ICE Tn7740. Intriguingly, ICE Tn7740 often co-occurred with the remnants of an Integrative and Mobilizable Element (IME) harboring aadE, an aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase, indicating a putative point of integration of ICE Tn7740 (Fig. 3b, c).

Key integration sites include a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator gene (CD630_15730, coordinates: 1,821,726-1,822,940) and a distinct site in German ST11 isolates (CD630_19010, 2,203,327-2,203,836). In addition, an integration into a metallophosphoesterase gene (CD630_06890, 833,702-835,627) in an ST11 isolate and within a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator gene (CD630_02920, 353,054-354,148) for ST161 and ST54 clusters, along with a unique site in the ST36 cluster within a fic family protein gene (CD630_06470, 769,216-769,530).

The structure of ICE Tn7740 varied slightly among isolates, with additional insertions of IS110, disruptions by ltrA gene or both, giving rise to diverse ICE Tn7740 variants (Fig. 3c). Core components to all ICE Tn7740 included a serine recombinase, a mobP family relaxase, and the conjugative system proteins virB4 and virD4, which allowed its classification within the Tn5252 superfamily and Tn1549 family. Adjacent to the ICE, the IME featured a mobV family relaxase, and notably, a serine recombinase, often compromised structurally due to proximity and interaction with ICE Tn7740. Using the complete ICE Tn7740 as a reference, we compared and annotated isolates with shorter contigs harboring incomplete ICE sequences, thereby assigning them to specific ICE Tn7740 variants.

The analysis revealed a consistent integration pattern of ICE Tn7740 variants and associated IMEs across various clusters, despite the diverse phylogenetic distribution of npmA2 (Fig. 2). Notably, ST11 isolates frequently showed integration into genes encoding a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator. A subset of German ST11 environmental isolates exhibited a distinct integration site, while a complex genetic interplay was observed with ICE Tn7740 integrated into another ICE within a metallophosphoesterase gene in one ST11 isolate. Similarly, ST161 and ST54 clusters shared an integration site within a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator gene, whereas the ST36 cluster presented a unique site within a fic family protein gene, highlighting the specificity of ICE integration patterns across different clusters (Fig. 3d). The analysis of the integration sites showed low information content across all positions (mean < 0.5 bits) and only a modest A/T bias at a few sites, with no discernible core motif (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Once the mosaic structure of the multiple embedded MGEs carrying npmA2 (i.e., Tn7734, the ICE Tn7740 and IME) was characterized, we established the order of the integration events that generated such structure (Fig. 4). In the C. difficile M120 chromosome (FN665653.1), we observed a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator protein (CDM120_RS08225, 1,726,966-1,728,177) which may have served as the original integration site of the IME carrying aadE (SAMN25516600). Subsequently, ICE Tn7740 seems to have been integrated into the serine recombinase of this IME, leading to the consistent co-localization of these two elements (Fig. 4a). The phylogenetic analysis of the ST11 cluster revealed that npmA2-negative isolates carrying the same ICE variants but lacking Tn7734 and npmA2 yet retained a copy of ISCld1 (Fig. 2a). This pattern is consistent with the behavior of IS30 family members, where npmA2 could potentially be mobilized via a circular intermediate, leaving a remnant ISCld1 from where Tn7734 was initially located (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the discovery of isolates with the ICE Tn7740 but lacking Tn7734 suggests an ancestral state of the ICE prior to the integration of Tn7734 and npmA2, highlighting the inherent mobility of Tn7734 and its pivotal role in npmA2 mobilization (Fig. 4a).

We conducted a thorough analysis of the genomic surroundings flanking the npmA1 gene variant, too, identified as a rarer variant in C. difficile (n = 3, two ST11 and one ST54). The same genetic context was found in all npmA1-carrying isolates (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The npmA1 gene was found integrated within a putative complete ICE, belonging to the Tn5252 superfamily and Tn1549 family, as well as the ICE Tn7740. This putative ICE exhibited structural variations primarily due to the insertion of the ltrA gene, expanding its size to an estimated 40,000-45,000 bp (Supplementary Fig. 5b). This ICE, while sharing the same family as the ICE Tn7740 carrying npmA2, presented a divergent structural composition beyond its similar conjugative machinery (Supplementary Fig. 6). A comparative analysis with the initially described genetic context of npmA1 in the pARS3 plasmid of E. coli (AB261016.2) revealed a distinct genomic environment, suggesting disparate origins of npmA1 in C. difficile and E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To investigate the capacity of npmA for cross-species transmission, we investigated the genetic context of npmA2 in the two vancomycin-resistant, clonal E. faecium genomes identified (out of the 71 npmA-carrying isolates identified), both isolated from a single Dutch hospital16. The isolates were provided by the Microbiology Department at Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam. These strains were derived from two patients who had undergone heart valve replacements. Resequencing both isolates using Oxford Nanopore technology, we found that npmA2 also appeared within the same Tn7734 and ICE Tn7740 structure observed in C. difficile isolates with a 99.9% identity (Fig. 5), demonstrating a common MGE responsible for the genetic mobilization of npmA2 across these two Gram-positive bacterial species. ICE Tn7740 was integrated into the chromosomal dinB gene (E6A31_14200, coordinates: 2,753,333-2,753,857; reference E. faecium strain SRR24, GenBank accession CP038996.1). Despite this shared genomic architecture, conjugation assays failed to detect transfer of ICE Tn7740 from C. difficile to either C. difficile or E. faecalis recipients. In contrast, control transfer of Tn6194 from C. difficile to E. faecalis occurred at a similar frequency to previous studies17. Similarly, intra-enterococcal mating experiments resulted in vanA-positive plasmid transfer at 1.82 ± 0.016×10⁻² per donor, but no npmA2-positive ICE Tn7740 transconjugants were recovered under the same conditions.

Comparison of the genetic environment surrounding npmA2 in C. difficile isolate SAMEA1710827 and E. faecium isolate SAMEA4885232, showing conserved synteny and shared mobile genetic elements.

To further characterize the clinical isolates recovered in the Netherlands, we determined the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the two E. faecium isolates in vitro, summarized in Supplementary Table 1B, which revealed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (≥ 1024 mg/L) for all the aminoglycosides tested. High levels of resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin can be explained in these E. faecium isolates by the presence of other aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). However, the high MIC values observed in the npmA2-carrying E. faecium isolates against apramycin, not explained by these enzymes, suggest an association between the presence of the npmA2 gene and aminoglycoside resistance (see Discussion).

In scrutinizing the distribution of MGEs (Tn7734 and ICE Tn7740) in the combined dataset, which included both the Blackwell dataset and the dataset of 33,253 C. difficile genomes (Supplementary Fig. 1b), we observed distinct patterns. ISCld1, a component of Tn7734, was found exclusively in association with C. difficile ST11, either co-existing with ICE Tn7740 (n = 8) or in ST11 genomes lacking the ICE (n = 8). Conversely, ICE Tn7740 exhibited a broader presence, being in various C. difficile STs (detailed in the Supplementary Table 4) and in genomes from the Lachnospiraceae family. We queried a comprehensive dataset of 147,851 high-quality metagenome-assembled and isolate genomes from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) catalog18 for the presence of ISCld1 and ICE Tn7740. While ISCld1 was only discovered in a Roseburia hominis genome, ICE Tn7740 showcased extensive dissemination across multiple Lachnospiraceae family genomes (n = 14), including species such as Sellimonas intestinalis, Clostridium bolteae, and Dorea spp., and even Ruminococcus bromii genomes, belonging to the Acutalibacteraceae family (Supplementary Table 5).

To evaluate the intrinsic stability of npmA2 without selective pressure, we conducted serial passaging experiments in various host backgrounds. In its native context within ICE Tn7740, C. difficile ST11 (SAMEA5846557) retained full gentamicin resistance in 100% checked colonies across six consecutive daily passages (~200 generations) (Supplementary Fig. 8). Similarly, the chromosomally integrated ICE in E. faecium E7474 remained stable over ~ 200 generations, with no loss of apramycin resistance. To assess the stability of npmA2 with its native promoter in a different mobile element, the gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTG262. In E. coli HST08 and MG1655, plasmid maintenance remained complete (100%) over ~ 60 generations. In E. faecalis JH2-2, plasmid stability was slightly more variable. One biological replicate showed a marked loss (~50%) on day 2, while the other two remained > 90% stable. This single event reduced the day-2 group average to 83 ± 17%, but plasmid carriage recovered by day 6 (94 ± 4%), consistent with transient instability rather than sustained plasmid loss (Supplementary Fig. 9). These results indicate that npmA2 imposes minimal or no detectable fitness cost in Gram-positive hosts and remains fully stable in standard E. coli strains under laboratory conditions.

This study represents a comprehensive analysis of the occurrence, distribution, and mobilization dynamics of npmA in C. difficile populations and in one E. faecium clone. Through a systematic and in-depth genomic analysis, we discovered a predominant presence of the npmA2 variant and demonstrated the within- and cross-species mobilization of this gene through a previously unreported and common complex MGE (Tn7734 and ICE Tn7740), as shown by its conserved genomic structure across diverse bacterial species, lineages, niches and geographical regions.

Although 16S-RMTases have been described as exclusive to Gram-negative bacteria9, the detection of npmA variants in C. difficile and in E. faecium reported in this study challenges this prior assumption. This wider distribution of npmA across various nosocomial pathogens represents a significant threat in clinical settings10. The analysis of over 30,000 C. difficile genomes show that npmA is still rare, detected in only 101 isolates (0.34%). The gene is even rarer in E. faecium, detected in just two isolates (0.00007%) out of 27,842 genomes in the AllTheBacteria dataset. When determining the population structure of npmA-carrying C. difficile, we identified C. difficile ST11 as a predominant group (Fig. 1). ST11 comprises multiple ribotypes (078, 126, 127, 033, 288), it is well-established in livestock populations worldwide and a key contributor to the incidence of community-acquired C. difficile infection in humans, suggesting zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission pathways19. Notably, the earliest npmA2-carrying ST11 isolate traced back to 2001 and was sampled from a pig in the USA. This evidence further supports the hypothesis that animals could play a very important role in harboring and disseminating this gene. However, in the phylogenetic analysis focused on the ST11 cluster, we observed different evolutionary events of npmA acquisition (Fig. 2a), without identifying any clonal transmission of npmA-carrying C. difficile lineages from pigs to humans. Intriguingly, some npmA2-carrying ST11 isolates originated from the same study as those in the ST161 and ST36 clusters13, both of which are rare STs, representing < 1% of C. difficile genomes in EnteroBase, compared to ST11, which accounts for 7.85% (Supplementary Fig. 2). This might imply that the npmA2 origin in these clusters (ST161 and ST36), which appears to be restricted to pigs in a single geographic location (Germany) in this dataset, could be attributed to the extensively detected and disseminated ST11 cluster. The limited detection of npmA2 in these rare STs could reflect under-sampling of these lineages in public genomic databases, which are predominantly enriched for clinical isolates, leading to a relative underrepresentation of genomes from animal and environmental sources20. All pig-derived isolates in these clusters were collected as part of a single study involving multiple farms in Germany13. Contrary to what is observed in the ST11 lineage, our analysis of the ST54 cluster revealed a strong link with human-derived isolates, predominantly restricted to specific geographic regions (Fig. 2b). Although not widely studied, ST54 has emerged as a predominant ST in China21,22. Nevertheless, the presence of the npmA gene in Chinese isolates was infrequent. In contrast, we identified a subclade within the USA isolates, characterized by the presence of npmA2 (Fig. 2b), suggesting ongoing transmission. Since no npmA-carrying isolates were detected in other high-prevalence C. difficile lineages, including RT027, RT014, RT001 and RT002, this emphasizes the specific role of ST11 (RT078), and, to a lesser extent, ST54 (RT012), as key carriers of the npmA gene.

Our stability assays demonstrate that npmA2 persistence is influenced more by the nature of the genetic vehicle and host-specific factors than by a Gram-positive versus Gram-negative classification. The gene remained stably maintained on its native ICE in both C. difficile (Supplementary Fig. 8) and E. faecium and was equally stable when carried on a plasmid in E. coli. The transient decrease observed in E. faecalis (Supplementary Fig. 9) likely reflects host-specific differences in pTG262 plasmid replication and maintenance mechanisms rather than a direct fitness burden from the npmA2 gene. These results contrast with previous reports of rapid npmA1 inactivation in IS-rich E. coli DH5α strains8, suggesting that npmA2, potentially due to its single amino acid substitution, the pTG262 plasmid biology, or both, may exert a lower fitness cost. Further experiments will be needed to quantify potential fitness effects and to better understand the factors influencing npmA2 stability across different bacterial hosts.

The characterization of the genetic context of AMR genes and their phylogenetic distribution offers fundamental insights into their mobilization capacity, host range and epidemiology, facilitated by the increasingly large datasets of bacterial genomes available and recent advancements in bioinformatics tools11,12. These approaches have recently been applied, for example, to the study of beta-lactamase12 and the critical carbapenemase gene blaNDM-123. Through a standardized bioinformatic pipeline, our study identified the integration of npmA2 within an uncharacterized composite transposon Tn7734. This transposon was predominantly integrated within the ICE Tn7740 across the studied C. difficile isolates. This previously unreported ICE Tn7740, belonging to the Tn5252 superfamily and Tn1549 family, contained a complete set of genes for recombination and conjugation. Tn1549-type elements represent the major transposon carrying vanB genes among enterococci24, and these elements have also been identified in C. difficile25,26.

In our study, the widespread presence of Tn7734 and ICE Tn7740 across C. difficile isolates, irrespective of ST, geographical origin, or source, underscores their pivotal role in both the mobilization and persistence of the npmA2 gene. We determined that ICE Tn7740 integrates into specific chromosomal loci, typically in association with IMEs carrying the aadE gene. Using C. difficile strain M120 as reference, we delineated the integration of ICE Tn7740 via the serine recombinase of the IME (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the ST11 phylogenetic analysis revealed subclades where ICE Tn7740 was present without the npmA2 gene, suggesting an ongoing dynamic of npmA2 gene acquisition and loss (Fig. 2a). This was further evidenced by the detection of ISCld1 remnants in isolates lacking npmA2, indicative of a behavior typical of the IS30 family IS elements. This mechanism mirrors that observed with ISApl1 and Tn6630, known for mobilizing the colistin resistance gene mcr-1, through a copy-out-paste-in process in which the element transiently forms a circular intermediate that can integrate in a new location while partial or complete copies remain at the original site27,28, suggesting a common strategy for gene mobilization and the potential of npmA2-ISCld1-Tn7734-ICE Tn7740 association to become an emerging health concern. On the contrary, the analysis revealed that npmA1 was integrated within a unique ICE distinct from the npmA2-associated ICE Tn7740, albeit within the same Tn1549 family (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The genomic context of npmA1 diverged significantly from that found in a previously characterized E. coli plasmid7. This observation suggests that the hypothesis proposing the chromosomal integration of npmA1 in C. difficile as a precursor to its presence in E. coli is less likely. The precise origins of npmA1 remain undetermined, underscoring the complexity of tracing the origin of AMR genes29.

The identification of these same MGEs (Tn7734 and ICE Tn7740) in two E. faecium isolates (Fig. 5) demonstrates the capacity of npmA2 to disseminate beyond C. difficile. E. faecium may have acquired ICE Tn7740 by conjugation from C. difficile, potentially shared within a niche like the gut microbiome. Although evidence of ICE conjugation between C. difficile and E. faecalis exists30, our study suggests that a similar phenomenon could have taken place between C. difficile and E. faecium. To explore this possibility, we conducted filter-mating experiments to test ICE Tn7740 mobilization across three host pairings: C. difficile to C. difficile, C. difficile to E. faecalis, and E. faecium to E. faecium. Despite the transfer of control elements under identical conditions, no ICE Tn7740 transconjugants were recovered. These results support the inference from our genomic survey that horizontal dissemination of ICE Tn7740 carrying npmA2 is an infrequent event. Its observed distribution across species and lineages may thus reflect rare transfer events followed by clonal expansion, rather than ongoing active spread.

Moreover, our analysis revealed the presence of ICE Tn7740 across various C. difficile STs and within members of the Lachnospiraceae family (Supplementary Table 4), which are one of the core families of the human gut microbiota31. Notably, this occurs without any observed association between ICE Tn7740 and Tn7734 or npmA2. This observation suggests these genetic elements might be originating from anaerobic Gram-positive gut commensals, reflecting the distribution patterns observed in other Tn1549-type ICEs32. In addition, the identification of ISCld1 within the genome of R. hominis, also a member of the Lachnospiraceae family, further supports the hypothesis that these elements may originate from such bacteria. Despite these insights, our search has not yet identified npmA2-like genes within these bacterial populations, indicating a need for further research to clarify the precise origins and mechanisms of spread for this resistance determinant.

Phenotypic analysis of two ST11 isolates showed that npmA2 presence in C. difficile increased resistance to aminoglycosides like gentamicin (MICs > 256 mg/L) compared to non-npmA isolates, as it was already reported10, demonstrating the role of npmA in conferring a high level of gentamicin resistance. Notably, high levels of aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci (defined by MICs ≥ 512 mg/L) are also linked to aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes33. Our genotypic predictions, based on WGS of E. faecium34, were consistent with phenotypic resistance patterns to gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, attributable to varied aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (Supplementary Table 2). However, when assessing the MIC values for apramycin, we observed unexpectedly high values (> 1024 mg/L). These findings suggest that resistance to apramycin cannot be solely attributed to the action of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, as none of the four known resistance determinants of apramycin (aac(3)-IVa, apmA, kamB and npmA)35 were detected in the enterococci isolates here analyzed. Therefore, we hypothesize that the npmA2 gene plays a significant role in conferring high pan-aminoglycoside resistance levels.

This study, while large and comprehensive, is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the reliance on public databases for genome sequences, which may suffer from selection biases and not fully represent global microbial diversity, might lead to uneven distribution of species, strains, carrying hosts and countries among npmA-positive isolates. Secondly, although our conjugation assays provided preliminary insights, experiments under conditions other than standard in vitro assays would be needed to better study these rare transfer events. Further work demonstrating direct gene transfer and assessing the phenotypic impact of npmA2 in the absence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in E. faecium would markedly strengthen the conclusions drawn from genomic analyses.

Our study provides significant insights into the global distribution and spread, genetic integration, and the capacity for intraspecies and interspecies mobilization of npmA. This study emphasizes the risk of MGEs in propagating AMR genes within and between clinically important bacterial pathogens, and the public health value of standard bioinformatics pipelines to analyze available bacterial genomes and metagenomes to systematically assess that risk. Future research should focus on the experimental verification of gene transfer mechanisms and the examination of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of AMR genes in complex microbial communities.

To investigate the presence of the npmA gene, the nucleotide sequences of npmA1 (GenBank accession number NG_048018.1) and npmA2 (NZ_JFOF01000002.1, region:1860-2519) were used as queries for a Compact Bit-sliced Signature (COBS)36 v0.3.0 index search. This search was performed on the AllTheBacteria dataset, which includes 1,932,812 curated draft genomes37 (combining 661,405 genomes from the Blackwell dataset38 with 1,271,428 new assemblies up to May 2023), applying a k-mer similarity threshold of 95%, which allowed us to distinguish between npmA1 and npmA2 variants. This search approach was chosen for its efficiency and ability to process large-scale genomic data. Upon identifying that npmA was predominantly associated with C. difficile (see Results), we expanded our search to compile a dataset of 33,253 non-overlapping C. difficile genomes. These genomes were collected from multiple databases, ensuring no overlap by using unique BioSample identifiers. Specifically, 28,923 C. difficile genomes were obtained from EnteroBase39 (accessed on 19 September 2023), 17,680 from NCBI Pathogen Detection (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/, accessed on 16 November 2023), and 13,706 from the Blackwell dataset38 (November 2018). A diagram showing the databases used for this study can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 1.

For a uniform analysis approach, raw Illumina reads from genomes containing npmA1 and npmA2 sequences were assembled using Shovill v1.1.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) with default settings. Available assemblies derived from long-read sequencing technologies, specifically Oxford Nanopore (n = 1) and PacBio (n = 8), were also downloaded and included in our analysis. To ensure a high and comparable quality of genomic data across genomes sequenced from multiple laboratories, stringent quality control (QC) measures were applied. We used Quast v5.0.240 and CheckM v1.2.141 for the quality assessment. De novo assemblies were checked for total assembly length to exclude those shorter than 3.7 Mb or longer than 4.7 Mb that may represent low-coverage or contaminated samples. In addition, assemblies with more than 200 contigs were excluded to prevent the inclusion of highly fragmented assemblies. Genomes with <90% completeness and >5% contamination were excluded, as recommended by CheckM41. We included only publicly available assemblies that could be linked to a published study so that isolate metadata on source (human, animal or environmental) and country could be extracted. The genome accessions and related metadata of curated npmA-harboring assemblies are detailed in Supplementary Data 1.

We employed in silico MLST to determine sequence types (STs) from npmA-carrying C. difficile genome assemblies. This was performed using the MLST tool v2.23.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/mlst) and pubMLST database42 for C. difficile. For a higher resolution genotyping, core genome MLST (cgMLST) was determined using chewBBACA v3.3.143. This tool uses a gene-by-gene approach to analyze coding sequences, assigning alleles based on a BLAST Score Ratio (BSR). First, Ridom C. difficile cgMLST schema v2 (encompassing 2147 genes, https://www.cgmlst.org/ncs/schema/Cdifficile971/) was adapted using the PrepExternalSchema module for chewBBACA. Second, the AlleleCall module was used to determine allelic profiles of npmA-positive genomes, applying the default BSR threshold of 0.6. Following allele identification, the ExtractCgMLST module was applied to create a comprehensive cgMLST retaining all loci present in 100% of the strains (--t 1). This resulted in a robust cgMLST profile of 1796 loci. Finally, we constructed a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using GrapeTree v1.5.044 and the MSTree method, ignoring missing data (--missing 0), to visualize the genetic relationships among the isolates.

After establishing the population structure of npmA-carrying C. difficile isolates, we identified ST clusters as distinct groups of genetically related isolates in the MST assigned to the same ST. To extend our search and systematically identify closely related C. difficile genomes without the npmA gene from the public genome databases originally queried, we identified the common cgMLST alleles shared by all isolates within each ST cluster. Using nucleotide sequences of these shared alleles, we conducted a COBS36 index search of the entire C. difficile dataset, applying a stringent k-mer similarity threshold of 97% to ensure high specificity and recover genomes most similar to the npmA-carrying isolates. Afterwards, we applied the same genomic QC and metadata completeness criteria as for npmA-carrying genomes (see section De novo assembly and Quality Control), ensuring that selected contextual genomes met the same quality standards. The genomes selected through this process served as contextual genomes for the two major clusters, ST11 and ST54 (Fig. 2). The information of contextualized C. difficile assemblies is detailed in Supplementary Data 2.

We restricted phylogenetic analyses to ST11 and ST54 clusters as these were the largest groups comprising npmA-carrying and contextualized isolates obtained from different sources (human, animal, and environment) and geographical locations. We used the snippy-multi from the Snippy package v4.6.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the assembled C. difficile genomes against specific reference genomes for each cluster: C. difficile M120 (GenBank accession FN665653.1) for ST11 and C. difficile 630 (AM180355.1) for ST54. We then used snippy-core to construct a genome-wide core alignment. ClonalFrameML v1.1245 was applied to this alignment to identify and remove recombinant regions, using the parameter -output_filtered to generate a recombination-masked alignment, which includes only non-recombinant sites. This recombination-free alignment was processed using SNP-sites v2.5.146 to produce an alignment with SNP sites only. This alignment was used as input by IQ-TREE v2.2.647 to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with a general time-reversible (GTR) and gamma substitution model (-m GTR + G), applying 1000 ultra-fast bootstrap replicates (-B 1000). The resulting phylogenetic trees were midpoint rooted and processed with ape v5.748 and visualized with ggtree v3.8.049 packages on R v4.2.2. To further delineate the genomic relationships, pairwise SNP distances between isolate genomes were calculated using snp-dists v0.8.2 (https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists) using the recombination-free alignment obtained from ClonalFrameML.

The identification and extraction of contigs carrying npmA were performed using a custom Python script that searches for a specific DNA sequence in a set of bacterial assembly files. Then, we employed a pipeline designated for the in-depth analysis, contextualization and visualization of genetic flanking regions, targeting npmA (https://github.com/liampshaw/mobile-gene-regions)12. Briefly, this approach used pangraph50 to identify blocks of homologous sequences by iteratively aligning subsets of sequences with minimap2 or mmseqs2. The algorithm identifies stretches of homologous sequences, referred to as pancontigs or homologous blocks, which represent the consensus sequence of the aligned regions. These blocks are then connected to form a graph structure that visualizes the structural diversity of the flanking regions. To further explore the immediate genetic context of npmA, we analyzed a window of 5 kb both upstream and downstream of the gene. In case of longer contigs, we expanded this window to 30 kb, enabling a comprehensive view of the surrounding genetic context. Selected contigs were also annotated using Bakta v1.8.251. Annotated contigs served as the input for subsequent analysis with ICEscreen v1.2.015, which facilitated the detection and annotation of Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) and Integrative and Mobilizable Elements (IMEs). The contigs carrying npmA1 and npmA2 had a median length of 175,821 bp (IQR 134,368-333,748 bp), with a range from 33,889 to 4,180,658 bp (Supplementary Fig. 7). We also conducted a comparative analysis of the assemblies carrying the npmA gene, focusing on cases in which the contig did not extend to the full 30 kb. This comparison was performed using NUCmer v3.152, applying stringent criteria for ICE identification: only those assemblies aligning for ≥98% of their length and demonstrating > 98% identity with a complete ICE were considered as matches. Visual representation of these genetic structures was performed through Clinker on the CAGECAT web server (https://cagecat.bioinformatics.nl/), offering a clear and detailed view of their organization. Afterwards, we identified elements with characteristics similar to known insertion sequences (ISs). To confirm their identity, we conducted a blastp analysis against the ISFinder database53 (https://isfinder.biotoul.fr/, last update: 2023-11-27). This analysis revealed that these sequences did not match any known IS in the database, leading to their recognition as novel IS sequences. Subsequently, ISFinder was used to assign a name to these previously unreported ISs, and their sequences were uploaded to the ISFinder database. New composite elements were named and registered in the Transposon Registry (https://transposon.lstmed.ac.uk/)54. To assess target-site specificity of ICE Tn7740, we extracted 15 bp of chromosomal sequence immediately flanking each of the five C. difficile and the single E. faecium integration sites and aligned the 30 bp windows using MUSCLE v5.3. Then, we visualized the alignment with WebLogo (https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for the two npmA2-carrying E. faecium isolates was performed to determine their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for various aminoglycosides, following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standards. The selected aminoglycosides included amikacin, apramycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and neomycin, with concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L to 1024 mg/L in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth. E. faecium ATCC 19434 was used as a quality control reference. After incubating at 37 °C for 18 h in an aerobic condition, MICs were assessed. On the other hand, AMR predictions were generated using raw Illumina reads from the two E. faecium isolates and a streamlined WGS data pipeline34 (https://github.com/francesccoll/amr_efm_wgs). Briefly, the pipeline employs ARIBA55 to detect and annotate mutations and resistance genes against a curated database of AMR determinants for E. faecium. In addition, the pipeline uses Snippy for reference-mapped SNP calling to identify nucleotide polymorphisms and complex mutations that ARIBA might miss. This process enables precise resistance prediction by correlating the presence of these specific genes or mutations with known resistance phenotypes. This tool incorporates a curated database of 228 genetic markers involved in resistance to 12 antibiotics in E. faecium, which was evaluated against a dataset of over 4000 E. faecium genomes with phenotypic AST data34.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of two npmA2-carrying C. difficile strains was evaluated by ETEST® (BioMérieux) for amikacin, gentamicin and streptomycin, with concentrations ranging from 0.016 mg/L to 256 mg/L (for amikacin and gentamycin) and 1 mg/L to 1024 mg/L (for Streptomycin), using Columbia blood agar plates (BioMérieux). C. difficile 630Δerm was included as a quality control reference. Plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 42 h, after which MICs were assessed.

The stability of ICE Tn7740 was evaluated in the C. difficile ST11 isolate SAMEA5846557. One hundred colonies were streaked on BHI agar, with and without gentamicin (250 mg/L). Colonies from antibiotic-free plates were replicated daily onto both media types for six days. Growth on gentamicin was used to qualitatively indicate ICE retention. The gentamicin-susceptible strain C. difficile 630Δerm was used as a negative control. Stability of ICE Tn7740 in E. faecium E7474 was tested over ~200 in vitro generations. Triplicate 5 ml BHI cultures, initiated from single colonies, were serially diluted 1:1000 every 24 h. At generations 0, 100, 200, and 300, 100 colonies from BHI plates were screened for apramycin resistance (200 mg/L) to quantify ICE maintenance.

To assess npmA2 stability outside of chromosomal context in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the npmA2 gene with its native promoter was cloned into shuttle vector pTG262 (removing kanamycin cassette) by overlapping PCR amplification and subsequent assembly using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara). The recombinant plasmid was electroporated into E. coli MG1655, E. coli HST08 and E. faecalis JH2-2. Three different transformant colonies per strain were grown in BHI apramycin (200 mg/L) cultures for 24 h and passaged daily in antibiotic-free BHI for six days (~ 60 generations in E. coli and ~ 40 in E. faecalis). Each day, cultures were plated, and 100 colonies were replicated to determine the percentage retaining apramycin resistance.

Single colonies of donor strains (C. difficile SAMEA5846557 and CII7) and recipient strains (C. difficile 630Δerm and E. faecalis JH2-2) were used to inoculate 20 ml BHIS broth and cultured to mid-exponential phase (OD₆₀₀ up to 0.6). Cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml BHIS. 100 µl of both the donor and recipient suspensions were mixed and loaded onto 0.45 µm pore size nitrocellulose filters placed on BHIS agar. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, filters were removed, washed with 1 ml BHIS, and 100 µl aliquots were plated on BHIS agar supplemented with selective antibiotics. Transconjugants were recovered after 48 h. C. difficile transconjugants were selected anaerobically on plates containing gentamicin and rifampicin. E. faecalis transconjugants were selected aerobically on erythromycin-supplemented plates (method adapted from refs. 17,56).

For intra-enterococcal conjugation assays, E. faecium BM4105RF (rifampicin- and fusidic acid-resistant) was used as the recipient. Donor strains included the apramycin-resistant E. faecium E7474 harboring ICE Tn7740/npmA2 and a vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strain CCP129 harboring plasmid-encoded vanA. Donor and recipient cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and incubated on 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate filters for 24 h. Filters were then washed, and serial dilutions were plated on selective media. Transconjugants were selected on BHI agar supplemented with rifampicin (30 mg/L), fusidic acid (25 mg/L), and either apramycin (100 mg/L) or vancomycin (6 mg/L), depending on the transferred resistance marker. All assays were conducted in triplicate.

For long-read sequencing, the two npmA2-carrying E. faecium were grown overnight in LB broth at 37 °C. Genomic DNA extraction and purification was conducted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corp.), following the Isolating Genomic DNA from Gram-positive Bacteria protocol. Subsequently, DNA concentration was quantified with Qubit (Invitrogen). We prepared the genomic library employing the 1D Genomic DNA by Ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109 and EXP-NBD104). Sequencing run was executed on a FLO-MIN106 R9.4.1 flow cell and run for 36 h using a MinKNOW v4.0.5. The Fast5 files generated were basecalled using Guppy v4.0.9. Hybrid assemblies were performed using Unicycler v0.4.757, applying default parameters. The quality of genomes was assessed with Quast v5.0.240, and complete genomes were annotated with Bakta v1.8.251.

To extend our investigation to a broader ecological context, in addition to scanning our initial dataset for the previously described MGEs, we analyzed 147,851 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (>90% completeness, <5% contamination) from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) catalog v1.050. We employed BLAST, focusing on ISCld1 (a component of Tn7734) and ICE Tn7740 in the absence of Tn7734 as our primary queries. The detection of ISCld1 was confirmed through strict parameters of 100% coverage and identity, whereas for ICE Tn7740, a slightly more flexible criterion of a minimum 90% coverage and 98% sequence identity was applied.

For the first time, a new study has revealed how and when we make eye contact -- not just the act itself -- plays a crucial role in how we understand and respond to others, including robots.

Led by cognitive neuroscientist Dr Nathan Caruana, researchers from the HAVIC Lab at Flinders University asked 137 participants to complete a block-building task with a virtual partner.

They discovered that the most effective way to signal a request was through a specific gaze sequence: looking at an object, making eye contact, then looking back at the same object. This timing made people most likely to interpret the gaze as a call for help.

Dr Caruana says that identifying these key patterns in eye contact offers new insights into how we process social cues in face-to-face interactions, paving the way for smarter, more human-centered technology.

"We found that it's not just how often someone looks at you, or if they look at you last in a sequence of eye movements but the context of their eye movements that makes that behavior appear communicative and relevant," says Dr Caruana, from the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work.

"And what's fascinating is that people responded the same way whether the gaze behavior is observed from a human or a robot.

"Our findings have helped to decode one of our most instinctive behaviors and how it can be used to build better connections whether you're talking to a teammate, a robot, or someone who communicates differently.

"It aligns with our earlier work showing that the human brain is broadly tuned to see and respond to social information and that humans are primed to effectively communicate and understand robots and virtual agents if they display the non-verbal gestures we are used to navigating in our everyday interactions with other people."

The authors say the research can directly inform how we build social robots and virtual assistants that are becoming ever more ubiquitous in our schools, workplaces and homes, while also having broader implications beyond tech.

"Understanding how eye contact works could improve non-verbal communication training in high-pressure settings like sports, defense, and noisy workplaces," says Dr Caruana.

"It could also support people who rely heavily on visual cues, such as those who are hearing-impaired or autistic."

The team is now expanding the research to explore other factors that shape how we interpret gaze, such as the duration of eye contact, repeated looks, and our beliefs about who or what we are interacting with (human, AI, or computer-controlled).

The HAVIC Lab is currently conducting several applied studies exploring how humans perceive and interact with social robots in various settings, including education and manufacturing.

"These subtle signals are the building blocks of social connection," says Dr Caruana.

"By understanding them better, we can create technologies and training that help people connect more clearly and confidently."

Across the globe, oceans are acidifying as they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, threatening coral reefs and many other marine organisms. A new study, led by oceanographers at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, revealed that unprecedented levels of ocean acidification are expected around the main Hawaiian Islands within the next three decades.

Increased ocean acidification has the potential to harm marine life by weakening the shells and skeletons of organisms such as corals and clams, amplifying the effects of existing stressors, and threatening ocean-based ecosystems. However, researchers have hope, as some organisms have shown signs of adapting to the changing waters. The study helps researchers, conservationists and policymakers understand the future challenges facing Hawaiian coral reefs and provides information for preserving these critical ecosystems for future generations.

Researchers within the laboratory group of Brian Powell, professor in the Department of Oceanography at the UH Mānoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), used advanced, fine-scale computer models to project how ocean chemistry around the main Hawaiian Islands might change over the 21st century under different climate scenarios based on how much carbon dioxide societies continue to emit.

"We found that ocean acidification is projected to increase significantly in the surface waters around the main Hawaiian Islands, even if carbon emissions flatline by mid-century in the low emission scenario," said Lucia Hošeková, lead author of the paper and research scientist in SOEST. "In all nearshore areas these increases will be unprecedented compared to what reef organisms have experienced in many thousands of years."

Emissions shape coral reef future

The extent and timing of these changes vary depending on the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere. In the high‐emission scenario, the team found that ocean chemistry will become dramatically different from what corals have experienced historically, potentially posing challenges to their ability to adapt. Even in the low‐emission scenario, some changes are inevitable, but they are less extreme and occur more gradually.

The team calculated the difference between projected ocean acidification and acidification that corals in a given location have experienced in recent history. They refer to this as 'novelty' and discovered that various areas of the Hawaiian Islands may experience acidification differently. Windward coastlines consistently exhibited higher novelty, that is, future conditions deviate more dramatically from what coral reefs have experienced in recent history.

"We did not expect future levels of ocean acidification to be so far outside the envelope of natural variations in ocean chemistry that an ecosystem is used to," said Tobias Friedrich, study co-author and research scientist in the Department of Oceanography. "This is the first ocean acidification projection specifically for Hawaiian waters to document that."

Coral's potential to adapt

Previous studies have shown that a coral that is exposed to slightly elevated ocean acidity can acclimatize to those conditions, thereby enhancing the coral's adaptability.

"The results show the potential conditions of acidification that corals may experience; however, the extremity of the conditions varies based on the climate scenario that the world follows. In the best case, corals will be impacted, but it could be manageable. This is why we continue new research to examine the combined effects of stresses on corals," said Powell. "This study is a big first step to examine the totality of changes that will impact corals and other marine organisms and how it varies around the islands."

The research team will continue to investigate the future changes in Hawaiian waters, specifically, heat stress, locations of possible refugia for coral reefs, and changes to Hawai'i's fisheries.

Sperm not only delivers the paternal genome to the oocyte but also regulatory small RNA (sRNA). However, the role of sRNA in fertilisation and human embryo development remains poorly understood. Here, couples undergoing IVF are recruited, and sperm sRNA analysed to investigate their role in IVF treatment. Differential expression of mitochondrial sRNA and Y-RNA are observed in relation to sperm concentration. For fertilisation rate, sRNA from a single locus are significantly changed. Expression of microRNA (miRNA) and ribosomal sRNA correlates positively and negatively, respectively, to high-quality embryos. Notably, the top miRNA have an area under ROC of >0.8. Predicted targets of these miRNA are relevant for development, suggesting a role for sperm-borne miRNA in embryo development. In conclusion, sperm-borne sRNA are biomarkers for sperm concentration and embryo quality in IVF. These findings may contribute to clinical strategies improving embryo quality, lowering costs and reducing the need for additional treatment cycles.

Infertility is increasing globally, affecting one in six couples of reproductive age1. To address this issue, researchers have developed assisted reproductive technologies, such as In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), resulting in about 12 million babies being born2. Despite being well-established, IVF is only successful in ~30% of cases3. One major limiting factor in modern IVF treatments is embryo development. IVF clinics often aim to have 30% of fertilised oocytes develop into high-quality embryos, although this success rate is not reached consistently4. Often, couples need several rounds of treatments to receive a baby5. In this context, the potential for male contributing factors to increase IVF success has remained unexplored.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the sperm delivers not only genetic material but also small RNA (sRNA) to the oocyte. By definition, sRNA are short RNA molecules ranging from tens to a few hundreds of nucleotides. sRNA include microRNA (miRNA), originally discovered for their regulatory role in embryogenesis, as well as tRNA-derived fragments (tsRNA), ribosomal RNA-derived fragments (rsRNA), mitochondrial-derived RNA (mitosRNA), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), and fragments from ribonucleoprotein associated RNA (ribonucleoprotein associated sRNA) such as Y-RNA and small nucleolar RNA6.

Here, we show that by analysing sRNA in sperm samples retrieved during ongoing IVF treatment, we find subpopulations of sRNA to be biomarkers for sperm concentration, fertilisation rate, and embryo quality. Our work highlights the paternal role in IVF success and establishes a foundation for a new era in reproductive medicine.

Couples undergoing IVF were recruited between the 18 November 2022 and 8 June 2023 at the Centre of Reproductive Medicine at University Hospital in Linköping, Sweden. Of the 84 couples assessed for eligibility, 72 were recruited and pseudonymized. One couple had an inadequate sperm count for sRNA sequencing and was excluded after sample collection. Two couples did not retrieve any oocytes and were excluded from further analysis. One couple provided two samples because they underwent two IVF treatments; both samples were included. Thus, 70 treatments from 69 couples were studied, with sperm samples sequenced from each of these treatments (Fig. 1). The median age of the men was 34 years, and their median BMI was 27. The median age of the women was 33, and their median BMI was 25. Median sperm concentration and progressive motility were 28 million sperm/mL and 50%, respectively (Table 1).

IVF In vitro fertilisation. sRNA small RNA.

To investigate whether there are molecular markers capable of predicting IVF outcome, leftover sperm was collected and sequenced. In total, 70 samples from 69 couples were sequenced for sRNA. Analysis of this data confirms previous findings that sperm contains a large and diverse repertoire of sRNA7,8 (Supplementary Data 1, and Supplementary Fig. 1).

We performed differential expression analysis on sequenced sRNA and identified sRNA differing by sperm concentration, fertility rate, and rate of high-quality embryos. Specifically, differential expression analysis comparing samples with high ( >16 million sperm/mL) and low ( ≤16 million sperm/mL) sperm concentration (Supplementary Data 2) identified 563 (1.89%) significantly upregulated sRNA in samples of high concentration (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 3). Conversely, 640 (2.15%) sRNA were significantly downregulated. Of the identified upregulated sRNA, 72% were mitosRNA; of the downregulated sRNA, 48% were ribonucleoprotein associated sRNA (Fig. 2a). As sperm concentration and motility are used to determine sperm quality, we performed differential expression analysis of these two parameters. We identified a great overlap between significant sRNA in sperm concentration and sperm motility ( ≥5 million progressively motile sperm as high and <5 million sperm as low motility), where 48% of all differentially expressed sRNA were identical between the two parameters (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c).

Cpm=counts per million. Ribonucleoproteins include SRPs, vault-RNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA and Y-RNA. Upregulated are sequences with an adjusted P value of <0.1 and a log2 fold change above 1, whereas downregulated are sequences with an adjusted P value of <0.1 and a log2 fold change below -1. Adjusted P values and log2 fold changes shown in a, b and c were all produced by differential expression analysis with DESeq2 as described in the “Methods section”. Up and downregulated RNA are marked blue in volcano plots.

Next, comparing sRNA from sperm associated with high ( ≥70%) and low ( <70%) fertilisation rates (Supplementary Data 4), we identified 34 sequences (0.11%) to be downregulated in samples of high fertilisation rate (Fig. 2b, and Supplementary Data 5). Of these, 39% were piRNA, 34% unannotated, and 27% tsRNA (Fig. 2b). We found that no sRNA were significantly associated with high fertilisation rate. Lastly, when comparing sperm producing high ( ≥20%) respectively low ( <20%) rates of high-quality embryos (Supplementary Data 6), 60 sRNA (0.20%) were upregulated and 104 sRNA (0.35%) were downregulated (Fig. 2c; and Supplementary Data 7). Upregulated sRNA consisted of 66% miRNA, and downregulated sRNA consisted of 73% rsRNA (Fig. 2c). Thus, differential expression analysis of sperm-borne sRNA identified unique RNA profiles associated with sperm concentration, fertilisation, and embryo quality.

Next, we investigated sRNA differentially expressed in sperm concentration. Therefore, we mapped differentially expressed sRNA to their genes of origin and will hereafter name sRNA according to their annotation. Since the most prominent sRNA biotype upregulated in sperm concentration originated from the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 2a), we investigated these mitosRNA further. All upregulated mitosRNA originated from mitochondrial tRNA genes (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of these genes, the three most significant were MT-TQ-Glu, MT-TH-His, and MT-TS1-Ser1 (Fig. 3a); MT-TS1-Ser1 was the most significant. Further examination with linear regression of sperm concentration to levels of sRNA mapping to MT-TS1-Ser1 showed a positive significant correlation (R2 = 0.208, P ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3b). Additionally, the potential of MT-TS1-Ser1 to differentiate a low or high sperm concentration was assessed by performing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, where the area under curve (AUC) was 0.891 (Fig. 3c).

In contrast, downregulated sRNA was mostly ribonucleoprotein associated sRNA (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The top three most significant all mapped to Y-RNA (Fig. 3d). Of these, sRNA mapping to RNY4 was the most significantly changed. Linear regression of sperm concentration and sRNA mapping to RNY4 showed a significant negative correlation (R2 = 0.238, P ≤ 0.0001, Fig. 3e). The AUC was 0.845 in this ROC analysis (Fig. 3f). Thus, we identified mitosRNA and ribonucleoprotein associated sRNA from Y-RNA as biomarkers that differentiate between sperm samples with high or low sperm concentrations.

We identified 34 sequences of sperm-borne sRNA to be associated with low fertilisation rate (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Data 5). A closer analysis of these sequences revealed that they all originate from the same genomic region (Fig. 4a). Sequences from this region can be annotated as both tRNA and piRNA depending on database. It is therefore not possible to precisely classify the differentially expressed sequences found here. Comparing the sum of normalised sequences in samples with high or low fertilisation rate did not show a statistically significant difference (Fig. 4b, c). In addition, ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.5817 (Fig. 4d). In all, our data suggests that sequences from this specified region may be relevant for the sperm's capability of fertilisation, but more data would be needed to strengthen this finding.

Concerning the rate of high-quality embryos, miRNA was the most prominent biotype of upregulated sRNA. Specifically, 16 miRNA were found (Supplementary Fig. 4a); the three most statistically significant were hsa-let-7g, hsa-miR-30d, and hsa-miR-320b/a (Fig. 5a, and Supplementary Data 8). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of the predicted targets for these three miRNAs showed several biological processes to be involved. Interestingly, nine of the top GO terms were related to embryogenesis, development, or cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 9). This finding suggests that these miRNA play important roles in developmental processes. Further investigation of the miRNA revealed that hsa-let-7g had the lowest P value (P = 0.000000005.4, Fig. 5a), making it an interesting candidate for further investigation. Comparing hsa-let-7g expression against the rate of high-quality embryos showed no significant regression (R2 = 0.001, p = 0.79, Fig. 5b). However, exclusion of one sample with an expression 12 times above mean, resulted in a significant regression (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Moreover, an AUC of 0.812 for the ROC curve (Fig. 5c) supports the notion that hsa-let-7g affects embryo quality outcomes. Additionally, we studied linear regression and ROC analysis for hsa-miR-30d (Supplementary Fig. 4d) to address the sensitivity of miRNA for embryo quality. Regression was significantly positive (R2 = 0.065, p = 0.04), and AUC was 0.712, suggesting that these miRNA are robust biomarkers of the ability of the sperm to produce high-quality embryos.

Data is presented as sum of normalised sequences (cpm) for each sperm sample by indicated genomic origin. High rate of high-quality embryos n = 47, low rate of high-quality embryos n = 17. Line in box plot represents the median, hinges show the first and third quartiles and whiskers extend to the largest value unless values are above 1.5 times the inter-quartile range. In linear regression, coloured area represents 95% confidence interval.

Additionally, downregulated sRNA were identified as mostly rsRNA. RsRNA originating from ribosomal genes 28S, 5S, 5.8S, and 12S were associated with sperm giving rise to low rates of high-quality embryos (Fig. 5d; and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Of these, rsRNA from the 28S gene were the most significantly changed between the high and low rate of high-quality embryos. Linear regression against sRNA mapping to 28S rRNA and rate of high-quality embryos showed a significant negative correlation (R2 = 0.084, P = 0.02), and AUC was 0.79 (Fig. 5e, f). We found that miRNAs and sRNA from 28S were sperm-borne biomarkers that predict embryo quality in IVF treatment.

From the 65 treatments with successful fertilisation, 28 children were born (Fig. 1). To investigate whether there are molecular markers capable of predicting live birth, gestational age, and size for gestational age, we performed differential expression of sperm sRNA and these parameters (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c, and Supplementary Data 10). We identified a few sRNA to be upregulated in sperm associated with live birth (Supplementary Fig. 6a). These sequences originated from the snRNA U6 (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Regarding gestational age, there was no association with sperm-borne sRNA (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Next, looking at size for gestational age, we identified a subset of tsRNA (Supplementary Fig. 6c). These sequences mapped to four tRNA, Arg-CCT-3−1, iMet-CAT−1−1, Glu-TTC−14−1 and Lys-CTT-2−1 (Supplementary Fig. 6e–h, left panels). Sequences aligning to the same tRNA was summed and plotted as a function of size for gestational age. Three of these tRNA showed a negative correlation to size for gestational age (R2 between 0.05811 and 0.1879), suggesting that these sequences relate to foetal growth (Supplementary Fig. 6e–h, middle panels). When grouping the samples in sperm giving rise to babies small for gestational age (SGA), average for gestational age (AGA), large for gestational age (LGA) and performing a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis, there was no significant difference between the groups (Supplementary Fig. 6e–h, right panels). While the negative correlation between tsRNA and size for gestational age is an interesting observation, the few data points in SGA (n = 2) and LGA (n = 5), indicate that more data is needed to support this observation.

We provide evidence that sperm-borne sRNA are biomarkers for sperm quality, fertility rate, as well as embryo quality in an IVF setting. Our data reveal specific subpopulations that are relevant throughout IVF treatment. These findings provide intriguing new insights into the contributions of sperm in embryo development.

We identified mitosRNA to be markers of sperm quality in couples undergoing IVF (Fig. 3a; and Supplementary Fig. 3). In a previous study, we found that sperm-borne mitosRNA is affected by a short-term diet intervention7 and directly related to human sperm quality9. Thus, there is accumulating evidence that mitosRNA are markers for high sperm concentration and motility. A recent investigation has shown that sperm-borne mitosRNA in mice, as in humans, are sensitive to a short-term diet intervention, suggesting that there are evolutionary conserved mechanisms in nutrient sensing capabilities10. Moreover, these sperm-borne mitosRNA appear capable of programming the metabolism in the developing embryo, suggesting that even though the mitochondrial genome is exclusively inherited from the mother, the father transmits mitochondrial regulation via the sperm. Further prospective studies, such as IVF cohorts, are needed to investigate whether a similar mechanism is involved in humans. Notably, we found that high levels of mitosRNA correlate with sperm concentration but not with fertilisation rate and embryo quality. This finding suggests that in an IVF setting sperm-borne mitosRNA are not important for embryonic development or fertilisation. However, sperm-borne mitosRNA may have functional relevance in in vivo fertilisation, where progressive motility in sperm is required to fertilise the egg.

Examining the role of sperm-borne sRNA in embryo development, we found 16 miRNA to be relevant (Supplementary Data 7, 8, and Supplementary Fig. 4). GO term analysis of predicted targets from the top three miRNA suggests a role for these miRNA in embryogenesis, development, and cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 9). Previous studies have reported that several sperm-borne miRNA are important for male reproductive health11,12,13,14,15,16, embryo quality17,18, as well as likelihood of live birth19. In a recent meta-analysis, Joshi et al.20 concluded that three miRNA are relevant biomarkers for male infertility. Here, we found one of these to be a predictor of low rates of high-quality embryos, supporting the relevance of this miRNA for embryo quality (Supplementary Data 11). Similarly, Hamilton et al.21 found sperm-borne miRNA to be related to the rate of blastocyst formation. Of these, we identified miR-200b and let-7a to be associated with low sperm concentration and miR-200b to be associated with low fertility rates.

Of the 16 miRNA identified in this study, three are members of the let-7 family (Supplementary Data 8). This miRNA family is well-established as a conserved family that is crucial for diverse aspects of embryogenesis. Previous work suggests that let-7 regulates embryonic and postnatal growth in mice via the insulin-PI3K-mTOR pathway22. Huang et al.23 found that rodent sperm-borne let-7 dictates the metabolic phenotype in offspring. Furthermore, they found that weight loss in humans reduces levels of let-7d/e in sperm. Thus, our results combined with mentioned findings support a functional role for sperm-borne miRNA. From our data, however, we cannot infer whether the level of miRNA in human sperm is causal to embryo quality or is a consequence of other processes in sperm. In mice, it is clear that sperm-borne miRNA are pivotal for preimplantation embryonic development24. In humans, however, functional validation studies would be required to provide further evidence. It is evident that sperm miRNA, such as let-7g and mir-30d, are promising biomarkers that could predict whether a sperm sample will result in high-quality embryos in IVF treatment (Fig. 5a, c, and Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). Notably, the let-7 family holds prognostic value in other contexts. In terms of fertility, let-7c is important for blastocyst formation25, pregnancy loss26, and azoospermia27 and let-7i is relevant for PCOS28, IVF success rate29, endometriosis30, and male subfertility31. Lastly, let-7g has been associated with ovarian response to hormonal stimuli29 and foetal alcohol spectrum disorders32.

In addition to mitosRNA and miRNA, we identified several other relevant subtypes of sRNA for IVF. We found that sRNA originating from Y-RNA – particularly RNY1, RNY3, and RNY4—are associated with low-quality sperm. While sRNA from Y-RNA has previously been reported to be present in human sperm33, we found that sRNA from Y-RNA is also relevant for male reproductive health. Full-length Y-RNA are components of the Ro60 ribonucleoprotein particle, involved in DNA replication and RNA quality control34. In addition, our analysis supports the relevance of sperm-borne rsRNA for embryo quality, where specific sequences of 28S rRNA exhibit a lower expression in sperm samples producing high-quality embryos (Fig. 5d, f). In mice, sperm-borne rsRNA have been found to share biogenesis pathways with tsRNA via Dnmt235 as well as being phthalate-sensitive36, but so far their roles in fertility have not been evaluated. Regarding fertilisation rate, we find sequences of piRNA or tsRNA originating from the same locus to be differentially expressed, suggesting a potential intriguing role for this locus in male fertility. We also find other sperm-borne tsRNA, namely from Arg-CCT-3−1, iMet-CAT-1-1, Glu-TTC-14-1 and Lys-CTT-2-1 to have a trend of negative correlation with size for gestational age. In mouse, sperm-borne tsRNA has been related to offspring body weight37. However, in a human setting, these findings need to be further explored in larger cohorts since foetal growth as well as fertilisation is heavily dependent on female factors before and after conception. Nonetheless, Oluwayiose et al.38 identified two sperm-borne piRNAs to be relevant for the chance of live birth. Additionally, Chen et al. and Hua. et al. also showed sperm-borne tsRNA to be relevant for early embryo cleavage events and blastocyst formation39,40, highlighting that both piRNA and tsRNA are highly relevant and interesting in the case of human reproduction.

One limitation in our analysis is the difficulty of examining the isolated effects of sperm sRNA on clinical outcome. Specifically, in analyses concerning rate of high-quality embryos, female factors influence the outcome. Additionally, within the studied population, positive correlations exist between females and males in both age and BMI. However, despite the female influence, we are still able to associate sperm-borne sRNA with embryonic quality, supporting their robustness in this system.

As embryo quality is one of the major limiting factors of modern IVF success, finding sperm-borne biomarkers capable of predicting embryo quality holds great potential. Couples often undergo several demanding IVF treatments before a successful pregnancy. Additionally, some couples are left without a diagnosis or explanation after failed IVF attempts, causing emotional distress. A more efficient selection of sperm can attain more high-quality embryos, alleviating the number of hormonal treatments needed, aiding in closing the inequality gap in reproductive medicine.

In conclusion, we identified different subpopulations of sRNA in sperm that exhibit distinct profiles in clinical reproductive measurements, such as sperm concentration, fertilisation rate, and the rate of high-quality embryos. Furthermore, our analysis identifies specific sRNA as highly promising biomarkers. These biomarkers are clinically applicable for the examination of sperm samples while providing insight into possible molecular mechanisms of male fertility and paternal contribution to embryonic development.

Couples were recruited at the Centre for Reproductive Medicine at the University Hospital in Linköping, Sweden, on the day of ovum pick-up (OPU), the same day as semen sample collection and IVF fertilisation. As couples share an IVF record, written consent was obtained from both partners. The sex of participants was collected from their medical records. Couples did not receive any compensation for enroling.

Male participants had to meet the following criteria: the presence of mature sperm in the ejaculate and proficiency in Swedish. Males were excluded if they had a known malignant disease, a history of radiation in the pelvic area, previous chemotherapy, or a known genetic anomaly. Importantly, only males with over 600,000 leftover sperm were sequenced due to a restriction in input RNA level. Therefore, males with low sperm count requiring intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection could not be included.

Patients received standard care for IVF, where the only laboratory operation different from non-recruited couples was the retrieval of leftover sperm not used in the fertilisation process. Recruitment started on 18 November 2022 and ended on 8 June 2023.

On the day of OPU, the semen samples were collected (at home or the clinic between 6:30–9:30) in sterile 50-mL non-spermotoxic polypropylene Falcon tubes (Corning Science, Mexico) after recommendation of ejaculation every other day during hormonal stimulation (8–14 days) and a maximum of 3 days abstinence. After liquefaction for 15–30 min at room temperature on a Nutating Mixer (VWR, Pennsylvania, USA), standard semen parameters were examined manually by embryologists. Parameters for concentration of sperm, concentration of progressively motile sperm and percentage of progressive motile and motile sperm in the ejaculate were evaluated according to WHO criteria41. Internal controls are performed every six months. Most samples were examined within 60 min post ejaculation and none later than 120 min.

Spermatozoa were prepared for IVF using PureSperm gradient (1.5 mL 80%/1.5 mL 40%) (Nidacon, Gothenburg, Sweden). Semen was layered on top of the gradient and centrifuged at 300 g for 20 min, followed by resuspension of the pellet (with PureSperm Wash; Nidacon). Subsequently, sperm was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended, and the number and concentration of progressive motile sperm post gradient were estimated (Makler counting chamber, Cellvision, Heerhugowaard, Netherlands). From this post-gradient suspension, the sperm sample was prepared and diluted with G-IVF (VitroLife, Gothenburg, Sweden) for fertilisation. Leftover sperm from the sample was used for sRNA sequencing.

After fertilisation on the day of OPU (between 13:30 to 15:30), leftover sperm was diluted with G-IVF (VitroLife) or concentrated (centrifugation on 500 g for 10 min and then fluid removal) to a concentration of 12 million sperm/mL. Aliquots of 50 µl (i.e., 600,000 sperm) were put in RNAse-free 2-mL Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Germany), followed by immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sperm was stored at −80 °C until extraction of sperm RNA.

RNA extraction was performed with miRNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen; 217084) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prechilled Steel beads (stainless steel bead 5 mm, Qiagen; 69989) were added to frozen samples, followed by the addition of 1 mL of prechilled Qiazol (Qiagen). Samples were instantly processed in a Tissue Lyser LT (Qiagen) for 2 + 2 min at 40 oscillations/s upon defrosting. RNA concentration was determined with a Qubit microRNA assay kit (Q32880, Life Technologies) using Quantus Fluorometer (E6150; Promega, Madison, WI). RNA quality was controlled by BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit; 5067-1511), both by extracting RIN values and by visual inspection of the curves. The RIN values were low (2,3 -5,4), with no visible rRNA peaks indicative of pure sperm samples42,43,44. Library synthesis used 4 ng of RNA; if lower, full volume was used. Small RNA libraries were produced with NEBNext Multiplex SmallRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7300S, E7330S, E7580S; New England Biolabs), with the customisation of a dilution of primers 1:8. The 3´adaptor ligation reaction was carried out at 16 °C overnight. Libraries were amplified for 15 cycles and cleaned using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The quality of cDNA libraries was studied using BioAnalyzer 2100 with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit, 5067-4626. Amplified libraries were pooled in relation to peak size before size selection. Size selection was done using TBE gel (EC6265BOX; Invitrogen) of 130–165 nt length. The extraction of cDNA from gel was performed with Gel Breaker Tubes (3388-100, IST Engineering) by incubation with buffer included in the NEBNext kit and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at 37 °C, flash frozen for 15 min, and again incubated on a shaker. Gel debris was removed by Spin-X 0.45 µm centrifuge tubes (8162, Corning, Inc.). Precipitation was done using GlycoBlue (Invitrogen), 0.1 times the volume of Acetate 3 M (pH5.5) and three times the volume of 100% ethanol at –70 °C overnight. The final cDNA concentration was determined using a Quantus Fluorometer (E6150; Promega, Madison, WI) and QuantiFluor ONE ds DNA system (E4870, Promega). The quality of pooled and size selected cDNA libraries was studied again with BioAnalyzer and sequenced on NextSeq 550 with NextSeq 500/550 High Output kit version 2.5, 75 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, CA). All libraries passed Illumina's default quality control. Fastq files were produced by FASTQ generation v1.0.0 by Illumina.

Data analysis was performed within R version 4.3.2 with Seqpac version 1.2.01, mapping to human genome GRCh38. Any sequence that did not match the human genome with a maximum of 3 mismatches was discarded. Primary filters of 1 read in 90% of samples and a length of 16–75 nt were performed before normalisation by counts per million (cpm). Additional filtering of 1 cpm in 90% of samples was consecutively performed. Small RNA was annotated against ensemble ncRNA GRCh38.ncrna, piRNA from piRbase 2.0, protein coding from GRCh38 from NIH, and ribosomal RNA from RNAcentral, and searching for rRNA in Homo sapiens. Biotypes were annotated in a hierarchy as follows: rRNA, miRNA, mitochondrial RNA, tRNA, ribonucleoproteins (including SRPs, vaultRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA, and Y-RNA), lncRNA, miscRNA, and piRNA. Biotypes were mapped with a mismatch of 1, where sequences failing to annotate to any of the previously defined databases were classified as “unannotated”.

Data visualisation was performed with ggplot2 version 3.5.0. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq22 version 1.42.1, with the model accounting for flow cell (technical batch effect), as this is the major driver for variation in data when explored for with R package variancePartition version 1.32.5 and Principal Component Analysis performed with Seqpac (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). In gestational age and size for gestational age, differential expression analysis was performed as continuous variables. Wald test and local regression were used for differential expression.

Linear regression and normality check of cpm data were performed GraphPad Prism ver. 10.0.2. Results from tests for each RNA shown in boxplots may be found in Supplementary Data 12. Non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Signed Rank Tests were two-sided and were performed with R function wilcox.test in stats version 4.3.2.

Clinical parameters from the couple's IVF records were retrieved, forming groups for analysis. Males with ≤16 million sperm/mL were classified as having low sperm concentration. This cut-off was based on WHO guidelines41. For Supplementary Fig. 2 and 7, ≥5 million progressively motile sperm in total amount after preparation with density gradient was considered as high sperm motility, <5 million sperm as low motility. For supplementary Fig. 7,3 30% motile sperm before density gradient was considered high motility percentage and <30% as low motility.

In line with The Vienna Consensus4 for fertilisation rate (n fertilised oocytes/n oocytes retrieved) and benchmark values for the Centre of Reproductive Medicine Linkoping, Sweden, the ratio of ≥70% was set as a high fertilisation rate.

Embryologists examined the embryos through microscope with criteria mentioned below. For cleavage stage embryos (days 2 and 3), the guidelines from the Istanbul consensus were used45. At day 2, High-quality embryos were defined as embryos with 4–6 evenly sized blastomeres with a maximum of 20% fragmentation and a smooth cytoplasmic appearance. At day 3, embryos with 6–10 evenly sized blastomeres with a maximum of 20% fragmentation and a smooth cytoplasmic appearance were defined as high-quality. For blastocyst stage embryos (day 5), embryos were graded according to Gardner. High-quality embryos were considered to have a grade of 3BB or higher46. Couples with a high rate of high-quality embryos had a ratio of ≥20% (n high-quality embryos/ n fertilised oocytes*100).

In Supplementary Fig. 6, size of gestational age is calculated by neonatal weight charts resulting in z-scores corresponding to centiles47. Small for gestational age (SGA) is defined as <10th centile. Average for gestational age (AGA) is defined as 10-90th centile. Large for gestational age (LGA) is defined as <90th centile. These calculations were performed with web tool from fetalmedicine.com.

OpenAI is trying to leave behind the restrictive walls of a chatbot text box and expand into every nook and cranny of your device. On Thursday, the company announced ChatGPT Agent, its foray into the growing “agentic” space that allows artificial intelligence models to perform specific tasks.

According to the company, the ChatGPT Agent uses a virtual computer to handle specific requests from start to finish. The company offered examples like “look at my calendar and brief me on upcoming client meetings based on recent news,” “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,” and “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.” Once given the task, ChatGPT Agent acts independently without additional input to navigate websites, open apps, and perform the tasks it was given.

The Verge reports that ChatGPT Agent was built on a new, unnamed model that OpenAI developed specifically for this project that combines the functionality of its Operator tool, which can navigate web browsers, and Deep Research, which can complete multi-step research and analysis tasks—both features that were introduced earlier this year. Additionally, the Agent tool was reportedly trained on complex tasks that can require multiple tools to complete, like jumping between a browser and the terminal.

The early impressions of the agent appear a bit mixed. The Verge noted that while it appears quite capable of tackling multi-step operations, it can be slow to complete its tasks and is not designed for humans to sit there and watch it work. Wired, likewise, said that the thing isn't exactly blazing fast. It took an hour to order cupcakes for OpenAI's research lead, Isa Fulford, who said that still amounts to saving time because she “didn't want to do it.” One feature that Wired highlighted as leaving an impression was the agent's “replay” feature, which lets you replay the steps it takes to understand and complete its tasks.

Agents are all the buzz in the world of AI, often positioned as human replacements for certain tasks. Klarna, for instance, adopted AI agents to take over its customer support operation, only to backtrack and bring back human operators due to the quality of work the agents provided.

ChatGPT Agent will be available to people who are subscribed to a ChatGPT Pro, Plus, or Team plan, where it can be accessed by selecting “agent mode.” The company said it will introduce the agent to ChatGPT Enterprise and Education users later this summer.

Roblox is rolling out new features aimed at making the platform safer for minors, including a revamped friend system, privacy tools, and age verification services users submit by recording a video selfie.

In Roblox's old friend system, players have no distinction between people they know casually or online versus someone they consider a close friend. The platform's new tiered system introduces Connections and Trusted Connections specifically for people that players know and trust. To access Trusted Connections and its benefits, users first need to complete an age verification, which requires them to submit a video selfie. Once they've submitted their video, the company says it's run against an AI-driven “diverse dataset” to get an age estimation. If the user appears to be under 13, they will automatically lose access to any features not deemed age-appropriate.

For users whose ages cannot be determined with “high confidence,” according to a blog on the company's site, their age remains unconfirmed; they'll need to use ID verification to pass. The company says it will allow for parental consent in the future; biometric data is deleted after 30 days, except where required in the case of a warrant or subpoena. WIRED raised the issue of 13-year-olds not having government-issued IDs to chief safety officer Matt Kaufman. “That is a problem,” Kaufman says. “In North America or maybe the United States in particular, that's not common. In other parts of the world, it is much more common to have photo ID.” If a child is unable to obtain verification due to lack of ID, they can get verified through their parents. If their parents are unable to do so for any reason, kids won't be able to use Trusted Connections.

Teen users who pass the age check will be able to use the Trusted Connections feature to add anyone ages 13 to 17. Anyone 18 or older will need to be added either via an in-person QR code scan or via a phone number. With Trusted Connections, Roblox removes filters—which includes inappropriate language and personally identifiable information—on party voice and text chats for users 13 and up. Those communications are still subject to Roblox's community standards and moderation, but the company hopes removing filters will keep users on their platform rather than moving to spaces like Discord. By keeping players within Roblox, the company can monitor their activity. A spokesperson told The Verge that includes “any predatory behavior aimed at manipulating or harming minors, the sexualization of minors, engaging in inappropriate sexual conversations with or requesting sexual content, and any involvement with child sexual abuse material.”

Kaufman says the company wants to make Roblox “safe by default.” That's why the company filters communications even for teenagers who haven't verified their age. “If parents are uncomfortable with that, and it's the right decision for their family, parents can turn off communications through parental controls,” Kaufman says.

Roblox is one of the biggest platforms worldwide in video games, especially with kids. Kaufman, in a press briefing, said roughly 98 million people from 180 countries use the platform; Kaufman says that over 60 percent of users are over age 13. The company has struggled, however, with predators and minors' safety. According to a 2024 Bloomberg report, police have arrested at least two dozen people who've used Roblox as a platform for grooming, abuse, or abduction. Roblox has also been the subject of several lawsuits. This includes a class action lawsuit alleging the company harvests user data, including that of minors, and a federal lawsuit alleging a 13-year-old girl was exploited and sexually groomed via Roblox and Discord.

In the briefing, Kaufman called Roblox “one of the safest places online for people to come together and spend time with their friends and their family.”

Kirra Pendergast, founder and CEO of Safe on Social—an online safety organization operating worldwide—says Roblox's latest safety measures are largely opt-in, therefore putting “responsibility on minors to identify and manage risks, something that contradicts everything we know about grooming dynamics.” Features like machine-learning age-estimation tools, for example, can incorrectly categorize users as older or younger; in-person code scanning, she says, “assumes that in-person QR code scanning is inherently safe.”

“Predators frequently use real-world grooming tactics,” says Pendergast. “A QR scan doesn't verify a trusted relationship. A predator could build trust online, then manipulate the child into scanning a QR code offline, thus validating a ‘Trusted Connection' in Roblox's system. Real protection would require guardian co-verification of any connections, not child-initiated permissions.”

Furthermore, says Pendergast, Trusted Connections applies only to chat, which leaves “large surface areas exposed, making it a brittle barrier at best.”

When asked how an in-person QR code keeps minors safe from real-world grooming tactics, Kaufman echoes a press briefing comment that there is no “silver bullet.” Instead, he says, it's many systems working together. “Those systems begin with our policies, our community standards,” Kaufman says. “It's our product which does automated monitoring of things, it's our partnerships, it's people behind the scenes. So we have a whole suite of things that are in place to keep people safe. It is not just a QR code, or it is not just age estimation, it's all of these things acting in concert.”

Kaufman says that Roblox is “going farther” than other platforms by not allowing kids age 13 to 17 to have unfiltered communication without going through Trusted Connections. “We feel that we're really setting the standard for the world in what it means to have safe, open communication for a teen audience.”

According to Roblox's briefing, the updates are part of Roblox's typical development process and haven't been “influenced by any particular event” or feedback. “It's not a reaction to something,” Kaufman said. “This is part of our long term plan to make Roblox as safe as it can possibly be.”

Kaufman also tells WIRED that the heightened scrutiny and discussion of the game hasn't had a dramatic impact on the company's plans. “What we're doing with this announcement is also trying to set the bar for what we think is appropriate for kids,” he says.

Looking at technology like generative AI, he says, “the technology may have changed, but the principles are still the same. We also look at AI as a real opportunity to be able to do some of the things that we do in safety at scale when we think about moderation. AI is central to that.”

In the briefing he said Roblox believes it's important for parents and guardians to “build a dialog” with their kids about online safety. “It's about having discussions about where they're spending time online, who their friends are, and what they're doing,” Kaufman said. “ That discussion is probably the most important thing to do to keep people safe, and we're investing in the tools to make that happen.” He added that Roblox is aware that families have different expectations on what's appropriate online behavior. “If parents make a decision about what's appropriate for their kid, it may not match the decisions that we might make or I might make for my own family,” he said. “But that's OK, and we respect that difference.”

Dina Lamdany, who leads product for user settings and parental controls, said in that briefing that as teenagers are experimenting with their independence, “it's really a moment where it's important for them to learn the skills that they need to be safe online.” Teen users can grant dashboard access to their parents, which gives parents the ability to see who their child's trusted connections are. “We won't be notifying parents proactively right now,” Lamdany says.

Online safety, especially for minors, is an ongoing problem in games spaces. Nintendo recently introduced GameChat with the Switch 2, a social feature that allows players to connect with friends without leaving the platform. For younger users, it relies heavily on parental controls, while adults are expected to be proactive in who they chat with. The system's privacy policy warns that it might also “monitor and record your video and audio interactions with other users,” though some people are concerned about that level of surveillance and argue it makes GameChat less appealing than Discord. Kaufman says that Roblox takes privacy seriously. “We're the only large platform in the world that has a large number of kids and teens on it, and for that reason, privacy has been built into the foundation of our entire platform,” he says.

Pendergast says that if Roblox wants to lead the way in safety, it has to take harder stances.

“It must stop asking children and parents to manage their own protection and start building environments where trust isn't optional, it's engineered in as safety by design,” she says. “Age estimation, parental dashboards, and AI behavioral monitoring must be default, not optional, creating a baseline of systemic defense, not user-managed or user-guardian managed risk.”

Otherwise, Pendergast says, “parents and children are left to do the heavy lifting often without the digital and online safety literacy required.”

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a man whose brain was partially eaten by a worm and who once admitted to keeping jars full of roadkill in his freezer, is begging the Canadian government to spare the lives of 400 ostriches who may have been exposed to bird flu. Kennedy, who also happens to be in charge of America's federal health policy, believes those ostriches could help scientists “better understand the virus.”

The ostriches in question are at the heart of a legal battle in Ottawa, where federal judges are now deciding whether birds belonging to Universal Ostrich Farms, an animal reserve in British Columbia, should be destroyed or allowed to live. An outbreak at the farm in December resulted in the deaths of 69 birds, and, while hundreds of ostriches remain at the farm, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has mandated that those birds be culled to protect the region from a broader outbreak. The farm owners have maintained that this would be unnecessary and amounts to government overreach, The Globe and Mail reports. Kennedy, as well as a gaggle of MAGA influencers and other Trump officials, have repeatedly stepped in to ask that the lives of the sick birds be spared.

“The Secretary has urged Canada not to kill the ostriches but to do further testing to try to better understand the virus,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which Kennedy runs, told Politico. Earlier this year, Kennedy also apparently told Canadian officials that “significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment.”

The whole let-bird-flu-run-wild thing has been a longstanding obsession with Kennedy. Earlier this year, the HHS czar suggested that U.S. farms with infected fowl “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it.” Kennedy and other like-minded individuals believe that the birds that survive viruses like avian flu may have powerful antibodies that are worth studying, and that could be used to develop protections against future outbreaks. However, many science and health professionals have warned that by letting viruses spread, the government would merely be clearing the way for a broader pandemic and additional (and unnecessary) deaths.

Thankfully, Kennedy doesn't have the power to determine bird policy in the U.S. As head of the Department of Health and Human Services, he is only responsible for human health, not bird health (the Department of Agriculture is in charge of that), nor is he capable of making any decisions for the government of Canada. Instead, he has continued to use his public platform to advocate for the controversial notion of allowing viruses to spread.

Kennedy has a number of allies in his mission to save the birds. The U.S.'s administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz (also known by his TV personality, Dr. Oz) has offered to let the birds stay at his 900-acre ranch in Florida. “We're sticking our necks out for the birds,” Oz told the New York Post in May. “The Canadians should stop putting their heads in the sand,” he continued, offering another tortured bird metaphor.

Kennedy's plea for an executioner's stay is sorta funny, given that the HHS director seems to have never met an animal he wasn't comfortable slaughtering—or whose corpse he wasn't interested in desecrating. In addition to Kennedy's admission that he once committed the chef d'oeuvre of public littering by dumping a bear cub corpse in Central Park, his daughter remembers fondly an incident in which he used a chainsaw to cut the head off of a beached whale. His cousin also claims he used to put baby chicks and mice into a blender to feed his hawks. He has denied eating a dog during a 2010 trip to Korea.

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that Coca-Cola would switch from using high-fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar in its drinks. The president made his announcement on Truth Social, but people online were skeptical that Trump was telling the truth, and with good reason. Trump lies constantly.

“I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You'll see. It's just better!”

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola acknowledged the president's statement in an email to Gizmodo but didn't exactly confirm Trump's claims, instead using the kind language you deploy when you're trying not to contradict the most powerful person in the world but have no intention of completely revamping your product line.

“We appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm for our iconic Coca‑Cola brand. More details on new innovative offerings within our Coca‑Cola product range will be shared soon,” a Coca-Cola spokesperson said in a statement.

Coca-Cola also defended the use of high-fructose corn syrup in a tweet Wednesday on X. “The name sounds complex, but high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)—which we use to sweeten some of our beverages—is actually just a sweetener made from corn. It's safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body,” the company wrote. 

The use of high-fructose corn syrup is controversial, though the FDA has previously said it found no evidence that it's more dangerous than cane sugar. Coca-Cola noted that other organizations have asserted this as well, even if the consumption of sugary drinks in any form can lead to a host of serious health problems.

“The American Medical Association has confirmed that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners,” the company continued. “Please be assured that Coca-Cola brand soft drinks do not contain any harmful substances. All Coca-Cola brand products are wholesome beverages manufactured in compliance with the federal law governing food safety and labeling, the laws of all the states, and the laws of over 200 countries throughout the world where they are sold.”

Why would Trump declare that Coke was changing its product if that wasn't the case? There are, of course, a few possibilities. One is that Trump just enjoys lying and feeling powerful. And Trump knows that the so-called Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement is a newly important part of his base since he brought on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Trump often tries to will his own version of reality into existence by simply declaring things through posts on Truth Social. Trump frequently tries this tactic with trade deals, for instance.

President Trump also knows that right-wing media will just parrot his declarations as fact, as Fox News did when its X account proclaimed Trump “celebrates a new win for the ‘MAHA' movement” and insisted “@CocaCola announces it's switching from artificial flavoring to real cane sugar.” Again, Coke announced no such thing. It was just Trump.

But some people believe it may be part of a coordinated plan to distract the public from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Epstein died in a New York jail during Trump's first term, and the entire MAGA movement has been clamoring to see the so-called Epstein files. Trump has failed to deliver that for his base, even claiming that anyone who still cared about Epstein was involved in a “hoax,” calling them his “past supporters.”

Democrats have pounced on the controversy, suggesting that Trump's announcement about Coke was just a new way to distract his followers. California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote a joking response to Trump's post on Wednesday: “Oh thank god! I've totally forgotten about the Epstein files now!”

The other option: Trump is just losing his mind and doesn't know what he's saying. Support for that theory came this week when Trump told a bizarre story about his uncle, the late John Trump, who was a professor at MIT. The president insisted that his uncle had taught Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, and that he had discussions about this before John Trump died in 1985. The problem is that the public didn't know the Unabomber's identity until he was arrested in 1996, and Kaczynski never went to MIT.

Sometimes it's really hard to tell when Trump is intentionally lying. It's entirely possible that the 79-year-old's brain is just melting.

When I first reviewed the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review), my main criticism was over the price. At the time, the only configuration available had a terabyte of storage and cost $1,099. That hurt its appeal to me, especially since it would be a more attractive sub-$1,000 laptop if Dell were selling a 512-GB option.

But what if that 1-TB model was significantly discounted? Well, that changes everything. The 14 Plus is just $700 right now, directly from Dell, down $400 from its retail price. It dipped down to $850 briefly during Amazon Prime Day last week before shooting right back up.

What you get for $700 is a stacked laptop with 1 TB of storage and 16 GB of RAM. It also has a 2,560 x 1,600-pixel resolution display, plenty sharp for the 14-inch size. If you prefer a larger screen to work on, Dell offers the same laptop in a 16-inch size at the same price and specs.

Compare this deal to my current recommendation for the best cheap laptop, the Asus Vivobook 14 (Snapdragon), which is selling for $750. The Dell 14 Plus blows that laptop away at its $700 sale price. Battery life is just as long, but the display is better, and the touchpad is more responsive. These are two areas where laptop manufacturers tend to compromise to bring the price down, and the Dell 14 Plus uses high-quality parts in both.

The Intel Core Ultra 7 256V is the key to the laptop's success. It's a very efficient CPU. It also supplies the best integrated graphics I've tested on a laptop. Don't expect AAA gaming at max settings, but for lighter stuff, the Core Ultra 7 256V may surprise you. It held up surprisingly well at a recent casual LAN party, with Counter-Strike 2, Heroes of the Storm, Starcraft, and a few other lightweight titles.

If you're buying a laptop right now, there's only one other laptop that would make me question buying the Dell 14 Plus. That's the M1 MacBook Air. It got a price cut last week at Walmart, dropping the price to $599, and that sale is still going strong. That's $100 cheaper than the Dell and nets you a proper MacBook, with its unmatched build quality, touchpad, and speakers. It's a pitiful amount of RAM and storage, yes, but for the right person, that MacBook is still probably the way to go.

You can also find higher-quality Windows laptops out there, such as the Surface Laptop, which has a faster screen-refresh rate and a haptic feedback trackpad. But you'll be paying extra for it and getting less storage. At its sale price, the Dell 14 Plus is nearly impossible to beat.

A “biblically strong,” super-smart, unkillable warrior crafted from AI and brought from the digital world into the real world. Oh, and he's on a mysterious mission, so you can add “curiosity” to that list of character traits. What could possibly go wrong? Add in some absolutely dazzling visuals, and you can get a good idea of what's to come in Tron: Ares.

The latest trailer is here, and it gives us our best look yet at Jared Leto's supersoldier, unveiled by a smug-looking Evan Peters and questioned by a very skeptical Gillian Anderson. Also, a glowy Jeff Bridges! Check it out:

Here's the official scoop: “Tron: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. beings. The feature film is directed by Joachim Rønning and stars Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, with Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Jared Leto, Emma Ludbrook, and Steven Lisberger are the producers, with Russell Allen serving as executive producer.”

We should learn a lot more about Tron: Ares at San Diego Comic-Con next week, where it'll have its own Hall H panel to reveal even more details about the new movie (while presumably continuing to remain silent about the recent allegations against Leto).

Tron: Ares hits theaters October 10. Are you excited to check this one out?

Warner Bros. has finally unveiled the new trailer for Mortal Kombat II, the sequel to its 2021 video game adaptation. It stars Karl Urban as B-movie star Johnny Cage, and the character is front and center in this new clip.

The sequel film, whose title is likely to cause further confusion among fighting game fans, on top of the damage already caused by game developer NetherRealm Studios, was first announced in 2022. The trailer aims to put viewers right back in the middle of the gory action.

In contrast to the first film, which saw an original character fight alongside and against series mainstays, Mortal Kombat II will center more on its titular to-the-death martial arts tournament.

“They keep score throughout the movie,” Ed Boon, co-creator of Mortal Kombat, told Entertainment Weekly. “There's a visual representation of who is winning… It's not just a tournament for the sake of a tournament. There are huge consequences, so you really are keeping score. And there are a lot of twists in it that keep you on your toes.”

Characters fortunate enough to not be fatalities returning to the fray from the first film include Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada), Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), Liu Kang (Ludi Lin), Jax (Mehcad Brooks), and Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), as well as Kano (Josh Lawson) and Kung Lao (Max Huang). While the last two were very much killed in the first film, they're somehow back. Undoubtedly, Mortal Kombat II will explain the strange appearances of characters, particularly through the cinematic introduction of revenants—undead versions of deceased fighters.

Joining the fight are Kitana (Adeline Rudolph), Shao Kahn (Martyn Ford), and—as mentioned—Johnny Cage (Karl Urban). In contrast to the previous film, which followed Young's journey, Mortal Kombat II shifts focus to make Cage a central figure. Time will tell whether the new-wave Mortal Kombat II will eat the lunch of video game competitor Street Fighter, which also appears to be assembling its killer lineup of Hollywood actors.

Mortal Kombat II is slated to release October 24.

FCC chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement that the commission is looking to defend U.S. infrastructure against a variety of threats.

The FCC announced yesterday that it plans to vote on new rules "to unleash submarine cable investment to accelerate the buildout of AI infrastructure, while securing cables against foreign adversaries, like China," as part of its efforts to follow the America First Investment Policy Memorandum that President Donald Trump issued in February.

“Submarine cables are the unsung heroes of global communications, carrying 99% of all Internet traffic," FCC chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement. "As the U.S. builds out the data centers and other infrastructure necessary to lead the world in AI and next-gen technologies, these cables are more important than ever."

Carr's proposal takes a two-pronged approach: one incentivizes "the use of American submarine cable repair and maintenance ships and the use of trusted technology abroad, including a proposal to "presumptively entirely exempt from Team Telecom review license applications that meet a high-level security standard," while the other disincentivizes the use of Chinese technology in global infrastructure by imposing additional restrictions on its use in any undersea cables that connect to the U.S..

"We have seen submarine cable infrastructure threatened in recent years by foreign adversaries, like China," Carr said in his statement. Perhaps the most prominent example arrived in November 2024 when two undersea cables that connected Finland and Sweden to the rest of Europe were cut; December 2024 reports suggested that underwater footage supported claims this was a deliberate act of sabotage conducted by a Chinese bulk carrier that dragged its anchor across the cables.

There are also concerns that China might abuse the use of its technologies in these undersea cables to conduct mass spying. Reuters published a special report in 2023 about the U.S. and China's mutual distrust over the other's involvement with this critical infrastructure. "Spy agencies can readily tap into cables landing on their territory," the report said, with one expert telling the outlet that "undersea cables were 'a surveillance gold mine' for the world's intelligence agencies."

So what does Carr want to do about that? The FCC said that Carr's proposal would see it "adopt a range of measures to protect submarine cables against foreign adversaries—apply a presumption of denial for certain foreign adversary-controlled license applicants, limiting capacity leasing agreements to such entities, prohibiting the use of 'covered' equipment, establishing cybersecurity and physical security requirements, and more—all while streamlining the Commission's license review procedures."

This wouldn't be the first time the U.S. looked to ban Chinese tech from communications infrastructure. Equipment made by Huawei and ZTE was banned from use in American telecommunications in 2019, for example, although the Pentagon argued in 2024 that it was effectively impossible not to use Huawei's products in some capacity because it's the largest telecoms provider in the world. Presumably, these restrictions would face similar obstacles if they're accepted.

In what might be the biggest flex from a streamer to assert dominance in the video game adaptation space, Netflix has announced that its next venture will be to create a live-action adaptation of Ubisoft's megapopular series, Assassin's Creed.

In a press release, Netflix announced that its live-action Assassin's Creed series will be helmed by Emmy nominees Roberto Patino and David Wiener, who respectively worked on shows like Westworld, Sons of Anarchy, and Paramount's own video game adaptation of Halo. While Netflix has yet to disclose any plot details for the project, it has confirmed that the series has been in development for nearly five years, with the project first being announced in 2020.

“We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us,” Wiener and Patino wrote in a joint statement. “Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour, and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story—about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance.”

They continued, “But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet.”

Based on Ubisoft's 2007 game, Assassin's Creed is a historical action-adventure game that follows the exploits of a secret order of Assassins who, throughout time, have influenced key historical events. The series, which has spawned a total of 14 games since its inception, has seen its heroes play pivotal roles in events from the Revolutionary War, Ancient Egypt, and the Sengoku Period, with its latest entry, Assassin's Creed Shadows.

As many Assassin's Creed fans will know, this isn't the first time that a live-action adaptation has been attempted. Back in 2016, 20th Century Fox's Michael Fassbender-led film tried to bring the sci-fi action fanfare to the silver screen, but despite Fassbender's affinity for the games, it failed to wow fans or the box office.

Regardless of what's ostensibly gaming's golden goose, failing to nail its landing in live-action territory, Netflix executives, who in the same press release signaled toward past triumphs with Castlevania, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and Arcane, aren't shying away from the challenge of doing better by the series than past attempts to adapt it.

“When we first announced our partnership with Ubisoft in 2020, we set out with an ambitious goal to bring the rich, expansive world of Assassin's Creed to life in bold new ways,” Peter Friedlander, Netflix's Vice President, wrote. “Now, after years of dedicated collaboration, it's inspiring to see just how far that vision has come. Guided by the deft hands of Roberto Patino and David Wiener, the team has carefully crafted an epic adventure that both honors the legacy of the Assassin's Creed franchise and invites longtime fans and newcomers alike to experience the thrill of the Brotherhood as never before.”

“We are so excited to work alongside Roberto, David, and our Netflix partners to bring this beloved franchise to series,” Margaret Boykin, executive producer and head of content at Ubisoft Film and Television, added. “We look forward to delivering an experience that speaks to the heart of what fans love about Assassin's Creed, while introducing its unforgettable worlds and timeless themes to new audiences worldwide.”

As with everything live-action video game adaptation-related, time will tell whether the optimistic disposition of its executives shines through once Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation graces the screens of its once-bitten-twice-shy viewers.

The beauty industry has seen an explosion of offerings recently. Customers can now access treatments far beyond basic hair and nail care, from wrinkle-smoothing Botox and fillers to permanent laser hair removal to weight management through GLP-1 medications.

Riding this wave of industry growth is Boulevard, a provider of scheduling and payment software for the self-care sector.

The 9-year-old Boulevard just raised $80 million in Series D funding, valuing the business at nearly $800 million, a meaningful uptick from the $595 million valuation it garnered three years ago. The round was led by growth equity firm JMI Equity and included participation from existing investors Index Ventures and VMG Partners.

When Boulevard launched in 2016, the company's co-founders, Matt Danna and Sean Stavropoulos, wanted to solve what seemed like a simple problem: allowing people to book hairstyling visits online.

The duo couldn't understand why salons still made clients call to make appointments. What they discovered was that salons were intentionally resistant to online scheduling: They were trying to optimize stylists' time. 

So, Boulevard built a machine learning-based booking system that considers various constraints, such as clients' unique service needs and punctuality history.

The company initially sold their precision-scheduling software to hair salons, expanding to barbershops, spas, and nail salons.

Boulevard's revenue soared over 500% in the last three years, partly driven by a burgeoning new client segment: medspas. These businesses, which are a hybrid between traditional day spas and medical clinics, provide nonsurgical, minimally invasive procedures ranging from microneedling and Botox to prescribing GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for weight loss.

Danna, who serves as Boulevard's CEO, said he was first surprised that medspa owners were interested in using the company's software instead of electronic medical records systems (EMRs). He discovered that EMRs are better suited for clients billing insurance, whereas medspas predominantly run on a cash-pay model.

Adapting Boulevard's software to serve medspas was pretty straightforward, Danna said. The company became HIPAA compliant and integrated medspa-specific features, including visual charts for precise Botox and filler injection mapping.

Three years after introducing these features, Boulevard estimates that it is powering approximately 15% of all medspas in the U.S.

“I am really impressed by how beauty and medical services lines are blurring,” Danna said. “We have hair salons that offer medspa services.”

Over the years, Boulevard expanded its offerings to include an online payment system, a business offering that the company unexpectedly stumbled upon. “We ended up learning that if you make it easy to book online, it is easy to not show up for an appointment,” Danna said. “So, we started capturing credit cards to hold appointments, and that solved the problem of no-shows.”

Though Boulevard initially had no intention of charging those credit cards, customers requested the company use the data for transactions. Boulevard now estimates it will process approximately $5 billion in payments this year.

Of course, Boulevard has plenty of competition, including Zenoti, which was last valued at $1 billion in 2020, Fresha, Booksy, and many others.

Do you need more storage?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


HighPoint Technologies, which specializes in storage solutions, just introduced two adapters that massively expand your system's storage capacity through a single PCIe slot. According to the company's press release, the Rocket 1628A and 1528D NVMe Switch Adapters let you directly plug up to eight PCIe devices into one PCIe 5.0 x16 or PCIe 4.0 x16 slot, or up to 32 NVMe drives via a UBM-compliant backplane.

These adapters are primarily designed to give systems with limited space and PCIe/NVMe slots more connectivity options. Aside from accommodating NVMe drives, they're also designed to work with GPUs, NICs, capture cards, and storage controllers, allowing you to attach all the tools you need, even if your workstation has a limited number of slots. Aside from this, HighPoint's PCIe switching architecture and flexible lane allocation optimize the connection for all attached devices, splitting the x16 bandwidth into multiple x4 and x8 lanes to avoid bottlenecks.

Aside from those features, the company also included several quality-of-life improvements. The devices offer plug-and-play compatibility — they use industry standard MCIO and SlimSAS interfaces, allowing them to slot in on existing hardware, and their LP MD2 form factor ensures they'll fit in 1U and 2U rackmount servers. They also work with both x86 and ARM platforms and are natively supported by operating systems with NVMe driver support. You can also check the status of each card without taking it apart, thanks to its LED status lights for diagnostics. But in case you need to take them apart for service, the 1628A and 1528D offer hot-swap capabilities, ensuring that your system remains online.

The company recommends these adapters for multiple applications, including data center and edge computing that need high-density storage, AI and machine learning infrastructure that demand multi-GPU setups, industrial automation systems with multiple PCIe sensor arrays, compact professional workstations with limited PCIe expandability, and custom storage solutions. However, these adapters are designed for enterprise use, so they are generally meant for EDSFF E1.S and E3.S SSDs, not the typical M.2 drives you'll find in your nearby computer store.

The Rocket 1628A is now available on the HighPoint store for $1,499, while the Rocket 1528D is much more affordable (although slower) at just $699. Nevertheless, these devices are the perfect solution for those who require more PCIe slots but are constrained by space and limited expandability in their current system.

Mark Zuckerberg and other current and former Meta executives have settled a lawsuit filed by a group of shareholders, who were seeking $8 billion for the damage the executives caused the company by allowing repeated violations of Facebook users' privacy in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The parties did not disclose details of the settlement, according to Reuters.

Facebook shareholders filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, and other executives, alleging they intentionally violated a Federal Trade Commission agreement by sharing user data with third-party apps without user consent.

The FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019 for failing to comply with a 2012 agreement requiring the company to protect users' personal data.

The trial was expected to feature testimonies from Zuckerberg, Sandberg, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.

French AI lab Mistral introduced a range of new features to its Le Chat chatbot on Thursday that bring it closer to the capabilities of rivals like OpenAI and Google. The new update includes a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing. 

The news comes a couple days after Mistral released Voxtral, its first open source AI audio model that's capable of reasoning in multiple languages, transcription, and more. Voxtral is also available via Le Chat.

Mistral says its new deep research mode, like those offered by rivals, turns Le Chat into a coordinated research assistant that can plan, clarify your needs, search, and synthesize data. 

“What the model does is really go and look into a big variety of sources on the web to answer a specific question,” Mistral's head of product, Elisa Salamanca, told TechCrunch. “We believe this feature is going to be very relevant for both consumer and enterprise use cases. For consumers, because it can research travel and provide an exhaustive analysis of the best travel plans. And for enterprise work, it can do exhaustive research.”

While the updates are available across all tiers — Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise — Salamanca notes that Mistral is focusing on integrating Le Chat and Mistral's productivity suite into enterprise ecosystems with this release. That's in large part because Mistral handles data connectors differently than competitors. 

“A lot of customers who have very sensitive data don't actually use cloud services, or if they do, they do it on their own premises with virtual private clouds,” Salamanca said, citing customers in banking, defense, and government.

To address this, Salamanca said Mistral's Le Chat and productivity suite connect to enterprise data on-premises. In other words, companies can use Le Chat's deep reasoning and other capabilities to analyze their own internal data without having to upload anything to the cloud. That's a meaningful differentiator against cloud-native LLM platforms like OpenAI, which is Azure-hosted, and Gemini, which is Google Cloud-based. It also opens the door for Mistral to offer other productivity tools. 

“A big part of our value proposition, especially when we release Le Chat Enterprise, is that we want to make [things like] Microsoft Excel and Google Docs and that kind of office suite work seamlessly with our capabilities,” Salamanca said. “So the connectors that we release with Le Chat Enterprise are actually one step in that direction. We're building these connectors internally because we believe this is going to be a key for using Le Chat as a productivity enabler in the business context.”

Aside from deep reasoning, Le Chat has gotten other updates today. While users have been able to use Le Chat to reason through complex questions via Magistral, Mistral's new reasoning AI model, that capability was previously only available in English. Now Mistral natively supports multilingual reasoning in languages like French, Spanish, Japanese, and others. Mistral says Le Chat can also code-switch between languages midsentence. 

This latest update from Mistral also includes the addition of Projects, which helps users stay organized by grouping chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces. Each project can have its own default library and remember which tools and settings a user has enabled. Mistral says use cases include planning a move, designing a new product feature, or keeping work-related projects on track. 

Finally, Le Chat is getting improved image-editing capabilities. This allows users to create and edit images with prompts like “remove the object” or “place me in another city.” 

The new features put Mistral in a more competitive range with the AI industry's frontrunners, positioning Le Chat as not just a model demo, but also a full-stack contender.

Last year, Delta Air Lines announced it was testing out dynamic pricing on some flights using tools built by the tech company Fetcherr. And while the test was initially limited, executives from the company announced that 3% of flights now use AI pricing, and they hope to sell 20% of all tickets using a dynamic price by the end of the year.

Edward H. Bastian, the CEO of Delta, explained the strategy on an investors call last week, noting that it was “optimizing revenue through [its] partnership with Fetcherr,” an Israeli tech company founded in 2019, and “leveraging AI-enhanced pricing solutions.”

“So today, we're about 3% of domestic. And that's… our goal is to have about 20% by the end of the year, and that's a goal,” Glen Hauenstein, the president of Delta, told investors on July 10. “I mean, we can report back on what the actual numbers are. But you have to train these models as you might, and you have to give it multiple opportunities to provide different results.”

Hauenstein said the company was in a “heavy testing phase” but that executives at the company “like what we see.”

“We like it a lot, and we're continuing to roll it out, but we're going to take our time and make sure that the rollout is successful as opposed to trying to rush it and risk that there are unwanted answers in there,” the president said.

What does that mean? If you ask critics like Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona, it means Delta isn't being fair about the way it's pricing seats.

“Delta's CEO just got caught bragging about using AI to find your pain point—meaning they'll squeeze you for every penny,” Gallego wrote Tuesday on X. “This isn't fair pricing or competitive pricing. It's predatory pricing. I won't let them get away with this.”

But the company disputes the idea that there's anything unfair about its use of AI to price fares, telling Fortune magazine, “Our fares are publicly filed and based solely on trip-related factors like advance purchase and cabin class, and we maintain strict safeguards to ensure compliance with federal law.”

Dynamic pricing is highly controversial and can lead to some intense backlash. When news broke back in early 2024 that Wendy's was thinking about introducing surge pricing—making food items more expensive during certain times of the day—it backed off the plan almost immediately.

Will Delta face the same backlash? That seems likely, given the subsequent outrage you can see on social media. But that doesn't mean Delta will be as responsive to the negative publicity. Delta makes a significant portion of its revenue from its partnership with American Express, meaning it's less sensitive to people griping about the penny-pinching nightmare that is flying in the 21st century. Or, as the Atlantic put it in an article from 2023, airlines are just banks now. And banks don't really care if you think they're out to just make money without regard for their customers' feelings.

A $35 billion deal.

Synopsys this week received approval from Chinese regulators to complete its $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, removing the final obstacle to closing the deal, which happens July 17. The green light from Beijing follows prior clearances from U.S. and European authorities, but was granted with specific conditions. The combined company — which will retain the Synopsys name — will become a powerhouse offering tools that will span the full design spectrum of both chips and actual devices, which will open a lot of new doors both for Synopsys-Ansys and the industry. However, there may be some ramifications, too.

Synopsys is primarily known for electronic design automation (EDA) software that enables the design and verification of semiconductor circuits, chips, and multi-chiplet system-in-packages (SiPs). By contrast, Ansys specializes in simulation tools that model how products perform in the real world — electrically, thermally, structurally, and even fluidically — spanning across many industries and applications, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, and industrial."High-end simulation capabilities are more important than ever with the acceleration of AI-powered systems, which are silicon-powered and increasingly complex to design and deliver," a spokesperson for Synopsys told Tom's Hardware. "Engineering AI-powered products requires the integration of digital design with multiphysics simulation and analysis. For example, with the rise of multi-die architectures, designers must simulate and analyze thermal, power, and signal integrity interactions across multiple chips within a single package to ensure optimal performance and reliability. At Synopsys (now including Ansys), we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive, integrated simulation and design solutions that empower customers to innovate the next generation of intelligent systems. Simulation remains foundational to our mission of enabling world-changing innovation."

The combined company will offer tools that span the full design spectrum, from transistor-level chip design (Synopsys) to physical system analysis and simulation (Ansys). As a result, the transaction creates a unified platform for developing complex, multi-domain products like AI processors and servers, aircraft, defense systems, consumer electronics, and vehicles, just to name a few.

Using tools from Ansys and Synopsys, engineers can simulate and optimize both semiconductor and system behavior early in the design cycle, reducing time to market and increasing design confidence. From now on, these tools will come from one source, which will increase the appeal of using solutions from the combined company instead of using tools from companies like Altair, Cadence, Dassault Systèmes, or Siemens.

One of the particular strengths of the joint company will be the ability to merge simulation data (Ansys) with AI-accelerated electronic design automation tools (Synopsys), which will open the door for smarter, automated co-design across domains. Designers can now use AI to optimize power, performance, thermal behavior, and reliability of devices holistically, which will simplify and perhaps even shrink the development cycle. For example, when designing an application processor, vertically integrated companies will be able to simulate the whole device well before mass production of the chip to get the final device design ready just as soon as they get the actual chip from the fab. Also, this could be particularly important in a world where design technology co-optimization (DTCO) becomes a major factor in the extraction benefits of the latest process technology."AI-enabled EDA tools and advanced simulation capabilities truly go hand in hand," the company told us. "Through our strong, 8-year partnership, we have seen first-hand how integrating robust simulation into AI-powered design environments enables engineering teams to manage complexity, catch issues earlier, and accelerate development. This combination allows for continuous co-optimization from silicon to systems, helping customers innovate faster and deliver higher quality solutions across a wide range of industries."

In fact, Synopsys is already working hard to add simulation to its EDA stack, which will be particularly beneficial for multi-chiplet designs, such as data center CPUs and GPUs, or upcoming UCIe-enabled solutions."We are fast-tracking the development and delivery of holistic engineering solutions that bring together multiphysics simulation with the full EDA stack, including advanced solutions for multi-die chip packaging," the representative continued. "We expect to deliver our first set of integrated capabilities in the first half of 2026."

Integration of simulation capabilities into the EDA stack will not be the only thing that the new Synopsys will do with the Ansys product portfolio. The company plans to continue evolving Ansys tools to make them more versatile for next-generation challenges.

"We are committed to expanding and building on Ansys's leading portfolio of engineering and simulation solutions," said the spokesperson. "Together as one company, we're uniquely positioned to deliver new, holistic system design solutions for customers across industries like semiconductors, high-tech, automotive, aerospace, industrial, and more. We'll continue to invest in innovation that advances the capabilities of our combined offerings, so we can better serve our customers across a broad range of industries."

While EDA tools are ubiquitous for chip design, simulation is used across many industries. As a result, Synopsys will tap into Ansys's stronghold in aerospace, automotive, energy, and heavy industry, whereas Ansys gains deeper exposure to electronics and semiconductors as a result of the transaction. Unless specifically prohibited (more on this later), both companies will be able to upsell and bundle solutions, increasing customer stickiness and total contract value.

"Bringing Synopsys and Ansys together creates an industry leader in engineering solutions from silicon to systems and positions us to take on a broader set of opportunities," the representative continued. "Together, we are able to serve not only our existing semiconductor and high-tech customers. We can also accelerate innovation across industries like automotive, aerospace, industrial, healthcare, and more."

While Ansys is becoming a part of Synopsys and will be integrated into the company, the Ansys brand will be retained for some time.

"Synopsys is now the company brand, with Ansys positioned as 'part of Synopsys'," the company explained. "We will continue to use the Ansys brand for select products, and we will share more guidance as the integration moves forward. There are no immediate plans to retire the Ansys brand; we will keep leveraging its strong reputation and legacy in simulation to benefit our customers."

The merger reduces the number of major EDA and engineering simulation players, which may lead to unforeseen results. Cadence (Synopsys's arch rival) will face stronger competition if the integration succeeds, which might trigger further M&A or ecosystem shifts.

While the transaction might raise antitrust concerns, the deal was okayed by regulators in Europe, the U.S., and the UK. China's antitrust regulator imposed a condition that Synopsys must not turn down any customer requests to extend existing licenses or force bundling. In addition, the U.S. demanded that Synopsys ensure all Ansys and Synopsys tools will be interoperable with competing solutions from rivals, such as Cadence, Dassault, or Siemens.

Because the merged firm will influence critical systems and system design workflows, it could face more scrutiny from governments, especially in the U.S., China, and the EU. As a result, expect export restrictions, national security rules, and cross-border IP management to become even more complex than they are today.

Chinese regulators already created a roadblock for the Cadence and Ansys transaction when, earlier this year, the U.S. government considered limiting access to EDA software for Chinese entities over national security concerns, briefly introducing new export controls before removing them weeks later after China agreed to ease export controls on rare earth metals.

This approval is especially notable given China's past reluctance to sign off on large U.S. tech mergers, such as Qualcomm and NXP in 2018 or Intel and Tower Semiconductor in 2023. However, given unique capabilities that the merged Synopsys-Ansys company is set to provide, it is important for Chinese chip and system designers; thus, China greenlit the deal. This does not mean that the combined firm will not be a part of the geopolitical tensions between the U.S., China, and the EU.

The merger of Synopsys and Ansys reduces the number of independent players in a critical tech space, which is set to raise competitive and regulatory concerns. As a result, regulatory pressure on the combined company may grow, as the new entity will offer a set of tools that is applicable in the semiconductor sector and in other sensitive spaces, such as aerospace or defense.

But Analogue says that it will absorb any costs, with pre-order prices honored.

Premium retro console (re)maker Analogue has updated the FAQ page for its long-awaited reimagining of the Nintendo 64. The big news is that the Analogue 3D (formerly the Analogue 64) is delayed again. However, the delay doesn't seem to be extreme, with shipments now being touted to begin in “late August.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Analogue blamed “last week's sudden tariff changes” for the change of plans.

Following last week's sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month. We're absorbing the costs—your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges. Late August, the wait ends: reviews go live with everything we've been saving for this moment.…July 15, 2025

If you are one of the long-suffering pre-order customers, then perhaps the assertion that tariffs have caused this delay may worry you. Analogue assures all its pre-order purchasers that “we're absorbing the costs – your pre-order price remains the same. No additional charges.”

The firm is still offering any pre-order customers the chance to cancel for a refund at any time, should they be unhappy about the delay. But having had their $250 locked in for a while already, and the potential price rises coming when the units hit general distribution, we wouldn't expect a lot to take up this offer.

To put this latest delay into perspective, the Analogue 3D was originally teased in 2023, announced in 2024, and pre-order customers were told to expect hardware shipments in Q1 2025. In March this year, customers were asked to shoulder a delay until July, without explicit reasons given. Now, macroeconomic turbulence has pushed the delivery dates back to “late August.”



The Analogue 3D is new console hardware designed to replace your creaking Nintendo 64, offering “one hundred percent compatibility” with original cartridges from every region (USA, EU, and JP).

Giving the Analogue 3D its modern allure is the impeccable styling that this remake is known for. Importantly, the Analogue 3D also folds in 4K HDMI output – with original display modes supported, as well as “reference quality recreations of specific model CRTs and PVMs.”

Other modern niceties include the Wireless and 2.4G peripheral compatibility, though the machine still packs four original-style controller ports.

Remember, like several other modern retro recreations, the Analogue 3D isn't relying on software emulation for its functionality. It uses a specially modified FPGA, which operates on a transistor level implementation,” to weave all its N64 magic.



In case you're wondering, Analogue asserts that its new N64 tribute doesn't play copyrighted ROM files. Rather, “It plays legacy game cartridge via the cartridge slot,” it says. That probably leaves it open to the use of N64 backup systems such as the NEO N64 Myth Cart, although we can't be sure until hardware gets into enthusiast hands.

Analogue appears to have a sterling track record for its retro gaming FPGA hardware. It might already be known to you for its 'Pocket' - a Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance compatible portable. It has also previously sold machines for MegaDrive / Genesis and SNES devotees.

A cheap CPU for Copilot+ PCs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD on Wednesday added the sixth processor to its Ryzen AI 300-series lineup. The CPU in question is the quad-core Ryzen AI 5 330 product that will be the entry-level product in the family, thus priced below others and making Ryzen AI more accessible to customers on a budget. While the CPU will come with a reduced number of general-purpose cores, it will still offer a 50 TOPS NPU, thus being fully compliant with the requirements of Microsoft's Copilot+ PCs.

AMD's Ryzen AI 5 330 is a quad-core processor operating at 2.0 GHz – 4.50 GHz, equipped with an AMD Radeon 820M integrated GPU featuring 128 stream processors (two GPU clusters) and an NPU with 50 TOPS performance. Just like other members of the Ryzen AI 300-series family, the model 330 comes with a dual-channel DDR5 memory controller, but unlike other CPUs in the lineup, the new unit has a configurable TDP (cTDP) of between 15W and 28W.

AMD does not disclose how many Zen 5 and Zen 5c cores the CPU has, but this is common for the general specifications of AMD's processors. In fact, the company also does not disclose whether the CPU uses Strix Point or Krackan Point silicon, but we can expect this information to be disclosed once the company adds the new SKU to its website.

AMD clearly positions its Ryzen AI 5 330 as an entry-level solution for Microsoft Copilot+ PCs, which is why the CPU comes with only general-purpose cores and a very low-end integrated GPU that will barely be enough even for casual gaming. The main feature of the processor is its NPU, which exceeds Microsoft's requirements for Copilot+-badged systems and therefore delivers all the AI features of Windows 11.

"The new AMD Ryzen AI 5 330 processor is designed to offer incredible everyday compute experiences in mainstream and affordable Copilot+ PCs," a statement by AMD reads. "With 50 NPU TOPS, notebooks powered by AMD Ryzen AI 5 330 exceed Microsoft's requirements for Copilot+ PCs, offering true next-gen AI experiences built for Windows 11."

By offering a cheap Copilot+-compliant processor, AMD probably attempts to capture a sizeable part of the AI PC market as inexpensive machines tend to sell in high volumes, particularly in retail. Such a move will strengthen AMD's market position and enable the company to sell cut-down versions of its Ryzen AI 300-series CPUs with disabled general-purpose cores and GPU clusters.

Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey isn't just vibe coding new social apps, like Bitchat and Sun Day; he has also invested $10 million in an effort to fund experimental open source projects and other tools that could ultimately transform the social media landscape.

These efforts are funneled through an online collective called “andOtherStuff,” formed in May, whose team includes Dorsey; Twitter's first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath; “Calle,” creator of the e-cash platform Cashu; Alex Gleason, former engineering head at Truth Social; and Jeff Gardner, the fourth employee at Intercom.

The group originally met through collaborating on Nostr, an open, “apolitical” social networking protocol that has been receiving the bulk of Dorsey's attention since Twitter's sale to Elon Musk and his stepping down from social network Bluesky's board. However, the team will experiment with other tools, too, like ActivityPub, the protocol that powers the decentralized app Mastodon and others, as well as Cashu.

In recent years, Dorsey has been more critical of how social media platforms have evolved, saying that Twitter should have never been a company and that Bluesky seemed to be repeating the mistakes he and others made at Twitter. 

As a result, the team at “andOtherStuff” is determined not to build a company but is instead operating like a “community of hackers,” explains Henshaw-Plath. Together, they're working to create technologies that could include new consumer social apps as well as various experiments, like developer tools or libraries, that would allow others to build apps for themselves.

For instance, the team is behind an app called Shakespeare, which is like the app-building platform Lovable, but specifically for building Nostr-based social apps with AI assistance.

The group is also behind heynow, a voice note app built on Nostr; Cashu wallet; private messenger White Noise; and the Nostr-based social community +chorus, in addition to the apps Dorsey has already released.

Developments in AI-based coding have made this type of experimentation possible, Henshaw-Plath points out, in the same way that technologies like Ruby on Rails, Django, and JSON helped to fuel an earlier version of the web, dubbed Web 2.0.

Related to these efforts, Henshaw-Plath sat down with Dorsey for the debut episode of his new podcast, revolution.social with @rabble. (Henshaw-Plath's handle on X is @rabble.)

Since Dorsey lives in Costa Rica and Henshaw-Plath lives in New Zealand, the two met up at a hackathon in Switzerland for the chat. In the nearly hour-long episode, Dorsey delves into Twitter's history as well as his philosophies around where social media went wrong and how it can be fixed.

“It took me a long time to realize this … I didn't really put it into words until I came back as CEO the second time. But it's hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,” Dorsey says. He notes that Twitter was at the mercy of its advertisers — something Musk also faces despite taking Twitter, now called X, private. Musk has even threatened advertisers with lawsuits over ad boycotts driven by their concerns over X's lack of moderation and controversial comments Musk has made.

While Dorsey understands that catering to advertisers was correct for the business and for Twitter's stock price, it was the “wrong thing for the internet.” 

“They can just remove the money — your money — and your revenue goes down completely,” Dorsey says of advertisers' power. “So if [Twitter] were an open protocol, if it were truly an open project, you could build a business on top of it, and you could build a very healthy business on top of it.”

Dorsey eventually funded an effort to build an open protocol inside Twitter, which later spun out to become Bluesky. But Dorsey believes Bluesky faces the same challenges as traditional social media because of its structure — it's funded by VCs, like other startups. Already, it has had to bow to government requests and faced moderation challenges, he points out.

“I think [Bluesky CEO] Jay [Graber] is great. I think the team is great,” Dorsey told Henshaw-Plath, “but the structure is what I disagree with … I want to push the energy in a different direction, which is more like Bitcoin, which is completely open and not owned by anyone from a protocol layer. That's what I see in Nostr as well,” he says. “That's where I want to push my energy … into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation,” Dorsey adds.

In later episodes, Henshaw-Plath will interview others who have insight into how social media and tech have evolved, including journalists like Kara Swisher and Taylor Lorenz; former Twitter head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth; Substack co-founder Chris Best; Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine; Cory Doctorow (who coined the term “enshittification” to describe the state of much of the current web); and renowned misinformation researcher Renée DiResta.

The team at “andOtherStuff” is also working on a social media “Bill of Rights,” says Henshaw-Plath, which spells out what social media platforms need to provide in areas like privacy, security, interoperability, transparency, identity, self-governance, and portability.

This, they believe, will help platforms, including Bluesky and others, remain accountable to their users despite any outside pressure.

Dorsey's initial investment has gotten the new nonprofit up and running, and he worked on some of its initial iOS apps. Meanwhile, others are contributing their time to build Android versions, developer tools, and different social media experiments. 

More is still in the works, says Henshaw-Plath. 

“There are things that we're not ready to talk about yet that'll be very exciting,” he teases.

At some point during the evolution of life on Earth, inorganic matter became organic, nonliving matter became living. How this happened is one of humankind's greatest mysteries. Today, scientists work to develop synthetic cells that mimic living cells, hoping to uncover clues that will help answer the question: how did life on Earth begin?

While there's no single definition of life, three elements recur across biology:

In the past, researchers have focused on compartmentalization, but not on metabolism. Yet this cycle of building up and breaking down molecules is a critical aspect of how living cells respond to environmental stimuli, replicate and evolve.

Now researchers from the University of California San Diego have designed a system that synthesizes cell membranes and incorporates metabolic activity. Their work appears in Nature Chemistry and is featured on the cover of the June 2025 issue.

Cells that lack a metabolic network are stuck -- they aren't able to remodel, grow or divide. Life today is highly evolved, but we want to understand if metabolism can occur in very simple chemical systems, before the evolution of more complex biology occurred."

Neal Devaraj, the Murray Goodman Endowed Chair in Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego and principal investigator on the paper

Lipids are fatty compounds that play a crucial role in many cell functions. In living cells, lipid membranes serve as barriers, separating cells from the external environment. Lipid membranes are dynamic, capable of remodeling themselves in response to cellular demands.

As a crucial step in understanding how living cells evolved, Devaraj's lab designed a system where lipids can not only form membranes, but through metabolism, can also break them down. The system they created was abiotic, meaning only nonliving matter was used. This is important in helping understand how life emerged on prebiotic Earth, when only nonliving matter existed.

"We are trying to answer the fundamental question: what are the minimal systems that have the properties of life?" said Alessandro Fracassi, a postdoctoral scholar in Devaraj's lab and first author on the paper.

The chemical cycle they created uses a chemical fuel to activate fatty acids. The fatty acids then couple with lysophospholipids, which generate phospholipids. These phospholipids spontaneously form membranes, but in the absence of fuel, they break down and return to the fatty acid and lysophospholipid components. The cycle begins anew.

Now that they've shown they can create an artificial cell membrane, they want to continue adding layers of complexity until they have created something that has many more of the properties we associate with "life."

"We know a lot about living cells and what they're made of," stated Fracassi. "But if you laid out all the separate components, we don't actually understand how to put them together to make the cell function as it does. We're trying to recreate a primitive yet functional cell, one layer at a time."

In addition to shedding light on how life may have begun in an abiotic environment, the development of artificial cells can have a real-world impact. Drug delivery, biomanufacturing, environmental remediation, biomimetic sensors are all possibilities over the coming decades as we continue to deepen our understanding of how life on Earth came to be.

"We may not see these kinds of advancements for 10 or 20 years," Devaraj noted. "But we have to do the work today, because we still have so much to learn."

Thomas McElrath, MD, PhD, of the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Brigham & Women's Hospital, is the lead and corresponding author of a paper published in JAMA Network Open, "Utility of the US Preventive Services Task Force for Preeclampsia Risk Assessment and Aspirin Prophylaxis."

Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?

Dr. McElrath: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disease that complicates 7-10% of pregnancies. While recent advances in understanding the underlying causes of PE have been made, predicting its occurrence has historically been difficult because it is a complex condition that likely results from a variety of causes and can present in different ways.

To address this challenge, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed a series of PE-associated studies to develop a set of risk factors to assist in characterizing patient risk of PE. However, since these risk factors were identified in individual and separate studies, they have not been evaluated as a whole to see how effective they are at stratifying risk within a single, diverse patient population.

We aimed to assess how well these guidelines help physicians identify patients at risk of PE and if those patients who were identified as being at-risk patients were directed to take aspirin as a preventative measure.

We found that using the USPSTF guidelines identified 89% of participants as being at either moderate or high risk for PE. With the vast majority of the population being labeled as "at risk," it is unclear if the USPSTF guidelines are serving their intended use of helping clinicians identify patients at most need of additional care.

Furthermore, we found that only 37% of the participants who were identified as being at moderate risk were receiving the recommended prophylaxis of one low-dose aspirin per day, suggesting a gap still exists between risk identification and connection to preventative care.

Q: What question were you investigating?

How well do the risk assessment guidelines for preeclampsia that were developed by the USPTF work in identifying those at increased risk of preeclampsia?

Subsequently, how many of those individuals identified at increased risk are receiving a prescription of aspirin prophylaxis, as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine?

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We approached and enrolled 5,600+ individuals with singleton pregnancies who met the inclusion criteria for the study at 11 different centers in geographically diverse area of the United States.

For the purposes of the study, we defined individuals as being in the high-risk category if they had at least one high risk factor (as identified by the USPTF). Individuals were defined as being in the moderate risk category if they had at least one of the moderate risk factors, but no high-risk factors. Participants were defined as being in the low-risk category if they had no moderate or high-risk factors.

Q: What did you find?

Using the USPTF screening guidelines, we found that 18% of participants were in the high-risk category, 71% of participants were in the moderate risk category and 11% were in the low-risk category.

These categories were therefore labeling 89% of the population as at moderate or high risk for PE.

With the majority of the population being labeled as risk, it is unclear if the USPSTF guidelines are serving their intended use of assisting clinicians in stratifying preeclampsia risk.

The actual rates of PE for each of the three categories were as follows:

While the majority of patients (82%) at high risk for PE received a recommendation for aspirin prophylaxis, patients at moderate risk for PE received recommendations at much lower rates.

Only about half of the patients with two or more moderate risk factors received recommendations for an aspirin prophylaxis while less than 25% of patients with one risk factor received a recommendation for aspirin.

Q: What are the implications?

If the intended utility of the guidelines is to facilitate the focus of clinical attention and limited clinical resources on those at greatest risk of preeclampsia, identifying the majority of the population as "at risk" does not meet this end.

Q: What are the next steps?

The risk factors for PE, and probably other conditions, should be simultaneously evaluated in a single population, not just compiled from the results of separate and individual studies, to ensure that they provide clinically actionable information that can assist with patient risk stratification and the alignment of clinical resources.

Genes, fragments of DNA located on our chromosomes, control much of what happens in cells. Each cell activates only the genes it needs, silencing the rest through molecular "switches" present on each gene. However, these switches can sometimes be erroneously activated, leading the cell to behave abnormally and potentially resulting in diseases such as cancer or autoimmune disorders.

The activity of these "switches" is regulated by their methylation status, chemical marks that can be added to or removed from DNA. Thanks to new tools based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, the team led by Dr José Luis Sardina, group leader at the Josep Carreras Institute, has succeeded in controlling the "switch" of the IL1RN gene in cells derived from human leukemia, turning it on or off by adding or removing these chemical marks.

The results of the study, led by Dr Gemma Valcárcel and conducted in collaboration with Dr. Esteban Ballestar's team, have just been published in the prestigious journal Science Advances. The research demonstrates how precise control of IL1RN gene activity affects the production of inflammatory cells that respond abnormally to external stimuli. This altered response causes the cells to produce modified inflammatory cytokines, showing a distinct capacity to modulate tumor growth in laboratory models.

This proof of concept demonstrates that it is possible to regulate the activity of key immune system genes such as IL1RN through DNA methylation, thereby modulating functions like inflammation or tumor progression. Although researchers already suspected that such chemical modifications could influence immune system behavior, this study provides the first experimental evidence confirming that connection and revealing its functional consequences.

With this knowledge and the technological capability to activate or deactivate individual genes with precision, the door is opened to the development of new strategies aimed at intervening in the most fundamental biological processes of immune cells and, potentially, new therapies for certain subtypes of leukemia and other diseases with an inflammatory component.

This work was funded by the Government of Spain, the Government of Catalonia, the Carlos III Health Institute, and Worldwide Cancer Research.

A new study by a Tulane University researcher casts doubt on a widely used shortcut in rectal cancer drug trials, raising concerns that some treatments may be fast-tracked for approval without evidence they help patients live longer.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open in collaboration with researchers at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, found that the absence of detectable tumors after treatment – a key metric in clinical cancer drug trials known as pathologic complete response or pCR – does not reliably predict an improvement in long-term survival for patients diagnosed with rectal cancer.

Traditionally, success of treatments for these patients was determined by measuring "overall survival," or the years between a person's diagnosis and death. Since 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed pharmaceutical companies to use tumor-free status post-therapy as a surrogate for overall survival to cut down on time and expenses needed to approve new cancer treatments.

The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 25 clinical trials involving nearly 12,000 rectal cancer patients. They found no statistical relationship between pCR and overall survival, meaning cancer drugs may be moving toward development without showing meaningful long-term improvements over existing treatments, said first author Kavin Sugumar, chief resident of general surgery at Tulane University School of Medicine.

This is about patient outcomes, but it's also about how we evaluate whether a new drug works. The FDA has approved pCR as a substitute for a result that would normally take years to determine, but we found that pCR should not be used as a sole endpoint to determine if a cancer treatment has been effective."

Kavin Sugumar, chief resident of general surgery, Tulane University School of Medicine

PCR remains vital for effectively determining if cancer has been cleared locally from tissue, and patients whose tumors disappear often fare better than those who don't.

Still, the metric may fail to capture the full picture, such as whether the patient has lingering toxicity from chemotherapy or undetected cancer cells elsewhere in the body.

The use of pCR as a gold standard for drug approval may also increase costs for drug companies which may invest in approved therapies that cannot guarantee improved survival rates.

"Overall survival is a costly and time-consuming endpoint to determine, and I don't think we've found the ideal surrogate yet," Sugumar said. "Instead of relying solely on pCR, we should maybe include a combination of surrogate endpoints that also includes pCR."

In a study conducted in Uganda and published in JAMA Surgery, researchers from Karolinska Institutet evaluated a new surgical method for treating groin hernias in women. The method could become an alternative in resource-limited settings where laparoscopic techniques are not generally available.

Groin hernia repair is the most common general surgical procedure in the world. Groin hernias are more common in men, but women are more likely to experience complications due to this condition.
Many women in low- and middle-income countries who need surgery for groin hernias lack access to laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). To evaluate a new method using open surgery, the researchers conducted a randomised clinical trial at two publicly funded hospitals in Uganda. The study included 200 women who underwent groin hernia surgery and were followed up after two weeks and after one year.

There are two main types of groin hernias, called inguinal and femoral hernias. The evaluation showed that the new surgical method was effective for both femoral and inguinal groin hernias.

Its effectiveness for both types is particularly important as the study also showed that nearly 45 percent of the women had femoral hernias, which carry a higher risk of complications.

The fact that so many of the women had femoral hernias was unexpected and highlights the need to develop effective, safe and accessible methods."

Alphonsus Matovu, PhD, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet and first author of the article

The results are promising as the new method could be developed into a viable alternative where access to advanced laparoscopic surgery is limited.

"Women with groin hernias can suffer serious and even fatal complications and therefore need access to effective surgical methods," says Jenny Löfgren, docent at the same department and last author of the article. "The new method could become a valuable tool to improve care for millions of women".

The method needs further evaluation, and the researchers will also follow up with the study participants five years after surgery to ensure long-term results. To improve treatment, the new method will also be compared with other surgical methods, both open and laparoscopic.

The Swedish Research Council funded the study.

Despite an overall decline in prescribed opioid use in Canada over the past decade, a recent study found that people in poorer areas receive three times the prescriptions for opioids than those in wealthier areas.

Researchers from the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo analyzed prescription records in seven provinces' public drug plans from 2010 to 2018, the most recent data available. British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba shared comprehensive data across all age groups, and Alberta, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island provided data for individuals aged 65 and older. Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia do not submit data to the federal entity that collects these records. The research team cross-referenced prescription patterns with census data on household income and sex to support their analysis.

Canada remains the world's second-highest consumer of opioids. In 2024 alone, opioid-related harms averaged 67 emergency room visits, 99 emergency responses, 15 hospitalizations and 20 deaths per day, according to a report from the Government of Canada.

Despite the perceived success in the reduction of opioid prescribing, inequalities persist. Our findings confirm that among lower socio-economic areas, women overall receive more opioid prescriptions. Among men, those with lower incomes received more prescriptions than their counterparts in the higher income brackets."

Dr. Wasem Alsabbagh, professor in Waterloo's School of Pharmacy

The researchers say the gap in opioid use between communities raises important concerns, and the problem affects everyone. They hope the findings will inspire health-care providers to take additional steps towards mitigating the risks of opioid misuse and support more equitable care.

"Pharmacists are an essential part of the primary care team," Alsabbagh said. "They can provide guidance to prescribers on individual prescriptions, appropriate dosages for each patient, inform policy decisions to address inequities and connect patients to support services, if necessary."

Future research will expand on gathering more data from the private health-care sector to add to this research on prescribing patterns.

Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is characterized by a poor prognosis and rising mortality. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a chimeric protein, plays a multifaceted role in driving the progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). While its interaction with tumor microenvironment cells is well-documented, the specific mechanisms by which Gal-3 mediates tumor-stromal interactions and promotes metabolic reprogramming linked to drug resistance remain unclear.

This research, published in the Genes & Diseases journal by a team from Capital Medical University, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Shandong First Medical University, and Cardiff University School of Medicine elucidates whether the inhibition of Gal-3 expression in tumor or stromal cells can improve the efficacy of gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapeutic agent for PAAD.

Analysis of multiple RNA sequencing public datasets revealed that Gal-3 is not only remarkably up-regulated in tumors but also significantly associated with the tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) in PAAD patients. Notably, high Gal-3 expression correlated strongly with poor patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer. Using a co-culture model of PAAD cells and pancreatic stellate cells, the researchers demonstrated that Gal-3 mediated the Ca2+/−calcineurin-NFAT pathway to increase the transcription of C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) and basigin (BSG) in TAFs.

Interestingly, the Gal-3-mediated signaling cascade was shown to suppress oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells. Elevated CCL2, secreted by Gal-3-activated TAFs, inhibited NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) activity, reducing ROS levels, mitochondrial ATP production, and oxygen consumption. Additionally, Gal-3 induced the expression of CCL2 and BSG via calcium-dependent calcineurin (CALN) dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFAT1), promoting their transcription in TAFs.

Further investigations revealed that Gal-3 enhances gemcitabine resistance via two mechanisms, CCL2-CCR2 signaling and the BSG-FAK-ERK pathway. Inhibition of these pathways reversed drug resistance and reduced tumor sphere formation. In orthotopic pancreatic xenograft models, co-treatment with modified citrus pectin (MCP)—a natural Gal-3 inhibitor—and AC-73, in combination with gemcitabine, significantly reduced tumor growth without adverse effects. These findings suggest that Gal-3 inhibition in vivo can effectively potentiate the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine.

In summary, this study demonstrates that by inhibiting Gal-3 in combination with gemcitabine in the tumor microenvironment represents a valuable innovation in the pharmacological treatment of pancreatic cancer. Overall, given its food-derived origin and safety profile, MCP presents a promising avenue for further development as an adjunctive therapy in pancreatic cancer.

Aspergillus is a fungus that is commonly found in the environment, both indoors and outdoors. This fungus species can cause aspergillosis-a respiratory infection affecting the lungs. A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, and A. niger are some of the common species within the Aspergillus genus that cause aspergillosis. In high-risk populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, aspergillosis can be life-threatening and lead to poor patient outcomes.

Previous research studies have identified A. latus as an allodiploid hybrid species containing gene sequences from two distinct species: A. spinulosporus and an unknown species related to A. quadrilineatus. Owing to its allodiploid hybrid nature, A. latus has been associated with both colonization and clinical disease, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and some strains have shown reduced susceptibility to antifungal agents. Recent reports indicate that certain European and American aspergillosis cases could be attributed to A. latus. However, to date, A. latus strains have not been identified in clinical samples of patients in Japan.

To identify and characterize A. latus strains from clinical isolates and address the concerns around cryptic species of Aspergillus that lack definite and observable morphological characteristics, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Hiroki Takahashi from the Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, Japan, has conducted a new study. The research team comprised Dr. Saho Shibata, Dr. Momotaka Uchida, and Dr. Takashi Yaguchi from the Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, along with Dr. Vit Hubka from the Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic. Their findings were published in Volume 63, Issue 6 of Medical Mycology on June 10, 2025.

"The complexity of fungal pathogens and their resistance mechanisms presents both a fascinating scientific challenge and an important public health issue, which I am eager to explore," says Dr. Takahashi, explaining the motivation behind the present study. Initially, the researchers analyzed 23 A. spinulosporus strains, which were collected between 2012 and 2023.

To accurately identify A. latus strains among the samples, the team utilized comprehensive phenotyping and genome sequencing analysis. The team identified seven A. latus strains among the 23 samples, which are clinically significant given that A. latus strains were not previously reported in Japan. Furthermore, through phylogenetic analyses, they observed that while one copy of the calmodulin gene aligned with the genetic sequence of A. spinulosporus, the other copy clustered with A. sublatus.

Inspired by their findings, the researchers went a step further and conducted antifungal susceptibility testing of different Aspergillus strains to antifungal medications. Japanese strains of A. latus showed reduced susceptibility to caspofungin and amphotericin B drugs. Also, genomic analysis revealed multiple amino acid insertions and deletions in one of the two alleles of the fks1 gene, which encodes a key component of the fungal cell wall biosynthesis machinery. This fks1 gene is associated with resistance to echinocandin-class antifungal drugs. The researchers suggest that if overlapping nucleotide signals are observed during gene sequencing-such as double peaks indicating the presence of two distinct alleles-then the possibility of hybrid species like A. latus should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation.

Highlighting the potential applications of the present study, Dr. Takahashi states, "By incorporating molecular phylogenetic and genomic analyses into diagnostic systems, our research is expected to improve the accuracy of fungal infection diagnoses and enable the selection of the most appropriate antifungal treatments for individual patients."

Taken together, this study provides significant observations regarding the clinical relevance, prevalence, and potential role of A. latus as a disease-causing agent. Improved and reliable molecular diagnostic tools are vital for the accurate identification of A. latus strains and the subsequent management of aspergillosis.

Excessive alcohol consumption causes alcoholic liver disease, and about 20% of these cases progress to alcohol-associated steatohepatitis (ASH), which can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure. Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore extremely important. A KAIST research team has identified a new molecular mechanism in which alcohol-damaged liver cells increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death and inflammatory responses. In addition, they discovered that Kupffer cells, immune cells residing in the liver, act as a "dual-function regulator" that can either promote or suppress inflammation through interactions with liver cells.

KAIST (President Kwang-Hyung Lee) announced on the 17th that a research team led by Professor Won-Il Jeong from the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, in collaboration with Professor Won Kim's team at Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, has uncovered the molecular pathway of liver damage and inflammation caused by alcohol consumption. This finding offers new clues for the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).

Professor Won-Il Jeong's research team found that during chronic alcohol intake, expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 increases, leading to glutamate accumulation in hepatocytes. Subsequent binge drinking causes rapid changes in intracellular calcium levels, which then triggers glutamate* secretion. The secreted glutamate stimulates the glutamate receptor mGluR5 on liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), which induces ROS production and activates a pathological pathway resulting in hepatocyte death and inflammation.

A particularly groundbreaking aspect of this study is that damaged hepatocytes and Kupffer cells can form a "pseudosynapse"—a structure similar to a synapse which is previously thought to occur only in the brain—enabling them to exchange signals. This is the first time such a phenomenon has been identified in the liver.

This pseudosynapse forms when hepatocytes expand (ballooning) due to alcohol, becoming physically attached to Kupffer cells. Simply put, the damaged hepatocytes don't just die—they send distress signals to nearby immune cells, prompting a response.

This discovery proposes a new paradigm: even in peripheral organs, direct structural contact between cells can allow signal transmission. It also shows that damaged hepatocytes can actively stimulate macrophages and induce regeneration through cell death, revealing the liver's "autonomous recovery function."

The team also confirmed in animal models that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of VGLUT3, mGluR5, or the ROS-producing enzyme NOX2 reduces alcohol-induced liver damage. They also confirmed that the same mechanism observed in animal models was present in human patients with ALD by analyzing blood and liver tissue samples.

These findings may serve as new molecular targets for early diagnosis and treatment of ASH in the future."

This study was jointly led by Dr. Keungmo Yang (now at Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital) and Kyurae Kim, doctoral candidate at KAIST, who served as co-first authors. It was conducted in collaboration with Professor Won Kim's team at Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center and was published in the journal Nature Communications on July 1.

A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on July 9, 2025, titled "A novel anti-human CD25 mAb with preferential reactivity to activated T regulatory cells depletes them from the tumor microenvironment."

In this study, researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, led by first author Maja Buszko and corresponding author Ethan M. Shevach, discovered a new monoclonal antibody that selectively targets a subset of immune cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs). These cells, while normally important for preventing autoimmunity, also can block the body's ability to fight cancer by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. This discovery could lead to novel cancer therapies that strengthen the immune system's capacity to attack tumors.

The researchers identified an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody with several atypical properties and named it 2B010. To evaluate its effects, they used humanized mice, laboratory mice that are engineered to carry human immune cells, to closely mimic how human immune systems respond to cancer. The treatment of these mouse models with 2B010 significantly decreased the number of Tregs in tumors and boosted the activity of CD8+ T cells, which are essential for killing cancer cells. Importantly, 2B010 worked without disrupting other key immune functions. Unlike traditional Anti-CD25 antibodies, it did not interfere with interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, which is essential for the growth and activity of effector T cells that fight cancer. 

"2B010 also had no effect on IL-2 induced STAT5 phosphorylation or CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro while both were blocked by Clone D1 further supporting the view that 2B010 does not recognize the IL-2 binding site."

This finding is especially significant because high levels of Tregs in tumors are associated with poor outcomes in many cancers. By specifically removing these cells, 2B010 may help overcome one of the main barriers to current immunotherapy approaches. Its ability to preserve IL-2 signaling could also make it safer and more effective when used alone or in combination with existing therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.

While the 2B010 antibody showed strong effects in reducing Tregs and boosting immune cell activity, the study did not observe changes in tumor size in these models. Researchers suggest this may be due to limitations in the preclinical systems used, such as the lack of tumor-specific T cells in humanized mice. Nevertheless, these findings demonstrate that 2B010 has a unique mechanism of action that could complement other cancer immunotherapies in future clinical trials.

In conclusion, the development of 2B010 is a promising step toward selectively disrupting the immune suppressive environment in tumors. As researchers continue to refine and test this antibody, it could become a powerful tool for enhancing the effectiveness of cancer treatments and improving outcomes for patients.

Food insecurity is not only linked with, but directly causes symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to research published in the open access journal PLOS Mental Health. Melissa Bateson of Newcastle University, UK, and colleagues at École Normale Supérieure, Northumbria University and York University, collected monthly data from adults in the UK and France and found that changes in food insecurity one month resulted in changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression the next. The authors therefore propose that interventions to reduce food insecurity would have immediate positive impacts on mental health.

Social determinants play a role in the development of poor mental health, and food insecurity has been associated with increased anxiety and depression, though it has been unclear whether this effect is causal and the timescale over which it occurs. The authors collected monthly data between September 2022 and August 2023 from almost 500 adults in the UK and France. They assessed food insecurity for the previous week and measured anxiety and depression with two commonly used questionnaires - GAD-7 and PHQ-8.

The team found a surprisingly high prevalence of food insecurity, with 39.5% of participants experiencing it in at least one month of the study. For those individuals, fluctuations between food insecurity and security were associated with changes in anxiety and depression, with deteriorations in mental health occurring when they experienced food insecurity and improvements when food security improved. The authors were able to predict mental health variations based on food security changes during the previous month. Such rapid changes in mental health suggest that the effects are related to food security rather than longer-term nutritional changes which would take longer to manifest in mood alterations.

The authors conclude that food insecurity causes rapidly emerging negative effects on mental health, and interventions to prevent food insecurity are likely to quickly and effectively reduce prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in populations currently experiencing periodic food insecurity. 

The authors note: "What really impressed us was how rapidly symptoms of anxiety and depression responded to changes in participants' food insecurity status and the large size of the effects".

The authors add: "Our results suggest that eliminating periodic food insecurity in those currently experiencing it could reduce the number of people with clinically concerning symptoms of anxiety and depression by 20 percentage points."

Winning the Gatorade Player of the Year award can be a significant step in the path of many young athletes.

Players like Jayson Tatum, Cooper Flagg, Juju Watkins and Cameron Boozer are among the recent notable winners.

Looking to stamp her name next is women's soccer player Addison Halpern, who is one of the recipients for 2024-25 having logged 44 goals and 14 assists this past season despite missing the first six games due to representing the U.S. women's national team at the FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup.

Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are

Halpern, who played for Rutgers Prep in Rochester, N.J., finished her high school career with 180 goals -- second in state history -- and 68 assists as she prepares for college. Halpern is still trying to wrap her head around the achievement.

"It's hard to even think about it, and it's good to always take a step back and realize, like, what you're actually accomplishing," Halpern told NBCUniversal Local. "And I think we often look over that, and I've recently had some time to reflect on it. And it's just, it's insane to even think about that. To even get the state one was an honor, and then I couldn't even think that wasn't even on my radar to get the national one.”

Where will Halpern take her game next? She's set to be a Cavalier at the University of Virginia, where she's maintaining high aspirations.

“The goal is national championship at Virginia, obviously,” Halpern said. “But just taking it one game at a time and just making sure I'm developing while I'm there and and just having a good time and enjoying it while I can.”

As part of winning the award, Gatorade invited Halpern and family to Los Angeles for a week-long experience leading up the ESPYs. Lisa Leslie, Karl-Anthony Towns and April Ross were among some of the stars in attendance. 

The list also included USWNT legend Abby Wambach, a Gatorade state winner who sat with Halpern and praised the New Jersey native for her goalscoring traits and achievements.

If there's anyone who knows about scoring goals at high rates, it's Wambach. The 5-foot-11 forward scored 184 goals in 255 caps, currently the second most of all time in women's international soccer. As young forwards like Halpern and more seek to grow their game, Wambach offered deep insight beyond just the tactical aspect of the sport.

"I think there's a thing that I've been thinking a lot about recently," Wambach started. "My daughter also plays, and she she scores goals, too. One of the things that I think is happening a lot in the younger generation is it's like this dual perspective. Meaning, oftentimes, some of the kids are worrying too much about what it looks like rather than the actual reality of the goal and the matter of the fact that as forwards, our job is to score goals. And vulnerability is a difficult thing for a Gen Z, Gen Alpha age person. You know, they 'LOL' everything. Like, so that's so funny. Right? And I think that there's a desire to not be as vulnerable. And in order to score goals at the highest level at a consistent rate, you have to literally open yourself up to the most kinds of vulnerability there is.

"So, putting yourself out there and, like, planting a flag in the ground every single time you enter the field, that says I care more than everybody else. Because the way that that motivates you to run around, the way that that motivates you to lead your team, the way that that motivates you to score the goals, just based on saying it out loud, like, that's what competition is, and it's not necessarily against anybody else.

"It's like you wanna go out there and score. And if you don't score, then you've had a bad day. And the end of the game, at the end of the season, at the end of practice, that is the thing that I want these players to remember. That it's like, the more you can open yourself up to utter annihilation, to me, the more goals you're gonna score."



Young players have also been at the focal point of the USWNT with the arrival of head coach Emma Hayes. Hayes built a dominant team in England with Chelsea, and has brought over her expertise and success overseas. 

Wambach offered insight as to how Hayes is building her ideal World Cup team and beyond with a blend of ready-now youth and accomplished veterans.

"Every cycle leading into the World Cup, you've got then the Olympics the following summer, the coaching staff has to really get their core group of players together," Wambach started. "And right now, in the last couple of months, since the Olympics, Emma has had an opportunity to see younger players who potentially could be a part of that core team. So some of the veteran players, you know, we've got players out, pregnancy leave, and some injuries, the 'Triple Espresso' [Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson], specifically. It's a unique opportunity for some of these other players to step in to grow themselves in the highest level of environment, of competition and difficulty.

"So to me, Emma...she's sitting pretty. Right? Like, she came in, she had no expectations in the Olympics. They win gold. Incredible. Now the expectations get reset, and they're quite high. Right? And I think that they will always be high. That's the nature of the position of the national team head coach. And I'm just excited to see what happens because a lot can happen over the next 24 months leading into the women's World Cup in '27."

Wambach also pointed out that there could be more players in both the NWSL and foreign leagues who are currently not in the picture that eventually breakthrough in time for the quadrennial tournament in Brazil.

Not only is the USWNT different now compared to when Wambach retired in 2015, the sport itself has undergone significant changes since the Rochester, N.Y., native hung up the cleats. So much so that Wambach is uncertain how she would have fit in her prime.

"It feels like the game is a totally different game," Wambach said. "It feels like they used to just bang the ball up to me, and I would head it to Alex [Morgan]. And then she would run really fast and then bring it back in the middle, and I would score. Like, that was our game plan, it feels like. And, of course, we we were much more sophisticated, but we definitely played more direct. 

"And nowadays, it's definitely more of a tactical, and a technical exploration, you know, going in and out of different formations depending on who's on the field and what their strengths are. And so it's a lot more fun in some ways to watch, and sometimes I think we get a little too cute with it. I really want more goals, I like to score more goals. That just will always be the case for me. But...I don't know if I would even make the team nowadays."

Real Madrid were entirely outplayed in their Club World Cup semi with PSG. This poses more questions than answers over their 25/26 La Liga prospects.

Despite Barcelona's financial issues, there's a sense of stability in Hansi Flick's squad now. They are our pre-season value pick for the 25/26 title.

Xabi Alonso has learnt a lot about his Real Madrid players after taking charge of the team for the 2025 Club World Cup. Despite being one of the pre-tournament favourites, Real were eventually dumped out in the semi-finals in comprehensive fashion by Paris Saint-Germain.

Their 4-0 loss exposed Real's defensive frailties. Several former Real stars have backed Alonso to solve these issues. The media have often focused on the lack of defensive work from Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr, whose minimal pressing is said to leave Real's midfield and backline exposed.

In his post-match press conference, Alonso admitted he picked too many attack-minded players in their 4-0 thrashing by PSG. Finding the right balance in his forward line will be vital to alleviating the pressure on Real's midfield and defence.

There are serious question marks over Kylian Mbappe's role in an Alonso side. He had the fewest touches of any outfield player against PSG and once again demonstrated an inability to press and track back.

Whether Mbappe can be coached into a pressing forward remains to be seen. By contrast, Ousmane Dembele's relentless pressing caused Real all kinds of problems, and the Frenchman capped his performance with a well-deserved goal. 

Alonso is also in desperate need of a dependable left-back. Ferland Mendy continues to struggle with injuries, and Fran Garcia was left red-faced on several occasions by PSG's Desire Doue in their Club World Cup semi.

With so many unresolved issues, it's hard to see why Real are currently priced as odds-on favourites to win the 2025/26 La Liga.

Real's bitter rivals, Barcelona, have had the luxury of sitting and watching Alonso's men struggle under the American sun. Hansi Flick's 2024/25 La Liga champions missed out on a place at this summer's Club World Cup. This could actually be quite beneficial to them in the long run.

Barca will surely start the new domestic campaign fresher and fitter than their title rivals. With plenty of question marks over Real at both ends of the pitch, Flick has only needed to make minor adjustments to his squad in the close season.

Although financial constraints continue to hamper the Catalan giants, they have still been able to strengthen their goalkeeping ranks. Joan Garcia has arrived from city rivals Espanyol.

There is also continued media speculation surrounding a move for Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who would offer serious competition to the likes of Raphinha and Dani Olmo.

The main question mark for Barca remains the Polish striker Robert Lewandowski. The veteran frontman has been an important figure since his move to the Nou Camp. However, with the Pole set to turn 37 next month, his goal output might begin to wane.

That's where Lamine Yamal comes in. The Barca starlet has shown remarkable maturity in the last 12 months and has taken his game to even greater heights. With an energetic forward line of Raphinha, Yamal and potentially Rashford supporting Lewandowski, Barca continue to be the team to beat.

When Donald Trump attended the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final on July 13, the president's attention-seeking behavior reached fever pitch when he made the trophy ceremony all about him. And from everything Donald has revealed about his son, Barron Trump, the president's cringe-worthy self-aggrandizing might have meant quite a bit to Barron, given his love for the sport.

When Chelsea Football Club defeated Paris Saint-Germain Football Club 3-0 in the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Donald was on hand to present the trophy (or at least a replica, as he reportedly kept the real trophy for himself). Then, he proceeded to just stand around with the Chelsea players and bask in the cheering, as if it was meant for him. According to an X post from The Athletic, standout star Cole Palmer said he was baffled by the situation. "I knew he was going to be there," Palmer shared, "but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand where we lifted the trophy."

Palmer later told the Daily Mail that he spoke with Donald face-to-face when the president awarded him with the coveted Golden Ball Award for being the best player in the tournament. "When he gave me the award, he said his son is my biggest fan," Palmer recalled. While this may be true, and Barron hasn't shared his thoughts publicly, the New York University student has been spotted showing his love for Chelsea's rivals, Arsenal F.C., in the past.



Back in 2017, Barron Trump was spotted playing on the White House lawn rocking an Arsenal Football Club jersey. It was one of several times Barron was seen rocking the club's gear. The following year, Donald Trump spoke with Piers Morgan and said, "I have a son who does love this sport," while also confirming that his son is a big Arsenal supporter. Perhaps Cole Palmer's impressive talents with Chelsea have won Barron over and made him a superfan. Or perhaps Donald simply has no idea who Barron roots for and was simply trying to be nice.

What is known, for sure, is that Donald — not Chelsea F.C. — wound up taking home the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. The trophy Chelsea F.C. hoisted into the air was an impressive replica, and the real trophy is actually in the White House, The Daily Beast reports. The Tiffany & Co-created award was reportedly made from 24-karat gold and is valued at approximately $230,000.

"[FIFA] said, 'Could you hold this trophy for a little while?'" Donald told DAZN (via The Daily Beast) during the final. "We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' And [FIFA President Gianni Infantino] said, 'We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office.'"

Claim:

Video authentically shows FIFA President Gianni Infantino criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for taking the FIFA Club World Cup trophy.

Rating:

On July 16, 2025, a viral video claimed to show FIFA President Gianni Infantino criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for taking the Club World Cup trophy for himself. In the summer of 2025, the United States hosted the FIFA Club World Cup, with Trump attending the final match in New Jersey on July 13. 

The video of Infantino spread after Trump presented the winner's trophy to Chelsea Football Club. However, instead of stepping aside for the customary trophy lift, Trump stayed onstage during the team's victory photos, resulting in criticism and even some of the football players expressing confusion. 

Per the TikTok post, Infantino allegedly said: 

This robber stole the glory that belonged to us. I really don't understand what this trophy has to do with the president of the United States. This was the most ridiculous day of my life and it happened right there on the Club World Cup podium. After every Club World Cup ends, the trophy always goes back to headquarters, quietly displayed in that building Zurich, Switzerland, to be admired by the whole world. That's the custom, the rule, the respect for football history. But this time, everything was broken. 

Trump stood in the center of the podium, with all the cameras pointed at him and the players were forced to squeeze to the side. I tried to push him aside, but it was useless. I brought the trophy to the White House, wanting to do a diplomatic display, and [he] even said to me, "This trophy is beautiful. It would look great in my office."

Our rules are crystal clear. The original is for display only and teams can only take home a replica. And just like that, the most absurd trophy swap in football history was born. 

There is no credible evidence Infantino made the above statement.  Apart from a few seconds at the very beginning of the video, the FIFA president isn't seen actually speaking, and in those few seconds, the audio, likely AI-generated, doesn't match the movement of Infantino's lips. As such, we rate this video as fake. 

We searched for specific sections from the above purported statement and found no authentic news sources verifying that Infantino ever criticized Trump using those words. Had Infantino actually made the above statements, it would have been headline news and would have likely gotten a public response from Trump.

On the contrary, Infantino and Trump appeared to be on good terms. Infantino even brought the FIFA trophy to the White House in March. A March 2025 Instagram post on Infantino's official page stated:

Today, the White House, under the leadership of the President of the 🇺🇸 United States, Donald Trump, and Vice President JD Vance set up a task force for the FIFA World Cup 2026. [...] 

I am confident that FIFA, together with the White House, is going to ensure that these events will be celebrations of our beautiful sport unlike anything else the world has ever seen before. 

Trump said in a July 13 interview: "[FIFA] said, 'Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [Infantino] says, 'We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one.' And they actually made a new one, so that was quite exciting [...] Right now it's in the Oval Office."

Per Getty Images, June 18 and June 27 photographs showed the trophy on display in the White House.

We previously reported on Trump's statement about FIFA giving him the original trophy. Snopes reached out to both the White House and FIFA to learn more about the current whereabouts of the trophy but has yet to receive a response. 

We also covered the false rumor that the FIFA Club World Cup winners Chelsea deliberately edited Trump out of their celebratory photos, when in fact they had chosen to publish images from when Trump moved to the back of the stage.

For a long time, my expectations of Donald Trump have been that he will be worse than I think, just never in the way that I think. Say what you will about the man, he is full of surprises. I assumed he'd make the country dumber, but I didn't think he'd succeed at nixing the entire Department of Education. I figured he'd do his best to destroy the federal government, but DOGE really came out of left field. (Or should that be the far right field?) And of course I knew he'd raise tariffs, but I had

Christian Pulisic took home the Best Soccer Player award at the 2025 ESPYS, beating out a Barcelona trio of Lamine Yamal, Aitana Bonmatí and Alexia Putellas.

Pulisic put together a career-best campaign for AC Milan last season, recording 17 goals and 10 assists in 50 appearances. The U.S. men's national team star helped the Rossoneri win their first Italian Super Cup since 2016, scoring a goal in his side's improbable 3–2 comeback victory against Inter Milan.

The 26-year-old is in talks to extend his contract with the Italian outfit, all while fending off lucrative offers from the Saudi Pro League. Despite Pulisic's stellar campaign, AC Milan only managed an eighth-place finish in Serie A, ruling them out of European soccer in next season.

Still, the 2025 ESPYS, an annual awards ceremony produced by ESPN, recognized Pulisic's individual accomplishments and honored him as the Best Soccer Player award-winner. Voting was open to the general public, and it is clear Pulisic's strong fanbase across the United States played a large role in securing him the honor.

Pulisic was up against 18-year-old Yamal, one of the favorites for the 2025 Ballon d'Or. The winger helped Barcelona claim a domestic treble in Hansi Flick's first season in charge, tallying 18 goals and 21 assists across all competitions.

Aitana Bonmatí, the reigning 2024 Women's Ballon d'Or winner, and her Barcelona teammate Alexia Putellas were also nominated for the award. The two superstars led the Catalans to yet another Liga F title, as well as the the club's fifth Spanish Super Cup and 11th Copa de la Reina trophy.

Pulisic, though, beat out the three Barcelona players to join an exclusive list of past and present legends to win the Best Soccer Player award at the ESPYS. Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi are the two most recent winners, while David Beckham, Ronaldinho and Mia Hamm have all claimed the honor as well.

The public backing Pulisic is a good sign for the USMNT captain after he received harsh criticism for skipping the 2025 Gold Cup to prioritize his recovery after a gruelling season. The Stars and Stripes finished as the runners-up in this summer's competition, losing out to Mexico in the Gold Cup final.

When Chelsea FC stunned Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's Club World Cup final, U.S. president Donald Trump managed to insert himself into the conversation.

As the Chelsea players were preparing to lift the trophy, Cole Palmer noticed that Trump was still on stage — right in the center — and urged captain Reece James to wait for Trump to exit. The U.S. president refused, which made for an awkward celebratory scene. Chelsea ultimately settled on a photo where Trump was obscured, but the questions about Trump's presence were unavoidable.

That awkwardness also played out in the medal ceremony, and Palmer was asked about that exchange as well.

In an interview with The Daily Mail, Palmer recalled that Trump told him that his son, presumably Barron, was his biggest fan.

To that, Palmer said, "'Thank you' ... or something."

The president sparked controversy for a few reasons at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup

 Ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup, President Donald Trump has sparked multiple controversies with soccer fans.


 The president was on hand at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey over the weekend to present the trophy to the winners of the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup. The 32-team tournament was ultimately won by Chelsea, who delivered a 3-0 rout of Paris Saint-Germain in the title game on Sunday, July 13.


 When Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were finished distributing championship medals to the winning team, Trump was left with one in his hand. Rather than hand it back, the president stashed it in the inside pocket of his suit jacket, drawing criticism from viewers.


 "My god Trump really pocketed one of the championship medals meant for the players smh," one X user wrote, while another quipped, "He's like a kid trying to blow out all the candles at another kid's birthday party, making it about himself, trying to take all the credit."


 The move came after the president claimed, in a mid-game interview, that he had the original Club World Cup trophy at the White House, and that FIFA had created a replica to present to Chelsea.


 “[FIFA] said, ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' and [Infantino] said, ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office.' ”


 The trophy in fact has been on display since it was delivered to Trump in March. It was next to the presidential desk as Trump was visited by the Italian football club Juventus last month, ahead of their Round of 16 knockout loss to Real Madrid.

 The FIFA Club World Cup trophy was also on display on May 30, when Trump and Elon Musk held an Oval Office press conference to mark the Tesla CEO's last day as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency — just before the two had their public falling out.

 Trump's controversial moves at the Club World Cup — and the fact that he was booed by what was nearly a hometown crowd — have some on edge as the U.S. prepares to co-host the main event, the 2026 FIFA World Cup, next year.


 In addition to tension among soccer fans, there is global concern about the Trump administration overseeing an international tournament at the same time they are implementing foreign travel bans and ramping up immigration raids.


 Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement last month, “FIFA should publicly acknowledge the threat U.S. immigration and other antihuman rights policies pose to the tournament's integrity and use its leverage with the U.S. government to ensure that the rights of all qualified teams, support staff, media, and fans are respected as they seek to enter the United States regardless of nationality, gender identity, religion, or opinion."


 While all three North American nations are sharing hosting duties for the upcoming FIFA World Cup tournament, it is certainly the U.S. of it all that has caused the most concern.


 The opening match of the World Cup is set to be played in downtown Los Angeles, where Trump recently deployed National Guard troops to shut down protests against his deportation policies.


 Additionally, Mexico is both a host nation and a contender to perform well in the tournament, yet Mexicans are one of the most-targeted nationalities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

 Earlier in July, 90 civil society groups signed an open letter urging FIFA to press Trump on his immigration and travel policies ahead of the massive sporting event.


 “We call on FIFA to use its influence to encourage the U.S. government to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of foreign visitors and fans who seek entry to the U.S. to attend the tournaments, and those of the constitutional rights of the many immigrants who already live, work, and contribute meaningfully to the cities selected to host them,” the letter read.

USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman talks to ESPN after confirming his switch from PSV to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. (1:59)

Last weekend, Bayer Leverkusen officially signed American attacking midfielder Malik Tillman. The 23-year-old enjoyed two robust seasons at PSV Eindhoven, scoring 24 goals with 15 assists in 68 appearances in all competitions. And he was stellar for the United States men's national team in the Gold Cup and friendlies over the summer, with three goals and three assists in eight appearances. A record signing for the German club, he will be an important member of a rebuilt Leverkusen attack.

Tillman also will have a prime opportunity to keep his national team stock high for the 2026 World Cup. He might be the front-runner to start in the central attacking midfield role in U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation, and a solid season for a Champions League club and recent Bundesliga champion will only reinforce that.

We tend to see a lot of jostling for position in World Cup years. While the U.S. has plenty of stalwarts and, if healthy, likely 2026 starters -- including left back Antonee Robinson, right back Sergiño Dest, midfielders Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie, and winger Christian Pulisic (recent drama aside) -- there are plenty of spots on the 26-player roster for next summer. And we could see quite a few players seeking changes in scenery this season with one of those spots in mind.

Here are seven national team members who are gearing up for prime U.S. lineup or roster spots in 2026 and could -- or maybe should -- change clubs in the coming weeks or months. What would be their best moves, if any?

Current team: Juventus

The 25-year-old Weah started all four games for the U.S. in the 2022 World Cup, scoring the opening goal in an eventual draw with Wales, and he has made three appearances since Pochettino took over in September.

Weah finds himself in a tricky position at Juventus: He battled a hamstring injury for a good chunk of the 2024-25 campaign and was in and out of the lineup, spending time at multiple positions.

He's also a bit of a tweener: He is a very good scorer and ball progressor for a fullback, and he's a good presser and defender as a winger; but he isn't a natural in either spot. Over the past two seasons with Juve, he has recorded 3,716 minutes in all competitions (ninth on the team), with seven goals (sixth), six assists (seventh) and 38 blocked passes (fifth) defensively. He is solid just about everywhere, but he's spectacular nowhere.

Since Igor Tudor took over as Juve manager on March 23, the right-footed Weah has started just three of 13 matches and made appearances mostly on the left side of the lineup in Tudor's 3-4-2-1 formation. Juve have shopped him around and agreed to a deal with Nottingham Forest, but Weah turned down Forest's contract offer. Now, he's in talks with Marseille.

Marseille would be an intriguing fit. Manager Roberto De Zerbi bounced between a 3-4-2-1 and 4-2-3-1 formation last season, and Weah's flexibility could make him an important player. His best position would almost certainly be as a right midfielder or wing back in a setup with a three-man defense, but since Pochettino is primarily a 4-2-3-1 man, this would split the difference nicely.

If Inter Milan were to send Denzel Dumfries to Manchester City or elsewhere, as rumored, Weah would be a nice replacement option, as his stats were extremely similar to Dumfries' this past season. But if that isn't on the table, Marseille would be a solid alternative.

Current team: Borussia Dortmund

The single most encouraging thing you can say about Reyna at the moment is that he's still only 22. If we ignore everything we know about his overall career trajectory and focus on the raw stats -- 5,762 minutes, 19 goals and 14 assists with Borussia Dortmund before his 23rd birthday -- there's still plenty of promise here.

An endless string of injuries, however, has limited his playing time and seemingly sapped a lot of his athleticism. He has played only 1,218 club minutes over the past two calendar years with only nine starts, and he has filled holes everywhere from left attacking midfielder to right back. His brilliant 2020-21 season -- 2,699 minutes in all competitions as a 17- and 18-year-old, seven goals (fourth on the team), six assists (fifth), 103 one-on-ones (second), 63 fouls suffered (second) -- is pretty far in the rearview mirror.

More than anyone else in the U.S. player pool, Reyna simply needs a set role and playing time. It's hard to imagine that coming with Borussia Dortmund. If he would consider MLS an option, which I doubt, he potentially could find a nice spot as a central attacking midfielder -- my own read on his best role -- with New York City FC (where 38-year old Maxi Morález is logging major minutes) or, perhaps, other 4-2-3-1 teams such as Houston (where he could team with Jack McGlynn) or Real Salt Lake (with Diego Luna). But the best fit could be in the Bundesliga, where Gerardo Seoane's Borussia Monchengladbach operates from a 4-2-3-1 and gives a lot of central attacking midfielder minutes to 32-year-old Alassane Pléa, whose contract expires in 2026 and who could move this summer.

If Reyna is healthy, it wouldn't be hard to envision him pairing well with the industrious Rocco Reitz in midfield. Really, though, the best fit is any team that will play him a lot. Hopefully he finds one.

Current team: AC Milan

One of the most important players during the USMNT's solid 2022 World Cup showing, Musah finds himself in a situation reasonably similar to that of Weah and Reyna: He's a man with skills and no defined position. Musah is a high-level dribbler and hard-working defender and like Weah, might be best tucked into the right midfield. But Musah has spent time in a lot of positions, including right winger. He isn't a right winger. His one-on-ones chart basically shows that he'll take on anyone, anywhere, and that he's a man without a set spot.

Like Reyna, Musah is still only 22 years old, and he's really good at what he's good at -- namely dribbling and drawing contact. New Milan manager Max Allegri could find him useful at right wing back or -- thanks to Tijjani Reijnders' departure -- in the second defensive midfield spot in a 3-5-2. If we're thinking about what might translate well to playing time in Pochettino's system, defensive midfielder experience would be useful.

Allegri has proved allergic to playing younger guys at times, and the thing I'll call the Transfer Industrial Complex has linked Musah to Forest and Napoli in recent weeks. We'll see. But staying in Milan might not be the worst thing in the world.

Current team: Real Salt Lake

Aside from maybe goalkeeper Matt Freese, no player improved his national team stock more than Luna this summer. The 21-year-old has eight goals and four assists midway through the MLS season after going for eight and 10, respectively, last season, and he made the most of Christian Pulisic's national team absence. In six Gold Cup matches, Luna finished first on the U.S. team in goals (three) and tied for second in shots on goal (five) and assists (two). Until he seemingly ran out of gas a bit against Mexico, he put in solid pressing work throughout the tournament, as well.

Summer tournament success almost always produces a run of transfer rumors, as it has for Luna. He has been linked to a few European teams. Who doesn't need a burly, hard-working and opportunistic attacker for your bench, at the very least? Most notably among them is LaLiga's Celta Vigo. As with Patrick Agyemang, Luna clearly doesn't have to leave MLS to get on Pochettino's radar. But Celta Vigo would be intriguing: They were the fifth-best attacking team in the league last season, and they are rebuilding their attack after the loss of forward Jørgen Strand Larsen and winger Fernando López to Wolves. Celta Vigo just added a nice string-puller in Club Brugge's Ferran Jutglà too.

That might be a good club to pursue. But even though Real Salt Lake kind of stink this season, Luna has a good thing going and doesn't need to leave just to get the national team manager's attention.

Current team: PSV Eindhoven

You have to take a piecemeal approach to building a statistical profile for Pepi. Over the past two seasons, he has produced brilliant scoring stats on a dominant team in an attacker-friendly league. He played 1,486 minutes in all competitions over two campaigns with PSV but only started in eight of his 62 appearances. Attacker stats are typically friendlier when you're making shorter substitute appearances.

We've definitely learned that Pepi can contribute great things in a great environment, as 22 goals and six assists in 16.5 90s (aka the equivalent of 16.5 full matches) is outstanding work in any environment; and it has to be accepted that anywhere outside of PSV, his scoring stats will drop. But at different stops, he has proved different things. Meanwhile, at FC Augsburg, in an extreme too much, too soon move (he had just turned 18), he scored zero goals in 583 minutes but pressed like crazy and created 1.1 chances per 90 minutes.

Stewart Robson believes the USMNT might struggle at next year's World Cup after their poor performance in the Gold Cup final.

The rumor mill has linked Pepi with a Fulham move, among others. But with Malik Tillman leaving PSV, Luuk de Jong out of contract and Pepi coming back from meniscus surgery, the best play for Pepi might be to work his way back to full strength in this forward-friendly environment. He could have a bigger role on a Champions League team, and if he has a good season, he'll enter free agency while playing a role on a World Cup team. There are worse situations than that.

Current team: Venezia

Busio has a lot of miles on his 23-year-old legs. He broke through with Sporting Kansas City at age 16, and between Sporting and Venezia, he already has recorded more than 12,000 minutes of action. Playing defensive midfield for Venezia in Serie A this past season, he contributed to just about every line in the stat sheet: He was second on the team in fouls suffered; third in touches, progressive carries, progressive passes, chances created and ball recoveries; fourth in goals and pass attempts; and fifth in defensive interventions. He is proving durable and physical despite a 5-foot-7, 143-pound frame.

All in all, Busio has the Tor-Kristian Karlsen seal of approval.

Venezia were relegated again in 2024-25, however, and now that he has proved himself at the Serie A level, a move is expected. Rumors link him to Udinese, and that's probably about right: He might not be ready for a top-level team yet, but he could be a strong role player for a midtable club. The U.S. is loaded with interesting options at defensive midfield, where Tyler Adams, new Atlético Madrid addition Johnny Cardoso and Lyon's Tanner Tessmann all lurk (and where Musah might get more club minutes). But as long as Busio stays on a top-division squad, he'll remain a solid option.

Current team: Orlando City

As far as prospects go, Freeman might be the most fascinating in the U.S. player pool. The 6-foot-2 son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman has enjoyed a breakout year at age 20. He debuted as an Orlando City starter and looked good enough to not only get a USMNT summer call-up, but also start every Gold Cup match at right back. He has contributed quite a bit to the Orlando attack with four goals and two assists from 31 chances created. But while he didn't do a lot of that with the national team, he still had a ton of touches and defensive interventions (third in both categories).

Granted, he also played the scorer onside for Mexico's winning goal in the Gold Cup final, and he was easily beaten in attack on a promising late scoring chance. His rawness is obvious. But he's absolutely tantalizing, as evidenced by his current scouting report chart at FBref.

The rumor mill hasn't yet blown his name around as much as Agyemang's or Luna's. There was talk of a Parma offer and things of that nature, but Freeman moving on after less than one full season as a professional starter might seem like a bit too much, too soon. Still, he came from out of nowhere and quickly advanced up the U.S. depth chart. He almost certainly is going to be at the center of many rumors this time next year.

Chelsea talisman Cole Palmer has revealed the message United States president Donald Trump shared with him after the conclusion of last Sunday's FIFA Club World Cup final. 

The Blues were significant underdogs for the final at MetLife Stadium but Palmer inspired them to a 3–0 victory over European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The 23-year-old scored twice and assisted João Pedro's third as Chelsea secured the title. 

However, the attacking midfielder was left bemused by Trump's presence during the Club World Cup trophy presentation in the U.S. As well presented Palmer with the trophy for being the tournament's best player, the 79-year-old was meant to hand Chelsea their prize before leaving the stage while they celebrated, but he remained on the podium instead. 

Speaking after the match, Palmer admitted: “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy. I was a bit confused, yes.”

He was not the only one who was taken off guard, with club captain Reece James confessing: “They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay.”

Palmer has now revealed exactly what Trump said to him during Chelsea's trophy celebrations and how he responded. 

“When he gave me the award, he said his son is my biggest fan.” Palmer told the Mail during a trip to St Kitts & Nevis. “I can't remember what I said. I think I said ‘Thank you' or something.”

Alongside his Chelsea teammates, Palmer has three weeks off before reporting back to pre-season training on the week beginning August 4. He will need to make good use of much-needed rest before 2025–26, as the Blues play their first Premier League game against Crystal Palace on August 17.

Canadian soccer fans eager to score a ticket to one of the 13 FIFA World Cup games in Toronto or Vancouver next summer can now purchase hospitality packages.

But the premium tickets for the group stage and round of 32 matches, which start at $2,500 and increase significantly depending on the level of service selected, won't get you in to see Canada's Men's National Team on the pitch at Toronto's BMO Field or BC Place in Vancouver.

According to FIFA and On Location, its official hospitality partner, host nation games “are not available as a single-match offerings” for the special tickets.

The Canadian side plays its first game at BMO on June 12 — the first-ever men's World Cup on Canadian soil — and rounds out its group stage play with matches on June 18 and 24 in Vancouver. Opponents won't be determined until later this year.

Here's what you need to know about ticket prices less than a year before the event kicks off.

To secure admission to one of the nine games not featuring Team Canada and for which the teams are yet to be determined, it will depend on when and where you want to watch.

After the Team Canada opener on June 12, Toronto will host five more matches — four group stage and one round of 32. Hospitality package tickets for group stage games on June 17 and 20 start at $2,500, contests on June 23 and 26 start at $2,600 and the round of 32 match on July 2 starts at $2,800.

“That's steep. That is very steep. But I don't have much control over it,” Toronto mayor Olivia Chow said this week, per City News.

Vancouver's first game, on June 13, starts at $2,950 but drops to $2,575 for those on June 21 and 26. A round of 32 game on July 2, meanwhile, begins at $3,215.

Those prices allow ticketholders access to the FIFA pavilion, a private area offering food and drinks separate from other attendees. There are four other hospitality levels to choose from, each offering a slightly higher level of exclusivity — the champions club, the trophy lounge, VIP and the top tier pitchside lounge.

“An exclusive experience that blends luxurious comfort with the electrifying energy of the world's greatest sporting event,” according to FIFA and On Location.

Selecting the “pitchside lounge standard plus” option for the June 17 game in Toronto, for example, jacks the single ticket price to $5,750. As of right now, Vancouver tops out at the “VIP standard plus” level, which will run you $6,450 for the round of 32 match.

All of the packages include all you can eat and drink, including alcoholic beverages, and they get you inside three hours before kickoff and allow you stick around for up to two hours after the game ends.

While a strong third-place finish could earn 28th-ranked Canada a berth in the round of 32 in this year's expanded tournament, the side is guaranteed only three group stage games.

As of right now, tickets to those matches can only be secured by investing in the venue series, which grants the pass holder access to all the matches at either stadium, starting at $15,975 for Toronto and $19,860 in Vancouver.

Like the single-match offerings, that number can increase dramatically depending on the hospitality level above the FIFA pavilion.

A single venue series pass with access to the “pitchside lounge standard plus” for the six games in Toronto rings up for $37,700. In Vancouver, where the pass gets you into all seven games, it's $46,740.

Another option is to sign up for Canada Soccer's CanadaRED program, which offers registered members exclusive access to the organization's ticketing allotment for the national team's games. The higher your donation tier, the better your odds of scoring a chance to buy one of the tickets. Paying tiers range from $50 to $5,000 annually.

FIFA also announced this week that it would open applications for general tickets on Sept. 10. Tickets are going to be released in five phases to accommodate the high demand.

However, the governing body did not specify when the draw would take place, nor whether it would employ dynamic pricing, as was the case for the Club World Cup, which saw ticket prices fluctuate wildly.

FIFA encourages fans to register their interest so they can “use their FIFA ID to apply for their first chance to buy tickets” in September.

Ticket sales will continue from then until the final match in East Rutherford, N.J., on July 19, but FIFA has yet to offer details on the timing of future phases.

As for how much they might cost, general tickets for fans at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar ranged from $11 for Qataris attending a group stage game all the way to $2,210 for international fans watching the final, according to The Sporting News.

How much are Canada's World Cup games costing?

Toronto has ballparked its hosting cost at $380 million, $104 million of which was supplied by the federal government, with another $97 million coming from Doug Ford's provincial government, a deal that's still being negotiated.

A city staff report in late May revealed that “provincial service costs are still substantially higher than budgeted, and in some cases completely unbudgeted,” resulting in $39 million of the province's contribution already earmarked for provincial service costs like added Ontario Provincial Police security and hospital and paramedic surge capacity.

Ford, who initially said the city wouldn't get a penny more, has promised to work with Chow to come up with a solution.

“When I talked to the mayor and we were looking over the costs, the security is crazy,” he said last month, per CTV.

“She (Chow) needs more cash, which I understand. But we will review it, we will come up with a solution, and it will turn out well.”

The city is putting $123 million into BMO Field, increasing capacity to 45,000 with the addition of $17,000 temporary seats, along with other upgrades like four new LED videoboards and improved team facilities.

In Vancouver, the latest estimated gross core costs of planning, staging and hosting are between $532 million and $624 million.

Ottawa has committed $116 million and the high-end estimated cost for the province, by way of government and the B.C. Pavilion Crown Corporation (PavCo) is $279 million. The city's portion could total as much as $345 million when third-party entities providing public services are factored in.

PavCo is putting between $171 and $181 million in B.C. Place, which includes a new natural grass playing surface, a FIFA requirement.

President Donald Trump's ultimatum to Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine within 50 days or face bruising sanctions on its energy exports has given the Kremlin extra time to pursue its summer offensive.  The dogged Ukrainian resistance, however, makes it unlikely that the Russian military will make any quick gains.  President Vladimir Putin has declared repeatedly that any peace deal should see Ukraine withdraw from the four regions that Russia illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured.

U.S. president Donald Trump quite literally stook centre-stage following the final of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup on July 13.

Trump joined FIFA chief Gianni Infantino in the middle of the MetLife Stadium pitch as Chelsea were crowned world champions following their shock 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

He then decided to stand with the players as they lifted the trophy, despite Infantino's attempts to intervene and some bemused looks on the faces of Cole Palmer and Reece James. There was even a moment where it seemed Trump would try to lift the trophy alongside the Chelsea captain.

Whether he truly wanted to share in the Blues' moment of glory is not entirely clear, but Trump certainly seems to be a big fan of the Tiffany-designed trophy itself. Indeed, he claims he will be keeping it.

In an interview conducted with DAZN, the global Club World Cup broadcaster, Trump claimed Chelsea were given a replica of the expanded tournament's new trophy and that he would be keeping the real one in the White House.

It was unveiled at a special event in the Oval Office back in March, at which point it took pride of place on a plinth. Apparently, it will be staying there.

"I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] 'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one,'" Trump said. "And they actually made a new one. So, that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now."

This is not an entirely irregular thing to see. These days, national teams that win the FIFA World Cup do not keep the real trophy; rather, they are given a replica for things like celebratory tours, while the original returns to the FIFA World Football Museum in Zurich, Switzerland after the tournament ends.

However, allowing the head of state of the host nation to maintain possession of a trophy takes things to a different extreme. And it's not the only token Trump is said to have received.

During the trophy ceremony, Infantino was seen to hand a spare winners' medal to Trump after the Chelsea players and staff had been presented with theirs. Video footage shows the U.S. president folded up the ribbon and put the medal in his jacket pocket.

FIFA has not commented on whether a medal was intended to be a gift for Trump.

“My grandma grew up a few houses away from here,” said Adams, a Hudson Valley native. “So, I lived in her house for a part of my life, and that was the main part that I was coming down to camp here and walking down here for camp every single day.”

It's where Adams learned the beautiful game, and spent time with family and friends.

“Me and my friends, we used to come down here and play soccer, baseball, basketball, everything,” he said. “But coming to summer camp was one of my favorite memories growing up here.”

These days, the 26-year-old's schedule is filled with soccer, whether it's commanding the midfield for Bournemouth in the English Premier League (EPL), or serving as captain of the U.S. men's national team on the world stage.

“I know that I've had so many experiences that a lot of the young guys haven't had, so they lean on me for advice and experience,” Adams said. “I think being a leader is something that I've always been as a young kid.”

He has come a long way to becoming one of the top midfielders to wear an American shirt. It's all thanks to his loved ones back home, according to Adams, like his parents making those long drive to the New York Red Bulls Academy in New Jersey as a kid.

“Tough for my parents, probably. Not me. I was sleeping in the passenger seat next to them,” he said. “But again, it wouldn't be possible without my family. I'm so thankful for them for that commitment to my journey, to allow me to play at the highest level possible. I don't think I'd be where I am right now without [them].”

Adams' legacy and impact on his hometown was cemented this month, when the field he grew up playing on was renamed Tyler Adams Soccer Pitch. It was part of a partnership with Scotts lawn care company to resurface the field with new natural turfgrass.

“I hope many generations of kids are going to be able to come here and play and grow, not only as athletes like I was able to, but also become good people from the Town of Wappinger,” Adams said.

He said he doesn't have the opportunity to come back as often as he would like. So Adams is cherishing these moments as much as he can, before joining Bournemouth later this month in Chicago for the Premier League Summer Series tour of the U.S. with three other clubs. The World Cup follows in the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026.

“Right now, I'm enjoying having the off time,” Adams said. “So it's nice to just be able to decompress a little bit, spend time with your family, not have to worry about training every day. But yeah, it changes quickly. So soon we're gonna have to do training again and get ready for the new season.”

The Spain wonderkid needs to be wary of the pitfalls of global fame as he follows in the footsteps of a Blaugrana legend

After many months of anticipation, Lamine Yamal finally signed his new six-year contract at Barcelona on Wednesday. That agreement reportedly made the teenage winger the highest-paid player in Hansi Flick's squad on an annual salary of €30 million ($34 million), which is a reward for his incredible contribution to the team's domestic treble success in 2024-25.

But perhaps most importantly, Yamal was also bestowed with the No.10 jersey previously worn by Lionel Messi. That iconic shirt was vacated when Ansu Fati joined Monaco on loan earlier this summer, with the academy graduate ultimately unable to handle the weight of history that came with it.

It's very difficult to imagine Yamal experiencing the same problem, though. "I don't feel pressure; I'm at the best club in the world. Messi has made his way, I'm going to make mine, and the '10' comes from Ansu anyway. I'll try to make my own way," he told Barca's official media channels.

That fearlessness is what has set Yamal apart from his peers since his stunning breakthrough in the senior team. Walking the same path as Messi, and the likes of Ronaldinho, Romario and Diego Maradona before him, does not faze the Spain international. After all, he had already racked up 74 goal contributions for club and country en route to winning four major titles, including the European Championship, prior to turning 18 on July 13.

Yamal may even become the youngest Ballon d'Or winner ever later this year, having consistently delivered awe-inspiring performances in the biggest matches. The sky is the limit if he continues on his current trajectory. But to do that, Yamal will have to avoid the same trap Neymar fell into back when the Brazilian also had the world at his feet in Catalonia.

Onyx Equities is set to play a major role in next year's FIFA World Cup, announcing Wednesday that it has become the first official supporter for the New York New Jersey Host Committee.

The real estate firm, which is based in Newark, said it was making a multimillion-dollar commitment as part of a partnership that will make it a key player in the expansive promotion, programming and community initiatives tied to the iconic tournament and the eight matches that will be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, including the final on July 19, 2026. In the process, the company will showcase a series of properties that have been among New Jersey's most ambitious and successful development or repositioning projects in recent years.

They include the Gateway Center office complex in Newark, where Onyx joined the NYNJ Host Committee alongside New Jersey First Lady Tammy Murphy and other dignitaries to unveil the partnership.

“We are thrilled to support an event of this magnitude right here in New Jersey,” said John Saraceno, cofounder and managing principal of Onyx Equities. “Our support is not just about visibility — it's about creating opportunities for community engagement and driving economic growth that will benefit our region long after the final whistle.”



To that end, Onyx said it will support the legacy partnership between the NYNJ Host Committee and the U.S. Soccer Foundation to develop equitable and inclusive access to soccer in New York and New Jersey, with plans to donate a mini pitch in the region by 2026. It will also be integrated into the FIFA Fan Festival NYNJ, a sprawling event that will take place at Liberty State Park in Jersey City during the tournament's 39 days in June and July.

“The announcement of Onyx Equities' support today embodies the spirit of collaboration and community partnership that is essential for the success of the FIFA World Cup 2026,” said Alex Lasry, CEO of the NYNJ Host Committee. “The Host Committee is excited that our first supporter is a homegrown firm that understands the importance of championing our region as we prepare to welcome the world. Together, we are not only bringing a world-class event to the region but also creating a lasting legacy rooted in opportunity, inclusion and the unifying power of the world's most exciting game.”

Gateway, where Onyx has spearheaded a $60 million renovation and expansion of its retail and dining space, is the headquarters of the NYNJ Host Committee and has been named the exclusive urban office campus for the organization. It's among several properties and brands across the firm's portfolio that will be highlighted as part of the partnership, also including:



Saraceno highlighted those brands while praising Onyx's partners across its projects, including Russo Development, Axonic Capital and Machine Investment Group. He also teased what will likely be a series of events and programming initiatives in the coming weeks and months to make Gateway “the epicenter of the World Cup, at least in the state of New Jersey.”

“We are also excited that our properties, Gateway Center and The Junction, will be ready to serve as a hub for the games throughout the year,” said Jonathan Schultz, cofounder and managing principal of Onyx Equities. “We are not only proud to be involved in promoting the world's most watched sporting event, but also want to truly embrace the culture of the sport and international fans who are visiting New Jersey for the experience. It truly will be a Junction for the fans who are coming to our great region to experience the excitement of the games.”

The FIFA Fan Festival NYNJ will provide another touchpoint for Onyx's brands from June 11 to July 19, when it's expected to welcome tens of thousands of visitors per day as part of the tournament's most expansive and spectacular fan destination, according to a news release. That will include real-time match broadcasts, world-class live entertainment, interactive fan experiences and extensive sponsorship activations.

“It is completely appropriate that New Jersey's leading city would be the home of World Cup's first New Jersey corporate sponsor,” Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka said Wednesday. “With a cultural diversity that is unmatched in New Jersey so many of our residents have soccer in their blood and their energy will be celebrated throughout the World Cup.”



Joshua Burd, an award-winning reporter and editor, has been covering New Jersey commercial real estate for 13 years. Many industry leaders view him as the go-to real estate reporter in the state, a role he is eager to continue as the editor of Real Estate NJ. He is a lifelong New Jersey resident who has spent a decade covering the great Garden State.

Onyx Equities is set to play a major role in next year's FIFA World Cup, announcing Wednesday that it has become the first official supporter for the New York New Jersey Host Committee.

Even in this worldwide boom of inflation, some of this summer's transfer fees are truly difficult to contextualize at a glance.

In the week-plus following the U.S. men's national team's runner-up finish at the Concacaf Gold Cup, two members of Mauricio Pochettino's squad have switched European clubs at an eight-figure valuation. Malik Tillman and Johnny Cardoso have joined Bayer Leverkusen and Atlético Madrid, respectively, for fees combining over $75 million. Tack on Patrick Agyemang leaving Charlotte FC for Derby County this week on an $8 million fee — among the highest returns for a player selected in the MLS SuperDraft — and it's been an opulent summer for players aiming to be on the squad for the 2026 World Cup co-hosts.

The market wasn't always so warm to USMNT-eligible players. Even into the early 2010s, many Americans were either acquired at a bargain valuation or on free transfers after trial periods. In January 2007, Clint Dempsey broke MLS records when Fulham signed him from the New England Revolution for just $4 million. The program's joint-record scorer (tied with Landon Donovan on 57 goals) again made history in August 2012 when Tottenham brought him across town from Craven Cottage for $9.5 million.

Put another way, Dempsey — then a proven Premier League forward who helped Fulham reach a Europa League final — went for as much money as West Brom paid Orlando City for Daryl Dike three years ago. How the transfer market has changed.

Some of this was inevitable given the increased finances in soccer. To condense an entire seminar's worth of backstory, most of the sport's history saw ticket sales, prize money and sponsorship agreements serve as the chief driver of revenue for clubs. There was an urgent need to ensure staunch gate receipts, to design shirts that would fly off the shelves and to have a proud host of companies lining the pitch on ad boards. On top of this, success on the field was a self-fulfilling path to retain a strong squad as winnings could be reinvested in higher wages and transfer fee expenditure.

The 21st century has seen numerous innovations and advancements in how the sport's power brokers generate revenue, and with far greater returns than the previous paths could offer. It starts with viewers who weren't occupying seats at grounds. Broadcast rights have become league-altering bidding wars for the sport's top circuits, with the rise of streaming platforms only further increasing the options. Major leagues have become more accessible to a global audience, with fans able to foster stronger bonds from abroad with their teams possibly visiting on an occasional preseason tour.

None of this is under-reported, nor is it unique to soccer. It is, however, undeniably relevant to this surge in player valuations.

In the past, the world's highest-caliber of clubs dominated and operated at the richest bracket of the transfer market. In something of a trickle-down economy, they would pluck the top talents from their less wealthy rivals, who could then reinvest those sums in hopes of finding its next wave of stars. The fees weren't astronomical by today's standards: Barcelona bought Ronaldinho from PSG for just under $35 million in 2003 and Thierry Henry from Arsenal for $28 million in 2007, for example. A simple inflation calculator puts those price tags at in $61 million and $43.4 million, respectively, in today's money. These days, clubs like AFC Bournemouth and Leeds United spend over $20 million with increasing regularity.

All of which brings us back to Johnny, Tillman and the recent high sums for Americans abroad. Each of the dozen-plus highest fees for U.S. players have come in the past decade and involve players under 25, led by Christian Pulisic's $74.1 million move from Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea in January 2019. All fees in the table below have been directly reported over the years by The Athletic, with the exception of John Brooks' figure being on U.S. Soccer's official website.

There is compelling context for these moves beyond teams having more money to spend than they used to. Pulisic's breakout with Borussia Dortmund was a bellringer of the rising standard of young stateside talent. After over six years in FC Dallas' setup, Weston McKennie joined Schalke's academy in 2016 and debuted in the Bundesliga a year later. When Pulisic left for Chelsea, Dortmund already had its next American talent in the wings: Giovanni Reyna, who arrived from New York City FC's academy.

Youth movement doesn't garner nearly as significant fees as moves for senior players, but it isn't a surprise that McKennie was involved in a lucrative transfer following years of productivity in Germany. In a trend identified long before the Club World Cup, yet validated this summer, many of Europe's top teams operate more systematically, recruiting with data at the heart of the operation and coaches instructing players from positional play models that give strict responsibility guidance for each member of the squad. Roles have crystalized considerably; player recruitment more closely mirrors the corporate hiring process of a specialist position than it used to, and it's easier to project a tactical fit as a team's utilization of a player is easier to quantify.

This also helps erase longstanding stigmas tied to the nationality of the player. For every overpayment to obtain any young Brazilian playmaker with a bag of tricks, there were a dozen bargain bin signings from less sexy nations like those in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and North America (among other regions). Those biases have gradually been worn away with more clubs have sophisticated scouting operations, but having successes like Pulisic and McKennie only accelerates that process. Atléti wasn't assessing Johnny as “an American midfielder,” which used to mean he would bust his tail every game but struggled technically; it was signing a player who proved himself in La Liga after Betis vetted his readiness and signed him from Brazil.

The changing model of club ownership also plays a role. For generations, most owners were local stewards who saw their club as a local institution, even if it meant some lean years if revenue wasn't sustainable. Now, the sport is its own machine of profit-generation. Americans weren't previously dropping billions to helm Champions League contenders. Multi-club models were a twinkle in the Abu Dhabi royal family's collective eye, and loan deals were dependent on an outside entity wanted to temporarily house a player.

Advertisement

Agreements between clubs make those processes easier, meaning more players can be signed and stashed in case they develop to a first-team standard — or can be sold for a profit. Just like Chelsea has Caleb Wiley and Gabriel Slonina on its books now, it took a flier on a 21-year-old Matt Miazga in January 2016. Manchester City has taken chances on Erik Palmer-Brown and Zack Steffen. Bayern Munich has tried matching Dortmund's success in the American market to varying degrees of success via Tillman, Chris Richards and Justin Che.

None of this diminishes the major steps being taken by Tillman, Johnny and even Agyemang. Each is testing himself in a different setting, and each will almost certainly be a part of his new club's rotation from jump due to the amount invested by club ownership (though Derby indicated Agyemang's debut would be delayed due to hernia surgery). This list could be reshuffled some by summer's end, too, as more movement for USMNT regulars is reportedly in the offing. Yunus Musah could leave Milan after two difficult years, while Juventus apparently has suitors for both McKennie and Tim Weah. Josh Sargent, meanwhile, may be on the outs from Norwich City after years chasing promotion in vain.

This may not yet be the USMNT's “golden generation” in terms of on-field standard. In terms of the transfer market's valuation of U.S. talent, however, players of this nationality have never been assessed at a higher rate.

Iga Swiatek lost just one set on her way to winning her first Wimbledon Championships.

Swiatek has not always been successful at Wimbledon, and it was actually her weakest performing major tournament before this year.

However, after reaching the final in Bad Homburg, Swiatek showcased her improved grass court game at Wimbledon.

This was concluded with Swiatek thrashing Amanda Anisimova in the final, and now one of her Wimbledon opponents has revealed what she noticed about the now six-time major champion.

Of the players that came up against Swiatek at Wimbledon this year, Caty McNally was the only one to win a set.

When looking back on that match in an interview with Tennis Channel, McNally explained that she noticed how much better Swiatek was handling certain shots like the slice.

“It's tough to say in that moment, you never know,” McNally said when asked if she thought Swiatek could win Wimbledon after their match. “You have to take it match by match in a Grand Slam, anything can happen. I think in the past maybe she thought or other people said that her game is not suited to grass. But boy was she playing well.

“I think just watching a lot of the matches she was serving extremely well and that was really setting her up. I feel like she was just playing really solid tennis to big targets and that was huge.

“She was never going for anything crazy but she was handling shots that maybe in the past like slices or shots where she would be a bit uncomfortable pressing her forehand.

“I feel like she did a really good job of staying calm and hitting big targets. She is so fit that she can get to every ball. I was really impressed.

“Obviously you never know what is going to happen in a final with nerves but credit to Iga, she kind of showed everyone up and told everyone I can play on every surface. That was really incredible to watch her.

“It's obviously very cool to have the opportunity to play her in that tournament and credit to her, I think she did a great job.”

McNally's match against Swiatek at Wimbledon was not the only time they have shared a court together.

Swiatek has won both of their matches at senior level, but it was McNally who was the victor in their Roland Garros junior semifinal in 2018.

It was at that same tournament when Swiatek and McNally also played doubles together, and would actually go all the way to win the title.

This is one of two junior Grand Slam titles that Swiatek won before playing on the senior tour, with her other coming in the singles event at Wimbledon.

Just two years later, Swiatek would win Roland Garros for the first time and she is now a six-time major singles champion.

Iga Swiatek took her game to another level on the grass in 2025, as she conquered the surface she had struggled on for years.

Before 2025, Swiatek had never reached a grass-court final on the WTA Tour, with her best Wimbledon performance coming two years ago, when she made a run to the quarterfinals.

Breaking new ground, Swiatek qualified for the final of the Bad Homburg Open in the lead-up to Wimbledon, where she fell to Jessica Pegula in straight sets.

Carrying that momentum forward to Wimbledon, Swiatek dropped just one set as she booked her place in the final.

Maintaining her perfect record in Grand Slam finals, Swiatek dominated Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0, picking up her sixth major title.

Reacting to the Pole's stunning win, Todd Woodbridge has compared Swiatek to a 22-time Grand Slam champion.

During the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', former double world number one Woodbridge gave his verdict on Swiatek's Wimbledon campaign.

“She was relentless. It was [Steffi] Graf-like,” he said.

“It was so ironic that she would lose in Paris and get the time to play a lead in tournament and prepare better for here, with a little less pressure than usual as well.

“She was not the number one player in the world.

“In the final, what experience she showed from the very first point. She was ruthless and very deserving overall.”

Swiatek became the first player to win a Wimbledon final 6-0, 6-0 in 114 years when she dismantled Anisimova in Saturday's Championship match.

Winning her sixth major title in such dominant fashion, Woodbridge believes Swiatek is on her way back to the top of the women's game.

“She did not go diving, she has just fallen off a ranking point or two, and this will give her confidence on every surface now, and I look forward to seeing what she can do in Australia. That is the one really to complete that set,” he said.

“So some really good stories unfolding, but I think for Iga [Swiatek] it has taken a bit of time for the new coaching team to kick in, and I think she will trust and believe in that with Wim Fissette.”

Swiatek has now won three of the four titles required to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the Australian Open all that's left for her to complete the set.

It remains to be seen if Swiatek can add the Australian Open title to her trophy cabinet in 2026, but it will certainly be worth tuning in for when the tournament begins on Monday, January 12.

Woodbridge said Swiatek reminded him of Graf during Wimbledon, but how wide is the gap between their career achievements?

Graf is a 22-time Grand Slam winner who held the world number one ranking for a mouthwatering 377 weeks.

Swiatek, on the other hand, has six Grand Slams to her name and has been ranked number one in the world for 125 weeks.

Trailing the German by 16 Grand Slams, and 252 weeks at number one, Swiatek certainly has her work cut out for her if she wants to catch Graf.

However, at just 24 years of age, there is still plenty of time for Swiatek to close the gap as she continues to impress on the WTA Tour.

Since Swiatek won her first major in 2020, she has averaged one Grand Slam per year, which should see her reach double digits in no time.

If she continues at her current rate of one Grand Slam every year, Swiatek would match Graf's tally at the age of 40.

As it is unlikely, albeit not impossible, that Swiatek will be winning majors in her 40s, she may need to speed things up if she wants to surpass Graf's numbers.

Only time will tell if Swiatek can win 20+ Grand Slams, but if she continues to play as well as she did at Wimbledon, you wouldn't want to bet against it.

Jannik Sinner is the toast of tennis after claiming his maiden Wimbledon crown last weekend. 

His four-set win over Carlos Alcaraz came after he'd dropped the first set and Sinner proved exactly why he's the world's number one player. 

Sinner finally cracked Wimbledon for the first time in his career and bounced back from a tough quarter-final loss to Daniil Medvedev when he struggled badly with fatigue. 

Although he's only just collected his maiden Wimbledon title, he's actually been trying to shoot for the stars at the All England Club for a while. 

Sinner has progressed at an alarming rate in recent years but it hasn't always been quite so straightforward for the Italian. 

It's hard to imagine Sinner having to qualify given how utterly brilliant he is right now but that was the situation he was faced with in 2019. 

Sinner came up against Australian performer Alex Bolt – and lost!

The future star of the game would, of course, go on and claim the title and become a player tipped to break all sorts of records. 

On that day in Roehampton, however, he had no answer to Bolt's brilliance as he was sent packing 6-2, 5-7, 10-12. 

Sinner was just a teenager back then and had only been on the professional circuit for one year. 

Clearly, he wasn't good enough to beat Bolt on that occasion and perhaps it was a defeat of this nature that lit the fire inside him that eventually led to world dominance. 

Like many players do, Bolt was one of many players who spent time on the tour trying to make a name for himself in professional tennis. 

Bolt qualified for the Australian Open in 2019, reaching the third round before losing to Alexander Zverev in straight sets. 

During that tournament he beat the very capable Jack Sock and Gilles Simon to showcase what he's capable of. 

He also reached round two of Wimbledon in 2021 but was beaten in comprehensive style to Cameron Norrie after overcoming Serbian player Filip Krajinovic in round one. 

Bolt has reached a career high of 125 and right now is sitting at 179 in the world rankings, playing on the challenger tour trying to improve his ranking. 

Recently, the Australian showcased that he can play by qualifying for the main draw at this year's Wimbledon, losing to Ben Shelton in round one. 

Despite a career that has at times been a struggle, Bolt will likely remember that day when he beat Sinner vividly. 

At 32, there might not be much left for Bolt but it will be fascinating to see if he can kick on after a successful Wimbledon qualifying campaign.

Novak Djokovic is chasing history this September, as he aims to become the outright leader in Grand Slam singles titles won.

Djokovic, who fell short against Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon, is tied with Margaret Court for the most Grand Slam singles titles in history.

The Serbian's last major victory came in 2023, when he avenged his 2022 final loss to win the US Open.

The upcoming US Open represents Djokovic's best and last hope of reaching number 25. The Serbian ace is 38 years old and the time remaining for him to achieve this feat is dwindling.

Below are three reasons why the US Open is the perfect time for Novak Djokovic to win his 25th Grand Slam

It is no secret that Novak Djokovic has a strong record at the US Open.

The Serbian star is tied for the second most men's singles titles in the Open Era alongside his great rival Rafael Nadal. 

He is only beaten out by Roger Federer, Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors, who all have five US Open titles to their name.

The Serbian has also consistently reached the latter stages of the tournament, having reached the final a further six times.

Also, Djokovic's last Grand Slam victory was at the US Open. In that match, he avenged his 2022 US Open final loss by beating Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to win his 24th major.

Ultimately, Djokovic has all the tools and experience of playing and succeeding in New York to win his 25th Grand Slam Crown.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner present the biggest stumbling blocks to Novak Djokovic's 25th Grand Slam title. The pair have won the last seven Grand Slam men's singles titles combined, and are showing no signs of slowing down.

Alcaraz's first Grand Slam title was won at the 2022 US Open, when he beat Casper Ruud in the final. However, he has since struggled to perform to a high standard at the major.

In 2023, he reached the semi-final stage before losing to Daniil Medvedev in four sets. He was then shocked at the 2024 edition, losing to Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round.

Djokovic also has a positive head to head record against Alcaraz, leading the Spaniard by five wins to three. The Serbian player has beaten Alcaraz in their last two encounters: at the 2025 Australian Open and the 2024 Olympic Gold Medal match.

However, Djokovic will not want to play another of his great rivals, Jannik Sinner. The Italian leads their head-to-head by six wins to four and has won their last five matches dating back to the 2023 Davis Cup Finals.

Of those victories for Sinner, the two most recent have come at the semi-final stages of the 2025 French Open and Wimbledon tournaments, giving Djokovic cause for concern.

Alongside the French Open, the US Open crowd is known for creating some of the most boisterous atmospheres on tour.

Numerous players have had run-ins with the crowd, including Daniil Medvedev, Laura Siegmund and even Novak Djokovic, who Rafael Nadal said did not deserve to be booed after retiring from his US Open fourth-round match in 2016.

Some players, like Daniil Medvedev, thrive in the toxic atmosphere. Others find it more difficult.

Djokovic has never been one to mince words, but he has always thrived when playing the ‘villain' role on court. 

For years, he was the bane of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal fans. It was a rarity that Djokovic would hold the majority of support in a stadium if he was competing against either of those two players.

However, Djokovic is a master at utilising these hostile environments to his advantage.

Speaking on Nick Kyrgios' Good Trouble Podcast in 2024, Djokovic said: “I don't know, it really depends. People think that I really thrive on that energy when somebody doesn't like me or I'm facing adversity on and off the court.

“Sometimes I do because that's the only thing I have in that moment. I have to find a solution. I have to find a way to win a tennis match and be who I am, be true to myself. I know that not everyone will like me. 

“I know that people of course have their favorite players or maybe they want an underdog to win and things like that happen.”

Tim van Rijthoven recently announced his retirement from professional tennis, sharing the news with an emotional post on social media.


The Dutchman notably became one of the sport's best underdog stories in recent memory in 2022, when he won the ATP 250 in 's-Hertogenbosch by ousting three Top 15 players. Van Rijthoven entered that week as No. 205 in the PIF ATP Rankings, without any tour-level match wins. He followed his title run with a dream fourth-round showing at Wimbledon, falling to eventual champion Novak Djokovic.




Van Rijthoven, 28, is retiring from pro tennis due to a persistent elbow injury.


“With a heavy heart, I have to share something today that I have been trying to process for a long time,” the former No. 101 wrote in Dutch on Instagram. “My professional tennis career is forced to end.


“Due to a stubborn elbow injury that, despite all the rehabilitation and medical journeys, fails to recover, I am forced to say goodbye to the sport I've lived my entire life. I would have liked to see it differently. I would have liked to say goodbye on my own terms, with a racket in hand and the audience in the stands. But sometimes the body decides differently than the head. Yet I look back with an incredible amount of pride and gratitude.”

The International Tennis Hall of Fame has rejected a $10 million gift from hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman after his widely criticized entry in its ATP Challenger event, according to Front Office Sports.

The 59-year-old Ackman, a longtime tennis fan, competed in the Hall of Fame Open in Rhode Island last week as a doubles team with former top-10 player Jack Sock, losing to Omar Jasika and Bernard Tomic 6-1, 7-5.

The Challenger Tour is the tier below the ATP Tour, but still an actual professional tournament. Ackman received a wild-card entry after a history of philanthropy with the Hall of Fame and played like, well, a 59-year-old tennis enthusiast with no professional experience thrown into a group of professionals. Jasika and Tomic were openly going easy on him, but it didn't prevent him and Sock from losing in straight sets.

The decision to add a billionaire to the tournament it hosts led to a wave of criticism toward the Hall of Fame in the tennis community, most notably from former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, the last American man to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Speaking on his "Quick Served" podcast, Roddick called the match "a total miss," "pathetic," "hard to watch," and "the biggest joke I've watched in professional tennis." He actually said he didn't blame Ackman for his decision to play, placing the onus on the Hall, and praised the billionaire's effort, but said he believed the decisions behind the match would warrant a review.

"There was exactly one person on that court trying as hard as they could," Roddick said. "... If you want to argue with me, go back and watch that video. You can't tell me there was more than one person trying as hard as they could every point, or any point. It was a disaster.

"This was beneath the Hall of Fame, in my opinion."

You can judge the respective effort levels in the video of the match below:

Three days after the match, Ackman posted a lengthy tweet in which he defended the Hall of Fame, criticized his own play and pledged to set up a $10 million endowment he would manage, giving the Hall 10% of the principal each year.

He also called the match an overall success, describing it as "one of the greatest public relations achievements in tennis history" for the Hall, partially due to his failure on the court, and challenged Roddick to a doubles match. He said the criticism the Hall received was "entirely" on him, but also tried to explain why he played so badly.

"What has not been disclosed is that I played a doubles tournament 10 days prior at the HOF, and I played great. The field was comprised of former pros and top college players from around the world, but 55 plus in age. Richey Reneberg and I lost in the semis to the ultimate winners of the tournament in the tie breaker ... Where things went wrong is that I hadn't been beta tested in a professional tournament and my nerves got to me.

"Jack also chose the ad side and I have been playing the ad side for the last year. I was also serving into the 1:30pm sun with a shot clock (a new experience for me), and to make matters worse the other side held back making the whole thing look like a farce."

Everyone has a different definition of success, but it appears the Hall has been less happy than Ackman about how this has played out. While it declined comment to FOS, it reportedly said in a letter to its members and board that it would reject the donation to avoid "any perception of impropriety."

It added, “In hindsight, we would not make this decision again,” referring to Ackman's entry.

Late Wednesday, Ackman tweeted that he would instead provide a $10 million endowment to the Junior Tennis Champions Center, which counts Frances Tiafoe among its graduates.

Ackman made sure to note that JTCC had already accepted the gift, adding "all is well that ends well."

Novak Djokovic's window to achieve a 25th major title is getting smaller with every passing major tournament.

The 2025 US Open will mark two years since Djokovic's last Grand Slam title, when he defeated Daniil Medvedev in the final to claim his 24th major. The Serbian player is attempting to claim a 25th major, which would put him one clear of Margaret Court's total.

Djokovic has struggled to usurp the new kids on the block in recent times, losing to Jannik Sinner in both the French Open and Wimbledon semi-finals.

However, Djokovic did beat Carlos Alcaraz at the Australian Open in 2025, and at the 2024 Olympic Games to claim an elusive gold medal.

Despite these successes, one journalist has made a dour prediction about the Serbian star's future at Grand Slam tournaments.

Tennis journalist Matt Roberts was speaking with David Law and Catherine Whitaker during their overview of this year's Wimbledon, when the topic of Djokovic's US Open chances arose.

Roberts, who was speaking on The Tennis Podcast, acknowledged that you can never write off a player like Djokovic. However, he believes Djokovic's chances of beating both Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner at a Grand Slam are ‘gone.'

Roberts said: “I think you can't write him off completely because, I agree with you David [Law], if something happens and Sinner loses early or Alcaraz loses early, I still think Djokovic is the most likely to pick up the pieces because, yes, he's struggling in these latter stages but I think he's really struggling because he's having to face a Sinner or an Alcaraz, and that's taking so much out of him.

“I think, [during] the latter stages of a slam, if his route to the title suddenly looked like Fritz to play Zverev – I think if he's not had to face Sinner, if he's not had to face Alcaraz, yes he's feeling it a bit, but I'm probably still backing him because of his experience and his talent and what he can still do, what he would have in the tank.

“So you can't write him off completely but in the slams that we've seen recently where the fields are holding up and Sinner and/or Alcaraz are getting there at the end, I think it's gone.

“I think that has gone for Novak Djokovic in terms of being able to beat both of them in the latter and that now is what it feels like he has to do and that to me is where the shift has been and that's to me what he was saying in that press conference.

“I think he still thinks if Dimitrov takes out Sinner, suddenly it's all looking a little bit different and he's maybe hanging on that and he can maybe hope that one of those happens in the next year or so, which is possible, but at this stage feels quite unlikely.”

The last time Djokovic won the US Open, the tennis landscape was very different. Carlos Alcaraz was number one in the world and Daniil Medvedev was the defending champion.

Jannik Sinner had also yet to realise his potential. He was the number six seed at the tournament.

The Serbian star was imperious at the tournament. Despite struggling through a five-setter against Laslo Djere, Djokovic did not drop another set in any other match.

Djokovic will be hoping to produce the same form at this year's US Open, which will run from August 24 to September 7.

 Francisco Cerundolo channelled some recent family pain at the hands of Mariano Navone to earn an impressive opening win Thursday at the Nordea Open. 

 Cerundolo overcame his good friend and countryman Navone 6-3, 6-3 to book his quarter-final spot at the Swedish ATP 250. With Navone having defeated Juan Manuel Cerundolo in an ATP Challenger Tour final in Germany last week, Francisco light-heartedly alluded to a sense of satisfaction at having avenged his brother. 

 “Of course it's always difficult [to play a fellow Argentine]. Mariano is a super close friend of mine,” said Cerundolo. “We practise a lot together in Buenos Aires. It's always tough to play a friend, someone you know well, so I'm very happy to get this win. 

 “I had to avenge my family, because Mariano beat my brother last week, so it couldn't be two in a row!” 

 Cerundolo is competing as the top seed at an event where he lifted his maiden ATP Tour title in 2022. With his 93-minute victory against Navone, the No. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings became the second player to register 20 tour-level wins on clay this year after Carlos Alcaraz. Cerundolo awaits either Hugo Gaston or seventh seed Damir Dzumhur in the quarter-finals.

Earlier, Camilo Ugo Carabelli continued his career best season on the ATP Tour by outlasting Botic van de Zandschulp 7-6(3), 5-7, 6-3 to reach his third quarter-final of the year. The fifth-seeded Argentine reached consecutive clay-court semi-finals in Rio and Santiago in February and has earned 15 of his 17 tour-level wins on the surface.

Now up to No. 54 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, three spots off his career high, Ugo Carabelli will take on Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic for a spot in the last four. Misolic rallied to upset third seed and defending champion Nuno Borges 3-6, 7-6(1), 6-3, dropping just four of 24 service points in the deciding set, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Borges memorably won his first ATP Tour title last year in Bastad, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the final, but he was unable to cope with Misolic's court craft and guile during the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash.

Misolic is competing at his career-high World No. 105 and has jumped to No. 95 in the Live Rankings. The 23-year-old secured his first Top 50 win on clay against Denis Shapovalov at Roland Garros in May before falling to Novak Djokovic in the third round.

Aryna Sabalenka has announced she will sit out the National Bank Open in Montreal as she believes it is her “best chance” of hard court success this season.

The World No.1 is without a slam this year having not recently exited Wimbledon at the semi-final stage and the US Open represents her final chance in 2025.

The Belruasin returns to North America as the reigning US Open Champion having beaten Jessica Pegula in the final but she will not be featuring at the Canadian Open after she opted to skip it.

“I'm looking forward to kicking off the North American hard-court swing, but to give myself the best chance for success this season, I've decided it's in my best interest to skip Montreal,” Sabalenka said via a Tennis Canada press release.

“I'll miss my amazing Canadian fans, but I'm already looking forward to seeing you all next year. Thanks for your understanding and support. It means the world to me!”

Sabalenka reached the quarter finals of the tournament last year, losing to Amanda Anisimova, and has never won the event.

The 27-year-old is expected to feature at the Cincinnati Open where she will look to defend her title before her US Open campaign kicks off.

Sabalenka is facing the prospect of a slam-less year for the first time since 2022 but said after her Wimbledon defeat that even if she ends 0/4, it has been a good year.

“Well, I think that's impressive. I'm already qualified for [the WTA Finals in] Riyadh. We are just in the middle. Maybe not really in the middle, but kind of like in the middle of the season. I already qualified. Never happened before.

“I think even though I lost a lot of finals, I lost tough matches at the slams this year, I still think that the consistency I was able to bring till this moment, it's impressive.

“Still a lot of things to be proud of. This experience shows that next year I'm only hungrier and angrier. These tough defeats help me to come back much stronger.

“I have huge hopes for the next year.

“I lost three semis, three tough ones. Then I was banned from playing. Then I was injured. So I have really more of a hate relationship right now with Wimbledon, but I really hope that one day I will, yeah, turn it around and have love relationship.

“Of course, if one day I'm going to be able to win it, of course, I'm going to look back on all of these tough losses and think that I still did it.

“Yeah, now it's tough, but I never give up, and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure.”

Emma Navarro has sent a tongue-in-cheek message to World No. 1 Jannik Sinner ahead of the US Open Mixed Doubles Championships. 

The doubles tournament is set to be a star-studded event with the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu and Iga Swaitek and Casper Ruud teaming together. 

Raducanu has already revealed her tactics with Alcaraz and now Emma Navarro has shared a cheeky message to her partner Sinner. 

Navarro has jokingly suggested there's a few things the Wimbledon champion has to work on ahead of their partnership. 

Navarro took over the US Open's social media accounts to send a jokey message about his potential doubles play. 

“Hey Jannik. I'm getting a bit worried because I didn't see that much net play,” Navarro joked in a social media video to Sinner.

The star continued: “You did hit a Tweener at one point, which was pretty cool, but you missed the overhead!”

Navarro's concerns may be valid as Sinner has never played a doubles match at a Grand Slam event, but the American doesn't have much experience either. 

She has never won a doubles match at the US Open and the star is currently ranked World No. 505 in the pair's rankings. 

The US Open Mixed Doubles Championships take place over two days the week before the singles action kicks off. The tournament will take place on August 19 and 20. 

While Alcaraz and Raducanu have stolen many of the headlines, the tournament is set to be littered with the biggest stars in tennis. 

British No. 1 Jack Draper is paired with 2024 Olympic Gold Medalist Zheng Qinwen, while current Italians Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti will team together.

Elsewhere, Americans Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton, and Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe will surely be the team with the most backing at Flushing Meadows. 

Nick Kyrgios is also expected to continue his doubles resurgence, after teaming with Gael Monfils in Washington, with the Aussie paired with Naomi Osaka.

The two had met each other last at tribute held in honor of Nadal at Roland Garros

Dubai: Tennis legend Roger Federer and his wife Mirka visited Rafael Nadal at his academy in Mallorca recently. 

The two had met each other last at the emotional tribute held in honor of the 14-time French Open champion at Roland Garros.

Two videos posted on social media. One shows the two champions walking side-by-side near the court at the academy while the other shows both having a discussion as Mika looks on.

Nadal posted a picture of him with Federer and said: "Really enjoyed our morning together at the @rnadalacademy!"

The Swiss legend ended his long career at the 2022 Laver Cup – which took place at the O2 Arena in London – in which he played his last doubles match right alongside Nadal.

Nadal called it an end to his professional career in November last year after representing his Spain for the last time at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga.

Tunisian trailblazer Ons Jabeur announces she is taking a break from professional tennis having previously been beaten in the final of Wimbledon twice and the US Open final amid a frustrating search for a Grand Slam title over the past few years

Thursday 17 July 2025 15:05, UK

Two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur has announced she is taking a break from tennis to 'rediscover the joy of living' after a difficult spell in her career.

The Tunisian recently made a tearful first-round exit at Wimbledon as she was forced to retire injured during her match against Viktoriya Tomova.

Jabeur has asserted herself as something of a fan favourite on British soil in recent years, having made the final at SW19 in both 2022 and 2023, falling to Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova on those occasions.

The defeats would combine with her 2022 loss at the US Open final in fuelling a painful pursuit of a maiden Grand Slam title, with subsequent injury issues and a decline in form culminating in her decision to step away from the court.

"For the past two years, I've been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges," she said in a statement on social media. "But deep down, I haven't truly felt happy on the court for some time now.

"Tennis is such a beautiful sport. But right now, I feel it's time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal, and to rediscover the joy of simply living.

"Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. I carry it with me always.

Jabeur has become a trailblazer in women's tennis as the first African and Arab woman to feature in a major singles final, as well as becoming the highest-ranked African and Arab tennis player in ATP and WTA rankings' history when she reached No 2 in 2022.

She had emerged as a must-see attraction on both routes to the final at the All England Club with her daring drop shots and bag of tricks.

At Wimbledon, a tearful Jabeur was forced to retire early in the second set of her opening match with Viktoria Tomova. Two weeks earlier, the former world No. 2 had put together an encouraging quarterfinal run in Berlin that included dispatching Jasmine Paolini for her first Top 5 win in nearly two years.“I'm really sad. It doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it was a very tough season for me. So I hope I'm going to feel better and we'll see what's going to happen,” Jabeur said following her disheartening exit in London.

In March, Jabeur sustained a calf injury—a problem area she dealt with in 2023—when facing Paolini at the Miami Open. Returning at the Mutua Madrid Open, where she lifted her biggest career trophy in 2022, the Tunisian ultimately went winless across her three European clay-court appearances,Last year, Jabeur shut down her season in September after withdrawing from the US Open with a shoulder issue. Currently ranked No. 71, the 30-year-old's most recent title came at the Ningbo Open in September 2023.“Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me.

Ons Jabeur, two-time Wimbledon runner-up, posted on X that she is taking a break from tennis. She said she's no longer happy playing the sport, and it's time to put herself first.

“For the past two years, I've been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges,” Jabeur said in a post on X. "But deep down, I haven't truly felt happy on the court for some time now.

“Tennis is such a beautiful sport. But right now, I feel it's time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal and to rediscover the joy of simply living.”

The 30-year-old last played at Wimbledon on June 30 in a first-round match against Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova, eventually retiring from the match due to difficulty breathing. She suffers from asthma and also experienced breathing difficulties at the 2025 Australian Open.

Jabeur's 2024 season ended early due to shoulder discomfort and this season she's battled a recurring knee and leg injury.

Recently, Jabeur hinted at taking a break following her early exit from Wimbledon, saying at that time she would “try to disconnect a little bit from tennis” and spend time with her family while recovering.

Even though Jabeur is a former world No.2, she struggled this year to reach top form. She lost her first-round match at the French Open and suffered a third-round defeat at the Australian Open.

Her best run came at the Qatar Open, a WTA 1000 tournament, where she reached the quarterfinals. She also reached the same stage at the Brisbane International and Abu Dhabi Open, which are both WTA 500 events.

"Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. I carry it with me always.

“Even while I'm away from the court, I'll continue to stay close and connected in different ways, and share this journey with you all,” added Jabeur.

Jabeur, who holds a career-high ranking of No. 2, has slipped out of the Top-50 and is currently 71st in the world. While the Tunisian announced her break, she did not mention how long she would be out for.

As is tradition in the VIP Tennis Lounge—previously visited by stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Nick Kyrgios, Aryna Sabalenka—the interview ended with the arrival of the check. But unlike the others, Medvedev was quick to start negotiating.He carefully reviewed the bill, even disputing a few humorous charges—including a fine for four “bad jokes”—and couldn't resist poking fun at the complexities of U.S. tipping.“The problem in the U.S. is that the check is already quite expensive!” he said. “And then you add 20 percent, and then there's going to be tax, and then there's going to be this or that…”The good news is Medvedev will have more chances to brush up on the system as he returns to the States for the North American hard-court swing. He's set to compete at the Mubadala Citi DC Open in Washington, D.C. from July 21 to 27.In the meantime, check out Tennis Channel's VIP Tennis Lounge for more interviews.

Tennis legend John Fitzgerald joined Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in China to announce the Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off will return to Chengdu this year.

The annual tournament sees top players from the Asia-Pacific region compete for a coveted Australian Open main draw wildcard.

“As the Grand Slam of Asia Pacific, we are thrilled to bring the AO Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off back to Chengdu,” John Fitzgerald, Australian tennis legend, said.

“This tournament is a launchpad for the region's rising stars, offering a direct pathway to the Australian Open main draw and a chance to shine on the world stage.

“China is now the fastest-growing tennis market globally, and the depth of talent across Asia-Pacific is extraordinary. Each year we see more players breaking through, and none more inspiring than Qinwen Zheng – last year's AO finalist – who followed in the footsteps of her idol Li Na, crowned champion a decade earlier

At last year's Play-off, Zhang Shuai and Kasidit Samrej won their places in the main draw of Australian Open 2025.

Winning the tournament capped off Chinese star Zhang Shuai's late-season resurgence. Zhang fell as low as world No.768 in February 2024 amid a 24-match losing streak before turning her season around on home soil at Beijing's China Open, a WTA 1000 tournament where she ultimately went on to reach the quarterfinal, followed up by her victory in Chengdu.

At Australian Open 2025, Zhang defeated American rising star McCartney Kessler in the opening round before going down to No.24 seed Yulia Putintseva. Zhang has continued to improve her ranking and is now ranked No.120 in singles and No.15 in doubles.

Unlike Zhang, who hit a career high ranking of world No.22, Thailand's Kasidit Samrej had never competed at a Grand Slam venue – not even in qualifying – before earning a wildcard to this year's AO. Faced with a tough round one matchup in No.5 seed Daniil Medvedev, Samrej fought valiantly, taking Medvedev to five sets.

“The Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off has a proud legacy, first held in Nanjing in 2012, and it's only grown in stature since,” Fitzgerald said.

“It's unearthed some incredible stories – such as Denis Istomin, who earned his wildcard and went on to stun Novak Djokovic in the second round of AO 2017, and Wang Xinyu, who won the play-off in 2017 and is now firmly inside the world's top 50.

“These are the moments that define careers and inspire the next generation. The Play-off is not just a tournament, it's a proving ground for the region's best, and a celebration of the Australian Open's deep connection with the Asia Pacific.”

The Play-off, scheduled for 24-29 November 2025, comprises 16-player men's and women's singles events – plus eight-player men's and women's qualifying draws – and 12-team men's and women's doubles events. It will be held at Sichuan International Tennis Centre.

The magnificent Australian Open trophies, the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup and the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, are in Chengdu this week for the announcement. Luzhou Laojiao (Official Baijiu Partner of the Australian Open) is an official partner of Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off.

Nick Kyrgios, fresh off two weeks at Wimbledon as a pundit, has sparked rumours he is dating a reality TV star through his posts on social media. The Australian was unable to play at SW19 this year as he recovers from injury, but worked for both TNT Sports and talkSPORT throughout the Grand Slam.

The 2022 finalist has taken to the Bahamas to relax in the sun on holiday, but fans are speculating that he has been joined by Love Island star Mia Dalkos. She appeared on season six of the show's Australian version and was runner-up with Niko Fotopoulous.

Kyrgios took to his Instagram story to share a snap at a poolside location in Nassau with stunning views. He also shared a mirror selfie with the caption: “Back home in the Bahamas. Making me darkkkkkk.”

And, in what could be a remarkable coincidence, Mia also shared snaps to her story this week at the same location. She posted her point of view from a car, which was travelling down a road on the coast.

She captioned it: “Nassau, Bahamas,” with a silver love heart. She also posted a clip standing in front of a gym, holding a basketball, Kyrgios' favourite sport alongside tennis.

The pair may have been vacationing separately, but previous public messages on Instagram have led fans to think otherwise.

Mia, whose real name is Efthimia Dalkos, posted a picture of herself in a salon in May, which grabbed Kyrgios' attention. He left a flirty eye emoji in the comments and she responded with a smiling emoji.

The very next day, Mia shared a series of photos from her sister's wedding as she donned a stunning black dress.

The snaps were described as “beautiful” by the outspoken ATP Tour star, to which she replied with a red heart emoji.

Neither person has publicly confirmed that they are dating and Kyrgios' representatives said that they are “good friends.”

Kyrgios, 30, last spent more than three years in a relationship with Costeen Hatzi before splitting up earlier this year.

During an Instagram Q&A he was asked about the break-up and said: "Things happen. I wish her nothing but the best. So many incredible memories that will stay with me."

Influencer Hatzi also opened up on the split, telling the Herald Sun: "We haven't spoken, relationships come to an end. I believe it's for the best.

"I hope he finds peace and happiness within himself. I definitely entered the relationship with pure intentions. I loved him, thought we had a great connection."

Alexander Zverev claims he isn't "as far away as some might think" when it comes to splitting the rivalry of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The German has changed his tune quickly from "not being good enough" to challenge the duo, to having hopes of "spoiling the party" for the world No.1 and 2 in tennis. Earlier this year in January, Zverev admitted that he feels he is simply not talented enough to challenge the pair, after his damning Australian Open defeat to Sinner.

Post-match, the 28-year-old told Sinner: "You're just too good. It's as simple as that," as he added: "I want to thank my team. We're trying to do all the right work. I'm just not good enough. It's as simple as that. I don't know if I'll ever be able to lift the trophy but I'll keep coming back, I'll keep trying."

However, this opinion seems to have quickly escaped Zverev's mind as he told Tennis365 that he isn't as far away from the pinnacle of tennis as some may believe. The German said: "Maybe it hasn't been my best year, but I don't think I'm as far away as some people might think.

"At the moment, Carlos is the star boy. He just brings great energy to the court, and along with Jannik, they are the players to beat. I just hope to spoil their party a little bit, and I think I can do that."

Zverev's claims could be backed up by his history against the pair, as he has one more win than both Alcaraz and Sinner when they go head-to-head on the court. The German has six wins to Alcaraz's five, while he has four wins to the Italian's three.



However, he is zero for three in Grand Slam finals, losing the 2025 Australian Open to Sinner, the 2024 French Open to Alcaraz, and the 2020 US Open to Dominic Thiem. If Zverev wants to ever split his higher-ranking tennis stars, he will have to get back to a few major finals and get the trophy secured to challenge at the highest level in the future.

Zverev also had some praise for Alcaraz, adding that if the young Spaniard can avoid getting into any bother on and off the court, then he will be extremely revered by the tennis world.

He said: "Carlos is a great guy. He is fun to be around, and he always has a smile on his face. If he can avoid any controversies, he is going to be very, very loved by tennis fans."

All England Club offers talks on creating player council

Slams also face legal action from union set up by Djokovic

Wimbledon and the three other grand slam tournaments are willing to make concessions to the players in an attempt to resolve a dispute over prize money, pensions and player representation.

The Guardian has learned that during discussions with representatives of several top-10 world-ranked men and women players at Wimbledon last week, the All England Club offered to hold talks over creating a player council to give athletes a voice in decisions over scheduling, as well as indicating a willingness to contribute to their pension and healthcare provision for the first time.

Similar offers are understood to have been made by the other major championships, the Australian Open, French Open and US Open, with the discussions set to resume at the final grand slam of the year in New York next month. The details have yet to be agreed with the players planning to submit a formal proposal later this year.

Player representatives held two meetings with Wimbledon and French Open officials, and executives from the Australian Open and US Open, at SW19 with sources involved on all sides describing the discussions as positive. The talks had begun in May at Roland Garros, where leading players, including Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff, met with the grand slam heads and made a series of demands, including a greater proportion of their revenue to be shared in prize money; contributions from the four majors to player healthcare, pensions and maternity pay; and a formal say in decisions regarding tournament scheduling.

The offer to begin talks over creating a player council for the grand slams is seen as a significant concession by the players, who have always insisted that the dispute is not primarily about prize money. All the grand slams have introduced significant changes to their playing conditions in recent years without consulting the players, including Sunday starts at the Australian and US Opens, playing on the first Sunday at Wimbledon and more evening sessions everywhere, which has led to 3am finishes in Melbourne and Paris in particular.

Many of the players feel such changes have had a detrimental effect on their preparation for tournaments and want a formal say on such decisions in the future, particularly as there is a feeling some of the grand slams want to introduce Saturday starts to give them three full weekends of action to sell to broadcasters. While the issue of prize money was not discussed in detail at Wimbledon there is an acceptance by the players that it has continued to increase significantly each year, with the All England Club paying out £53.5m this year, a rise of 7% on 12 months ago.

Wimbledon declined to comment on the details of private conversation, but confirmed discussions had taken place during the championships.

“We always welcome the opportunity to engage with the players and are regularly in touch with them year-round,” a spokesperson said. “We were happy to continue those conversations at Wimbledon. Listening to the players' feedback and maintaining a constructive relationship with them is very important to us and these discussions will continue.”

The grand slams are also facing potential legal action from the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), the international players' union set up by Novak Djokovic, who filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the ATP Tour, WTA Tour, and International Tennis Federation in March, accusing the sport's governing bodies of suppressing competition, manipulating prize money and imposing a restrictive ranking system on the players.

The PTPA filed an amended complaint against the tours in New York last week, which included an addendum that they would hold off naming the grand slams as co-defendants. Ahmad Nassar, the PTPA chief executive, said that they have since held productive discussions with the grand slams and expressed confidence they can reach an agreement.

“We filed a 180-page amended complaint, but we also filed a one-page letter about our talks with the grand slams, saying that we want 90 days to continue those discussions,” Nassar said. “Ninety days is the timeline in the letter we filed with the court that said that we're holding off on naming the grand slams as defendants in our court case. We've been having productive discussions with them about resolving the issues that we outlined in the 180-page complaint.

“The one page to me means far more than 180 pages. That's the window to really roll up our sleeves and address the issues over the schedule, player representation, and compensation.”

Genie Bouchard will retire from tennis at the National Bank Open in Montreal, while Aryna Sabalenka will skip the event due to fatigue; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Thursday 17 July 2025 07:08, UK

Former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard will retire from tennis at the National Bank Open in Montreal, while Aryna Sabalenka has decided to skip the event due to fatigue.

Bouchard, 31, who lost to Petra Kvitova in the Wimbledon final in 2014 will play at her home tournament in Canada later this month before ending her career.

The former world No 5 also reached the semi-finals that year at the Australian Open and French Open in the same year.

"You'll know when it's time. For me, it's now," Bouchard posted on social media, along with pictures of herself playing. "Ending where it all started: Montreal."

Bouchard, who won the Wimbledon girls' singles title in 2012, went on to reach the quarter-finals in Australia in 2015, but her career was never the same after she slipped on a wet locker room floor at the US Open later that year and suffered a concussion that forced her to withdraw before her fourth-round match.

She sued the US Tennis Association and reached a settlement in 2018 after a jury found the USTA 'most liable'.

Bouchard helped Canada win their maiden Billie Jean King Cup title in 2023 before she switched to pickleball, playing just one match on tour this season.

She has a career singles record of 299-230.

"She has been one of the most important figures in the history of our sport in Canada and a trailblazer who redefined what Canadian tennis could be," said Valerie Tetreault, the National Bank Open tournament director.

"We are proud of everything she has done, as a player and role model, and we can't wait to see her in action one last time at IGA Stadium this summer."

World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka has decided to skip the US Open tune-up event in Montreal due to fatigue.

The 27-year old Belarusian's decision to sit out the July 26-August 7 Canadian Open follows her semi-final appearances at Wimbledon and Berlin and after losing in the French Open final.

"I'm looking forward to kicking off the North American hard-court swing, but to give myself the best chance for success this season, I've decided it's in my best interest to skip Montreal," Sabalenka said in a Tennis Canada press release.

"I'll miss my amazing Canadian fans, but I'm already looking forward to seeing you all next year. Thanks for your understanding and support it means the world to me!"

Netflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said the giant streamer remains indifferent to legacy media networks even as a record number of companies seem to be peeling them off or putting them up for sale. 


	“We agree continued consolidation of studio and network assets is likely, but at least with respect to consolidation within legacy media, we don't think it materially changes the competitive landscape,” said Neuman on a Q&A with analysts after Netflix's latest quarterly earnings. “We've historically been more builders than buyers, and we continue to see big runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook.”

	The streamer's outlook may not be changing but the ecosystem sure is. Comcast is in the process of spinning out NBCUniversal's cable networks into a standalone public company called Versant. Warner Bros. Discovery is doing the same with its networks. Lionsgate and Starz separated. Disney and Hearst have floated the possibility of unloading A+E Global Media. A merged Skydance and Paramount (if and when) may opt to shed some assets. M&A opportunities abound for Netflix or other tech companies to swoop.

	“We look at a lot of things,” said Neumann. “We apply a framework or lens to those opportunities. Is it a big opportunity? Does it strengthen our entertainment offerings? Does it strengthen our capabilities? Does it accelerate our strategy? And we look at all of that relative to the opportunity cost of distraction or other alternatives. You know, we've been pretty clear in the past that we also have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so that also kind of reduces the funnel for us.”


	“We believe we can and will be choosy. We've got a great business. We're predominantly focused on growing that organically, investing aggressively and responsibly into that growth and returning excess cash to shareholders through share purchase. And I think you'll see us continue on that path.”

	In a shocking move, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will end in May.


	“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert will end its historic run in May 2026 at the end of the broadcast season,” CBS brass said in a statement. “We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire The Late Show franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.”


	The statement was made by George Cheeks, Co-CEO Paramount Global and President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS; Amy Reisenbach, President of CBS Entertainment; and David Stapf, President of CBS Studios.

	











	Colbert, who announced the news during tonight's taping, said that he was grateful to CBS for giving him the chair. “I'm not being replaced, this is all just going away,” Colbert said.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The CBS execs said this was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night” and “is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”


	The shock move coincides with Colbert's contract coming up at the end of 2026. With Jon Stewart having signed another deal to remain as one of the hosts of The Daily Show on Paramount-owned sister network Comedy Central until the end of 2025, could Colbert take the reins of that other storied late-night franchise? Stranger things have happened.


	It also comes days after Colbert, who was a Daily Show correspondent from 1997-2005, called Paramount Global's $16M settlement of Donald Trump's lawsuit a “big fat bribe.”












	In fact, tonight's guest was Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who alluded to the possibility that there were nefarious reasons behind the cancelation. He tweeted: “Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled. If Paramount and CBS ended The Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”


The Late Show began in August 1993 with David Letterman as host, having moved over from NBC after he didn't get The Tonight Show gig. Letterman retired from the show in May 2015 and Colbert, who had previously starred on The Daily Show and The Colbert Report took over in September 2015.


	The timing is interesting as it comes as Skydance is in the process of acquiring Paramount. While it's unlikely to have been related to noted-Trump hater Colbert's attacks on the President, the move will give David Ellison and his gang slightly less to worry about when it comes to telling truth to power. Colbert's old friend Jon Stewart weighed in earlier today on the possibility that Skydance might cancel The Daily Show when it takes over. 


	It's a brutal blow for late-night, which has already been struggling in recent years with CBS recently axing After Midnight, the show that replaced The Late Late Show with James Corden instead of replacing host Taylor Tomlinson.

While I'm sad for Colbert, haven't watched a late night show since Leno and Letterman called it a day.  C'est Le Vie…

Colbert is not funny. I won't miss him and his corny jokes about our president. Go away Colbert.

Fuck CBS, Paramount, Skydance, and the Ellison family.

Whatever the reason, late night talk shows are a dying breed.  You can see the same thing 30 other places.

He's the example. Fall in line or else.

	We all knew Coldplay concerts were a buzzworthy affair, but who knew the band would out an actual affair?


	That's what concertgoers are saying after a couple — identified as Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the company's chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot — were caught on the jumbotron in an intimate embrace during Coldplay's show in Boston Wednesday night. Their initially sweet reaction instantly turned to shock as they ducked and hid their faces from the camera, while frontman Chris Martin declared on stage, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,” according to social media videos.




	Turns out, it could be the former. Byron appears to be married, while Cabot is reportedly recently divorced. Neither of them have officially commented on the incident, nor has Martin or the band. Still, the caught-on-camera moment has gone viral, with commentators having a field day online. One savvy Etsy seller has also jumped on the bandwagon, offering merch that reads “I Took My Sidepiece To The Coldplay Concert And It Ruined My Life” (see it here). The sweatshirt only costs $34.99 for shoppers, but for the two people involved in the soft rock scandal, you can't put a price on embarrassment.




	Coldplay are in the middle of their “Music of the Spheres” tour, which wraps in a couple of weeks. Whether you're looking for something to wear to their show or something to hide away in the crowd, here's the best Coldplay concert merch (and concert disguises) to find online now.




	$4.49



	$6.55



	31% off




		Ah yes, the classic moustache, eyebrows and dark-rimmed glasses disguise! Works every time (we think). Amazon has this version on sale for just $5 and the site says more than 200 people have purchased it in the last few weeks alone, though we can't be sure exactly why… See more novelty disguises here.	




	$5.99




		Amazon also sells this pullover mask, which can be customized with a face photo of your choice. Consider printing the mask with a photo of Chris Martin, maybe Gwyneth Paltrow or y'know, the actual spouse of the person you're cuddling.	




	$17.99



	$20.99



	14% off




		This Amazon deal gets you a two-pack of polarized sunglasses in a classic Wayfarer-style silhouette so you can stay looking cool — and loved up discreetly.Bonus: take an additional 10% off with promo code 6N7Z4KQU at checkout.	




	$19.99



	$23.99



	17% off




		We like this camo-print shirt, which comes in an contemporary, oversized fit. This would probably help you blend in well to a Coldplay concert at an outdoor amphitheater or music festival.	




	$34.99




		The now-viral moment has already made its way into fashion. As the product description on Etsy states, “Whether you lived it or just love chaos, this tee is a whole mood. Inspired by the now-legendary viral tweet, this hilarious and slightly tragic shirt is perfect for those who love drama (from a distance), heartbreak, or just really ironic fashion.”	




	$30.99




		Of course, the best way to fit it (or blend in) at a Coldplay concert is by sporting their official merch, and Amazon has a number of Coldplay T-shirts, hoodies and accessories available online. This T-shirt features the words “Love is the Only Answer” around a custom logo created for the band's latest album, Moon Music.	




	$25.99




		The Moon Music album cover art also inspired this T-shirt, which features a rainbow-colored heart on the chest.	




	$30.99




		The “Love is the Only Answer” T-shirt is also available as a larger graphic tee in black. Choose from sizes small to 6XL online.	




	$44.99




		Another Amazon merch exclusive is this Coldplay Moon Music hoodie, which is made from a cozy cotton blend material with kangaroo pockets and a drawstring hood.	




	$5.99




		If you're really desperate to stay anonymous, you can always pull a balaclava over your head but uh… wear at your own risk: you may not even be able to get into the stadium wearing this, let alone make it onto the jumbotron.	




	$23.21




		And if you really want to avoid getting into a similar situation, consider re-upping your HR knowledge. I'm sure it says somewhere in the manual that employees should not be cuddling with their boss. When you love someone but it goes to waste, could it be worse? The answer is yes. Yes it can be worse.

Thirty-three years after “Basic Instinct” sent shockwaves through American culture with its explicit depictions of sex and violence, The Wrap has reported Amazon MGM Studios' United Artists and producer Scott Stuber has acquired the rights to a reboot straight from the film‘s screenwriter Joe Eszterhas. The movie doesn't have a title yet, nor are any details yet available of whether it is more of a sequel or a remake — other than it is reportedly going to be “anti-woke.” Upon its original release, the film did receive backlash from the LGBTQ+ community and feminists. Nick Nesbitt and Craig Baumgarten are also on board as producers of the reboot, with Adam Griffin serving as executive producer.

It's a high-price deal, with up to $4 million going to Eszterhas if the movie makes it to completion,  including $2 million guaranteed. Eszterhas made similar bank on the original film with a then-record $3 million for his script.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“Basic Instinct” was not only one of the highest grossing films of 1992, it also is one of the most successful R-rated films of all time — though it was almost rated NC-17 before director Paul Verhoeven made minor cuts to get it to the more box office-friendly R. The salacious erotic thriller finds Michael Douglas' Detective Nick Curran caught in a sexual game of cat-and-mouse with alleged killer and crime novelist Catherine Tramell, played in a truly iconic performance by Sharon Stone — who was far from the first choice for the role.

 










“I wanted to play her so badly that I had the script on top of my refrigerator for eight months. I just kept thinking, ‘I'm going to manifest this, I'm going to get this part,' as they offered it to everybody else on the planet,” she told THR in 2024. “I was the 13th choice. The line producer told me that relentlessly though the entire shoot while he called me Karen. ‘You, Karen, were the 13th choice.'”

When her performance sent her into superstardom, she said she felt a sense of relief. “As I walked down the carpet in Cannes and a thousand people started chanting my name, I had such a surge of relief come over me, such a feeling of calm,” she recalled.

This isn't the first time an attempt at revitalizing “Basic Instinct” has been made. Notoriously, in 2006, Stone returned for “Basic Instinct 2,” a film that was derided by critics and ignored by audiences, grossing only $38.8 million worldwide, versus its predecessor's $352.9 million. Reports so far indicate Stone “could” return.

South Korean indie rock four-piece Silica Gel have tapped Japanese Breakfast's Michelle Zauner for a new song titled “NamgungFefere.” “This was the first time I've ever written lyrics in Korean,” Zauner shared in a press statement. “Anyone who's familiar with my work knows how much my Korean heritage has come to mean to me, so it was very personal to collaborate with such a revered Korean band and to create something for a larger Korean audience.” Watch the music video for “NamgungFefere,” directed by Jan' Qui, below.

Zauner has kept busy since releasing her latest Japanese Breakfast LP, For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women), in March. She's shared music videos for the album tracks “Picture Window” and “Winter in LA,” covered Gorillaz's “On Melancholy Hill” during her Coachella 2025 set, and contributed a song to the soundtrack for Celine Song's new film Materialists. Zauner's ongoing international tour will return to North America in August.

"New developments have occurred since the investigation," counters HYBE.


													By
												

	Billboard Korea



After 15 months of legal disputes, the conflict between HYBE and former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin has entered a new chapter. Police officials in Seoul announced on Tuesday (July 15) that they will drop two criminal complaints filed by HYBE against Min for alleged breach of duty.


	However, the decision represents a “non-indictment disposition,” meaning the case has been closed at the police level without being forwarded to prosecutors — so it does not signify a final resolution. 


	HYBE responded swiftly, stating, “We will file an objection with the prosecution today regarding the non-indictment decision in the breach of duty case.” The company also emphasized that “new developments have occurred since the investigation, including the NewJeans members' declarations to terminate their contracts, along with newly submitted evidence in related court proceedings.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Min stepped down from her position as an internal director at ADOR in November 2024 and officially left the company after her request for reinstatement as the label's CEO was denied. 


	A third hearing in a separate civil lawsuit filed by HYBE for damages is scheduled to take place on Friday (July 18).


	The police's decision not to indict stands in contrast to the court's rejection of NewJeans' request to overturn an injunction, filed by ADOR in January, that barred the five NewJeans members from signing independent deals without the label's approval. The NewJeans members effectively ended their independent activities under the name “NJZ” following their appearance at ComplexCon in Hong Kong this past March.


	The legal battle between HYBE and Min Hee-jin, the implications of the police decision on NewJeans' future, and the evolving tensions between the group and their label ADOR are shaping up to be one of year's defining storylines in the K-pop world.

Mrs. Davis co-creator/executive producer Tara Hernandez will be writing the adaptation of the 1990 environmental superhero animated series Captain Planet and the Planeteers, which ran on TBS and in syndication for six seasons. 

	











	Appian Way previously spearheaded a live-action feature Captain Planet take. Originally set up at Paramount Pictures in 2016 with Glen Powell co-writing with Jono Matt and potentially starring, the project never materialized, with the rights eventually reverting to Warner Bros. Discovery, though Powell had remained passionate about it as his star rose fast post-Top Gun: Maverick. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	Appian Way's DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson executive produce the Captain Planet live-action series alongside Berlanti Prods.' Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman. Powell is not involved but Matt is a producer, sources said.

	Conceived by Ted Turner, Captain Planet and the Planeteers follows five teenagers who tackle environmental disasters with the help of a superhero, Captain Planet. The animated series was produced by DIC Enterprises (Seasons 1-3) and Hanna-Barbera Cartoons (Seasons 4-6).

	











	Berlanti is no stranger to the superhero genre — he built an expansive DC universe at the CW. This marks Berlanti Prods.' second high-profile live-action series adaptation of a beloved WBD animated property for Netflix, joining the upcoming Scooby-Doo origin series. At Netflix, the company also was behind hit thriller drama series You, co-created by Berlanti.


	Berlanti Prods.' current slate includes NBC's Brilliant Minds and the CW's All American. The company's pipeline also includes horror thriller Stillwater, based on the Skybound comics, which has a series order at Amazon with Berlanti and Carly Wray adapting; mystery Foster Dade in the works at Hulu; Dilettante, starring Jeff Daniels, set up at Apple; and a family drama at HBO Max.


	Environmental causes have been at the heart of Appian Way's documentary slate with projects such as the Emmy-winning The Path Of the Panther, We Are Guardians, Virunga, And We Go Green, Fin, The Loneliest Whale and Ice On Fire as well as the kids animated series Ozi: Voice of the Forest. 


	After a decade as a writer-producer on The Big Bang Theory and spinoff Young Sheldon, Hernandez co-created with Damon Lindelof and served as an executive producer and showrunner on Peacock's AI-themed limited series Mrs. Davis.

Better have Don Cheadle.

What were once outlandish cartoon villain plots to ruin the planet now qualify as hard-hitting, realistic drama, so I suppose there's no better time to bring back this franchise.

Jon Stewart may or may not be on the Paramount chopping block, but regardless, he's taking the whole mountain down with him. The often irascible host has not minced words when it comes to Paramount's, his show's parent company, “shameful,” “illegal” $16 million settlement with Donald Trump. Now, he's turning his signature harsh-but-fair attitude on Comedy Central, which actually airs The Daily Show, as he fields questions about whether or not the chiefs of potential Paramount owner Skydance would be inclined to keep such a rabble-rouser on the payroll. 

“Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” Stewart said of his not-yet-new bosses, on a recent episode of his The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart podcast (via Deadline). “They haven't called me and said like ‘Don't get too comfortable in that office, Stewart.' But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of shittier establishments than that. We'll land on our feet.”

The “shitty establishment” Stewart is referencing seems to be Paramount as a whole, though he doesn't spare Comedy Central either. “I'd like to believe that without The Daily Show… I don't know. Comedy Central is kind of like muzak at this point,” he continued. “I think we're the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park. But it's the only thing on there.” No offense to the upcoming second season of Digman! or new episodes of the Beavis And Butt-Head revival, but he's kind of right. The TV schedule for tomorrow, for example, features a re-run of Digman!, followed by four hours of South Park, followed by old episodes of Seinfeld, Futurama, and The Office, with some Family Guy thrown in for kicks at the end. South Park, of course, is also having its own issues with the company right now. 

For Stewart's sake, he'd “like to think we bring enough value to the property,” he said. “If they're looking at it as purely a real estate transaction, I think we bring a lot of value. But that may not be their consideration. They may sell the whole fucking place for parts, I just don't know. We'll deal with it when we do.”

Eyes are also on Stephen Colbert, another outspoken Trump critic under the Paramount umbrella. A mustached Colbert poked fun at the question of whether The Late Show would continue under Skydance leadership this week, asking on-air how the new bosses were “going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert if they can't find him.” It's a frivolous bit (the mustache is already gone), but speaks to the hosts' general attitude about these potential shakeups. It seems they're just going to keep doing their thing, capitulating leadership or not. “I'm so happy and proud of everybody that works over there. They want to do that? Knock themselves out,” Stewart said. “As Jay Leno would say about Doritos, go ahead, crunch all you want, we'll make more. We'll figure that out when the time comes.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Paramount+ has confirmed a series order to NOLA King, a spinoff from Taylor Sheridan's hit drama Tulsa King, which will star Samuel L. Jackson.


	As Deadline reported last month, Jackson will appear in multiple episodes of Tulsa King‘s upcoming third season before headlining and executive producing the new series, from 101 Studios and MTV Entertainment Studios.


	Paramount+ has released a first-look image of Jackson and Tulsa King star Sylvester Stallone in Episode 309 of the mothership series and more details about the offshoot's premise. NOLA King follows Russell Lee Washington Jr. (Jackson) who, after befriending Dwight Manfredi (Stallone) during a 10-year stint in federal prison, is sent to Tulsa by New York's Renzetti crime family to take Dwight out once and for all.

	











	Inspired by what Dwight created in Tulsa and impressed with the possibilities of second chances, Washington returns to New Orleans, the home he abandoned 40 years ago, to rekindle his relationship with his family, friends, and to take control of the city he left behind. In so doing, he incurs the wrath of his former employers in New York, and makes himself vulnerable to old NOLA foes, both criminal and cop.

	“Samuel L. Jackson brings unparalleled presence and global appeal, making him the perfect choice to maximize the momentum of one of our biggest hits and transform it into a hit franchise,” said Chris McCarthy, Co-CEO of Paramount Global and President of Showtime/MTV Entertainment. “Building on the breakout success of Sylvester Stallone's Tulsa King, audiences will now experience the full force of Jackson's dynamic, layered performance — supercharging one of Paramount+'s flagship series.”

	











NOLA King stems from an idea by McCarthy to expand the world of Tulsa King the way Sheridan's Yellowstone has spawned multiple offshoots. He took it to Stallone.


	“Chris McCarthy came to me with a game-changing idea: to elevate my show beyond a mob boss series, creating a dynamic, family-driven franchise,” Stallone said. “I was immediately on board. Sam Jackson is the only choice to anchor this new adventure in NOLA and David Glasser and 101 are the perfect partner to bring it to life.”


	This marks the first spinoff from Tulsa King, Paramount+'s No. 1 global original series in 2024, whose third season is set to premiere in September.


NOLA King, which is eying a February start of production, is executive produced by Sheridan, Stallone and Jackson. David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Michael Friedman and Keith Cox also executive produce. The project was originally written by Dave Erickson who was poised to become showrunner but stepped down due to his commitments as showrunner on Tulsa King and another Sheridan series, Mayor of Kingstown. Search is underway for a new showrunner.


	“Partnering with Paramount has been such a rich experience,” said Glasser, CEO of 101 Studios. “Taylor had the brilliant idea to drop Sylvester Stallone in the middle of Tulsa and it has been everything we have wanted and more. The success of this show has now led us to another icon. I can not wait to see what Sam brings to this world.”


NOLA King is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios and distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution outside of the Paramount+ markets.


	This marks the first series headlining stint for Jackson, known for his MCU role as Nick Fury, which he has played across films and TV series. On TV, he recently starred in the Peacock limited series Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist. An Academy Award nominee for Pulp Fiction, Jackson received an Honorary Oscar in 2021.

The actor gushed that the pop star has "always" been super kind to his daughters. 


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Adam Sandler will always be a devoted Swiftie. While speaking to Entertainment Tonight about new movie Happy Gilmore 2, in which Travis Kelce makes a cameo, the actor-comedian only had kind things to say about the tight end and his superstar girlfriend, Taylor Swift.


	The topic of Swift first came up when Sandler was asked whether his daughters –19-year-old Sadie and 16-year-old Sunny, whom he shares with wife Jackie — got the chance to meet the pop star while Kelce was on set of the Happy Gilmore sequel. “They have met, and Taylor's incredible,” the Sand Man replied. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“Taylor's so damn nice to my family and has always been,” he continued. “She's ridiculously nice to them and warm, and Travis is such a gentle, nice guy. Funny as hell. He's like the guys I grew up with.”


	Sandler has long been open about his family's love for Swift. In February 2024, he confessed to Conan O'Brien that the 14-time Grammy winner is a rare celebrity around whom he still gets “jumpy,” purely because of how much she means to his girls.

	











	Later that year — shortly after Sandler announced that Travis would appear in Happy Gilmore 2 — the Grown Ups actor echoed those thoughts on the Kansas City Chiefs star's New Heights podcast with Jason Kelce. “I love what she had to say … what she meant to young girls, what she means to women, what she means to guys doing the right thing in life,” Sandler said at the time. “I do get nervous around Taylor Swift, because I don't want to f–king blow it for my kids and say something stupid.”


	And in an interview with Billboard last August, Sandler revealed his favorite song of Swift's. “Everything [my two daughters] throw on I love, but one of the first ones they threw on when they were young was ‘The Best Day,'” he said. “We connected with that when the kids were young. Every album, we listen the first day it comes out. There's not a song they don't know every word to.”


	Featuring Travis Kelce and also starring Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald and Ben Stiller, Happy Gilmore 2 will premiere July 25 on Netflix.

Drew Pearce, whose screenwriting credits include 'Fall Guy' and 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,' is attached to write the script.

Senior Film Writer


Judge Dredd. Taika Waititi.


	Those two names have studio heads and executives sitting up this week as one of the hottest packages of the year hits the Hollywood marketplace.




	Waititi, the Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit filmmaker, is attached to direct a new feature film take on Dredd, the popular and violent British comic book character.


	Drew Pearce, the scribe known for his action movie-filled resume thanks to titles such as Fall Guy and Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, is attached to write the script.

	Producers include Dredd rights holders Chris Kingsley, Jason Kingsley and Ben Smith of Rebellion Developments, Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment, Jeremy Platt, Natalie Viscuso and Pearce. 

	










			Popular on THR		







	Sources say Pearce and Waititi both grew up with the books and are friends who have been trying to find a project to work on together for years. 


	Created in the late 1970s by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, Dredd debuted in the pages of weekly British anthology 2000 AD. He is a police officer in the bleak future metropolis of Mega-City One, part of a law enforcement corps that empowers officers to be judge, jury, and executioner. The character and his stories were a satire on a judicial system taken to the extreme. Dredd proved hugely popular, engendering several more comics and comics strips, video and board games, books, and even postage stamps in the United Kingdom. It is said that over 100,000,000 comics and graphic novels have been sold.


	The character was given the glossy Hollywood treatment in 1995 with a big-budget adaptation that starred Sylvester Stallone. It was poorly received. More warmly was the reception for Dredd, a 2012 adaptation that starred Karl Urban with a script by Alex Garland, the writer behind 28 Days Later, who also wrote and directed Civil War.

	











	The logline is being kept under the visor, but the pitch is said to take inspiration more from the comics than the previous screen iterations, leaning into the world-building and dark humor. It is also meant to be a fun sci-fi blockbuster that nonetheless speaks to this moment in culture. The desire is to see the movie launch a Dredd universe that could be explored with additional movies and shows across various platforms.

Destroy Lonely performed last week at a music festival called Beach, Please! in Costinești, Romania. According to footage from the festival's livestream, the Opium rapper stopped his set after performing “Blitz” to call up a fan whom he said had a sign indicating he wanted to be onstage. Once together, Destroy Lonely told the young man, “When this motherfucker drop, I need you to jump right back in there with your friends. Is you ready?” The rapper then went into his song “FakeNggas” and gestured for the young man to jump off the stage. He eventually jumped off with Destroy Lonely seemingly helping to prep him offstage. Additional footage shows that the young man landed nearly directly on a barricade.

Observator spoke with the young man, whom the Romanian news outlet identified as a 15-year-old named Nicolas. “When I fell I thought I was going to die,” Nicolas said, according to a Google translation of his Romanian remarks. “I had no more air; I was left without air. And I don't know. I thought that if I don't get help here, these will be my last moments.” Nicolas also claimed that he told Destroy Lonely that he did not want to jump, but the rapper insisted that he get himself off the stage.

When reached by Pitchfork, representatives for Beach, Please! shared the following statement:

In the immediate aftermath of the incident involving a young man who was injured after jumping off the stage, Beach, Please! Festival took swift and concrete measures.

Our on-site medical teams intervened within seconds, providing immediate and professional care. The injured fan was promptly transported to the hospital, where he received the necessary treatment. We are relieved and grateful to report that he is now in stable condition, recovering well, and expected to make a full recovery. Throughout this time, we have remained in close contact with his family, offering our full support. His wellbeing continues to be our highest priority.

We fully respect the family's privacy and will not be disclosing any contact details.

Beyond medical assistance, we acted immediately to strengthen safety protocols. That very night, we implemented a strict no-access policy for fans on stage during any artist performance. This rule was promptly communicated to all artist teams, security providers, and production staff. Any breach of this policy will now carry immediate consequences.

Beach, Please! is the largest festival in Europe and the biggest hip-hop festival in the world, with more than 500,000 total attendees over the course of this year's edition—a record-breaking turnout that confirms the trust and enthusiasm of our global community. Across multiple days of programming and dozens of high-energy shows, this was the only such incident reported. Major artists such as A$AP Rocky, Yeat, Lil Tecca, Ken Carson, and Lil Baby performed alongside Destroy Lonely without any similar occurrences.

At Beach, Please!, our mission is to create unforgettable experiences—never at the expense of safety. We believe festivals must lead by example when it comes to care, responsibility, and respect for the crowd. This incident has only strengthened our commitment to those values.

Representatives for Destroy Lonely did not immediately respond to Pitchfork's requests for comment.

In July 1985, the biggest movie in the country was “Back to the Future.” The number one song was “A View to a Kill” by Duran Duran, from the James Bond movie of the same name. A large number of the movies listed in the top 10 the weekend of July 19, even beyond the obvious “Back to the Future,” offer a murderer's row of movies we still talk about today: “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” “Cocoon,” “Rambo: First Blood Part II,” “St. Elmo's Fire.” Just for good measure, “E.T.” was re-released into theaters that weekend. 

 










Do you know what's difficult? It's difficult to have a brand-new, wide release film and have it finish 14th at the box office. Want to know what's even more difficult? To have a brand-new, wide release film finish 14th at the box office, and then, 40 years later, for it to still be culturally important enough to warrant a gigantic retrospective piece with the cast and crew of that film, which is what you are currently reading.

But this all seems appropriate for “The Legend of Billie Jean,” a story of a young woman with no agency, completely ignored and discarded, who slowly develops an underground cult following, while becoming an inspiration to young people (and especially women) across the country. 

Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner's original script for the film was inspired by the story of Phoolan Devi, an Indian icon and eventual member of parliament who defied authority and developed an underground following. (Her story is pretty fascinating and, ultimately, tragic.) For “The Legend of Billie Jean” (originally titled “Legend” until the Ridley Scott, Tom Cruise movie came out), Phoolan Devi of India became Billie Jean Davy of Corpus Christi, Texas.

This is the story of how “The Legend of Billie Jean” became (as Pat Benatar would sing), invincible. (Though, as I learned the hard way, not everyone involved is thrilled about this anniversary.)

“I was attracted to the screenplay because I hadn't seen anything like it, the empowerment of a female. And everybody in the movie was young and powerless. And everybody in the movie was young and powerless,” said director Matthew Robbins in a recent interview with IndieWire. “The assumptions are being made by all the adult males. It's kind of a forcefield the kids are up against.”

 










In “The Legend of Billie Jean,” Binx Davy (Christian Slater, in his very first film role) gets beaten up by some local bullies and has his prized red Honda Elite scooter vandalized. His older sister, Billie Jean (Helen Slater, “Supergirl,” which came out while “Billie Jean” was filming), confronts Mr. Pyatt (Richard Bradford), the father of the head bully, demanding the precise amount of $608, the cash necessary to repair Binx's scooter.

Mr. Pyatt agrees to pay but, in the process of this apparent negotiation, sexually assaults Billie Jean. An enraged Binx picks up Mr. Pyatt's gun, which he believes to be unloaded, and accidentally shoots Mr. Pyatt in the shoulder. Suddenly, the siblings, along with their friends Putter (Yeardley Smith) and Ophelia (Martha Gehman), become outlaws, going on the run while simply demanding the $608 they are owed for the scooter repairs, because “fair is fair.”

“As a mythologist now, I don't think you can underestimate that female empowerment,” Helen Slater, who, yes, recently finished her doctorate degree in mythology, told IndieWire. “I usually don't use that language, but for the sake of this, this idea of you don't feel you have much agency in your life, and the movie says, well, maybe not so much.”

“It's unusual in a film to see a big sister stick up for a little brother,” added Yeardley Smith. “Because I came up in the ‘80s, I was so used to all the female characters being secretaries, wives, much more incidental.”

 










Robbins was coming off directing “Dragonslayer” (a very different movie), but the script reminded him of themes he explored in one of his previous screenplays. “I was fascinated with notoriety getting confused with fame,” said Robbins, “which was exactly the same issue in “The Sugarland Express.'”

Robbins co-wrote “The Sugarland Express,” a 1974 film that Steven Spielberg directed just before he exploded with “Jaws” the next year. It stars Goldie Hawn and William Atherton, who become outlaws over a child custody battle. It's a much grittier film than “The Legend of Billie Jean” (it was the ‘70s, after all), but with the themes of fugitives on the run gaining notoriety, the seeds are very much planted here.

Still, Robbins felt the original script needed a rewrite in order to get the tone and humanity he was looking for. Robbins explained, “When I was offered the job of ‘The Legend of Billie Jean,' I said, I'd like to make some changes to the screenplay and I'd like to work with Walter Bernstein. Jon Peters, at the time said, ‘Work with whoever you want.' Walter Bernstein was hired and the two of us reworked it.” (Don't worry, there are plenty of Jon Peters stories still coming.)

(Though, Robbins did try to get the title and name of the character changed because of the, you know, still extremely popular Michael Jackson song that came out a couple of years earlier. The studio wasn't having it.) 

 










Bernstein, who was Robbins' longtime mentor, had previously written “The Front” and Marilyn Monroe's unfinished last film, “Something's Got to Give.” And, notably, he was also one of the writers blacklisted during the McCarthy era. 

Helen Slater sees a lot of Bernstein's point of view in the finished film: “It's not about a blacklisted screenwriter, but it had those seeds of when the culture, when the conditioning [is in a certain place], you get locked out. How do you navigate that?”

Robbins added, “I would have to attribute to him some of the understanding of the female side of this: the way she confronts the world; the way she steps into a leadership Pied Piper in a way. Helen shares a lovely scene with Keith Gordon where she's really wondering, Who am I? And he says, ‘You're Billie Jean.' That is really Walter Bernstein territory.”

As Billie Jean and the group go on the run across a steamy Texas summer, they eventually find refuge in what they think is an empty mansion. They don't realize that a somewhat eccentric young man (when we first meet him, he's wearing an elaborate Wolfman costume) named Lloyd (Gordon) is still at home. 

Matthew Robbins: “Keith Gordon was wonderful. He just had the right high IQ and intelligence and eccentricity to play that role.”

 










Helen Slater: “He's just so smart! Did you know this about him? I have such admiration for actors who become directors and have that brain thing going. He was lovely, just sweet as pie.”

Keith Gordon: “It's better than being remembered as dumb. I'm sure I've met people in my life who would say, he's not that smart. But if a doctor in mythology says I'm smart, I feel like I've been validated. There you go.”

Of course, Lloyd immediately falls in love with Billie Jean, but he's not the typical ‘80s boyfriend we usually saw in films of this era. But that doesn't mean Gordon (who had previously starred in “Christine” and “Dressed to Kill”) didn't have to convince producer Peters he was “sexy” enough for the role.

Gordon recalled, “I remember Matthew and them prepping me, ‘This is what they're looking for and this is what they're afraid of'. So, I remember just going in as the ‘Jon Peters version of the character.' Which was less having fun and more being cool. It felt so goofy, but I wanted to get the part.”

What's it like having to convince Jon Peters that you are “sexy”?

“It was weird. I went to his house, this gigantic mansion. We sat and had iced tea, or whatever. And he's like, ‘Do you really think you can be really sexy in a movie?,'” Gordon said. “And it's not really my personality to go, ‘Oh, yeah.'  Whatever Gordon did, however, ultimately worked.

 










Meeting Lloyd doesn't just add a love story subplot to the film, it also leads directly into one of the film's most enduring sequences. While at the mansion, Billie Jean watches “Joan of Arc” on television and decides to chop of all of her hair, providing her iconic look from the film and also providing one of the biggest headaches of Matthew Robbins' career.

Matthew Robbins: “Jon Peters was from the world of hairdressing. So, the issue of Helen and her haircut assumed enormous proportions. It was a gigantic issue for him.”

Helen Slater: “That was a whole thing!”

Yeardley Smith: “I remember that night she cut her hair.”

Matthew Robbins: “He wanted to — and a matter of fact, did — send his own choice of hairdresser to Corpus Christi. Only the ‘very best' could be responsible for cutting her hair.”

Helen Slater: “Our wonderful hairdresser, Lynn Del Kail, it probably was not great she couldn't do that moment.”

Keith Gordon: “At the time, I felt like it was a Hollywood sellout. And now I don't know that I was right. I was very idealistic. I remember I was like, ‘Yeah, they should just give Helen a pair of scissors and [let her] cut her own hair.' In the grand scheme, it ultimately was a Hollywood movie and it struck a chord [that] Hollywood movies strike in people that lasts in a different way. So, it was probably the right call.”

 










Helen Slater: “That was actually my hair. I was all in with the part, where I was and being so young and getting the lead in a movie. It's such a dazzling thing at such a young age, ‘Supergirl' then ‘The Legend of Billie Jean.' I just couldn't believe I was getting to do this. There was this feeling of, let's jump in and do this.”

Keith Gordon: “I remember at the time being like, this is silly! This is bullshit! Who would cut their own hair and have it be so perfect?!”

Yeardley Smith: “It was a cool haircut! I mean, Helen is one of those people who could wear any length of hair.”

Matthew Robbins: “It wasn't a good thing. It led to so much tension and chaos. It was an issue that should not have led to so much paranoia and expense.”

Helen Slater: “That haircut … it wasn't wrong, exactly. Because so many people have come up to me and told me, ‘I got that haircut.'”

Yeardley Smith: “I remember they wanted me to cut my hair. I said, ‘You know that's not happening.' They were sort of put out. The solution was — I had long hair and my hair was thick — so if I wore that cheesy blazer with the collar flipped up, put the wig on, my hair was down my back in that scene on the beach.”

Keith Gordon: “It does look cool. That's the thing that happens when our youthful idealism isn't always right.”

 










“It felt different from a lot of movies I saw as a kid, in that it made kid problems feel very adult, but somehow mythical,” said Oscar-nominated screenwriter and noted “Billie Jean” fan, Emily V. Gordon. Like most of us who love this movie, the “Big Sick” writer first discovered Robbins' film on a seemingly never-ending loop on HBO. 

“These were kids dealing with sexual assault, poverty, physical abuse, being wrongly accused, and going viral before that was a thing,” she told IndieWire. “And though all those stakes felt intensely real, they also felt like problems you could overcome by the very nature of being a kid. A rebellious kid.”

What also makes “The Legend of Billie Jean” unique is its portrayal of something that we hear a lot about today: “strong female characters.” Back then, outside of notable exceptions like “Alien” and “The Terminator,” these kinds of mainstream action movies did not really attempt to do this, let alone feature multiple women as part of the main group. Even today, the male interpretation of “strong female character” just means she can beat up a bunch of guys.

“Through the whole movie there's a female sensibility,” said Keith Gordon. “That would have been the other cliche Hollywood construction: it would have been Helen, a boyfriend, maybe the younger brother. There wouldn't have been any other women in there. That's the movie that was more likely: one woman and all guys.”

 










There are a couple of scenes in “Billie Jean” that really illustrate this. In one, Billie Jean is recognized by some neighborhood kids who ask for her help in confronting a local resident who is abusing his young son. In a bad movie, Billie Jean would kick the father's ass. What actually happens in the film is much more nuanced: she simply steps into his house and makes it clear she (and everyone else) know what he's doing.

“That's one of my favorite scenes in the movie actually,” said Robbins. “She is compelled to do something, but she doesn't know what's going to happen. And that kid was a local kid and he just nailed it. He came through so well.”

“That's a lovely scene,” said Smith. “I ended up working with that actor several times, John Jackson, lovely guy. But she does it with a quiet, ‘I see you. It's wrong and you know it.' Today, he would be bloody on the floor in a heap.”

In another scene after an intense shootout, Smith's character, Putter, is bleeding. At first, the group thinks she may have been shot. Instead, it turns out she's just had her first period. Putter says, “It's about time.” Binx says, “Gross.” Billie Jean immediately scolds her bother and says, “It's wonderful.” 

It probably really doesn't need to be said there's really nothing else like this scene, in this kind of movie, at that time or now. “I remember people asking me, are we really going to shoot that?,” said Robbins. “I said, of course! In the middle of all this action, what is the most unexpected? Where do we go that no one can anticipate?”

 










Slater added, “When we're there as the actors just shooting it, it just feels like, ‘Well, this is what this scene is,' as if we're doing a play. I don't think we had the brainpower or the insight to be like, ‘Whoa, I don't see this very often.' Somewhere we knew, we had a hunch, this is kind of cool, because it's touching on something real, and how great it is to have that wrapped up in this fable about someone not having agency, to having agency over something and inspiring other people when that happens. This scene feels like one of the ingredients that helps that along because it seems real.”

Smith feels a little differently, even now.

“I actually don't like that scene,” said the actress. “Just, to me, look, it's fine that she gets her period. Although, the way she discovers she gets her period is they're being shot at and she thinks, ‘Oh, my God, I've been shot.' The bullet would have come into her head! But now she gets her period? And then, I'm being washed off in the ocean with a towel around me, and the first thing I say is, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' Who says that?! Nobody! Nobody in the history of the world who gets their period would, first thing they say, be, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' I was like, this is so embarrassing. But, I'm glad I'm alone in my camp.”

 










“I can't go with Yeardley on that one,” said Keith Gordon. “Teen girls would watch this and go, ‘That's so cool.' It didn't talk down to young women and it celebrates them. It was treated as something totally positive. And the idea of, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' That a girl would be interested in getting a diaphragm and interested in sex? Again, that was something you never saw. Sex in mainstream movies, men initiated or boys initiated. There wasn't a lot of treating girls the way boys were treated.”

I presented the question of this scene to, again, noted “Billie Jean” fan Emily V. Gordon. “Everyone is entitled to feel however they want about it,” she said. “But I gotta tell you, I love it. I mean, movies still shy away from putting menstruation in our entertainment. Treat something like a shameful secret, it stays one! Thematically and emotionally, I love that it's a reflection of how young these children are, and also of how they care for each other. This experience is growing them all up very quickly, and that's true of getting your period, too. But it's also just an audacious beat to put in a shoot-out scene. In another movie it'd be treated just as a joke, but the care the movie shows with the beach scene that follows makes it iconic.”

 










I mentioned earlier that not everyone is thrilled about this anniversary of “The Legend of Billie Jean.” In the course of my prep work, I reached out to the reps for both of the film's credited screenwriters Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner. I knew the script had been rewritten, but I was genuinely curious what the original version of the script was like. 

Keith Gordon even mentioned, “When I first read the script, it felt like in spots it was a little more satiric and a little more double-edged. That the whole thing was about a scooter. It was a movie for teens, but there's also a grown-up way to look at this movie. There was more dark humor, which I loved. And when we made it, that wasn't there as much.”

Eventually, I heard from Mark Rosenthal via text message (for the life of me, I don't know how he got my number, but that's beside the point). He told me whatever I had heard about the movie so far was “distorted,” that Matthew Robbins fired him and was “clueless,” and then directed me to his website, where he had just written a long essay about his experience on the film.

He then texted me, “You do what you gotta do– but Billie was my creation. Would've been a much better film with me on it. (I'm actually in talks for a possible stage version.) The fact that you went to Walter and were not intending to talk to me till Walter said something — despite he has no credit!!!–confirms again the media press disrespects writers and does not understand how movies get made. Sorry to be snarky but it's my story.”

 










The “Walter” he is referring to is the aforementioned Walter Bernstein, who was born in 1919 and is no longer alive. If I had talked to him recently, I'm really burying the lede here about my supernatural abilities. 

It seems Rosenthal mistook an unidentified “he” earlier in the text thread as meaning Walter Bernstein, not Matthew Robbins, as I had intended. The last I heard from him was, “Then your noun pronoun agreement needs work. Write what you want. You guys don't get the business. Good night.” Touché.

“Helen Slater… I mean, that was… I thought she and I were meant to be together. I mean, I thought, ‘We wouldn't have to change our last name. We'd just get married.' And she was Supergirl! I was very excited.”

These are the words of Christian Slater when I interviewed him a couple of years ago as he was promoting the Disney+ show, “Willow.” I brought up “The Legend of Billie Jean,” both because I love the film and, I like to think, I had a premonition I'd one day work on a piece like this very one and it might be tough to get to talk to him again. 

I followed up by asking if he had a crush on Helen. “Oh, God. Dude. Yeah,” Christian Slater said. After I joked about them being just being close siblings in the film, he continued, “No, no, just brother and sister hanging out, playing and splashing, and having a great time. Yeah, it was unbelievable. Oh, my God. No, I had nothing but love for her.”

 










This kind of encapsulates the behind-the-scenes antics on “The Legend of Billie Jean” as — besides veteran actors like Peter Coyote and Dean Stockwell — most of the cast really was made up of young people. Kids, really.

When I recently relayed what Christian Slater said about Helen Slater to Helen Slater, she laughed, “Awww. I loved him! He was four years younger than me! Then that's a huge age gap then,” she said. “That's really funny. If it ever comes on I need to take a look at that. What's he playing in this? I just thought we were a very close brother and sister!”

Smith added, “She really thought of him like a little brother. But I am actually not at all surprised to find out he had a crush on her.”

And Keith Gordon agreed, “I don't remember that at all! It's not surprising. That's so interesting. And I can't say that I knew. That is really cool. I love it. And it makes perfect sense.”

“I thought he was great,” said Robbins, “he had just the edge and the unpredictability that the character needed. He was a young loose cannon. That hot temper. What can you say, the camera likes him. He was really growing up fast on that movie. He was kind of on his own as a young guy in a movie. His mother was a quite well-established casting director out of New York, but he was there without a parent or guardian. There were a lot of temptations and freedoms of staying up all night and that kind of stuff.”

 










Keith Gordon recalled what it was like to see that in action. “He's a teenager and all these girls are like, ‘Hi, you're in a movie and I want to hang out with you.' He was like 15 or 16 and all these girls were in love with him. He was very much enjoying it in a very sweet way,” he said. “I was a little older than everybody and he was younger than everybody. So, there was a certain amount of him coming to me, ‘What do I do about this girl? I like her but I'm not sure how much I like her.' I did a little bit of older brother stuff.”

And then there was the whole issue of, as Christian Slater alluded to, that he and Helen shared a last name and played siblings in the film, but were not related in real life.  

Robbins remembered, “It was almost impossible to persuade journalists that this was purely by chance. When we were doing prep on this I had to constantly explain, no, no, we didn't plan this.”

Keith Gordon was also (briefly) fooled. “I thought that when I got the job. They both looked enough alike and they had the same last name,” he said. “But once you start talking [to them], it became very evident in like three minutes that they are not related.”

While Christian Slater and Keith Gordon were bonding, Helen Slater, Yeardley Smith, and Martha Gehman were also becoming fast friends. “Helen was the only one who had a car. It was a Jeep,” Smith said. “Christian didn't really want to hang out with the girls. He was like, ‘Oh, God, why am I here?' But the girls, we'd pile into the Jeep and go to the mall.”

 










Gordon remembers this dynamic, too. “Those three, Helen and Yeardley and Martha, they had that connection,” he said. “They seemed super tight.”

“We loved each other,” said Helen Slater. “Martha and Yeardley and Christian and Keith. To be a teenager with those people? I'll just say this, there was no potato in the group. There's no potato where you're like, ‘Oh, no, that person?' We were shooting all day and there wasn't much downtime. There were dinners and hanging out. Hanging out at the pool! I don't know if Matthew said this, but we had to get more tan because we were ‘New York City tan.'” (“'NYC tans,' that does sound like me,” said Robbins.)

“Every night we'd go to this fish restaurant and have blackened red fish,” said Smith. “That was my first introduction to blackened anything! Actually, I remember, ‘Supergirl' came out while we were shooting, so we all went to a matinee to see it. The theater, I think we were the only ones in it. Of course, we were so proud of Helen. We loved it. It didn't do well.”

Recently, Helen Slater found herself back near Corpus Christi. “I don't remember what I was working on, but I went back to the Sunrise Mall,” she said. “It's still there, but it's been abandoned. It was like walking into a ghost town.”

 










Why do so many people today still love this movie that, almost literally, no one saw in theaters? The most successful aspect of the movie at the time of its release was a Pat Benatar song on the soundtrack, “Invincible,” which hit number 10 on the Billboard charts and was one of the themes of the summer of 1985. 

What is the legacy of “The Legend of Billie Jean,” 40 years later? What makes this movie so special? How did this movie predict the internet, with a woman going viral with her own hashtag (“What's fair is fair”)? And what made Matthew Robbins so equipped to tell such a feminine story? 

For the record, Robbins balks at this notion a bit, that a man can't tell a story about women. My counter was that of course men can (and do), it's just so many are bad at it and he was good at it.

Helen Slater tried to put this in context: “If I just take a stab at it, without disagreeing with what Matthew is saying, he was a relational guy. He might balk at this, but he was connected to that inner-feminine. The ability to create an environment on the set where people feel comfortable and relaxed. That comes from the top and that came from him.”

Yeardley Smith agreed, “I think that's true. There was nothing slick about him. He wasn't interested in playing the game, he was interested in telling the story. He was sort of like a dad to us. He obviously wasn't old enough to be our dad, but he had a grounded-ness about him that had not been infected by the Hollywood grind.”

 










Keith Gordon, now obviously an accomplished director himself, had this to add: “He shows, throughout [his career], a sensitivity to women characters, and also a sensitivity to complexity. I mean, ‘The Sugarland Express' has that, Goldie Hawn's character was really complicated and really interesting and really rich. Lots of men have not directed women well. Obviously, I don't think men shouldn't be able to direct women, because that would be a difficult world, but I do think female characters in Hollywood films have often been afterthoughts. I don't think that's ever been part of Matthew's writing, and he treated his male and female characters as equally as valuable. There weren't a lot of other movies that did that. There weren't a lot of other movies that had a young woman who was strong and smart and somebody that if you were 13 or 14 or 15, you'd see in a movie and go, ‘I want to be like her. She's cool.' Boys had that all over the place.” 

“I'm glad to hear of everyone's fond memories, which tells me I was able to shield them from the intense pressure I was under,” said Robbins. (An example: There's a scene near the end of the film in which Christian Slater's character, Binx, gets shot. As they were getting ready to shoot this scene, Robbins heard from the studio that he was not allowed to film this scene. He was told the most he can do is have Binx be shot with “a bean bag gun.” Anyway, assuming you've seen the film, Robbins won this argument.)

 










Yeardley Smith: “People accost me with the line, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' It's great to be accosted with that line in the produce aisle.”

Keith Gordon: “The film was a huge disaster when it came out. And the reviews were terrible, which didn't help. We didn't have any kind of major star and I don't think they had any idea how to market it. I think its fate was sealed literally before it even opened.”

Yeardley Smith: “I really thought this movie is going to make me a star. And then it didn't. Though, I had quite a few movies at the beginning of my career that I thought would make me a star and didn't. Like ‘Maximum Overdrive.' It's terrible! At least ‘The Legend of Billie Jean' is enormously charming.”

Helen Slater: “I don't want to put down any classic 1980s male directors, but if you think of some of those more bombastic ‘80s movies, if they had been at the helm, it probably would have gone a direction where you don't get that relational quality. But why a film about a teenage girl would be so popular is kind of interesting.”

Yeardley Smith: “It happens with ‘The Simpsons' daily. The show means so much to people, Lisa Simpson in particular. People are like, ‘She got me through so many hard times,' or, ‘I took up an instrument because of her,' or, ‘I became a writer,' or whatever the thing is. I never take that stuff for granted. With ‘Billie Jean,' I'm always delighted when something I was a part of was meaningful to other people. You do it because you love it, but the fact it can have a positive impact and mean something to somebody else who you've never met is icing on icing. How is anything better than that?”

EXCLUSIVE: Two years after the record-setting release of Barbie, the feminist live-action take on Mattel's iconic doll that became a cultural phenomenon, Illumination and Mattel Studios have finalized a deal to develop a new Barbie movie that will be the first in animation for theaters, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Illumination, Universal, and Mattel declined to comment. Not yet dated, we're told the film will be released by Universal Pictures, which has an exclusive financing and distribution partnership with Illumination. No word yet on the plot of this Barbie or creatives attached.

	











	Transcending all expectations as it grossed over $1.44 billion worldwide, Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring Margot Robbie, impacted culture like few other films in recent memory. Propelled to the highest heights in part by the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, where audiences paired Barbie with Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in a double-feature event, the film was the highest grossing of 2023 and has solidified its place in history as one the highest-grossing films of all time, along with the highest-grossing for a female director. That pic was released by Warner Bros., rather than Universal, and is the highest-grossing in the studio's history. The film's award run culminated in eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, with Billie Eilish's “What Was I Made For?” winning Best Original Song.

Oscar-nominated “Minding the Gap” filmmaker Bing Liu takes his camera from Rockford, Illinois, to New York City with his narrative feature debut, “Preparation for the Next Life.” The Chinese-American doc-maker, who's worked as a camera assistant on fiction series and films, also uncannily follows in the footsteps of “Nickel Boys” director RaMell Ross in parallel fashion: Liu is adapting a novel (here a 2014 book by Atticus Lish), making the transition from docs to narratives, and also for Plan B, Amazon/MGM Studios, and Orion Pictures 

 










With a screenplay by Martyna Majok, the intimate immigrant romance follows an undocumented Uyghur woman (Sebiye Behtiyar) trying to eke out a life in New York City and escape the hardships she experienced in China. Working in the city's kitchens, Aishe tries to understand the language and reckon with her Muslim family history, having been trained by her military father. She falls in love with Skinner, a PTSD-scarred Iraq war veteran (rising star Fred Hechinger) who has just returned from three tours in the Middle East.

A key collaborator on the project, as Liu told IndieWire, was casting director Jennifer Venditti (“Uncut Gems,” “Euphoria,” “The Curse,” “The Rehearsal”), who discovered up-and-coming actor Behtiyar through a SCAD College of Art and Design acting showcase. 

“Jen Venditti is great because she's good at finding the unicorn kind of roles that are difficult to cast,” Liu said. Behtiyar's character needed to speak three different languages, and the actress was “in her first year of acting for grad school. She didn't go to undergrad for acting, and we saw her first self-tape, and it was just like, ‘Wow.' Sometimes, you just see somebody who just has something that's so watchable and magnetic, and that was very true of her. She has a hard time of not making it real, and so we recognized that right away.”

The film is produced by Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Adele Romanski, Mark Ceryak, and Barry Jenkins, with Brad Pitt, Sophia Lin, and Liu himself as executive producers.

Liu said when he encountered the 2014 book, “At the time, I was so surprised that there was this piece of literature going around town that had a Uyghur character in it,” he said, referring to the Turkic ethnic minority in China and throughout East and Central Asia. “Then I started digging into what her thread is in the book and it just eerily [paralleled] my mom's life story. My mom also immigrated over here [from China] and started working in Chinese restaurants. We were undocumented for a little while, and she had to choose whether or not to build a life with somebody [in the U.S.],” said Liu, whose family moved from China to the U.S. when he was five. 

 










“The themes of what it's about are so different from the immigrant narratives I've seen captured before,” Liu said. “There's something about the novel that gets beyond the socioeconomic…  [For the film,] the narrow tightrope I walked was: How do I represent this character's past in her continuation, in her relationship with her family and the place where she comes from, and at the same time, not just have a somewhat myopic view to filter through just the politics of the current moment,” he added, as the Uyghur  population has endured human rights abuses under Chinese authority and internment camps at the level of World War II, and rarely publicized in Western media.

Producer Jenkins, at the 2021 National Board of Review gala, championed Liu's work as the Best Documentary Feature-nominated director of “Minding the Gap” while denouncing an immigrant speech by Donald Trump (via Variety). The two knew each other, though, during the Mountainfilm Telluride Film Festival, where Jenkins was a jury member and now sits on the board. “I remember he was like, ‘Hey, we should talk. You should think about the narrative space.'”

Liu was told Jenkins was developing “Preparation for the Next Life” as a TV series, but he “went off to do something else. ‘Would you like to take over?' And that's when I came on.”

 










Prior to “Preparation for the Next Life,” Liu was attached to write and direct an adaptation of Ocean Vuong's novel “On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous,” about a queer Vietnamese American poet grappling with his lineage and personal traumas. That's not a project Liu is still working on, however. “I developed it for a couple years, and there were creative differences. I'm no longer going to be a part of the project.” IndieWire contacted A24 representatives, who had no comment, though we understand the company is still developing the Vuong adaptation without Liu.

“Preparation for the Next Life” opens in select theaters on September 5 — also the weekend after Telluride, which seems like the best bet for a fall festival launch. Check out more first look images, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

EXCLUSIVE: Good news for Warner Bros. Discovery, the theatrical release of James Gunn's Superman seems to be driving audiences to familiarize themselves with more DC offerings.


	Deadline understands that titles like Man of Steel, Superman: The Movie, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story and Peacemaker have all seen increased engagement on HBO Max since the latest film hit theaters on July 11.


	Reeves' first outing as the iconic superhero, Superman: The Movie, saw the biggest spike in viewership, up 332% week-over-week. But, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel was actually the top performing Superman film on the streamer last week, up 218% versus the week prior.

	











	The renewed interest in Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story was also quite impressive with a 1,206% lift week-over-week.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The DC series are also benefitting from the renewed buzz around Superman. Peacemaker saw a 91% increase in viewership last week for the first season — just in time for Season 2's August debut.


Superman flew to a $220M global opening in theaters as of Monday, fueled by a big domestic turnout. In an interview with Deadline, Gunn explained he took a “lighter” approach to the DC Comics superhero that gets back to “the color and the joy” of his origins.


	Since taking over DC Studios with Peter Safran in 2022, Gunn has been hard at work directing Superman, which kicks off his new DCU franchise with the ‘Gods and Monsters' phase. Superman stars David Corenswet in the titular role. In addition to Rachel Brosnahan as Lois, the cast also includes Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor and María Gabriela de Faría as The Engineer, as well as Skyler Gisondo, Sara Sampaio, Sean Gunn, Edi Gathegi, Anthony Carrigan, Isabel Merced and Nathan Fillion.

The co-headlining tour will include 13 shows in the U.S. and Canada starting in October.

	Katie Bain



	Kaytranada and Justice are going on a co-headlining North American arena tour this fall. 


	The 13-show run will launch on Oct. 17 in Vancouver, B.C., then hits arenas across the U.S. until it wraps in Miami, Fla., on Nov. 16. The run includes one currently unannounced show that's blurred out on the poster and is happening between an Oct. 22 in Oakland and an Oct. 28 show in San Diego. (One is tempted to speculate that this show will be in Los Angeles.)


	The co-headlining run follows Kaytranada's remix of Justice's “Neverender” that was released last October. The Tame Impala collab from the duo's 2024 album Hyperdrama won the Grammy for best dance/electronic recording and gave Justice its first ever radio No. 1 in February.

	On July 16, Justice also released a remix package of “Mannequin Love,” also from Hyperdrama, with fresh edits by The Dare, Braxe & Falcon and Hudson Mohawke. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	This autumn tour falls into the timeline Justice told Billboard about in March, when the duo's Gaspard Augé said the French duo would likely tour the lauded show debuted at Coachella 2024 this December. Following this, added Xavier de Rosnay, they'll likely “pick a date and then dismantle everything” related to the live production “so that there can't even be the temptation of saying yes to anything else.”

	











	Both artists also have plenty of solo tour dates on the calendar ahead of this fall run. Kaytranada's upcoming schedule including standalone shows and festival sets at events including HARD Summer and Breakaway Carolina and Justice's summer schedule including festivals primarily in Europe and Australia. 


	Tickets for the run go on sale on Friday, July 25.

Jared Leto is continuing being a franchise baddie. After starring as antihero Morbius in the MCU, plus playing the controversial WeWork founder, the actor is now joining the “Tron” digital universe as the titular villain of “Tron: Ares.” 

Joachim Rønning (“The Young Woman and the Sea”) directs the third franchise film, which is written by Jesse Wigutow and Jack Thorne (“Adolescence”). Original lead Jeff Bridges returns, with Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith, Greta Lee, Arturo Castro, Hasan Minhaj, Cameron Monaghan, and Gillian Anderson co-starring. The official synopsis reads: “‘Tron: Ares' follows a highly sophisticated program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with AI beings.”

The sci-fi franchise began in 1982 with Bridges playing a video game programmer who becomes trapped in the digital world. The sequel “Tron: Legacy” was released in 2010 with Garret Hedlund playing Bridges' onscreen son; Joseph Kosinski directed.

For the third film, director Rønning told Empire that he views the process of making “Tron: Ares” as the “the Holy Grail of computer graphics,” especially with the famed Grid becoming even more paramount to the plot. Rønning added that “Tron: Ares” will “elevate” the world and take it “to the next level,” especially due to the motion-controlled camera movements on The Grid. Rønning said he worked to have the camera shots designed as though the lens was being operated by machine. “The concept was that a program is filming a program,” the “Young Woman and the Sea” and “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” director said. “So it's shot by a robot.” 

Original “Tron” creator Steven Lisberger added to Empire that the franchise is all about pushing tech to the next level. “Something comes out, and it's too avant-garde at the time. And then the real world catches up with it,” Lisberger said. “[The Grid in ‘Tron'] has become a symbol of our riding this technology that is going faster than we ever imagined. We've integrated into it, and the speed of it is mind-boggling. And in ‘Ares,' it's a metaphor for the fact that this technology is moving through every part of our reality.”

“Tron: Ares” has a score by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The Grammy-winning band dropped the soundtrack album's first single, “As Alive As You Need Me To Be,” with the trailer. This is the first official music from the band in five years. (They recently have scored Luca Guadagnino‘s “Challengers,” “Queer,” and “After The Hunt”). The “Tron: Ares (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)” will be released on September 19 via Interscope Records.

 










“Tron: Ares” is produced by Leto, Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Emma Ludbrook, and Steven Lisberger, with Russell Allen serving as executive producer.

Disney will release “Tron: Ares” in theaters October 10. Check out the trailer below.

Lilly Wachowski's Anarchists United Foundation is making moves on the grant and fellowship front.


	The organization — co-founded by the Matrix co-filmmaker to address inequity in the entertainment industry across film and television — has revealed the recipients of three inaugural filmmaker grants totaling $60,000 as well as the fellows for its partnership in the Circle M+P x Anarchists United Writers Discovery Fellowship program. The founders of Anarchists United, Wachowski, Lawrence Mattis and Sarah Marie Flores, released a joint statement about the latest traction, offering that the team remains steadfast in the resolve to fight for their core values of “artistry, diversity and equity” as those morals are “currently under attack.”

	The inaugural grant winners include Stanley Kalu with the Anarchists United visionary filmmaker grant, Jennifer Reeder with the J.J. Ingram Chicago visionary filmmaker grant, and Marco Bermudez with the Anarchists United feature film incubator grant. Kalu previously won the Launch's Million Dollar Screenplay Competition for his work, The Obituary of Tunde Johnson, which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and Outfest. Reeder, a festival veteran, has directed Night's End, Perpetrator and Knives and Skin. Bermudez, a graduate of Columbia College Chicago's film program, wrote and directed the short Rey, which won a prize at the IndieFEST film awards.

	Industry veterans Steven Canals, J.D. Dillard, Cheryl Dunye, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jon Watts served on the selection committee and handpicked winners. “These three artists are breaking free from traditional constraints and paving the way for others to do the same,” Howard said in a statement. “The remarkable work they are doing both in front of and behind the camera, for themselves and their communities, is invaluable.”


	Back for a fifth installment, the Writers Discover Fellowship offers a space for six rising TV writers to hunker down courtesy of a six-month program designed to “nurture their creative talents and advance their careers in the industry.” It was launched in 2020 by Circle M+P, a firm formerly known as Circle of Confusion, and is now run by Anarchists United Foundation (with Isabella Garcia charged with managing day-to-day). The 2025 edition is sponsored by Kilter Films (Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan), Pageboy Productions (Elliot Page) and Paper Kite Productions (Amy Poehler). The six Writers Discovery fellows are K. Broch, who writes, produces and co-hosts the podcast, She Said…Let's! and writes and directs for the dating sketch comedy show, Single Riders Only; Quincy Cho, who works as a writers' assistant on Netflix's Sweet Magnolias and starred in the short Saverio; Jacy Duan, a graduate of Princeton University with degrees in sociology, theatre and Asian American Studies, who currently serves as the writers' assistant on Tracker; Sydney Laws, a writer and researcher from Atlanta who studied at USC's School of Cinematic Arts and shepherded projects like Kindred (FX) and Wicked (Hulu); Amir Mo, an alum of NBC's page program who specializes in “fish out of water commercial comedies”; and Sule Murray, a Chapman University graduate who now co-leads the school's NextGen alumni mentorship program.

The Queen of Rap has called the R&B hitmaker a "fake girl's girl" and a "clown" since their spat first began.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



SZA has responded to Nicki Minaj‘s latest flurry of posts insulting her, with the R&B hitmaker claiming that the Queen of Rap — who recently said that the “music business wouldn't even miss” SZA if she “vanished” — has previously asked to collaborate with her.


	About one day after Minaj first started taking shots at SZA via multiple messages on X, the latter chose one of the former's most recent snipes — in which the New York native calls SZA a “fake girl's girl” — and replied late Wednesday night (July 16): “Nicki … You absolutely know my music and what I contribute cause you've asked for features twice to no response.” 

	











	“In addition to rapping my lyrics on feeling myself ‘Cooking up the bass looking like a kilo'?” SZA continued. “Lol ur having a moment ..im not sure why but be blessed.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The singer also shared a screenshot of alleged texts between a member of her team and Minaj, who appears to say in the messages, “Is sza recording right now? Got this hook I think she would be dope on.”

	











Billboard has reached out to Minaj's rep for comment.


	SZA's response follows a number of new disses from Minaj, who has been sounding off about the vocalist on X since Tuesday (July 15). After assuming that SZA had been subtweeting her with a post reading, “Mercury retrograde .. don't take the bait lol silly goose,” the rapper wrote that her opponent was “ugly” and a “liar” who's been “looking & sounding like she got stung by a f–king bee.”


	Aside from her initial reply — “I don't give a f–k bout none of that weird s–t you popping” — the alleged text screenshot SZA shared marks the first time she's directly engaged with Minaj amid the debacle. Minaj, on the other hand, has continued her posting spree, at one point re-sharing a screenshot of SZA allegedly calling Minaj a “clown” in a years-old tweet.


	“Calling someone a clown while drawing freckles on your face & telling the magazine they were real,” Minaj wrote Wednesday. “Pretending that was your hair … Was Frecklina not one of YOUR ALTER EGO's SZA?!?!! Ain't kung fu Kenny an after ego Sza????! Didn't btchs take a knife to the face to get my NATURAL FACE MZA???? LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO. FKNG CLOWN SHOW.”


	“These be the fake girl's girls who talk s–t but will run u down for a photo or do s–t like this on camera to pretend they're not the hater they rlly are,” Minaj also griped in the post that SZA would later reply to with her screenshot, with the rapper sharing a video of the singer attempting to speak to Rihanna at the 2018 Met Gala. “I wonder what she was lying about to the interviewer. Man it's so freeing to REALLY be yourself.”


	Also on Wednesday, Minaj re-posted a video of fans allegedly leaving the Grand National Tour when SZA came out on stage, implying that they had only showed up for SZA's tourmate, Kendrick Lamar. “is that this ho tour or her bro tour,” Minaj taunted.

	











	Fans aren't exactly sure why the two women are beefing, other than Minaj's issues with Top Dawg Entertainment president Terrence “Punch” Henderson, who managed SZA up until late last year. SZA shared her post about mercury being in retrograde shortly after the rapper posted about Punch, which is why Minaj likely believed it to be a subtweet aimed at her. 


	Regardless of why they're clashing, Minaj probably won't be backing down any time soon. The rapper is notorious for feuding with other artists, from Megan Thee Stallion to Cardi B and Lil Kim.


	In the meantime, SZA is gearing up for her next string of shows with Lamar after playing two nights in Paris July 15-16. Their next stop on the Grand National trek — which recently broke the record for highest grossing co-headline tour ever reported to Billboard Boxscore — will be July 19 in Wales.

Early in their investigation into the death of an unidentified woman, ISB officer Kyle Turner (Eric Bana) and park ranger Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago) discover a few clues in an eerie abandoned shed. There's a bloody rope laying on the floor, a footprint on the door, and fresh carvings in the rickety wooden walls. Kyle bags the evidence, photographs the etchings, and the two exchange theories about what may have happened here. Then, as Naya heads back outside, a bear slams into the door. Naya falls down as the bear bangs on the thin wood separating it from its prey, roaring in sudden, vicious fury. She scrambles for her sidearm, but Kyle already has gun out. He fires two shots into the air, and the bear runs off.

Not long after that random disturbance, Kyle reminds his rookie colleague that her new gig isn't like any work she did in the big city. This is Yosemite National Park. It's the size of Rhode Island, all of which is their jurisdiction and 95 percent of which is designated wilderness. “This is not L.A.,” Kyle says. “Things happen different out here.”

That may be true, given how few bears go knocking door-to-door in Beverly Hills, but there isn't enough proof in “Untamed.” Netflix's new crime drama from creators Mark L. Smith (“American Primeval”) and Elle Smith drifts further and further away from its distinctive setting and circumstances across its six-episode story, just as it leans harder and harder on murder-mystery tropes that have all but exhausted their utility. By the end, “Untamed” can only offer more of the same, despite ample opportunity to provide something “different.”

Take our lead, Kyle (please). At first, he's a familiar detective type but one sporting enough signature characteristics to feel like his own person. He works for the Investigative Services Branch of the National Parks — a real department! — and his elevated status there allows him enough leeway to play the lone wolf. He can ride horseback (instead of driving a car), he can stew quietly (instead of brainstorming with a partner), and he can dictate his own hours (instead of punching a clock, like a chump). Whatever job security he has (which isn't much, given how often the suits yell at him) stems from his expertise in the lost art of tracking. And you know Kyle's a good tracker because of how often he pauses mid-stroll, stoops to the ground, and examines a suspicious marking.

 










But before the first episode is up, the balance between Kyle the archetype and Kyle the individual starts to fall apart. His buddy and pseudo-boss, Paul Souter (Sam Neill), smells bourbon on Kyle's breath — during his shift — which means, yes, our antihero has a drinking problem. Then he makes Naya, his young Hispanic colleague, pass a series of personal tests before he lends her the respect anyone should extend to a nice coworker who's only trying to help. And, of course, he spends his nights drunk-dialing his ex-wife, Jill (Rosemarie Dewitt), who's just trying to get a decent night's sleep next to her nice new hubby.

Kyle's after-hours phone calls aren't rooted in anything as simple as lingering feelings for his lost love. They stem from a fact “Untamed” treats like a twist, but when the turn arrives at the end of Episode 1, it induces groans over gasps. Worse still, his “surprise” backstory knocks Kyle off his horse, so to speak — saddling him with too many tropes for one man to balance. 

Bana embodies Kyle's suffocating cliches with endearing commitment, his gravelly voice, gentle countenance, and steadfast capability combining to form a recognizable portrait of pride and suffering. But there's too little time for Bana's performance to deepen or subvert his defining traits, especially as the central case piles on its own stale patterns. 

 










In the series' sole thrilling sequence, a pair of mountain climbers are sent spinning when a body falls from the cliff's edge above them and gets tangled in their ropes. As an opening scene, it's dizzying and disturbing (nor does it treat the nameless mountaineers as expendable dumb-dumbs). But it also cuts away at the peak of their predicament — with one climber dangling beneath the other, hundreds of feet in the air, a corpse caught in between them — in order to shift the focus to more mundane circumstances, aka the investigation we're meant to care about more than anything save for the characters doing the investigating. 

A dead girl. A depressed cop with daddy issues. Can our hero solve the mystery of her death and maybe, just maybe, save his own life in the process? “Untamed” dares to ask the same questions as “Mare of Easttown,” “Happy Valley,” “True Detective,” and dozens of other cop dramas just like them, only not as clearly or convincingly. (Kyle's sheen of integrity gets pretty cloudy after the final twist.) It also a stretches a movie premise to the length of a miniseries, but what's more frustrating is that “Untamed” doesn't add anything distinguishing to the mix, despite an enticing ingredient sitting right there, largely ignored, in the massive form of Yosemite itself.

 










“Untamed” could've been a serviceable genre exercise, allowing the audience to play cowboy in the great outdoors while enjoying the sturdy structure of a modern crime show. But as Kyle and Naya get closer to the truth, they get further away from their natural reality. There's no tactile joy to dress up the rudimentary chase — no random rainstorms ripping through camp, no snowy mountaintops on summer days, no campfires, no canoe trips, no sense of the wild. On the rare occasion when the series tries to incorporate the perils of the park, the staging is unconvincing and the results are predictable.

The bear never returns, and neither does the difference it made.

“Untamed” premieres Thursday, July 17 on Netflix. All six episodes will be released at once.

The tour kicked off to a sold-out crowd at the T-Mobile Arena.


													By
												

	Joe Lynch


Executive Digital Director


	We're lucky Lady Gaga changed her mind about touring in 2025.


	Her headlining (and headline-making) Coachella performance and Singapore dates were initially intended as her only touring dates for 2025. But after the wild response to her new album Mayhem — which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200; earned Gaga her biggest-ever streaming week; and housed “Die With a Smile,” her Bruno Mars duet which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks and is still in the top 10 — Gaga reconsidered.


	Thank Gaga. The Mayhem Ball – which kicked off Wednesday (July 16) at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada (basically Las Vegas) — is a theatrical, electric and delicious live affair, offering fans charged performances of Mayhem's best songs (some of which are among her all-time best) and previous dance classics that inhabit the same sonic and thematic universe. The tour's opening night was for a sold-out crowd, and despite the 99-degree heat outside the arena walls, everyone was ready to throw down the moment Mother Monster took the stage.


	“This is my first arena tour since 2018,” said Gaga in a statement when she announced the tour in March. “There's something electric about a stadium, and I love every moment of those shows. But with The MAYHEM Ball, I wanted to create a different kind of experience — something more intimate — closer, more connected — that lends itself to the live theatrical art I love to create.”


	Below, check out the nine best moments from the opening night of Lady Gaga's The Mayhem Ball. (And if you want to eyeball the setlist, head here.)


	After a pre-show that found opera arias soundtracking texted-in testimonials from fans about their love for Mother Monster, Gaga hit the stage for the same awe-inspiring sequencing of songs that opened Coachella: “Bloody Mary” atop a gigantic red dress hoop that opened to reveal caged dancers; an unhinged “Abracadabra”; a jolt of “Judas”; and the sexy kitschy of “Scheiße.” Throughout it all, Gaga demonstrates how her legit acting chops enhance a pop performance, with her body language effortlessly transitioning from imperious formality to controlled chaos to slinky vamping.


	Although she stepped away from it for a minute in the late 2010s, Gaga is blessedly back to bringing the arthouse theatricality to pop culture. “Welcome to Mayhem,” she intoned in a German-accented voice early in the show. “Welcome to the opera house. This is my house.” Craning her head, Gaga sized up a dancer next to her wearing an outfit that called to mind a Gaga of yesteryear: “What are you doing in my house?!” Amid a thrilling “Poker Face” performance that mined the vibes of the Queen of Hearts' chess game, Gaga faux executed the dancer (“off with her head!”). After the song, you could actually hear her breathing — a nice reminder that when Gaga sings on stage, she genuinely sings live.


	For Mayhem standout “Perfect Celebrity,” Gaga brought back the inventive, creepy staging from Coachella. Situated in a giant sandbox full of skeletons, Gaga, in a wispy white dress, opens the song with her arm draped casually around the human remains. One song later (“Disease”), the skeletons around her have come to life, emerging from the desert sands as bone-encased backup dancers. Hey, it worked the first time: as long as the cats haven't found that supersized litter box, why change anything?




	While much of the Mayhem Ball is boosted by her crackling live band and energetic coterie of dancers, “Paparazzi” demonstrates how well Gaga can turn the simplest of stage movements into an engrossing visual story. Inching her way down the runway on platinum clutches (the same silvery look she rocked in the iconic video), Gaga croons and belts the ode to toxic media-celebrity symbiosis while a gauzy white train billows behind her (it's all very evocative of Cyd Charisse in the famous Singin' In the Rain fantasy sequence), eventually exploding into a rainbow glow. As the crowd-pleasing classic comes to a close, Gaga strikes a muscular pose, looking every bit the pop music Valkyrie as she descends into the stage.


	Equal parts Alice Cooper and Hammer Horror, “Killah” sees Gaga wearing regal Gothic opulence while letting loose in front of a ridiculously large spinning skull. That song is one of the album's most durable highlights, and the Mayhem Ball staging gives Gaga the chance to get funky and freaky, spinning down the runway before unleashing a hellish, prolonged scream into the rafters. When the banshee wail was over, Gaga let her stage character crack – for a moment, you could see how much fun she was having, and it was a beautiful thing to behold.


	Of the numerous Mayhem Ball songs Coachella viewers didn't experience, it's hard to pick a favorite. But, to name a few: “Applause” was greeted with a thunderous peal of exactly that (fans were clearly thrilled to hear ARTPOP represented), and “Summerboy,” which saw Gaga jamming on guitar while surrounded by a sweaty, tangled mess of gyrating bodies, was an unexpected treat. But “Million Reasons” might have been the most revelatory, with Gaga turning the rather stately ballad into a confrontational showdown between herself and an avatar of her past self.


	Gaga gave us solo “Shallow” belted out from a small, curved Viking ship, with an H.R. Giger-esque spine running the length of the boat and a human skull on the masthead. Then, it was time for her latest Hot 100-topping ballad, “Die With a Smile,” which she performed seated at an unusual, intricate upright piano made from sumptuous wood (it brought to mind the inventive, impractical instruments Lombard craftsmen made in Italy during the Renaissance).That song got one of the biggest responses of the night, with the crowd's sing-alongs on the chorus easily making up for the absence of duet partner Bruno Mars.


	“Little Monsters never die!” Gaga exclaims, rising from a wheeled-in gurney before delivering the penultimate song, “Bad Romance.” It's hard to one-up the original “Bad Romance” fit, but damn, this look was memorable, with Gaga brandishing long, branch-like fingers and rocking a hairpiece that curled up into two animalesque ears — almost splitting the difference between the hot dog fingers from Everything Everywhere All at Once and Nick Bottom in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.


	For the encore, Gaga stripped it down, wiping away the makeup, hanging up the high-fashion costumes and returning to the stage in nothing but shades, a black beanie and a Cramps t-shirt to sing “How Bad Do You Want Me.” It was clearly a victory lap for Mother Monster, who dropped the dramatic pretenses and simply allowed herself to exist as a human on a stage, running around with casual glee and beaming massive smiles to the folks in the back rows. “Before I came on stage tonight, I couldn't even believe you were here for me,” Gaga admitted earlier that evening of some pre-show nerves. By the encore, those doubts were clearly banished, with Gaga rightfully relishing the joy she brought to her throngs of devotees.

Things have changed a lot since Star Trek: Strange New Worlds aired its cliffhanger season-two finale back in August 2023. Discovery and Lower Decks both wrapped up with their fifth and final seasons, and Strange New Worlds now has an end date in sight too. Paramount+ announced that the series would also be ending with its fifth season—news that understandably sent some fans into a spiral. But things aren't quite as bleak as they seem.

For one thing, before we get to that shortened six-episode final season, we've got two full 10-episode ones to get through. Seasons three and four were basically shot back-to-back, with production on the final batch of episodes set to begin later this year. That means we're in for a nice steady run of 26 episodes to send out this sunny series on a high note.

For another, more so than any other Trek show, Strange New Worlds has always been building toward a set endpoint. Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) has known his fiery future since he set foot on the Enterprise for his final five-year mission. And ever since the show introduced Paul Wesley's James T. Kirk in its first-season finale, Strange New Worlds has embraced an Avengers-style subplot about seeing the crew of the 1960s original series come together too. Martin Quinn's Montgomery Scott joined at the end of last season, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get a Sulu or even a (slightly timeline bending) Chekov before this one is over. (It feels like Bones has to be last, right?) 

Where a lot of Trek shows are about limitless potential, Strange New Worlds has always been a true prequel running on limited time. And, in a way, I think knowing things are ending is only going to make the final run of episodes that much stronger. True, I suspect that if the show knew it would be taking a two-year strike-induced delay between its second and third seasons, it probably wouldn't have ended on a cliffhanger. (It's crazy to think there were only three months between the Locutus of Borg twist and its resolution in Next Gen's “The Best Of Both Worlds.”) But I suspect that's part of the reason we're getting a two-episode premiere this week. Strange New Worlds has a Gorn invasion storyline to wrap up, but it also wants to remind us how much episodic fun it can have too (especially when paying homage to Trek history.)

To that end, “Hegemony, Part II” opens with the sort of big impressive space battle that has become a hallmark of Alex Kurtzman-era Trek. There's nothing like playing chicken with a Gorn ship to kick off a season. Immediate crisis averted, there are three dangling problems for the intrepid Enterprise crew to work through after their terrifying experience on the mid-century-inspired human colony Parnassus Beta. And each allows the show to embrace a slightly different tone for a different set of Strange New World characters. 

On the medical-drama side, Pike's girlfriend Captain Marie Batel (Melanie Scrofano) has been infected with Gorn eggs that will hatch in less than a day. On the action-movie front, security chief La'An Noonien-Singh (Christina Chong), Dr. Joseph M'Benga (Babs Olusanmokun), helmsman Erica Ortegas (Melissa Navia), and xenoanthropologist Samuel Kirk (Dan Jeannotte) have been taken aboard a Gorn ship to be harvested. And in the political-thriller arena, the Gorn have drawn a line of demarcation that could be the start of an all-out war if the Federation doesn't handle the situation correctly—something Pike, first officer Una Chin-Riley (Rebecca Romijn), and communications officer Nyota Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding) tackle while leading the Enterprise on an “off-the-record” rescue mission into Gorn space. 

It's a setup that feels like a statement of purpose about how the show wants to tackle its storytelling moving forward. While Strange New Worlds' second season was filled with high points (I'm still smiling thinking about the Lower Decks crossover episode), it also sometimes felt like a selection of special, high-concept character episodes strung together rather than a true ensemble show. “Hegemony, Part II,” however, gives everyone a chance to shine by pairing them up in clever ways—from Scotty's funny but also quietly heartbreaking dynamic with his ageless former engineering professor Pelia (Carol Kane) to Spock (Ethan Peck) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Jess Bush) going full Grey's Anatomy melodrama in the sick bay. 

My favorite is actually the La'An/M'Benga/Ortegas/Sam quartet just because it's so unexpected. I feel like there are characters in that group we've barely seen interact before, but thrusting them together into a high-stakes escape mission highlights both what they bring to the table as individuals and how Starfleet's collaborative nature allows any set of the Enterprise crew to work in harmony. La'An and M'Benga provide the badass quotient, while Ortegas and Sam bring the comedic relief. And their dedication to saving the rest of the trapped colonists gives appropriately Star Trek-y stakes to their fight against the first true adult Gorn we've seen in the series. (No rubber masks in sight!) Even in their greatest moments of trauma, the Enterprise crew are still thinking about others—like Ortegas fighting through her life-threatening injuries to fly her friends to safety. 

Indeed, part of the joy of any Star Trek show is watching how a crew of people with very different skillsets and expertise come together to handle a crisis. That's what happens when Pike realizes that Una and Uhura's research into Gorn hibernation/hunting patterns could be the key to stopping a full-on armada invasion of Federation space. His plan involves Scotty and Pelia turning the ship into an artificial star that will trigger the Gorn to, well, go to sleep instead of going to war (thus leaving the Gorn as a future problem for Kirk to tackle in “Arena”). It's a perfect example of science, strategy, engineering, and a little hope—plus some modifying of the deflector shields, of course—solving the problem the Starfleet way. 

More than anything, “Hegemony, Part II” is an episode about relying on faith to get you through seemingly impossible odds. (“We'll just turn it off before we blow up,” Pike only half-jokes.) And while you could imagine a different version of this episode that lets at least one thing go wrong (particularly Spock and Chapel's improvisational surgery on Batel), it feels right that a big splashy premiere lets our heroes win on every front. There will presumably be days when the Enterprise can't do it all. But that's not this day. And though the resolution to the Gorn invasion is perhaps a little anticlimactic, especially given how they've been built up over the show's run, the balance of character storylines is really impressive—and I'd argue that matters even more. 

It helps that “Wedding Bell Blues” lightens things up without totally forgetting about the fallout of the Gorn defeat. The episode jumps three months into the future, which gives the Enterprise and its crew a chance to heal up (and get some new hairdos). The time jump also gives Nurse Chapel the chance to return from her archeological medicine fellowship with her new boyfriend Dr. Roger Korby (Cillian O'Sullivan) in tow. And thus begins this season's signature Spock comedy episode—a grand tradition that has so far given us the fiancé body swap in season one and the Spock-becomes-human twist in season two. 

As with the premiere, however, there is a real ensemble focus here. It's not just Spock who gets in on the hijinks this week. The crew is abuzz ahead of the Federation Day Centennial and the gala Pike is throwing to celebrate it. La'An ballroom dances! Uhura flirts with Ortegas' filmmaker little brother Beto (Mynor Luken)! The sick bay adds an adorable new nurse (Chris Myers)! Everybody wears fashion-forward civilian clothes! The Enterprise gets a three-armed bartender! 

Compared to all that, Spock's arc is downright dramatic at first, as he basically lives through the Joseph Gordon-Levitt plot of (500) Days Of Summer—watching the non-committal woman he thought he could win over instead get serious with someone else. But that all changes when an impish bartender (Rhys Darby styled like Trelane, the all-powerful 19th century fanboy from the original series episode “The Squire Of Gothos”) pours him a drink that seems to port him over to an alternate universe where Spock and Chapel are getting married. 

I'll get to the Trek canon of it all in a minute, but the most interesting choice “Wedding Bell Blues” makes is to turn this into a two-hander for the men in Chapel's life. Though I was expecting Spock to be shocked waking up next to Chapel, at first it's only Korby who realizes this isn't an alternate timeline but a mass delusion cast over all the guests at the gala. Once he's able to snap Spock out of the spell (“Oh no,” Peck deadpans), they're forced to team up—and match raised eyebrows—to get things back to normal. 

It's not totally dissimilar from when M'Benga and Hemmer were the only two people who realized something was amiss when the Enterprise turned into a children's fairy tale back in season one. Only here there's a much more compelling reason for Spock and Korby to be paired together. This isn't an episode about Chapel choosing between the two men—she's already made that choice. But it is an episode about Spock coming to understand what Chapel sees in Korby, who's devoted, pragmatic, funny, and relatably exacerbated throughout the whole madcap experience. (As in his brief role on Daredevil: Born Again, O'Sullivan has an insane amount of onscreen charisma.) 

With its focus on canapés and bachelor parties, “Wedding Bell Blues” mostly keeps things in goofy Father Of The Bride comedy mode rather than delving too deep into its character work. But it makes Korby seem like a likable, worthy partner for Chapel—even for the Spock/Chapel ‘shippers out there. And it's genuinely heartbreaking to watch Spock break the spell by repeating the Pablo Neruda poetry he knows will remind Chapel of her love for Korby. There's always been a slight note of self-sacrifice to Spock (even before we get his literal self-sacrifice in Wrath Of Khan). And “Wedding Bell Blues” emphasizes that understated character trait within an over-the-top comedic setting. He comes to understand that Korby has an inner confidence and calmness that lets him serve as a safe harbor for Chapel in a way that Spock just can't be right now.

It's also a really nice touch to bring everything back to Spock and La'An—both because it returns to their newfound ballroom dancing partnership and because we know she experienced a similar kind of heartbreak in the musical episode, when Kirk revealed he's dating a pregnant Carol Marcus. Spock and La'An know what it's like to feel a connection that doesn't work out because of bad timing. (“It's no one's fault,” as Chapel puts it.) And their burgeoning friendship is another lovely example of Strange New Worlds mixing up its ensemble in unexpected new ways this season. 

As for the cause of all that wedding chaos? It seems like Strange New Worlds might be tying two of its iconic all-powerful imps together. Like “The Squire Of Gothos,” this episode ends with a glowing parental orb showing up to chastise a peevish child. Only this one is voiced by John de Lancie, who's always said his performance as the all-powerful Next Gen antagonist Q was inspired by William Campbell's work as the similarly puckish Trelane. Q actually also had a son on Voyager, who popped up in petulant-teen form in the episode “Q2.” So this episode could be saying that Darby is literally Trelane who's also literally Q Junior. (He does get to deliver Trelane's iconic catchphrases “Tallyho!” and “Greetings and felicitations.”) Or maybe it's just operating as a fun homage. Nobody gets named, and Darby disguises himself to the crew so there's plausible deniability on all fronts. But, honestly, with all the Godlike Beings who popped up in the original series, why couldn't one of them have been a Q?

Regardless, Darby has an absolute blast chewing the scenery, and the de Lancie voice cameo is a lovely celebration of the franchise's long, winding history. In their own ways, “Hegemony, Part II” and “Wedding Bell Blues” are both optimistic episodes that serve as a welcome reminder of what Strange New Worlds does best. (And by that I mean having the whole cast dance to “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,” of course.) The final shot emphasizing Ortegas' Gorn-related PTSD suggests this season won't just be warm and fuzzy. In fact, anybody who remembers Roger Korby's role in the original-series episode “What Are Little Girls Made Of?” already knows that. But, for now, Strange New Worlds is here to remind us just how much fun it is to spend time with this crew. That's a great way to kick off this second half of the show's run. As Pike might say—hit it.

	In July 2024, die-hard Dodgers fans and groups of teens and young adults wearing colorful shirts, emblazoned with names like Mori Calliope and Gawr Gura poured into the Dodgers Stadium. While some had come to watch America's favorite pastime, others waited with bated breath, eyes on the digital screens set up around the arena — eager to see a diminutive anime girl with white hair and shark teeth appear. Bobbing around on screen, singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game,” this virtual idol was the first introduction for many in the stands to the concept of VTubers.


	VTubers, or Virtual YouTubers, are not a new phenomenon, but have grown in popularity during Covid-19. On a basic level, they're just like any other creator on channels like YouTube or Twitch, generally hosting variety streams and playing video games while interacting with their fans. The main difference is that VTubers appear as customized 2D or 3D avatars, often concealing their identities in lieu of fictional personas that audiences connect with.

	











	VTubers across all regions have gained some recognition among international audiences. Gawr Gura, a fictional descendant from the Lost City of Atlantis, broke into the mainstream through her success streaming gameplay and releasing original music on YouTube before retiring in May 2025. Usada Pekora, a fictional rabbit girl, was nominated for Content Creator of the Year at The Game Awards in 2024 for her erratic and high energy gaming content, and has since appeared in this year's hit PlayStation title Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Perhaps the most well known is variety streamer Ironmouse, a virtual demon queen who briefly overtook massively popular creator Kai Cenat as the most subscribed streamer on Twitch.

	All of these content creators have something in common — they embody fantastical personalities via anime-esque avatars that blink and move and emote in sync with the real person behind them. As rising stars of digital media, each has also signed to talent agencies to facilitate collaborations between virtual entertainers and brands. And while virtual idols have found massive success in Asia, they've recently become more prominent in the West. In turn, agencies are eager to take hold of a new captive audience, striking while the iron is hot to lead a new generation of influencer into a booming market.

	There are dozens of VTuber talent agencies in operation, but three currently reign supreme: North America's VShojo, and the Japan-based pair of NIJISANJI and Cover Corp. (whose subsidiary Hololive primarily manages its VTuber clients). Each brings to the table a different roster of creators looking to break through into the mainstream sphere of entertainment, leading VTubing's influence to grow substantially worldwide. 


	In 2024, Cover Corp. solidified its presence in the Western market with their first North American branch. Now, the three agencies are competing for major shares of the VTuber space where other smaller agencies have tried and failed. It's a big move for Japanese corporations like Cover Corp. and NIJISANJI, as many Japanese talent agencies, such as the widely popular and infamous Johnny's & Associates (that represent your more traditional, in-the-flesh idol), have remained focused solely on their domestic fan base, with no real consideration given to a broader, more international audience.


	But VShojo, founded in 2020, doesn't seem to mind that Hololive is encroaching upon its territory — at least according to CEO Justin “TheGunrun” Ignacio. Ignacio was one of the founding members of Twitch, and after the platform blew up, he decided to pivot to the burgeoning VTuber trend with the creation of VShojo. Having become a fan of the culture on the platform he helped launch, it felt like a natural fit. “Our competition are people that I love,” Ignacio tells Rolling Stone.

	With VShojo, Ignacio leaned into what he and his team excelled at, building on the experience of creating his own live streaming backpacks in 2018 to expand his ideas on what VTubing could be. “For me, it was kind of like, ‘How do we bring VTubers to real life using this bonded LTE technology?,'” Ignacio says.

	











	Utilizing IRL streaming kits, VShojo provided a new way for fans to interact with VTubers like Ironmouse through the use of iPads and digital displays for on-location meet-and-greets at events like Anime Expo. While VTubers are entirely virtual creations, the ideas pioneered by Ignacio's agency have allowed them to have an in-person presence at conventions and awards shows that mirror what regular creators and online personalities can offer. It's now possible for fans to say they've met Ironmouse, even if it's just interacting with a tablet on wheels. 


	Ignacio's background in streaming technology has been a boon for VShojo, allowing the agency to lean into their core strengths. “We know what we're good at, and we know what we want to get better at, and we want to lean into that while making sure our creators, our talents, are able to communicate what success looks like for them and are we aligned to build that out,” Ignacio says. It's a sentiment shared by VShojo's direct competition, Cover Corp.


	Cover Corp. was founded in 2013 by CEO Motoaki “Yagoo” Tanigo, an entrepreneur who'd previously found success in working with Sanrio and Japanese company, Imagineer. It was his experience in that realm that led him to form Cover Corp. in the first place, dipping his toes in the experimental world of VR before founding Hololive, now the largest Japanese VTuber talent agency in the world. Unlike VShojo, Hololive has taken a more traditional approach to this model, expecting their virtual stars to speak multiple languages, sing, and dance on-stage in live performances — just like any other Japanese idol — albeit via motion capture that's displayed on giant screens.


	In 2024, Cover Corp. established its first official North American branch to capitalize on its roster of English speaking talent, with the L.A. Dodgers collaboration serving as the first step in establishing Hololive's presence in the United States. “One of our missions for opening Cover USA is to create more opportunities for our English speaking talents,” Tanigo says. Having an office in North America would allow for the Japanese talent agency to properly support its overseas English-speaking talents like Ouro Kronii, Mori Calliope, and Ninomae Ina'nis, instead of churning out new VTubers, Cover Corp. can foster support and greater opportunities within the Western region. 

	











	This expansion wouldn't be possible without Hololive's massive fanbase in both North America and Europe. While Hololive is indeed the largest VTuber talent agency within its home market, a majority of its revenue, estimated to be 1.57 billion yen (or around $10.8 million) in Q3 of 2025 based on the company's financial reports, comes from merchandise. “Streaming revenue [for Hololive] only makes up about 25 percent of revenue. The rest comes from merchandise, licensing, promotions, and other types of business components. Having a U.S. branch allows for us to focus on that B-to-B collaboration and will help bring us into the next stage and will expand our recognition in this market,” Tanigo states.


	Ignacio views Hololive's North American arrival as a good thing for the industry at large, more or less cementing the mainstream success of VTubers in the entertainment space. “It was like you'd see VTubers in more of a Japanese cultural context and now it's here at this scale,” Ignacio says. “Like at the Dodgers game, or at The Game Awards. We're not locked into what people have categorized us as. I love that. And I want us to be part of that story.” 


	While CEOs like Ignacio and Tanigo are happy about the rapid growth of their industry, there's still a ways to go for VTubers breaking into popular culture. Mori Calliope, one of the first generation of creators signed to Hololive English (a Western-focused subsidiary in Hololive), feels as though the “Golden Age” of VTubers has yet to arrive. “I'd give it five to 10 years,” she says. While the appearance of Hololive talent at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 2024 certainly spurred interest in the brand, she thinks it's a good step, but isn't quite enough to kick off mainstream appeal.


	“Unless [something] unprecedented happens, like if one of the top five pop stars in America collaborated with a VTuber talent, then I could see a much steeper incline for VTubers to break into the mainstream,” Calliope says. As one of Hololive's most popular talents, and the vocalist behind Warner Bros. Suicide Squad anime end credits, her hope is to one day collaborate with artists like Megan Thee Stallion or The Gorillaz. Calliope attributes a lot of her success to Cover Corp. providing support behind the scenes in helping her pursue dreams as a musician. “I'm extremely grateful to Hololive, I feel like I wouldn't be the person I am without them. I feel like my heart is stronger and that my dreams are clearer,” Calliope says.

	











	And while her production team did broach the idea of her performing at Coachella, Calliope didn't feel like it would be a good fit — instead looking for something that more or less aligned with her own interests, pursuing smaller venues like the Hollywood Palladium for her solo concert, “Grimoire.” However, VTubers are inching closer to what Calliope feels as a significant moment within the industry, with VShojo talent Ironmouse collaborating with musician bbno$ during one of his performances, with the song subsequently released to various streaming platforms some weeks after.

	As more VTubers begin to cross the continental divide, the industry's future is looking bright. Earlier this month, Hololive followed up with a second collaboration with the Dodgers, which is a good indicator to fans that the momentum is just picking up. What was once a fairly niche form of entertainment now shares the stage at major sporting events, venues like Radio City Music Hall or the Hollywood Palladium, and annual events like The Game Awards. 


	It's official, VTubers have breached containment — and they're coming to some of the biggest screens near you.

Colin Farrell is partnering with Oscar winner Edward Berger for Netflix feature “Ballad of a Small Player.” The recent Emmy nominee stars as a high-stakes gambler whose past debts catch up with him. 

Berger recently directed the popular “Conclave” and first helmed history-making “All Quiet on the Western Front.” Fala Chen, Deanie Ip, Alex Jennings, and Tilda Swinton also star in “Ballad of a Small Player,” which is adapted from Lawrence Osborne's novel. Rowan Joffe (“The American,” “Brighton Rock”) wrote the script.

The synopsis reads: “When his past and his debts start to catch up with him, a high-stakes gambler laying low in Macau encounters a kindred spirit who might just hold the key to his salvation.”

Berger, Mike Goodridge, and Matthew James Wilkinson produce the feature, which was announced in April 2024. Berger will next direct Brad Pitt in another novel adaptation, this time for Tim Winton's “The Riders.” The “Bones and All” scribe David Kajganich, who's also writing the Zendaya-led Ronnie Spector biopic “Be My Baby” for A24, will adapt the book. “The Riders” follows Fred Scully (Pitt), who, after traveling Europe with his wife, Jennifer, and seven-year-old daughter, Billie, purchases a farmhouse in rural Ireland. Jennifer and Billie then return to Australia to finalize their affairs, only for Billie to return to Ireland alone after traveling across the globe, with Jennifer now missing. Fred is left to make sense of his wife's disappearance in a story that takes a mystical turn. A24 landed the film after a competitive situation, as IndieWire can share. 

 










The feature is a reunion for Berger and producer Ridley Scott: Kajganich brought the novel to Scott‘s Scott Free banner more than a decade ago, while Berger worked with Scott Free TV on AMC's “The Terror” with creator Kajganich.

Meanwhile, “Ballad of a Small Player” lead Farrell is starring in “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” opposite Margot Robbie, and might return for a possible “The Penguin” Season 2.  “The Penguin” recently received a slew of Emmy nominations, although a Season 2 has yet to be set at HBO Max. 

Netflix will premiere “Ballad of a Small Player” later this year. Check out the first look below.

							By 

	Tessa Stuart



	Since Donald Trump's crushing defeat of Kamala Harris in November, Democrats have agonized over their loss. Manifestos have been published, podcasts launched, summits held — all in the name of trying to figure out how to win back the voters Democrats lost last year.


	But new research suggests the prevailing wisdom that has guided those efforts — the idea that Democrats tacked too far to the left last year — might be, well, wrong.


	The polling, conducted by Democratic pollster Celinda Lake on behalf of the progressive donor network Way to Win, indicates that, contrary to Beltway groupthink, these voters would have preferred someone more progressive than Harris. According to Lake, the Americans who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and sat out the 2024 election generally hold a favorable view of Democrats, they believe inequality is at the heart of the country's problems and health care should be available to everyone who needs it, and they want candidates committed to fighting for that vision. 

	











	Perhaps unsurprisingly, the politicians most popular among the voters polled were the ones who have long campaigned on making health care accessible to all, and making billionaires pay their fair share: Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) were far and away the favorite candidates of voters polled. Seventy eight percent of those polled held favorable views of Sanders, and 64 percent had favorable views of AOC. Governors Gavin Newsom (Calif.) and Gretchen Whitmer (Mich.) also polled reasonably well among these voters, earning favorability ratings 60 and 50 percent, respectively.

	











	“The conventional wisdom is really wrong on these voters,” Lake tells Rolling Stone. “They're very clear about what they want and what they thought was missing in 2024: They want leaders who will fight for everyone… They're very health care-oriented…They want to crack down on Big Pharma… They're very populist. They have a clear economic agenda around affordability and making the wealthy pay what they owe in taxes.”

	Perhaps most critically, Lake adds: “You can't get these voters by just being against things. You have to be for something… You have to be offering solutions… And you have to be standing up and fighting.”


	Previously publicized voter file data indicated that millions of voters who cast votes for Biden in 2020 failed to appear at the polls to back his vice president four years later. Lake Research Partners polled 822 registered voters in battleground states who matched that profile, and what they found was that those voters are more liberal, and more plugged into the news, than many of the loudest pundits and prognosticators have assumed. 


	The most common answer given by these voters for why they didn't vote is because they “didn't like either candidate” and felt like they were being forced to choose between “the lesser of two evils.” When asked about specific policies, the most frequently cited reason these voters gave for not voting for Harris was because she failed to adequately address their economic concerns, like the cost of living and the scourge of income inequality. 


	Asked about the policies that would motivate them to cast a vote for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, an overwhelming majority — 62 percent — of these voter said they would be “very likely” to back a Democrat who made securing affordable health care for those who need it the centerpiece of their campaign. The same share of voters said they would vote for a candidate determined to make the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. 


	Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, a co-founder and chief strategy officer at Way to Win, says that the Biden drop-off voters, based on the polling, appear to be “uniquely winnable — and a key element to building back a more sustainable Democratic coalition, which is what we have to do.”

	“The whole entire Republican agenda under this new Trump regime is truly an opportunity for Democrats to go on offense,” she says.

	Ancona notes these voters' “top issue is affordable health care,” so Democrats should have a “golden opportunity” right now. Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law on July 4, will once again slash taxes for the ultra-wealthy, and do so while punishing the poor. Roughly 17 million Americans are expected to lose their health insurance as a result of the law, combined with Republicans' refusal to extend subsidies for marketplace coverage.

	











	These voters are “really ready,” Ancona says, “for messaging to go on offense against what the Republicans are doing — whether it's cutting health care that hurts children, giving billionaires more tax giveaways, doing absolutely nothing to cut costs.”

	When Lady Gaga turned Coachella into a cathedral of chaos in April, Rolling Stone hailed it as the “performance of a lifetime.” With the launch of her Mayhem Ball tour in Las Vegas Wednesday night, Gaga didn't just revisit that show — she expanded it, sharpened it, sprinkled in some nostalgia, and fully realized the gothic dream she had only just introduced.


	Thematically, the Mayhem Ball tour followed the same through line as Coachella and the one-off Mayhem shows in Mexico City, Rio De Janeiro and Singapore earlier this year: It captures Gaga's internal strife, with her light side (an angelic, innocent Gaga with blonde hair and curls) facing off with her darkness (dark reds and vampy, gothic energy).


	Most of the first act remained consistent with the earlier Mayhem shows, with Gaga taking the stage atop a three-story dress, though it opted for a more operatic version of Born This Way's “Bloody Mary,” which seamlessly transitioned into Mayhem centerpiece “Abracadabra.” The act focused on the “lady in red” dark side of Gaga she sings about on that song, as she presented herself at the center of the stage — an adapted, more intimate version of what she used at Coachella. For the first three songs, including a crowd-favorite performance of “Judas,” it seemed Gaga might deliver the same, or nearly identical, set fans had seen before. But to the surprise of many in the crowd (myself included), she slipped in a remix of Artpop favorite “Aura,” a nod to fans who've long begged her to resurrect tracks from what they consider her most overlooked album. It was just a taste of the deep cuts and fan-honoring she had for fans — and Artpop finally found some justice.

	For songs like “Scheiße” (sung from a Last Supper–esque table), “Perfect Celebrity” (performed from inside a pit of sand surrounded by skulls) and “Poker Face” (during which she faced off against the “good” version of herself), the choreography and staging remained unchanged from what fans had seen before. If it ain't broke, Gaga knows better than to fix it.

	What Gaga did in many moments, however, was enhance what had been seen before: She added elements to outfits with more intricate leotards and capes, and in others, the show incorporated new lighting effects and pyrotechnics that wouldn't translate on a festival stage. While at Coachella, she waltzed with skeletons; here she danced in a larger-than-life gothic black dress in front of a gigantic skull, before playing Mayhem's “LoveDrug” for the first time live while strutting down a spiral staircase. During “Paparazzi,” where Gaga stepped onto the stage in a metallic cape and armor while on crutches, a rainbow flag lighted up on her miles-long cape as she delivered an unexpected rendition of the song's bridge — with the “Don't stop for anyone/We're plastic, but we still have fun” line — for the first time since 2011. 


	Folded within her intricate storytelling about inner good vs. evil was a celebration of her Little Monsters and the depth of her catalog, as she made room for fan-favorite songs few imagined Gaga would sing on a tour six albums into her career. She performed a shortened version of “Applause” in an ArtRave-meets-Mayhem costume before transporting fans back to 2009 with “Just Dance,” emerging in The Fame-est of leotards. But the most surprising moment came when Gaga played “Summerboy” live for the first time since, literally, 2007 (which was the only other time she's ever performed it). It was a reminder of how deeply connected she still is to that 21-year-old Gaga playing dive bars in New York City for small crowds unaware of the pop genius that stood in front of them.

	Then came “Million Reasons,” a welcome surprise and the only Joanne song to make the setlist. The track served as the ideal soundtrack to a transitional moment in the show, where the light and dark versions of Gaga face off before ultimately joining hands, accepting that both sides must coexist in harmony. After a Phantom of the Opera-esque rendition of “Shallow” from atop a boat, and a stripped-down piano version of “Die With a Smile” sans Bruno Mars, Gaga addressed the crowd for the first time. She thanked her fans for being “a wonderful community I can rely on,” pausing several times to take in the applause.

	The Mayhem Ball could have easily been a stadium tour — she's playing three to five arena nights in most cities, and she's done it before with Chromatica. But when she performed “Vanish Into You,” and sang it into fans' faces at the floor barricade, it became clear that it's the intimacy with her Little Monsters that she craves, at least right now. “I wish I could meet all of you,” she said at one point during the show.

	The show seemed to close with a climaxing, pyrotechnic-backed rendition of “Bad Romance,” as Gaga returned to the stage reborn as a feathered angel in white, but now with the darker-hued hair of her shadowy side, declaring, “We are monsters, and monsters never die.” But with the story of light and darkness' coexistence told once again, Gaga had one final surprise. After credits rolled onscreen, a makeup-less Gaga appeared, standing in a backstage dressing room wearing just a beanie as she changed out of her show costume. Her face bare, stripped of the elaborate looks and crimson lips, and sunglasses covering her eyes. She was no longer the Mayhem Ball character, but the real woman behind it. It was a raw glimpse at the mad genius behind the show. The camera followed her as she walked beneath the stage for a last hurrah, singing “How Bad Do U Want Me,” a Mayhem favorite, before reemerging onstage for a final goodbye.


	“I hope you know that the ritual of being yourself is a beautiful practice. It's a practice you deserve to have every day in your life,” she told the crowd. Maybe Gaga forgot that she's the one who taught so many of us how to do exactly that.

One of the most commercially successful female singers in history, she also had hits with "Who's Sorry Now?," "Mama," "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" and "Stupid Cupid."

	Connie Francis, the actress and beloved pop vocalist who had hits with “Who's Sorry Now?,” “Everybody's Somebody's Fool,” “Stupid Cupid” and “Where the Boys Are” before her life took several turbulent turns, has died. She was 87.


	Ron Roberts, her friend and the president of her label, Concetta Records, shared the news Thursday on Facebook.




	“It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,” he wrote in a note that was reposted by the official Francis account on Facebook. “I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.”

	The news comes after the star was hospitalized this month. “I am back in the hospital where I have been undergoing tests and checks to determine the cause(s) of the extreme pain I have been experiencing,” she wrote July 2 on Facebook.


	Francis had recently seen an unexpected streaming surge as her 1962 tune “Pretty Little Baby” had become one of the biggest songs on TikTok this year. As of July, it has been featured in more than 2 million TikTok videos and has nearly 85 million streams on Spotify.


	A New Jersey native, Francis set the tone for the likes of Madonna and Lady Gaga and “had a powerful voice that could sound like a sob while staying on key,” San Francisco critic Neva Chonin once noted. One of the most commercially successful female singers of all time, she sold 42 million records by the time she was 26 and, according to her website, 200 million-plus records around the world during her career.

	











	On the heels of her newfound celebrity, famed MGM producer Joe Pasternak tapped Francis to portray the romantically challenged Angie, one of four co-eds on spring break in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and sing the title song for Where the Boys Are (1960).


	The coming-of-age film, also starring Paula Prentiss, Dolores Hart and Yvette Mimieux, was a box office hit, and her tune reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. Francis also sang it in Italian, Spanish, French, German and Japanese during the same New York City recording session in November 1960, and it would soar to No. 1 in 19 countries.


	As Francis churned out one top 10 hit after another, she starred in three more MGM movies, all musicals: Follow the Boys (1963), shot on location on the French and Italian Riviera and also featuring Prentiss; Looking for Love (1964), with Jim Hutton and Johnny Carson; and When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965), featuring Herman's Hermits.


	Francis never wanted to be an actress, she told Nick Thomas in 2017. “I asked the studio why they couldn't come up with a title without the word ‘boys' in it!” she said. “People knew [When the Boys Meet the Girls] was another lame Connie Francis movie and they stayed home. I was so pleased it was my last one.” (In 1984, she declined an offer from producer Allan Carr to appear in his remake of Where the Boys Are.)


	In 1958, Francis shot to stardom with her rendition of “Who's Sorry Now?,” a 1923 tune written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby that had been recorded by Bing Crosby and performed in French by Lisette Verea in the Marx Brothers' A Night in Casablanca (1946).

	











	With “Everybody's Somebody's Fool” in June 1960, Francis became the first woman to have a No. 1 song on the Hot 100 (the chart was almost two years old at the time). She reached the pinnacle again three months later with “My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own” and had a third chart-topper with “Don't Break the Heart That Loves You” in March 1962.


	Francis accumulated many other top 10 hits, including “My Happiness,” “Lipstick on Your Collar,” “Frankie” and “Among My Souvenirs,” all released in 1959; “Mama” — she said that was her personal favorite — and “Many Tears Ago” from 1960; “Together” and “Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart” from 1961; and “When the Boy in Your Arms (Is the Boy In Your Heart),” “Second Hand Love” and “Vacation” from 1962.


	Her personal life, however, was filled with tragedy. Her self-described one true love, singer Bobby Darin, was chased away by her strict father before they could elope, and she had four unhappy marriages, two miscarriages and a son that lived for only 10 days; was raped at knifepoint in a Long Island motel; her brother was murdered, gangland style; botched nasal surgery took away her singing voice for years; and she was diagnosed with manic depression and involuntarily institutionalized 17 times.


	​”I would like to be remembered, not so much for the heights I have reached, but for the depths from which I have come,” she often said.


	Concetta Maria Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, the daughter of Ida and George, a roofer who would become the dominating architect of her career. She began taking accordion lessons when she was 3, but her talents as a singer quickly became obvious.

	











	At 14, she was making demonstration records for publishers to pitch unreleased songs to popular singers — they'd say, “C'mon Connie, give it a Rosemary Clooney sound. Give it that great Patti Page or Jo Stafford sound” — when she appeared on the CBS program Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. During rehearsals, the host had trouble pronouncing her name and suggested she go by Connie Francis.


	While getting stellar grades at Arts High School and Belleville High School, she appeared from 1953-55 on NBC's Startime Kids. George Scheck, a producer on that variety show, became her manager and shopped her around to record companies; after being turned down by Mitch Miller at Columbia Records and many others, she got a 20-side, two-year deal from Harry Meyerson at MGM Records.


	She sang for Tuesday Weld in Rock, Rock, Rock (1956) and for Freda Holloway in Jamboree (1957), but her singles were not doing well, with “The Majesty of Love,” at No. 93, her only one to chart.


	With her MGM contract about to expire, she was going to accept a scholarship to study medicine at NYU when, hounded by her father, she reluctantly recorded “Who's Sorry Now?” with 16 minutes left on her final studio session. She thought the song was “square.”


	Championed by American Bandstand‘s Dick Clark — “without Dick Clark, there would be no Connie Francis,” she said — “Who's Sorry Now?” sold more than 1 million copies and spent 22 weeks on the Hot 100 in 1958. Suddenly, she was headlining the Copacabana in New York City and the Sahara in Las Vegas, starring on her own ABC special and getting 5,000 fan letters a week.

	











	Francis had further success in 1958 with the rock ‘n' roll hit “Stupid Cupid,” written by Neil Sedaka and Howie Greenfield. And when Pasternak advised her that he had commissioned the Oscar-winning songwriting team of Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen to pen “Where the Boys Are,” she pushed for Sedaka and Greenfield to be considered, and it was their song that she performed.


	In 1960, Francis was named Miss Coca-Cola and made four appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. She would be showcased on the program more than two dozen times.


	Her 1963 song “In the Summer of His Years,” written as a tribute to John F. Kennedy, was an early charity record, with proceeds going to dependents of the policemen injured during the assassination. In 1964, she was given a special Golden Globe for her “international contribution to the recording world.”


	Later, she performed for the U.S. troops in Vietnam.


	For all her success, she said she passed on opportunities to record such songs as “Strangers in the Night,” “Somewhere My Love,” “Danke Shoen,” “Angel in the Morning” and tunes written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach. “I think more songs I turned down than songs I recorded were hits,” she told Ira David Sternberg in a 2018 interview.


	Her father also rejected a lucrative offer from Frank Sinatra that would have had her record and make movies and TV specials for his Reprise Records. Her last song to chart came in 1969.


	After three years of inactivity that resulted in part from her miscarriage, Francis began a nationwide tour in November 1974 at the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island. On the fourth night of her engagement, she was raped in her room at a Howard Johnson Motel Lodge. She didn't appreciate that the news generated headlines around the world. “I didn't want to be thought of as a ‘professional victim,'” she said in 1984.

	











	Francis was depressed and couldn't get out of bed for months, and in July 1976, a jury awarded her $2.6 million, finding the Howard Johnson chain responsible for her unsafe room.


	Surgery to widen her nasal passages in 1977 left her unable to sing for four years, and it would take three subsequent operations to restore her singing ability. “When I lost my voice, I lost myself. It's as simple as that,” she said on her website. “My voice was the thing that had always defined me — it was who I was. Singing was the one and only thing I was born to do. I felt like a surgeon whose hands had been amputated.”


	In March 1981, her younger brother, Georgie, 40, who had pleaded guilty to bank fraud charges and had given law enforcement officials information concerning alleged organized-crime activities, was shot to death in front of his New Jersey home.


	Her eight-year run of stays in psychiatric hospitals ended in 1991 when she said she was properly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.


	In 2018, the first of her planned three-part memoir, Among My Souvenirs (The Real Story), was published.


	After “dating the swingers of the world but never doing the horizontal cha-cha-cha with any of them,” Francis married publicist Dick Kanellis in August 1964 but filed for divorce five months later, citing mental cruelty. She wed beauty salon owner Izzy Marion, owner of beauty salons in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe, in January 1971; they divorced 10 months later.


	She also was married to restaurateur and travel agent Joseph Garzilli from 1973-77 and to TV producer Bob Parkinson in 1985. Both of those unions ended in divorce, too. (Her romance with Darin has been revisited on Broadway in the jukebox musical Just in Time, with Jonathan Groff and Gracie Lawrence portraying the singers.)

	











	On Thursday, Lawrence appeared with her Just in Time castmates in New York's Bryant Park and performed “Who's Sorry Now.”


	“I'm going to sing a Connie song now. I implore you to listen to the real thing after [this performance],” she said. “You'll hear resilience, character, personality, humor, tenderness and strength. You can hear all of that in her voice … which she knew. I would also say that because we're not in a Broadway theater right now, we have the unique opportunity to all sing along, which I know also would've meant a lot to her because her relationship with her fans was everything to her. So, if you know this song, ‘Who's Sorry Now,' please sing along. I believe it would mean a lot to her.”


	Survivors include her adopted son, Joey.


	“There are a lot of people who have had my success in this business,” she told Gary James in an interview conducted in the late '90s. “There were exhilarating highs and abysmal lows. But, it was fighting to get out of those lows that I feel most proud of.


	“It was a struggle to reconcile all of the tragedies that had occurred in my life, and I'd like to be known for my music. I'm always honored and privileged when people remember, and it brings back happy memories for a lot of people, and that makes me happy.”

The tour's first night played to a sold-out crowd in Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena.

	The Mayhem Ball has been unleashed.


	On Wednesday (July 16) night at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena (technically in Paradise, Nevada), Lady Gaga ushered in a new touring era, officially kicking off the Mayhem Ball (in support of her Billboard 200-topping album Mayhem, naturally) to a sold-out crowd.


	Anyone who was at Coachella earlier this year or saw her recent Singapore dates certainly knew a bit of what to expect: those dates provided a fair glimpse of what to expect from the Mayhem Ball, which brought many of the songs, outfits and choreography from her Coachella performance back to the stage. Even so, the Mayhem Ball kickoff was far from a Coachella repeat, with Gaga and her creative team making notable changes to the look, pacing and setlist (which was generously expanded).


	“This is my first arena tour since 2018,” said Gaga in a statement when she announced the tour. “There's something electric about a stadium, and I love every moment of those shows. But with The Mayhem Ball, I wanted to create a different kind of experience — something more intimate — closer, more connected — that lends itself to the live theatrical art I love to create.”


Mayhem debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in March, placing 10 of its tracks on the Billboard Hot 100 (including the five-week Hot 100 No. 1 “Die With a Smile,” her Bruno Mars collab, which is still in the top 10) and setting two new records: Not only did Mayhem earn the 14-time Grammy winner her biggest streaming week ever, but it set a new record on Billboard's Top Dance Albums chart, where she now has the most No. 1s ever (eight).


	Mother Monster's previous concert tour, the Chromatica Ball in support of her Billboard 200 topper Chromatica, wrapped in 2022, selling more than 800,000 tickets and netting $112 million. The Chromatica Ball hit stadiums across multiple continents, while the Monster Ball is mostly playing arenas, offering fans a more intimate experience with the Emmy, Grammy and Oscar winner who has topped the Hot 100 six times and earned 18 top 10s on the tally.


	Below, check out the full setlist from the first night of Lady Gaga's The Mayhem Ball.

The unprecedented offer commenced Thursday at midnight ET for theater auditoriums equipped with the director's format of choice.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	A new chapter is being added to Hollywood's encyclopedia of marketing tactics, thanks to Universal and Christopher Nolan.


	Exactly a year to the day of the release of Nolan's The Odyssey, advance tickets are already on sale for Imax theaters that are equipped to screen the epic in 70mm film, the Oscar-winning filmmaker's format of choice. The offer officially commenced Thursday at midnight ET, according to Imax's social feed.




	By all accounts, it's the first time in history that any tickets have gone on sale a year before a film's release. One caveat: as of now, there are are only 16 sites in the U.S. that part of the offering, six in Canada, two in in the U.K., one in Australia and one the Czech Republic. More locations are expected to be added in the coming months as Imax audiotorums are equpped with 70mm projection, including Regal LA Live.

Tickets on sale for the first IMAX 70mm screenings of #TheOdysseyMovie. One year from now. https://t.co/B6z1mqBRA2 pic.twitter.com/L3WuorxHrn


Nolan‘s take on the classic Greek myth — starring Matt Damon as the eternal hero Odysseus — is being shot entirely on Imax film cameras, a first for a commercial feature. 


	Until now, such a feat would have been impossible. But after the success of his Oscar-winning Oppenheimer, Nolan approached Imax about upgrading its cameras, including resolving issues with processing the cameras' 70 mm film stock and the weight of the equipment.

	











	Imax screens ponied up more than $190 million of Oppenheimer‘s total global gross of $975.8 million, or 20 percent. “Chris called me up and said, ‘If you can figure out how to solve the problems, I will make [Odyssey] 100 percent in Imax.' And that's what we're doing,” Imax CEO Rich Gelfond recalled when speaking at the company's annual press lunch at the Cannes Film Festival this past May. “He forced us to rethink that side of our business, our film recorders, our film cameras.”


	The new film cameras are reserved for Nolan for now, but after he wraps The Odyssey, Imax will begin renting them out to other directors. Nolan has always been a big fan of Imax cameras, which he used when shooting Dunkirk, Interstellar, The Dark Knight movies and Tenet.


The Odyssey has a net budget of $250 million, which will make it the most expensive film of Nolan's career. The improbable blockbuster success of the atomic energy biopic Oppeneheimer proved yet again why Nolan is one of the few directors who can reliably deliver an all-audience event film, and The Odyssey‘s epic scope and A-list cast should prove a major draw.


	In addition to Damon, the film stars Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Jon Bernthal, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Mia Goth.


	The classic story follows the king of Ithaca as he undertakes a long and perilous journey home to his wife Penelope following the Trojan War. His challenges are many as he spends years encountering a succession of mythical beings including the Cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, the enchantress Circe, and travels to the Underworld.

	











	The first teaser trailer for Nolan's event pic debuted exclusively in theaters in front of Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth, which opened over the Fourth of July corridor to huge numbers and continues to be a major draw.


	Releasing the trailer so early is a bit unusual, considering that The Odyssey is still filming, but an all-audience tentpole such as Rebirth provided an opportunity Universal and Nolan's team couldn't pass up, even if the teaser was leaked online. Word of the advance ticket sales were also leaked when certain theater chains jumped the gun and posted notices that tickets would go on sale for the select 70mm screenings July 17.


July 17, 3:00 p.m.: Updated with revised details about the number of Imax locations that are part of the initial early offering.

Winning isn't everything, and in the case of one “Dancing With the Stars” runner-up, he's actually glad he didn't take home the Mirrorball Trophy. Find out why “DWTS” season 27 contestant Milo Manheim is fine with second place.

Manheim and his “DWTS” season 27 dance pro partner Witney Carson came in second, but he wasn't too torn up about losing.

During a July 2025 appearance on “The Zach Sang Show,” Manheim was asked if he's “haunted” by the loss. “To be honest, I feel like getting second place worked out in my favor because I'm reminded to this day that I was robbed,” he shared.

The “Zombie” star continued, “People come up all the time now and they're just like, ‘You killed ‘Dancing with the Stars.' And I don't think I would be getting that validation had I won.”

Manheim added, “So it's really nice.”

He also addressed how the “DWTS” voting system changed after his loss to Bobby Bones, who scored lower than Manheim.

“I will say that I was grateful that they changed the voting system after that year,” the actor noted. “So the fact that I was able to make them look at the system a little bit, that's the best thing I could have possibly hoped for.”

A post shared by Milo (@milomanheim)

Manheim has discussed his “Zombies” co-star Chandler Kinney coming in third place during “DWTS” season 33.

“I wasn't even worried for Chandler. I was like, ‘All right, she's going to avenge me.' And then, same thing happened to her. I mean, I don't want to say rigged 'cause it's not rigged. I'm not saying that.”

He added, “But I will say, I don't know, maybe it's just bias, but Chandler killed that thing and we just know how amazing she is at dancing.”

In a July 2025 interview with Us Weekly, Manheim gave his take on a possible curse. “You know the ‘Zombies' curse on ‘Dancing With the Stars' is we're always going to be runner-up,” he said.

As for the “Zombies” co-stars he would love to see take a spin on “DWTS,” the actor shared, “I would either send Meg [Donnelly] if she wanted to do it because [she] would redeem it for all of us and go win, or I would love to see Trevor [Tordjman]. Not even because he's a good dancer — because he is a fantastic dancer — but because of who he is. I think he would just kill.”

In what is, we dare to say, the most lucrative sale ever of a prop once used in an episode of Eerie, Indiana, a wooden sled with “Rosebud” painted on it—also used in Explorers, The ‘Burbs, Citizen Kane, and deleted scenes from Gremlins 2: The New Batch—has just been sold at auction for $14.75 million. This makes the sled, per THR, the second-most-expensive piece of movie memoribilia ever to be auctioned off, falling only behind Judy Garland's ruby slippers from The Wizard Of Oz—which, as far as we know, never even made it into the DVD extras of Gremlins 2.

But, uh, no, seriously: This was apparently one of the original Citizen Kane sleds, carved from pine and owned, for the last 40 years, by director Joe Dante. (Who, as you may have already surmised, was not shy about sneaking his insanely valuable treasure into some of his various film and TV projects.) Per Intelligent Collector, Dante got the sled through frankly bizarre means: While filming Explorers on the Paramount lot back in the 1980s, Dante was approached by one of the workers who was busy clearing out old storage spaces that had been used by RKO, the studio that produced the Orson Welles classic; would he possibly want to take home this unassuming piece of wood, which was otherwise going to be junked? Dante said, y'know, yes. (The same article notes that collectors previously believed there were only 2 extant Rosebuds in the world, one made of pine, and one of balsa, the latter the survivor of a trio built to be burnt for the film's famous ending. Steven Spielberg bought the balsa sled in the 1980s, and the pine one—used in the movie's flashbacks—has been circulating among collectors for years. Carbon-testing and other investigations have shown that Dante's sled definitely comes from the right time, and features similar-enough artistry to suggest that it might have been created as a back-up if the other pine sled broke.)

Dante has, of course, now sold the sled, for an absolutely massive amount of money that will unfortunately never be able to replicate feelings of love, family, and childhood innocence, although it'll probably do a pretty fucking good job at trying. The sled was sold to an unknown buyer as part of Heritage Auction's current movie memoribilia sale; other items up on the block this week include one of Indiana Jones' bullwhips, an X-Wing from The Empire Strikes Back, and some of the inscribed tablets from The Ten Commandments.

A powerful voice has joined the chorus of folks protesting the environmental damage wrought by American tech's increasingly fervent, creepy-cultish insistence that you just have to use AI: Singer and songwriter SZA. This is per Rolling Stone, which has catalogued a number of comments—some removed, some not—that the SOS singer has made in recent weeks on Instagram about the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, noting that “AI doesn't give a fuck if you live or die I promise” and calling out the ways the environmental damage the technology produces falls disproportionately on lower-class and minority communities. “PLEASE JUST GOOGLE ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM” she wrote in one such post.

SZA puts at least some of her focus specifically on Memphis, Tennessee, which is home to about 630,000 people, and also xAI's Colossus data center, which is working hard to try to out-do that human population in terms of how large a carbon footprint it can produce. (According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, Colossus uses energy equivalent to 100,000 homes, and consumes 1.5 million gallons of water a day; groups in Memphis are currently targeting the facility for adding additional gas-powered turbines it reportedly hasn't been cleared to use, and which will spew their runoff in the neighborhoods of many of the city's poorest residents.) “Ai is killing and polluting black and brown cities,” SZA wrote in one post on social media. “None of you care cause your codependent on a machine. Have a great life.” Elsewhere, she wrote, “Please google how much energy and pollution it takes to run Ai .. please google the beautiful black cities like Memphis that are SUFFERING because of twitters new Ai system.”

Anyway: In other news, Elon Musk rolled out another one of xAI's anime-coded “companions” for people to, we're assuming, masturbate to today; he claimed that the new “companion” had a “personality” “inspired by Edward Cullen from Twilight and Christian Grey from 50 Shades,” and, Christ, if we're going to burn down the entire planet and poison all our lungs for this idiocy, we at least wish it was being peddled by someone who understood that those characters are already essentially the same guy. Ugh.

The previous owner was director Joe Dante, who “had the honor of protecting this piece of cinematic history for decades.”

	The sled known as Rosebud — or at least one of the original red sleds created for the 1941 Orson Welles masterpiece Citizen Kane — has just sold for $14.75 million at auction.


	The pine hardwood prop, which bears its original paint but signs of production use, wear and removed rails likely sacrificed to wartime scrap drives, has belonged to director Joe Dante since 1984. While he was directing Explorers (1985), it was given to him by someone clearing out a portion of the Paramount lot that once served as the home of RKO Pictures.

	“One of the crew who knew I was a fan of vintage films came to me with a wood prop and said, ‘They're throwing out all of this stuff. You might want this,'” Dante recalled in a recent interview. “I'm not sure he knew what the sled was, but he must have had some inkling, or why else would he have asked me?

	“I was astonished. Since I am a huge fan of the movie, I said, ‘Yeah, I'll be glad to take it.'”


	Scientific testing has confirmed its authenticity.


	“I've had the honor of protecting this piece of cinematic history for decades,” Dante said in a statement released by Heritage. “To see Rosebud find a new home — and make history in the process — is both surreal and deeply gratifying. It's a testament to the enduring power of storytelling.”

	











	After the sale of a set of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz (1939) for $32.5 million in December, this is the second most valuable piece of movie memorabilia ever sold, according to Heritage. (The $14.75 million price includes the buyer's premium; the purchaser was not revealed.)


	While he had it, Dante put the sled in Explorers, The 'Burbs (1989), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and an episode of the 1991-93 NBC series Eerie, Indiana that he directed.


	Two other screen-used sleds from RKO's Citizen Kane — only a “few” were produced for the film, the auction house says — sold to Dante mentor Steven Spielberg for $60,500 in 1982 and to an anonymous buyer for $233,000 in 1996.


	The sale of Dante's sled took place Wednesday during the second day of Heritage's Entertainment auction, which runs through Friday. Earlier in the day, a painting by Bob Peak that served as original key artwork for Apocalypse Now (1979) went for $687,500.


	Other items up for sale include inscribed tablets from Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1956), Luke Skywalker's Red Five X-wing from The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and a bullwhip from Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade (1989).


	“This is not just the most important Entertainment event we've ever held — it's one of the most important in Entertainment auction history,” Heritage executive vp Joe Maddalena said. “These aren't just props. They're mythic objects. They tell the story of Hollywood's greatest moments, one piece at a time, each tied to a memory, a performance, a legend. We're honored to bring them to the fans, collectors and institutions who will preserve them for the generations to come.”

Farrell alleged the band attempted to to "undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing without blasting his own in-ear monitors at an unsafe level."


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


	Perry Farrell has filed a lawsuit of his own against Jane's Addiction members Dave Navarro, Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins over the 2024 onstage altercation that derailed the band's tour, his complaint coming just hours after the three members sued him earlier Wednesday.


	In the complaint, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles and obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Farrell maintains that the rest of the band were the original aggressors in the September 2024 incident that culminated with him punching Navarro on stage. He claimed in the suit that the band took part in a “years-long bullying campaign” where they harassed him onstage and attempted to “undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing without blasting his own in-ear monitors at an unsafe level.”

	Farrell claimed in the lawsuit that the band's alleged harassment “escalated on September 13, 2024 to physical violence by Navarro and Avery against Farrell onstage during the Boston show and the assault of both Perry and Etty Lau Farrell backstage by Navarro.”


	Farrell filed the suit alongside his wife Etty Lau Farrell and the company Wilton Hilton Inc. Farrell's claim disputes the band's original complaint, which stated that Farrell attacked Navarro and continued to attack him backstage. Farrell alleged the rest of Jane's Addiction used him as a “scapegoat” to cancel the rest of the tour. 


	“Perry Farrell was blindsided by not being allowed either input into this decision or even to be heard, leaving him unable to plead his case to continue the tour for Janes Addiction's fans,” the suit said. “Perry Farrell played no role whatsoever in these ill-conceived decisions utterly lacking in legal authority since he was not even consulted about cancelling the tour and would not have agreed to do so due to the financial and reputational consequences, as well as exposure to third-party legal liability created by their allowing Wilton Hilton, Inc., the band's touring company, breach its touring commitments.”

	











	When the band had announced the tour cancellation and claimed Farrell was having mental health struggles, Farrell said they'd “published malicious, defamatory public statements” about him, which he said have led to “significant reputational harm.”


	If there is a question about what to believe, you can believe the video we've all watched,” Chris Frost, Navarro, Avery and Perkins' lawyer, said in a statement. “You can believe Etty Farrell's contemporaneous Instagram posts stating: ‘Perry was clearly the aggressor, I'm not arguing that point at all… [H]e has been struggling mentally for quite some time….' You can believe Perry himself when he apologized to the Band: ‘I apologize to my bandmates, especially Dave Navarro, fans, family and friends for my actions during Friday's show. Unfortunately, my breaking point resulted in inexcusable behavior.' Today's complaint from Perry, including his account of events backstage after the September 13 show, is revisionist history. It won't stand.”


	Farrell's suit comes hours after the other three Jane's Addiction members filed a $10 million suit against him over the incident, claiming Farrell's conduct cost them millions. Navarro specifically had sued for assault and battery.


	“History will remember the band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell's unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control,” the band said. 


	Farrell's suit that he had “reached his breaking point” over Navarro's loud playing the night of the altercation, but that he responded by “body-checking” Navarro and that he didn't throw any punches. 

	











	“The video evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided, and in fact, what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell's minor body check of Navarro.” 


	In the suit, Farrell denied that he “sucker punched” Navarro backstage and alleged that Navarro “menacingly charged at and aggressively assaulted both Farrell and his wife Etty Lau backstage.”


	“As a founding member and creative force behind Jane's Addiction, Perry Farrell has always prioritized the band's legacy and its supporters, which is why the events of September 13th, 2024 in Boston and the resulting fallout was so devastating,” a lawyer for Farrell said in a statement. “Despite this continued bullying perpetuated by Navarro, Perry's dedication to Jane's Addiction and the preservation of its positive impact on the music industry remains unshaken. He is actively exploring ways to address the situation and ensure accountability.”

A fortune teller has been arrested in Manhattan for allegedly convincing a client to hand over nearly $90,000 in 2023, namely by telling the person that the money would go towards lifting a “generational curse” on her son.

Pamela Ufie was taken into custody after being fiercely pursued by a retired cop and self-described “psychic fraud” investigator, who had facilitated her arrest before; the P.I., Bob Nygaard, had gone so far as buying a plane ticket to see to it that her mystical street shop ended up shuttered.

In New York State, it is a class B misdemeanor to claim possession of “occult powers” while giving advice, a fact that many local residents may understandably not be aware of. After all, fortune telling is a fairly popular pastime in NYC, with plenty of patrons not ending up tens of thousands of dollars lighter in the pockets.

Details from Ufie's arraignment, which were shared with Straus News by the Manhattan D.A.'s office, alleged that she approached a woman near 1540 Broadway–located in the vicinity of Times Square–back in April 2023, telling her that her son had the aforementioned “generational curse.”

Between then and October of that year, Ufie then allegedly coaxed $87,000 out of the woman by saying that it would be used to “acquire specialty materials necessary to conduct rituals,” which would supposedly dispel the curse.

Ufie, 29, could face up to 90 days in jail in connection with the alleged incident. She was arrested near Bryant Park on July 10 after Nygaard, who used to work in Nassau County law enforcement, spotted her. Nygaard–who pursues fortune tellers for a living–had reportedly flown all the way from Florida, after learning she had set up a stand near the park.

In an interview with Straus News, Nygaard described what amounted to a personal stakeout on July 10, which began when he spotted Ufie on the W. 40th St. side of the park. He said that he fruitlessly attempted to convince a highway patrol officer, plus the officers in an NYPD patrol squad next to the New York Public Library, to make an arrest.

By that point, she was “gone with the wind.” Hours later, he spotted her again, and called the cops. At one point, he said that he hid behind a Nathan's hot dog stand, since Ufie knew who he was from previous legal encounters. After a cop car finally rolled by around thirty minutes later, he said that chased it down to a red light, and banged on its back windows to get the attention of officers. The arrest followed.

Nygaard said that he had first arrested Ufie as part of an undercover sting around 2016. Crucially, he also said that he had facilitated her arrest in Times Squares a few years ago, in connection with two fortune telling hauls that he said amounted to over $80,000. According to Nygaard, Ufie plead guilty in that case back in Sept. 2024, and ended up paying $50,000–which he personally believed was a “sweetheart deal.”

In a post on the social media site X.com after the July 10 arrest, Nygaard referenced this case: “Proud to have helped cause Pamela Ufie to be arrested but last time she was offered a sweetheart plea deal without @NYPD or @ManhattanDA investigating the scope of her activity fully. Will they give a damn this time or does the apathy run too deep?”

He added that the woman who lost $87,000, who he described as a “hard-working room attendant [who had immigrated] from the Caribbean,” contacted him within days of the prior plea deal. Thus began his plans to fly back to New York for the latest incident.

Nygaard told Straus that he believes people like Ufie are “emotionally abusive” swindlers on the level of Bernie Madoff, the infamous Wall St. Ponzi scheme operator, and opined that they were substantially different than people who attract “voluntary” clients.s

He has said that he first began understanding what “psychic fraud” was while on assignment for the DEA and FBI, back when he was active in law enforcement. After moving to Boca Raton after his 2008 retirement, he quickly took up his current private investigator gig.

In a 2017 interview with the New Miami Times, Nygaard also explained that his choice of post-retirement profession was partly sartorial, saying that he “relished” being able to wear fedoras and trench coats after being “restricted” to a police uniform for years.

Some people who have been arrested for claiming unprovable “occult” powers have mounted interesting defenses, such as by claiming that it should be protected under the religious liberty clauses of the First Amendment. However, precedent has not quite ruled in their favor, with a New York-based fortune teller named Abraham Ballard failing to win an appeal of his conviction back in the 1980s.

Yet according to the Columbia Undergraduate Law Review, the Ballard case established that “intent to defraud” is the key prosecutorial metric separating guilty fortune tellers from honest occult brokers.

Albert Dayan, Ufie's defense lawyer, did not return a call seeking comment as of press time.

            A Pennsylvania coroner is revealing new details surrounding the sudden death of Dan Rivera, a noted paranormal investigator who was on tour with the Raggedy Ann doll known as Annabelle, made famous by “The Conjuring” horror film franchise, when he died.
    


            Francis Dutrow, coroner in Adams County, PA, told CNN on Thursday that the doll was not present in the hotel room where Rivera died earlier this week in Gettysburg. He was reportedly 54.
    


            Ever since the death was reported by the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) via a press release posted to Facebook on Tuesday, horror and supernatural fans have theorized about a possible connection between the Annabelle doll, which Rivera was seen handling during the “Devils on the Run Tour” over the weekend, and his death.
    


            The case remains an“active investigation,” according to the coroner, with autopsy results expected in eight to ten weeks.
    


            Pennsylvania State Police public information officer Megan Frazer shared a report on Wednesday citing details that match Rivera's case, and stated that “nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene.”
    


            On Tuesday, NESPR posted to social media announcing “the sudden and heartbreaking loss of our dear friend and colleague” Rivera.
    


            “Dan was not only a vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend.”
    


            Rivera was affiliated with the Warren Occult Museum in Connecticut, which shared on its Facebook page that he “played a vital role in the museum's operations, often responsible for transporting and safeguarding Annabelle during public appearances and private events.”
    


            “He was respected for his careful approach and deep respect for the artefact's (sic) alleged supernatural reputation. Rivera's sudden passing has shocked both colleagues and paranormal enthusiasts worldwide.”
    


            NESPR's statement also said Rivera was a US Army veteran, and that he “worked closely with” Lorraine Warren – the late famed paranormal investigator who determined that the real-life Annabelle doll was demonically possessed in 1968.
    


            Warren was portrayed by actor Vera Farmiga in the “Conjuring” films, an immensely successful horror franchise that has also seen sequels and standalone spinoffs, including 2014's “Annabelle” and 2018's “The Nun.”
    


            A new sequel starring Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, titled “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” is due in September.

The paranormal community is remembering ghost hunter and paranormal investigator Dan Rivera. The Connecticut native died on July 13.

Rivera, 54, was found in his Pennsylvania hotel room. He was in Gettysburg for the “Devils on the Run Tour,” with the infamous Annabelle doll, which many believe to be haunted.

The story sparked online chatter that Rivera's death is somehow linked to the doll.

Rivera was a paranormal investigator with the New England Society of Psychic Research. As one of the Annabelle's handlers, he would take the doll to paranormal conventions.

NBC Connecticut spent time with Rivera in 2023 while filming our original docuseries “Haunted Legends of Connecticut.”

“I was mentored by Lorraine Warren herself. She made me promise that I would be doing this with Tony, keep on doing the investigations, helping people. I take that as an honor,” he said.

Tony Spera is the son-in-law of demon hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren, who were the basis for “The Conjuring” movie series, along with the Annabelle doll.



Following their deaths, Spera picked up the mantle of teaching about the paranormal and curates the Warren's museum in Monroe, CT, where the Annabelle doll is housed.

During our visit to the museum in 2023 Rivera, showed NBC Connecticut how the proper protocol for handling the doll, which includes wearing blessed gloves.

Rivera said he believed the Annabelle doll should be on tour as a teaching tool.

“Our intentions are to continue to do Ed and Lorraine's work to teach people about the devil, demons, and God.”

The Annabelle doll made headlines in May 2025 after touring in New Orleans. Within days of the event, fire devastated Louisiana's Nottoway Plantation, ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center and an historic home in the French Quarter burned down. It was believed to be the home of Voodoo practitioner Marie Laveau in the 1800s.

In an interview with NBC Connecticut on May 28, Rivera dismissed the notion that the events had anything to do with the doll's presence.

“I don't believe that was demonic that caused that all to happen,” he said.

A Pennsylvania state police classified the incident as a “natural death.” An autopsy is pending.

The report said Rivera was discovered in his room by coworkers and that nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene.

NESPR released a statement that said in part, “Dan was not only a vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend… His caring nature and sense of purpose made a deep impact on everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.”

The search for extraterrestrial life in the solar system and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics.

A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking. Our paper fills this gap based on a 3 yr long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group.

We review past studies of habitability but find that the lack of a universally valid definition of life prohibits a universally applicable definition of habitability. A more nuanced approach is needed.

We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: first, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat, and second, a viability model, which describes the probability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental conditions.

We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization, (b) interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets, (c) subsurface habitability of Mars, and (d) ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions.

The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms.

Three sociologists found that supernatural beliefs in the United States tend to group into four types

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Younger Americans are more likely to express belief in witchcraft and luck, as our new research shows.

As sociologists who research the social dynamics of religion in the United States, we conducted a nationally representative survey in 2021. Our survey posed dozens of questions to 2,000 Americans over the age of 18 on a wide range of beliefs in supernatural phenomena – everything from belief in the devil to belief in the magical power of crystals.

Our statistical analyses found that supernatural beliefs in the United States tend to group into four types.

The first represents what many consider “traditional religious beliefs.” These include beliefs in God, the existence of angels and demons, and belief in the soul and its journey beyond this lifetime.

A second represents belief in “spiritual and mental forces,” some of which are associated with either paranormal or new age beliefs. These include communicating with the dead, predicting the future, or believing that one's soul can travel through space or time.

A third group represents belief in “witches and witchcraft.” This was measured on our survey with questions about the existence of “black magic” and whether it was “possible to cast spells on people.”

The fourth and final group represents beliefs in supernatural forces that shape “luck” – for instance, that “black cats bring bad luck.”

Our analysis finds that higher education and higher income are associated with lower levels of all four types of supernatural belief. Those with a bachelor's degree or higher, for instance, score below average on all four types of belief, while those with less education score higher than average on all four.

Looking at race and ethnicity, we found that Latino or Hispanic individuals were more likely than white individuals to express belief in the “witches and witchcraft” form of supernatural belief. About 50% of Latino or Hispanic individuals in our survey, for example, strongly agreed that “witches exist.” This compares with about 37% of white individuals.

Comparing gender differences, we find that women are more likely than men to believe in the “spiritual and mental forces” forms of supernatural belief. For instance, about 31% of women in our survey agreed that “it is possible to communicate with the dead” compared with about 22% of men.

Our research addresses two key questions: first, whether people who hold one type of supernatural belief are also more likely to hold other types of supernatural beliefs; and second, how do different types of supernatural beliefs vary across key demographic groups, such as across educational levels, racial and ethnic groups, and gender?

Answering these questions can be surprisingly difficult. Most scientific surveys of the U.S. public include, at best, only one or two questions about religious beliefs; rarely do they include questions about other types of supernatural beliefs, such as belief in paranormal or superstitious forces. This could lead to an incomplete understanding of how supernatural beliefs and practices are changing in the United States.

An increasing number of Americans are leaving organized religion. However, it is not clear that supernatural beliefs have or will follow the same trajectory – especially beliefs that are not explicitly connected to those religious identities. For example, someone can identify as nonreligious but believe that the crystal they wear will provide them with supernatural benefits.

Moreover, recognizing that supernatural beliefs can include more than traditionally religious supernatural beliefs may be vital for better understanding other social issues. Research has found, for example, that belief in paranormal phenomena is associated with lower trust in science and medicine.

Our survey provides some insight into the nature and patterns of supernatural belief in the U.S. at one point in time, but it does not tell us how such beliefs are changing over time.

We would like to see future surveys – both ours or from other social scientists – that ask more diverse questions about belief in supernatural beings and forces that will allow for an assessment of such changes.

Canada needs a transparent, public-facing agency in charge of managing reports of mystifying things seen darting, blinking or hovering through our skies, according to a new report commissioned by Canada's top scientist.

The Sky Canada Project report published this week calls for a federal framework for managing UFO sightings by the public and pilots as a replacement for the current patchwork of protocols across departments that "hinder[s] scientific investigation."

"There is some evidence that there's something really unusual going on in the skies.… We just don't have enough information," said Winnipeg-based science writer Chris Rutkowski, director of the long-running Canadian UFO Survey, who was consulted for the report.

The Sky Canada Project was created in 2022 by the office of Mona Nemer, Canada's chief science adviser, partly in response to growing public interest in the topic of UFOs — also known as UAP, or unidentified anomalous or aerial phenomena. 

Staff set out to identify challenges related to data collection on UAP sightings and provide a summary of how other countries approach the issue.

The project was tasked with doing an environmental scan of historical reporting practices across the federal government and present-day UAP procedures of different federal agencies, and to consult non-governmental groups and experts in the country tracking and receiving UAP reports from the public.

The report found Canada's "fragmented" UAP reporting protocols across departments "complicates the application of scientific principles ... making it onerous, if not impossible, for researchers to access and compile data for rigorous, science-based analysis."

"Canada would benefit from an improved process for reporting, collecting, and studying UAP sightings," reads a section of the report.

Canada once had a centralized office for that run by the National Research Council beginning in 1967, with help from the RCMP.

That's the same year one of Canada's best-documented UFO cases emerged in Falcon Lake, Man.

The NRC effort ended in 1995. Roles and responsibilities were scattered among the Canadian Space Agency, Transport Canada, NavCanada — and Rutkowski, who amassed vast civilian, military, police and air traffic controller records of UAP reports dating back to the 1940s that Sky Canada has used in its analysis.

In recent years, NASA has conducted an independent UAP study; the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defence erected the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate UAP reports by military personnel; and Congress has held multiple public hearings centring on national security concerns posed by UAP and alleged government coverups.

Most UAP sightings happen to be planes, atmospheric conditions, planets or stars or meteors, satellites, weather balloons, drones, experimental craft, optical illusions or other mundane phenomena.

To date, there's still no evidence definitively proving extraterrestrial life is here or exists, notes the Sky Canada report.

"Nonetheless, some UAP sightings — for which data exist — remain unexplained even after investigation," the report says.

That uncertainty adds to the cultural fascination around UAPs.

"There is some interesting stuff being reported," said Rutkowski. "It doesn't necessarily prove that aliens are visiting us. It proves that some unusual cases are baffling."

The report also identifies the need to increase transparency and build public trust through proactive disclosure of UAP case details in an effort to combat misinformation and disinformation, and "pre-bunk" conspiracy theories before they spread.

"Everyone loves the idea of searching for UFOs or UAPs," said Sara Seager, a Canadian-American astrophysicist at MIT focused on the search for Earth-like planets.

"Taking that into a way to educate people about misinformation, about challenging your own assumptions ... I had never thought of the field in those terms before, and that was a really, really exciting new thing to me."

The report suggests the Canadian Space Agency might be a good fit to lead public UAP data management.

Seager thinks a post-secondary institution might be more appropriate.

"Universities are used to educating people, so perhaps there's a way they can, as the report said, parse this into some kind of outreach about planets and stars and natural phenomena," said Seager, who wasn't involved in the report.

Sky Canada never set out to prove whether we're alone in the universe, the report says, nor was that project in particular to analyze data of sightings.

Astrophysicist Avi Loeb is hunting for evidence of alien technology within Earth's atmosphere and our solar system through a data-driven approach.

Loeb wasn't involved in the report either. However, his work as head of Harvard's Galileo Project was cited by Sky Canada Project as an initiative that could prove "crucial in transitioning from anecdotal evidence to more scientifically rigorous analysis" of UAP.

That project will have three uniquely constructed observatories in different U.S. states upon completion that use sensors and machine learning to spot and measure speed, size, relative distance and other variables of UAP flitting around American airspace — including balloons or craft from rival governments engaging in espionage.

"The software we develop, the sensors we put together can be used by the Department of Defence if these are human-made objects, so I wouldn't feel like I wasted my time if we end up finding only human-made objects," said Loeb.

"This subject, of course, touches upon national security for Canada and the U.S., and I think co-operation would be very much appreciated."

Rutkowski appreciates Sky Canada's calls to encourage pilots to report sightings, and for more science on a topic still at times dogged by stigma and a "ridicule factor."

"Things are looking up and, you know, there's no question that the truth is out there," he said. "Unfortunately, we're stuck down here."

This week, reality TV show star Spencer Pratt posted multiple videos on social media savaging a proposed state bill on wildfire rebuilding. In one, Pratt told his 2 million TikTok followers that he consulted an artificial intelligence engine about Senate Bill 549. He said it told him the legislation would allow L.A. County to buy burned-out lots in Pacific Palisades and convert them to low-income housing, strip away local zoning decisions and push dense reconstruction. He urged people to oppose it.

“I don't even think this is political,” Pratt said. “This is a common sense post.”

 None of what Pratt said is in the bill. But over the last week, such misinformation-fueled furor has overwhelmed the conversation in Los Angeles, at the state Capitol and on social media about wildfire recovery. Posts have preyed on fears of neighborhood change, mistrust of government authorities and prejudice against low-income housing to assert, among other things, that the wildfires were set intentionally to raze the Palisades and replace the community with affordable housing.

The chatter has unmoored debate over a major rebuilding proposal from L.A. County leaders. Under the plan, a new local authority would be able to buy burned lots, rebuild homes and offer them back at discounted rates to the original owners. The idea is to give property owners struggling to rebuild another option to stay in their communities. There are no changes to any rules that require zoning amendments or approvals for individual housing developments.

 Housing & Homelessness 

A developer has plans to build as many as 100 apartments on the lot of a burned Shell gas station in Pacific Palisades. The proposal is likely to create strong opposition in the exclusive community.

State Sen. Benjamin Allen (D-Santa Monica), the author of SB 549, which creates the local authority, said he understands legitimate policy disagreements over the new powers granted in the bill.

But those discussions have been overshadowed, he said.

“It's become this total meme among the right-wing blogosphere and, unfortunately, picked up by some lazy-ass journalists that don't bother to read the bill that say this bill seeks to turn the entire Palisades into low-income housing,” Allen said.

Some of his own friends who lost homes in the Palisades, Allen said, have been texting him asking why he's trying to force low-income housing into the neighborhood.

“People are saying I want to put a train line in there,” Allen said. “It's insane.”

The frenzy, in part, is due to an issue of timing. Last month, a 20-member expert commission impaneled by L.A. County proposed the local authority as a key recommendation for rebuilding after January's Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed 18,000 homes and other properties.

 Climate & Environment 

An independent panel is urging California lawmakers to create a new authority to oversee rebuilding after the firestorms in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.

Commission leaders then approached Allen about writing a bill that would allow for its implementation. Allen wanted to do it, but deadlines for introducing new legislation had long passed.

Instead, Allen took SB 549, which had nothing to do with wildfire rebuilding but was still alive in the Legislature, and added the rebuilding authority language to it. This is a common legislative procedure used when putting forward ideas late in the year.

Allen decided as well to keep the original language in the bill, which called for significant spending on low-income housing in an unrelated financing program. Multiple news articles conflated the two portions of the bill, which added to the alarm.

The version of SB 549 with the wildfire rebuilding authority in it had its first hearing in a legislative committee on Wednesday. Allen spent much of the hearing acknowledging the confusion around it.

Misinformation over the rebuilding authority was fueled by a separate announcement California Gov. Gavin Newsom made this month.

State housing officials carved out $101 million from long-planned funding allocations for low-income housing and dedicated it to building new developments in Los Angeles.

The money will be used to subsidize low-income apartment buildings throughout the county with priority given to projects proposed in and around burn zones, that are willing to reserve a portion to fire survivors and are close to breaking ground.

The fires exacerbated the region's housing crisis. Higher rents persist in nearby neighborhoods and low-income residents continue to struggle. Newsom cast the announcement as assisting them in regaining their footing.

“Thousands of families — from Pacific Palisades to Altadena to Malibu — are still displaced and we owe it to them to help,” Newsom said when unveiling the spending.

 Housing & Homelessness 

After disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency directly leases apartments for survivors. Despite the horrific housing market in L.A., officials say that isn't needed here.

Like the proposed rebuilding authority, the funding does not change any zoning or other land-use rules. Any developer who receives the dollars would need separate governmental approval to begin construction.

Nevertheless, social media posters took the new money and the proposed new authority and saw a conspiracy.

“Burn it. Buy it. Rebuild it how they want,” said a July 15 post from X user @HustleBitch_, who has nearly 124,000 followers. “Still think this wasn't planned?

Newsom called the situation another example of “opportunists exploit[ing] this tragedy to stoke fear — and pit communities against each other.”

“Let's be clear: The state is not taking away anyone's property, instituting some sort of mass rezoning or destroying the quality and character of destroyed neighborhoods. Period,” Newsom said in a statement to The Times. “Anyone claiming otherwise is either misinformed or deliberately lying. That's not just wrong — it's disgraceful.”

Not all of the debate about the rebuilding authority is based on false information.

Allen and local leaders acknowledged the need for more consensus over its role, especially given the sensitivities around recovery. Still unresolved were the authority's governing structure, and whether it would encompass the Palisades or be limited to Altadena and other unincorporated areas.

Pratt lost his Palisades home in the fire and has sued the city, alleging it failed to maintain an adequate water supply and other infrastructure. In social media videos this week, Pratt said he and other residents didn't trust the county with increased power over rebuilding when he believed leaders failed to protect the neighborhood in the first place.

“We're a fire-stricken community, not a policy sandbox,” Pratt said. “We do not support the county becoming a dominant landowner in the Palisades.”

Representatives for Pratt could not be reached for comment.

By the end of Wednesday, Allen conceded defeat on SB 549. There were many legitimate hurdles to the bill passing before the Legislature adjourns in mid-September, he said. Notably, a representative for Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told the legislative committee that she was opposed to the bill because the city had yet to be convinced of its efficacy.

But the misinformation surrounding the bill made it even harder to envision its success, he said. Allen decided to hold the bill and have it reconsidered when the Legislature convenes again in January.

“If we're going to do this, I want the time to do it right,” he said.

If you've ever looked up at the sky and thought, “Okay, that is not a plane?" Well you are not alone...maybe literally. Did you know that New York is one of the top states in the country for UFO sightings? Action Network.com released their findings on a recent study, and it turns out that New Yorkers have reported over 6,100 UFO sightings.

Not only are people spotting weird things in the sky, but they are going deep in the Google rabbit hole too. New Yorkers search for UFO-related stuff about 14,800 times a month. That is a lot of “What did I just see?” moments.

New York landed in fifth place for total UFO sightings. Only California, Florida, Washington, and Texas beat us. But they also have much more open sky than we do.

New York has some ideal spots for a close encounter. The Adirondacks? Creepy and beautiful. Hudson Valley? Already famous for UFO sightings. Even Western New York and Long Island have had their fair share of “Wait… what is that?” moments.

Maybe it's a weather balloon ,a drone or that one neighbor who's always flying something in the sky. All we're saying is, people are seeing stuff. A lot of people.

If you've got a weird sky story, now's the time to share it. And if you haven't, maybe take a look up in the sky tonight. You never know what is out there. Go here to see the best states to spot a UFO. After all...Something is out there.

Japanese internet celebrity @Jonouchich1 is known as the ‘YouTuber' with the world's longest chin', because of his unusually long and pointy chin.

@Jonouchich1 is a very good example of how to turn a physical peculiarity that some would consider a defect into an advantage over the competition. The young Japanese YouTuber was ridiculed and compared to anime characters for his exceptionally long and pointy chin, but he never let the jokes get to him. If anything, he leaned into his unique look to attract more attention. Most of his YouTube and TikTok clips are centered around his chin, as it has become somewhat of a personal brand. People are fascinated and intrigued by it because it looks like the protruding, pointy chin of a manga character. In fact, his social media handle is inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh character Katasuya Jonouchi.



Some of @Jonouchich1's nearly 350,000 YouTube fans had long asked him to gen an X-ray of his impressive chin, and the social media sensation recently did just that. He said doctors had “never seen anything like this” before, but told him that it was most likely caused by genetic factors. @Jonouchich1 had long claimed that he drank a lot of milk growing up and speculated that the calcium had caused his lower jaw to grow, but doctors shut down his theory.



However, @Jonouchich1 says that he is the only one in his family with such a long and pointy chin. He showed his fans photos of himself as a 3-year-old, where he had a normal chin, but by age 5, his chin had already started growing.

 ﻿

Although his chin still attracts cruel jokes from time to time and has even caused @Jonouchich1 to be rejected by girls, he considers it an asset to increase his social media following. In that regard, his story is similar to that of Shogo Yoshida, a Japanese hairdresser with ball-like fingertips.

A UK woman managed to prove that the father of her child had colluded with a DNA test lab employee to fake his paternity test and avoid paying over $125,000 in child support.

That her partner broke up with her just three days after giving birth to their son, in 2022, was bad enough, but what came next was an even lower blow for 31-year-old Chelsea Miller. Her ex, Sheldon B., started denying that he was Louie's father and then asked for a paternity test. At the time of their breakup, Sheldon stood to save £94,000 ($125,800) if the DNA test came back negative, but his ex wasn't worried, because she ‘always knew who the father of my child was'. Imagine the shock she got when the paternity test came back negative.

Miller may have known that Sheldon B. was her child's father, but in the eyes of the Court, the DNA test was irrefutable evidence of the opposite. The 31-year-old didn't give up, though. Instead, she managed to persuade her ex's mother, Katie, to provide a sample of her DNA to another laboratory, which showed that Louie was her grandson and thus linked Sheldon to the baby as well.

The result had thrown a wrench in Sheldon's plans, and there was nothing left for him to do but admit to faking the paternity test to get out of paying child support. Apparently, he had asked his aunt, who knew someone at a DNA lab, to help him avoid responsibility. That someone was Robert P., who later admitted to swapping Sheldon's DNA sample with his own to skew the test results. The 38-year-old man admitted his guilt, but there was no proof that he had received compensation for his help.

Both accomplices pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and received sentences of 50 weeks and 33 weeks in jail. As for Chelsea, she expressed her disappointment with the level of unprofessionalism displayed by the DNA lab worker who assisted her ex-partner.

“The level of unprofessionalism and violation of trust in this case is beyond unacceptable,” she told The Sun. “Patients deserve to feel safe and respected when receiving care, especially in situations as sensitive as this.”

A wildfire near the highly secretive Area 51 military base in Nevada has sparked a mix of official updates and conspiracy theories. While official updates suggested it was a wildfire caused due to lightening, UFO enthusiasts are not convinced 

A lightning-sparked wildfire burning near the highly classified Area 51 military base in Nevada has reignited public speculation and conspiracy theories online. The blaze has been confirmed as part of the Gothic Fire, which has been raging across northern Nevada since July 4. According to officials, the fire was caused by lightning, and is one of many currently burning in the state.

Despite official explanations, conspiracy theories continue to float. Users on social media have speculated that the fire may be hiding “a crashed experimental aircraft” or that it's “evidence being destroyed.” One user referenced the viral 2019 trend to “storm Area 51,” suggesting, “maybe someone finally did it.”

The fire is burning about 15 miles from Area 51, near the Nevada Test Site, where the US once conducted above-ground nuclear tests. The region is roughly 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Since the US Department of Defense owns the land where Area 51 and the surrounding areas lie, the fire response is under their jurisdiction. The Gothic Fire has now spread over 366,000 acres. It is currently 0% contained, with no timeline yet for full containment. High temperatures, low humidity, and an abundance of dry timber and grass are feeding the fire. However, no evacuations have been ordered and no structures are under immediate threat, officials confirmed.

Area 51 is a remote US Air Force facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. Officially acknowledged by the US government only in 2013, the site has been at the center of decades-long speculation due to the highly classified nature of its operations. Originally developed during the Cold War, Area 51 was used for testing cutting-edge military aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. These aircraft often flew at altitudes and speeds far beyond what was publicly known at the time, leading civilians to report unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the skies.

Its secrecy, restricted airspace, and lack of public access have fueled countless theories suggesting the base houses captured alien spacecraft, extraterrestrial life, or advanced technology reverse-engineered from alien sources.

In 2019, the base drew viral attention when over 500,000 people RSVP'd to a Facebook event called “Storm Area 51: They Can't Stop All of Us.” While meant as a joke, it drew thousands of curious onlookers to nearby towns, forcing authorities to bolster security around the base. Though no concrete evidence of alien activity has ever been presented, Area 51 remains a symbol of government secrecy—and for many, a focal point for everything the public doesn't know about UFOs and unexplained aerial phenomena.

A wildfire near the highly secretive Area 51 military base in Nevada has sparked a mix of official updates and conspiracy theories. While official updates suggested it was a wildfire caused due to lightening, UFO enthusiasts are not convinced 

A lightning-sparked wildfire burning near the highly classified Area 51 military base in Nevada has reignited public speculation and conspiracy theories online. The blaze has been confirmed as part of the Gothic Fire, which has been raging across northern Nevada since July 4. According to officials, the fire was caused by lightning, and is one of many currently burning in the state.

Despite official explanations, conspiracy theories continue to float. Users on social media have speculated that the fire may be hiding “a crashed experimental aircraft” or that it's “evidence being destroyed.” One user referenced the viral 2019 trend to “storm Area 51,” suggesting, “maybe someone finally did it.”

The fire is burning about 15 miles from Area 51, near the Nevada Test Site, where the US once conducted above-ground nuclear tests. The region is roughly 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Since the US Department of Defense owns the land where Area 51 and the surrounding areas lie, the fire response is under their jurisdiction. The Gothic Fire has now spread over 366,000 acres. It is currently 0% contained, with no timeline yet for full containment. High temperatures, low humidity, and an abundance of dry timber and grass are feeding the fire. However, no evacuations have been ordered and no structures are under immediate threat, officials confirmed.

Area 51 is a remote US Air Force facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. Officially acknowledged by the US government only in 2013, the site has been at the center of decades-long speculation due to the highly classified nature of its operations. Originally developed during the Cold War, Area 51 was used for testing cutting-edge military aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. These aircraft often flew at altitudes and speeds far beyond what was publicly known at the time, leading civilians to report unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the skies.

Its secrecy, restricted airspace, and lack of public access have fueled countless theories suggesting the base houses captured alien spacecraft, extraterrestrial life, or advanced technology reverse-engineered from alien sources.

In 2019, the base drew viral attention when over 500,000 people RSVP'd to a Facebook event called “Storm Area 51: They Can't Stop All of Us.” While meant as a joke, it drew thousands of curious onlookers to nearby towns, forcing authorities to bolster security around the base. Though no concrete evidence of alien activity has ever been presented, Area 51 remains a symbol of government secrecy—and for many, a focal point for everything the public doesn't know about UFOs and unexplained aerial phenomena.
