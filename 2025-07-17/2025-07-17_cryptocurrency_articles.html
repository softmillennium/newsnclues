                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House passes Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, blocks digital dollar rollout originally appeared on TheStreet. The House of Representatives has officially passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a sweeping bill designed to block the Federal Reserve from issuing or testing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) without explicit congressional approval. The move signals strong Republican resistance to what they view as a potential tool for state surveillance. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and controlled by the government. They are designed to function like cash but in digital form — with potential for programmability, surveillance, and tighter monetary control. Join the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here. As outlined in the bill, a Federal Reserve bank “shall not offer products or services directly to an individual,” nor “maintain an account on behalf of an individual.” Additionally, the Fed is barred from creating any digital currency that is “substantially similar under any other name or label.” It states: “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall not use any central bank digital currency… to implement monetary policy.” This restriction reflects broader fears that a programmable digital dollar could grant the government intrusive control over individual financial activity. It explicitly bans the Fed from running CBDC pilot programs or testing initiatives without future Congressional approval. This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 17, 2025, where it first appeared.</p>

On June 25, the platform abruptly froze withdrawals for its 2 million users. Before shutting down, the platform allegedly transferred around 1.8 billion USDT (roughly 13 billion yuan) through Tornado Cash to offshore wallets, according to blockchain security firm SlowMist. On July 7, authorities in Taojiang County, Hunan Province, officially classified the platform as a suspected case of fundraising fraud and illegal network-based pyramid selling. The real Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange publicly disavowed any affiliation with the Chinese platform on April 8, warning that any platforms, apps or promotional material using its name were unauthorized and likely fraudulent. Public outrage intensified after XinKangJia's founder reportedly fled abroad and mocked victims in group chats. I only took what didn't belong to your level of intelligence.

U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to allow retirement accounts for alternative investments including cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.

The order, which could be signed as soon as this week, would to allow 401(k) accounts to invest in a broader set of assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds such as digital assets, gold and private equity, and would direct regulators to clear any hurdles.

Bitcoin jumped above $120,000 on the report, up 1.7% through the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, XRP surged to a fresh all-time high, breaking its 2018 record.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House approved the GENIUS Bill with a 308-122 vote with significant Democratic support, adopting regulations for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins that proponents believe will fundamentally change the world of commerce. He, along with his family, also stand to benefit from this, given their financial interests in a crypto company that has issued its own stablecoin. It ultimately required President Trump's intervention to convince the lawmakers and then a really long vote to clear all the procedural hurdles. With its passage, the U.S. is now formally adopting a new set of rules for cryptocurrencies — ones that critics view as far too easy. It also marks a sharp turn from the Biden administration's approach of seeking to get crypto companies follow the far tougher rules for Wall Street. More crypto legislation is expected to follow the GENIUS Act. There's another bill intended to provide more clarity about which regulatory agencies will oversee the different aspects of crypto. Those, however, now need to be passed by the Senate. The new legislation will put more formal regulations around stablecoins, which is viewed by many as a safer type of cryptocurrency. That's because companies selling stablecoins have to hold the equivalent dollars in reserve. Stablecoins are a hot emerging part of the crypto sector. Key industry players believe stablecoins will allow people and companies the ability to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous and expensive bank or money transfer fees. It's attracted a lot of interest from banks such as JPMorganChase and retailers like Amazon and Walmart, all of whom are said to be considering launching their own stablecoins. Controversially, even President Trump now stands to benefit financially from stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, in which his family has financial interests, has issued a stablecoin called USD1 (though it's market share is miniscule). Passage of the bill came after intense lobbying from the crypto industry, which spent over $100 million in Congressional races last year and is building an even heftier war chest ahead of next year's midterms. "This is what political power can buy you," says Corey Frayer, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. The crypto sector's war chest not only helps win supporters, Frayer says, they also silence Democrats and other lawmakers who might be opposed but "are just plain scared that crypto is going to come to their town and spend enormous amounts of money against them." Among other aspects, the bill seeks to formalize rules for stablecoins, mandating that companies must ensure they are holding proper reserves and are providing information about their holdings. It also introduces anti-money laundering rules and other regulations intended to address concerns that stablecoins are being used by criminals such as ransomware hackers, drug cartels or even regimes under sanction. But critics warn the rules are not strong enough, and they add that the bill would allow non-financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins without having to follow all the rules that banks and other financial firms must follow. "The stablecoin industry has claimed that it is a new payment system with better infrastructure than the payment system we've been using for years," says Frayer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the three bills, legislation to regulate a type of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, had already passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support and will now head to Trump's desk. It passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. “Around the world, payment systems are undergoing a revolution,” said House Financial Services Chair French Hill of Arkansas as lawmakers debated the stablecoin legislation Thursday morning. Hill said the bill will “ensure American competitiveness and strong guardrails for our consumers.” After Trump declared it “crypto week,” the bills were stalled for more than a day amid disagreements among House Republicans about how to combine the legislation. The stablecoin measure is seen by lawmakers and the industry as a step toward adding legitimacy and consumer trust to a rapidly growing sector. The bill outlines requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and mandates that issuers hold reserves backing the cryptocurrency. Without such a framework, Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee in a statement warned, “consumers face risks like unstable reserves or unclear operations from stablecoin issuers.” Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said the 294-134 vote on that legislation shows broad bipartisan support and a “massive energy” on the issue. But it is so far unclear whether the Senate would consider the House bill or try to write its own. That legislation aims to provide clarity for how digital assets are regulated. The bill defines what forms of cryptocurrency should be treated as commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and which are securities policed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In general, tokens associated with “mature” blockchains, like bitcoin, will be considered commodities. The crypto industry has long complained that unclear laws have made it difficult to operate in the U.S. and that the Biden administration tried to regulate it through enforcement actions rather than transparent rulemaking. Getting this bill passed has been a top priority for the industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to heavy campaign donations and lobbying. A provision in the stablecoin bill bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. Trump reported earning $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty Financial in 2024, according to a public financial disclosure released in June. A meme coin linked to him has generated an estimated $320 million in fees, though the earnings are split among multiple investors. Some Democrats also criticized the bill for creating what they see as an overly weak regulatory framework that could pose long-term financial risks. “If this bill passes, it will allow Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to issue their own money.

LQR House (NASDAQ:YHC), una piattaforma ecommerce specializzata in alcolici e bevande, ha annunciato l'intenzione di integrare criptovalute e tecnologia blockchain nel proprio modello di business. Questa svolta strategica è supportata dall'investitore crypto Robert Leshner, che ha acquisito una quota nella società ma non cerca più il controllo. L'azienda ha già approvato l'allocazione di una parte della sua tesoreria in Bitcoin e sta valutando investimenti in infrastrutture di mining attraverso partnership con Bitmain e Polaris Capital.

LQR House (NASDAQ:YHC), una plataforma de comercio electrónico centrada en licores y bebidas, ha anunciado planes para integrar criptomonedas y tecnología blockchain en su modelo de negocio. Este cambio estratégico cuenta con el apoyo del inversor cripto Robert Leshner, quien ha adquirido una participación en la empresa pero ya no busca el control mayoritario.

LQR House (NASDAQ:YHC)는 주류 및 음료에 중점을 둔 전자상거래 플랫폼으로, 사업 모델에 암호화폐와 블록체인 기술을 통합할 계획을 발표했습니다. 이 전략적 전환은 암호화폐 투자자 로버트 레슈너의 지원을 받았으며, 그는 회사 지분을 인수했지만 더 이상 경영권을 추구하지 않습니다. 회사는 이미 재무 자산 일부를 비트코인에 할당하는 것을 승인했으며, Bitmain과 Polaris Capital과의 파트너십을 통해 채굴 인프라 투자 가능성도 모색 중입니다. 주요 재무 지표로는 6,809,578주 발행, ATM 공모를 통해 2,000만 달러 이상 조달, 그리고 무부채 상태가 있습니다. Ce virage stratégique est soutenu par l'investisseur crypto Robert Leshner, qui a acquis une participation dans l'entreprise mais ne cherche plus à en prendre le contrôle. Dieser strategische Wandel wird von Krypto-Investor Robert Leshner unterstützt, der eine Beteiligung am Unternehmen erworben hat, aber keine Mehrheitskontrolle anstrebt. Das Unternehmen hat bereits die Verwendung eines Teils seiner Rücklagen für Bitcoin genehmigt und prüft mögliche Investitionen in Mining-Infrastruktur durch Partnerschaften mit Bitmain und Polaris Capital. Wichtige Finanzkennzahlen sind 6.809.578 ausstehende Aktien, über 20 Millionen US-Dollar durch ATM-Angebote eingeworben und keine Schulden. LQR House signals strategic expansion into crypto with blockchain integration plans and key investor support, representing significant business model evolution. The support from Leshner, described as a significant voice in decentralized finance, adds credibility to this initiative. The company's financial position appears relatively stable with zero debt and having raised over $20 million through its at-the-market offering. What's particularly noteworthy is management's characterization of digital assets as potentially "foundational" rather than merely diversification. The previous board resolution to allocate treasury to Bitcoin and explore mining infrastructure investments with Bitmain and Polaris Capital indicates this strategy has been developing for some time. However, investors should recognize the speculative nature of this announcement. The lack of specific timelines, investment amounts, or concrete implementation details creates significant uncertainty about execution. This strategic expansion, while potentially transformative, introduces substantial new risks alongside opportunities in the volatile cryptocurrency sector.

(the "Company" or "LQR House") (NASDAQ:YHC), a niche ecommerce platform specializing in the spirits and beverage industry, today announced its strategic intent to broaden its corporate focus by integrating cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into its long-term business model. This forward-looking shift has been spurred by Leshner, a significant voice in decentralized finance and the open market buyer of a stake in LQR House. Leshner has publicly expressed his interest in having the Company pursue a more crypto-native strategy. Leshner no longer intends on pursuing a controlling interest in the Company. This announcement follows the board's previously approved resolution to allocate a portion of the Company's treasury to Bitcoin, along with its stated intention to explore a potential investment in mining infrastructure through a partnership with Bitmain and Polaris Capital. There can be no assurances that the Company will enter into any definitive agreement with Robert Leshner, and that any potential transactions described above will be consummated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move follows a high-level meeting between Minister Bilal Bin Saqib and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele The agreement aims to facilitate technical cooperation and knowledge exchange in key areas such as public sector applications of Bitcoin, blockchain-based financial inclusion, sovereign digital asset reserves, and regulatory innovation in emerging economies. According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance, the meeting centred exclusively on digital asset collaboration and was seen as a landmark in what officials termed “Biplomacy” — a blend of Bitcoin and diplomacy reflecting the growing role of decentralized technologies in international engagement. “This visit marks the beginning of a strategic relationship rooted in innovation, inclusion, and shared learning.” President Bukele welcomed Pakistan's outreach, commending its forward-looking approach to digital assets and reaffirming El Salvador's support for emerging economies exploring Bitcoin as a tool for financial sovereignty. El Salvador, which made headlines in 2021 as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, has become a focal point for nations assessing digital currencies to expand financial access and reduce reliance on traditional monetary systems. A head of state who doesn't just talk tech, but challenges it, from AI and robotics to Bitcoin. Pakistan is similarly working to establish a structured digital asset economy. Officials believe the Pakistan–El Salvador agreement will help advance policy dialogue on sovereign digital asset frameworks, encourage public-private collaboration, and position Pakistan as a serious participant in global crypto governance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Myriad Moves: Will XRP and Ethereum Hit All-Time Highs? Prediction markets offer users the opportunity to test their knowledge about real-world events spanning diverse topics like crypto, politics, pop culture, and sports. On Myriad Markets, users can place predictions in these categories using USDC or points, collecting their share of profits if and when they predict correctly. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt parent company, DASTAN). One of the biggest on-chain events of the year took place last weekend when Solana token launchpad Pump.fun hosted an initial coin offering (ICO) for its PUMP token. The platform sold 15% of its total supply ($600 million worth) to eligible parties and enabled trading on Monday, which led to a quick burst to more than a $2 billion market cap for the PUMP token. But details remain outstanding about exactly when the platform might airdrop the 24% of its supply it set aside for community and ecosystem initiatives. Myriad users asked to predict whether or not it would take place by the end of July have changed their mind during the week. But just four days later, that number stands at 26.9%, a more than 50% decline as no further information has come from the platform. Interestingly, a scenario in which tokens are airdropped to participants before the end of July but they are locked and not tradeable will result in the market resolving “no.” Pump.fun users and PUMP token traders are eagerly awaiting the next announcement from the platform, which may indicate its plans for additional token distributions. Now, a new market on Myriad asks users whether or not the momentum and recent weekly gain of 21% will spur the second-largest crypto asset (by market cap) to set a new all-time high by the end of 2025. As of Thursday afternoon, predictors think ETH will hit a new all-time high, with odds standing at 53.7% despite the fact that it's still trading nearly 30% below its all-time high of $4,891. One analyst told Decrypt on Thursday that the asset's current setup is the “strongest in years,” pointing to sentiment improvement and increased institutional interest, which is evidenced by major ETF inflows and accumulation from publicly traded firms like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine. Former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes previously predicted that the price of ETH could reach $4,000-$5,000 this year. Predictors have time to monitor this market, as ETH sits nearly 30% off its all-time high with the market closing on December 31. As of Thursday afternoon, 84.5% of predictions were on “moon” to at least $3.50, a 11% jump since the day prior and a 34% weekly rise. Investment bank Standard Chartered is with predictors, calling the asset “uniquely positioned” and calling a target price of $5.50 by year end.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fumito Ueda praised Keita Takahashi's To a T for not relying on mechanics, stating that the age of coming up with new mechanics is long over. Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi released his brand-new game, To a T, on May 28 this year. To celebrate its release, Takahashi got together for a chat with another game industry legend – Fumito Ueda, the director of Shadow of the Colossus and ICO. When its trailer was first released, Ueda apparently reached out to Takahashi to ask him – “How do you play this game?” Takahashi remembers answering that the game didn't have any special mechanics – to which Ueda replied with: “That's great.” The Katamari Damacy creator jokingly remarks that he thought “Ah, these are the words of a professional” when he first heard that comment. While Ueda's reply may not seem that serious at first glance, what he was actually trying to suggest is that current day games could benefit from focusing on more than just gameplay mechanics. Ueda explained that, in his opinion, mechanics don't necessarily need to be “new” or “innovative,” because the game's art and story are there to build the experience. If we take into account Ueda's previous works, the logic behind his reasoning becomes much more obvious. Other prominent creators like NieR: Automata director Yoko Taro have praised Ueda's games exactly for this reason – by using already existing gameplay elements and deliberately ignoring playability in favor of conveying the message through the story and worldbuilding, the game ended up being one-of-a-kind experience for Yoko, and many others. This is the same reason why Ueda believes To a T to be a great game – rather than offering gimmicks, the game is story driven, with an emphasis on visual presentation and aesthetics and heavy messaging about living with disability. To a T is currently out for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X❘S. The devs wanted a chance to add things they missed out on Why did Nintendo handle Switch 2 pre-orders so differently in Japan and the US?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LUXEMBOURG, July  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin Swift (BTC3), a next-generation blockchain protocol, has officially launched Stage 1 of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), introducing a novel approach to early-stage participation with programmable mining rewards that activate immediately. Unlike traditional ICOs that require investors to wait for mainnet or roadmap deliverables, Bitcoin Swift's Proof-of-Yield system is already live. Early contributors who purchase BTC3 during Stage 1 receive programmable mining contracts that begin distributing rewards from day one, a move designed to reshape how value is delivered in token presales. The platform has allocated 50% of its total token supply toward programmable mining, with early participants gaining access to the most lucrative reward cycles. “We're not just rewarding early access—we're activating a system where rewards are governed transparently by smart contracts and delivered automatically.” Bitcoin Swift operates on a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model. A layer of AI oracles monitors energy metrics and adjusts mining rewards in real time to prioritize sustainable, low-carbon usage. BTC3 is more than a mining protocol—it incorporates governance mechanisms powered by AI, where votes are scored for risk and participation is linked to both token holdings and verified identity. Meanwhile, zk-ledger technology ensures that transactions are shielded and private, while maintaining institutional-grade compliance for transparency. Bitcoin Swift's fixed supply of 45 million BTC3 is designed to support long-term value through a transparent allocation model: Bitcoin Swift is a programmable Layer 1 blockchain designed to deliver real-time mining, AI-enhanced consensus, and privacy-first decentralized finance. With only 63 days left in the presale, the project invites early participants to engage in an active ecosystem where programmable mining and real-time payouts are already live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In ongoing proceedings of the $1 billion money laundering and sanctions trial against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, an admitted cryptocurrency fraudster revealed how he used the decentralized crypto mixer to conceal the proceeds of a $1.1 million NFT rug pull. Andre Llacuna, 23, testified Wednesday that he and coconspirator Ethan Nguyen orchestrated a fraudulent scheme involving the sale of 8,888 “Frosties” NFTs on the OpenSea exchange in January 2022. Despite promising access to a metaverse game, the project was a sham. After collecting approximately $1.1 million from investors, Llacuna and Nguyen abruptly shut down the Frosties website and attempted to obscure their illicit gains. Facing mounting scrutiny on the public Ethereum blockchain, Llacuna admitted they turned to Tornado Cash as the “best option” to hide the stolen funds and evade detection. He explained, “It was valuable because people would be unable to trace back the original way we got the cryptocurrency.” Despite efforts, authorities arrested both individuals within two months, with Nguyen sentenced to probation and ordered to forfeit nearly $579,000. The testimony forms part of prosecutors' broader case alleging that Storm and his associates operated Tornado Cash as a “washing machine” for illicit funds, enabling criminals—including fraudsters and the North Korean Lazarus hacking group—to launder more than $1 billion over four years. Additional testimony from Joseph Evans, partner at McDermott Will & Emery, detailed his efforts to recover stolen assets linked to a $196 million heist of crypto exchange BitMart, further highlighting Tornado Cash's role in facilitating anonymous transactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin, fresh from hitting an all-time price of $123,000 per bitcoin at the beginning of the week, could be about to make another major move. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can “uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!” The bitcoin price, up around 60% from its April lows, has powered a huge ethereum and XRP rally that's pushed the combined crypto market to just under $4 trillion (with a Congress game-changer predicted to unleash trillions more). Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirms wild bitcoin rumors, traders are turning toward next week as the “next big catalyst” for the bitcoin price, ethereum, XRP and crypto market looms. policy is the next big catalyst," Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, chief investment officer with XBTO, said in emailed comments, pointing to U.S. president Donald Trump's digital asset task force's report that's due July 22 and “could introduce sweeping policy changes, with speculation around a potential bitcoin reserve strategy.” Trump's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has until July 22—180 days after Trump's January 23 executive order establishing the group—to submit its final report on a proposed federal framework for the regulation of crypto, including stablecoins, market oversight, and consumer protection. If the stablecoin Genius Act is passed, it will go to U.S. president Donald Trump's desk for his signature, while the crypto market structure Clarity Act may receive a vote next week, Punchbowl News reported. Meanwhile, the Trump's digital asset task force's report could reveal plans for the U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve that Trump ordered in March, mandating federal agencies transfer their holdings to the Treasury Department, which would oversee the reserve, as well as a crypto stockpile that's had ethereum, XRP, solana and cardano named to it. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, has been working on “budget-neutral” strategies for acquiring bitcoin while bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Cynthia Lummis, a champion of the bitcoin reserve who has introduced bitcoin acquistion bills to Congress, has said that following the passage of the stablecoin and market structure bills, the Trump administration will then turn to the bitcoin reserve. “Crypto Week is a historic moment for both Bitcoin and crypto as a whole,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin layer two network BOB, said in emailed comments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The country's recent high-profile engagements—particularly with El Salvador and the Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLF)—signal a radical policy shift that many see as a desperate embrace of digital assets to stave off economic collapse. However, experts warn that even this lifeline could snap if geopolitical risks escalate. In this economic climate, traditional tools have limited utility. Inflation peaked at 38 per cent in 2023, while the rupee has lost 165 per cent of its value since 2017, a study conducted by the Asian Development Bank said. For a population whose savings are rapidly being eroded, the appeal of decentralised financial systems has grown dramatically. Despite an official ban on cryptocurrency trading, Pakistan ranks 8th globally in crypto adoption. Citizens are said to hold between $20–25 billion in digital assets, driven by desperation for financial security in a rapidly depreciating fiat system, Geo News reported. Crypto assets have effectively become a parallel financial system for many Pakistanis. In April 2023, the government doubled down on its prohibition, citing capital flight risks. This popular adoption is happening against the will of regulators but reflects a grassroots shift toward decentralised finance. After years of resistance, the Pakistani government is formalising its stance on digital assets. The establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority and plans to launch a Central Bank Digital Currency by this year mark a significant policy reversal. Further legitimising this shift is the Pakistan Crypto Council, led by Bilal Bin Saqib, who recently signed Letters of Intent with both El Salvador and World Liberty Financial. El Salvador was the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. With its Bitcoin reserves now valued at over $760 million—nearly triple their original investment—Pakistan sees a model of financial sovereignty and growth through crypto. Saqib described the partnership as a “strategic relationship rooted in innovation, inclusion, and shared learning,” adding that El Salvador's “bold Bitcoin experiment has inspired governments around the world.” El Salvador's experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender has failed. The country has reversing its decision to make Bitcoin a mandatory form of payment. Bitcoin adoption rates remained low, concerned over volatility reigned supreme, and technical issues with the Chivo wallet could never really be fixed. More controversial is the deal with WLF, a DeFi platform backed by US President Donald Trump's family. These discussions led to an agreement that outlines key areas of cooperation aimed at advancing Pakistan's digital finance ecosystem. Further, it seeks to expand the use of stablecoins for cross-border remittances and trade to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The optimism from the government and crypto leaders is palpable, but this rapid embrace of digital currencies is not without serious risks. Pakistan faces several critical risks as it moves toward deeper integration with cryptocurrency initiatives. The country remains in the early stages of developing a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework, creating a regulatory vacuum that could allow for unchecked growth. Without strong oversight, the rapid adoption of digital assets might facilitate fraud, capital flight and money laundering. Another major concern is the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Sudden price crashes could wipe out billions in perceived wealth, potentially triggering widespread financial panic and undermining public trust in emerging financial technologies. Geopolitically, Pakistan's close alignment with the Trump-backed WLF may carry unintended consequences. A shift in political leadership in Washington could weaken support, while global institutions such as the IMF—already critical of Pakistan's fiscal management—may view the partnership as a destabilising move. This could detract from critical efforts to strengthen traditional industries, enhance export capacity and build a more resilient and diversified economy. Yet, despite these risks, Pakistan's limited options are pushing it toward cryptocurrency. As traditional finance mechanisms fail to meet citizens' needs, the decentralised economy offers both hope and hazard. However, this step is born more out of necessity than choice. Soaring inflation, geopolitical pressures and a weak rupee have made crypto a survival tool for citizens and an innovation imperative for the state. But it is undeniably tethered to it and the government's growing entanglement with blockchain and DeFi may determine whether the country navigates through crisis or plunges deeper into instability. In a world where digital assets are reshaping global finance, Pakistan may be among the first developing nations to bet its economic future on the blockchain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash, is responsible for the crypto "mixing" service. He is charged with laundering more than $1 billion in dirty cash—money linked to North Korean hackers. The last witness was Andre Marcus Quiddaoen Llacuna, a 23-year-old convicted NFT scammer, who testified as part of a government cooperation agreement. Llacuna gave an inside perspective on how Tornado Cash supposedly aided him and other actors to mask the source of stolen crypto. Llacuna admitted to defrauding investors in a now-defunct NFT initiative named Frosties, selling 8,888 NFTs under pretenses of an impending game and breeding mechanics with a partner. Asked how he "cleaned" the money, Llacuna replied matter-of-factly: Read more: Fartcoin Blows Up: This Ridiculous Meme Crypto Just Surpassed Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Prosecutors also introduced testimony from victims and investigators who tried to reclaim stolen money, only to be ignored or dismissed by Tornado Cash. In another case, crypto exchange BitMart's lawyer, Joseph B. Evans, testified that hackers made off with $196 million on the platform in 2021. However, he was greeted with a dry reply, which only says that "Tornado Cash is a decentralized computer software program that no one can control." Storm, who is running an unlicensed money transfer business and evading federal sanctions, has refuted that he didn't do anything wrong. His attorney, Keri Curtis Axel, defended that Roman can't do anything to prevent bad actors because he just wrote the software.
