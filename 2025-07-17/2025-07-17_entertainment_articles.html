                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said the giant streamer remains indifferent to legacy media networks even as a record number of companies seem to be peeling them off or putting them up for sale. “We agree continued consolidation of studio and network assets is likely, but at least with respect to consolidation within legacy media, we don't think it materially changes the competitive landscape,” said Neuman on a Q&A with analysts after Netflix's latest quarterly earnings. “We've historically been more builders than buyers, and we continue to see big runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook.” Netflix's High Threshold: Canceled Series 'The Residence', 'Pulse' & 'The Recruit' All In Top 35 For 2025, Data Reveals As 'KPop Demon Hunters' Sings On Netflix, Ted Sarandos Talks Up Original Animated Features Comcast is in the process of spinning out NBCUniversal's cable networks into a standalone public company called Versant. Discovery is doing the same with its networks. Disney and Hearst have floated the possibility of unloading A+E Global Media. M&A opportunities abound for Netflix or other tech companies to swoop. “We look at a lot of things,” said Neumann. “We apply a framework or lens to those opportunities. You know, we've been pretty clear in the past that we also have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so that also kind of reduces the funnel for us.” We're predominantly focused on growing that organically, investing aggressively and responsibly into that growth and returning excess cash to shareholders through share purchase. And I think you'll see us continue on that path.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire The Late Show franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. The statement was made by George Cheeks, Co-CEO Paramount Global and President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS; Amy Reisenbach, President of CBS Entertainment; and David Stapf, President of CBS Studios. Colbert, who announced the news during tonight's taping, said that he was grateful to CBS for giving him the chair. “I'm not being replaced, this is all just going away,” Colbert said. The CBS execs said this was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night” and “is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” With Jon Stewart having signed another deal to remain as one of the hosts of The Daily Show on Paramount-owned sister network Comedy Central until the end of 2025, could Colbert take the reins of that other storied late-night franchise? It also comes days after Colbert, who was a Daily Show correspondent from 1997-2005, called Paramount Global's $16M settlement of Donald Trump's lawsuit a “big fat bribe.” In fact, tonight's guest was Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who alluded to the possibility that there were nefarious reasons behind the cancelation. He tweeted: “Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled. The Late Show began in August 1993 with David Letterman as host, having moved over from NBC after he didn't get The Tonight Show gig. Colbert's old friend Jon Stewart weighed in earlier today on the possibility that Skydance might cancel The Daily Show when it takes over. It's a brutal blow for late-night, which has already been struggling in recent years with CBS recently axing After Midnight, the show that replaced The Late Late Show with James Corden instead of replacing host Taylor Tomlinson. A post shared by The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. While I'm sad for Colbert, haven't watched a late night show since Leno and Letterman called it a day. I won't miss him and his corny jokes about our president.

We all knew Coldplay concerts were a buzzworthy affair, but who knew the band would out an actual affair? That's what concertgoers are saying after a couple — identified as Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the company's chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot — were caught on the jumbotron in an intimate embrace during Coldplay's show in Boston Wednesday night. Their initially sweet reaction instantly turned to shock as they ducked and hid their faces from the camera, while frontman Chris Martin declared on stage, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,” according to social media videos. Byron appears to be married, while Cabot is reportedly recently divorced. Still, the caught-on-camera moment has gone viral, with commentators having a field day online. One savvy Etsy seller has also jumped on the bandwagon, offering merch that reads “I Took My Sidepiece To The Coldplay Concert And It Ruined My Life” (see it here). Ah yes, the classic moustache, eyebrows and dark-rimmed glasses disguise! Amazon has this version on sale for just $5 and the site says more than 200 people have purchased it in the last few weeks alone, though we can't be sure exactly why… See more novelty disguises here. Amazon also sells this pullover mask, which can be customized with a face photo of your choice. This Amazon deal gets you a two-pack of polarized sunglasses in a classic Wayfarer-style silhouette so you can stay looking cool — and loved up discreetly.Bonus: take an additional 10% off with promo code 6N7Z4KQU at checkout. We like this camo-print shirt, which comes in an contemporary, oversized fit. This would probably help you blend in well to a Coldplay concert at an outdoor amphitheater or music festival. The now-viral moment has already made its way into fashion. As the product description on Etsy states, “Whether you lived it or just love chaos, this tee is a whole mood. Inspired by the now-legendary viral tweet, this hilarious and slightly tragic shirt is perfect for those who love drama (from a distance), heartbreak, or just really ironic fashion.” Of course, the best way to fit it (or blend in) at a Coldplay concert is by sporting their official merch, and Amazon has a number of Coldplay T-shirts, hoodies and accessories available online. Another Amazon merch exclusive is this Coldplay Moon Music hoodie, which is made from a cozy cotton blend material with kangaroo pockets and a drawstring hood. If you're really desperate to stay anonymous, you can always pull a balaclava over your head but uh… wear at your own risk: you may not even be able to get into the stadium wearing this, let alone make it onto the jumbotron. And if you really want to avoid getting into a similar situation, consider re-upping your HR knowledge. I'm sure it says somewhere in the manual that employees should not be cuddling with their boss.

Thirty-three years after “Basic Instinct” sent shockwaves through American culture with its explicit depictions of sex and violence, The Wrap has reported Amazon MGM Studios' United Artists and producer Scott Stuber has acquired the rights to a reboot straight from the film‘s screenwriter Joe Eszterhas. The movie doesn't have a title yet, nor are any details yet available of whether it is more of a sequel or a remake — other than it is reportedly going to be “anti-woke.” Upon its original release, the film did receive backlash from the LGBTQ+ community and feminists. Nick Nesbitt and Craig Baumgarten are also on board as producers of the reboot, with Adam Griffin serving as executive producer. Related Stories Connie Francis Was a Movie Star, Too: A Remembrance As APAC's VFX Industry Soars, How High Can It Climb? Eszterhas made similar bank on the original film with a then-record $3 million for his script. “Basic Instinct” was not only one of the highest grossing films of 1992, it also is one of the most successful R-rated films of all time — though it was almost rated NC-17 before director Paul Verhoeven made minor cuts to get it to the more box office-friendly R. The salacious erotic thriller finds Michael Douglas' Detective Nick Curran caught in a sexual game of cat-and-mouse with alleged killer and crime novelist Catherine Tramell, played in a truly iconic performance by Sharon Stone — who was far from the first choice for the role. “I wanted to play her so badly that I had the script on top of my refrigerator for eight months. I just kept thinking, ‘I'm going to manifest this, I'm going to get this part,' as they offered it to everybody else on the planet,” she told THR in 2024. “As I walked down the carpet in Cannes and a thousand people started chanting my name, I had such a surge of relief come over me, such a feeling of calm,” she recalled. This isn't the first time an attempt at revitalizing “Basic Instinct” has been made. Notoriously, in 2006, Stone returned for “Basic Instinct 2,” a film that was derided by critics and ignored by audiences, grossing only $38.8 million worldwide, versus its predecessor's $352.9 million. Reports so far indicate Stone “could” return. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korean indie rock four-piece Silica Gel have tapped Japanese Breakfast's Michelle Zauner for a new song titled “NamgungFefere.” “This was the first time I've ever written lyrics in Korean,” Zauner shared in a press statement. “Anyone who's familiar with my work knows how much my Korean heritage has come to mean to me, so it was very personal to collaborate with such a revered Korean band and to create something for a larger Korean audience.” Watch the music video for “NamgungFefere,” directed by Jan' Qui, below. Zauner has kept busy since releasing her latest Japanese Breakfast LP, For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women), in March. She's shared music videos for the album tracks “Picture Window” and “Winter in LA,” covered Gorillaz's “On Melancholy Hill” during her Coachella 2025 set, and contributed a song to the soundtrack for Celine Song's new film Materialists. Zauner's ongoing international tour will return to North America in August. Read about Japanese Breakfast's “Be Sweet” at No. 85 on “The 100 Best Songs of the 2020s So Far.” All rights reserved.

After 15 months of legal disputes, the conflict between HYBE and former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin has entered a new chapter. Police officials in Seoul announced on Tuesday (July 15) that they will drop two criminal complaints filed by HYBE against Min for alleged breach of duty. Min stepped down from her position as an internal director at ADOR in November 2024 and officially left the company after her request for reinstatement as the label's CEO was denied.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jon Stewart may or may not be on the Paramount chopping block, but regardless, he's taking the whole mountain down with him. The often irascible host has not minced words when it comes to Paramount's, his show's parent company, “shameful,” “illegal” $16 million settlement with Donald Trump. Now, he's turning his signature harsh-but-fair attitude on Comedy Central, which actually airs The Daily Show, as he fields questions about whether or not the chiefs of potential Paramount owner Skydance would be inclined to keep such a rabble-rouser on the payroll. “Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” Stewart said of his not-yet-new bosses, on a recent episode of his The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart podcast (via Deadline). But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of shittier establishments than that. The “shitty establishment” Stewart is referencing seems to be Paramount as a whole, though he doesn't spare Comedy Central either. Comedy Central is kind of like muzak at this point,” he continued. “I think we're the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park. The TV schedule for tomorrow, for example, features a re-run of Digman!, followed by four hours of South Park, followed by old episodes of Seinfeld, Futurama, and The Office, with some Family Guy thrown in for kicks at the end. South Park, of course, is also having its own issues with the company right now. They may sell the whole fucking place for parts, I just don't know. Eyes are also on Stephen Colbert, another outspoken Trump critic under the Paramount umbrella. It seems they're just going to keep doing their thing, capitulating leadership or not. “I'm so happy and proud of everybody that works over there. “As Jay Leno would say about Doritos, go ahead, crunch all you want, we'll make more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While speaking to Entertainment Tonight about new movie Happy Gilmore 2, in which Travis Kelce makes a cameo, the actor-comedian only had kind things to say about the tight end and his superstar girlfriend, Taylor Swift. “They have met, and Taylor's incredible,” the Sand Man replied. “Taylor's so damn nice to my family and has always been,” he continued. Sandler has long been open about his family's love for Swift. In February 2024, he confessed to Conan O'Brien that the 14-time Grammy winner is a rare celebrity around whom he still gets “jumpy,” purely because of how much she means to his girls. Later that year — shortly after Sandler announced that Travis would appear in Happy Gilmore 2 — the Grown Ups actor echoed those thoughts on the Kansas City Chiefs star's New Heights podcast with Jason Kelce. “I do get nervous around Taylor Swift, because I don't want to f–king blow it for my kids and say something stupid.” And in an interview with Billboard last August, Sandler revealed his favorite song of Swift's. “Everything [my two daughters] throw on I love, but one of the first ones they threw on when they were young was ‘The Best Day,'” he said. Every album, we listen the first day it comes out. There's not a song they don't know every word to.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drew Pearce, whose screenwriting credits include 'Fall Guy' and 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,' is attached to write the script. Waititi, the Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit filmmaker, is attached to direct a new feature film take on Dredd, the popular and violent British comic book character. Drew Pearce, the scribe known for his action movie-filled resume thanks to titles such as Fall Guy and Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, is attached to write the script. Joanna Bacon, British Actress Known for 'Love Actually' and 'Breeders,' Dies at 72 Producers include Dredd rights holders Chris Kingsley, Jason Kingsley and Ben Smith of Rebellion Developments, Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment, Jeremy Platt, Natalie Viscuso and Pearce. Sources say Pearce and Waititi both grew up with the books and are friends who have been trying to find a project to work on together for years. Created in the late 1970s by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, Dredd debuted in the pages of weekly British anthology 2000 AD. He is a police officer in the bleak future metropolis of Mega-City One, part of a law enforcement corps that empowers officers to be judge, jury, and executioner. It is said that over 100,000,000 comics and graphic novels have been sold. More warmly was the reception for Dredd, a 2012 adaptation that starred Karl Urban with a script by Alex Garland, the writer behind 28 Days Later, who also wrote and directed Civil War. The desire is to see the movie launch a Dredd universe that could be explored with additional movies and shows across various platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Destroy Lonely performed last week at a music festival called Beach, Please! According to footage from the festival's livestream, the Opium rapper stopped his set after performing “Blitz” to call up a fan whom he said had a sign indicating he wanted to be onstage. Once together, Destroy Lonely told the young man, “When this motherfucker drop, I need you to jump right back in there with your friends. He eventually jumped off with Destroy Lonely seemingly helping to prep him offstage. Additional footage shows that the young man landed nearly directly on a barricade. Observator spoke with the young man, whom the Romanian news outlet identified as a 15-year-old named Nicolas. I thought that if I don't get help here, these will be my last moments.” Nicolas also claimed that he told Destroy Lonely that he did not want to jump, but the rapper insisted that he get himself off the stage. When reached by Pitchfork, representatives for Beach, Please! Our on-site medical teams intervened within seconds, providing immediate and professional care. We are relieved and grateful to report that he is now in stable condition, recovering well, and expected to make a full recovery. Throughout this time, we have remained in close contact with his family, offering our full support. His wellbeing continues to be our highest priority. We fully respect the family's privacy and will not be disclosing any contact details. Beyond medical assistance, we acted immediately to strengthen safety protocols. That very night, we implemented a strict no-access policy for fans on stage during any artist performance. This rule was promptly communicated to all artist teams, security providers, and production staff. Any breach of this policy will now carry immediate consequences. Across multiple days of programming and dozens of high-energy shows, this was the only such incident reported. Major artists such as A$AP Rocky, Yeat, Lil Tecca, Ken Carson, and Lil Baby performed alongside Destroy Lonely without any similar occurrences. We believe festivals must lead by example when it comes to care, responsibility, and respect for the crowd. This incident has only strengthened our commitment to those values.

Elmo's Fire.” Just for good measure, “E.T.” was re-released into theaters that weekend. To have a brand-new, wide release film finish 14th at the box office, and then, 40 years later, for it to still be culturally important enough to warrant a gigantic retrospective piece with the cast and crew of that film, which is what you are currently reading. Related Stories ‘Basic Instinct' Is Getting an ‘Anti-Woke' Reboot by OG Screenwriter and Amazon MGM's United Artists Connie Francis Was a Movie Star, Too: A Remembrance But this all seems appropriate for “The Legend of Billie Jean,” a story of a young woman with no agency, completely ignored and discarded, who slowly develops an underground cult following, while becoming an inspiration to young people (and especially women) across the country. Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner's original script for the film was inspired by the story of Phoolan Devi, an Indian icon and eventual member of parliament who defied authority and developed an underground following. (Her story is pretty fascinating and, ultimately, tragic.) For “The Legend of Billie Jean” (originally titled “Legend” until the Ridley Scott, Tom Cruise movie came out), Phoolan Devi of India became Billie Jean Davy of Corpus Christi, Texas. (Though, as I learned the hard way, not everyone involved is thrilled about this anniversary.) “I was attracted to the screenplay because I hadn't seen anything like it, the empowerment of a female. And everybody in the movie was young and powerless,” said director Matthew Robbins in a recent interview with IndieWire. It's kind of a forcefield the kids are up against.” In “The Legend of Billie Jean,” Binx Davy (Christian Slater, in his very first film role) gets beaten up by some local bullies and has his prized red Honda Elite scooter vandalized. Mr. Pyatt agrees to pay but, in the process of this apparent negotiation, sexually assaults Billie Jean. An enraged Binx picks up Mr. Pyatt's gun, which he believes to be unloaded, and accidentally shoots Mr. Pyatt in the shoulder. “As a mythologist now, I don't think you can underestimate that female empowerment,” Helen Slater, who, yes, recently finished her doctorate degree in mythology, told IndieWire. “I usually don't use that language, but for the sake of this, this idea of you don't feel you have much agency in your life, and the movie says, well, maybe not so much.” “Because I came up in the ‘80s, I was so used to all the female characters being secretaries, wives, much more incidental.” Robbins was coming off directing “Dragonslayer” (a very different movie), but the script reminded him of themes he explored in one of his previous screenplays. “I was fascinated with notoriety getting confused with fame,” said Robbins, “which was exactly the same issue in “The Sugarland Express. Robbins co-wrote “The Sugarland Express,” a 1974 film that Steven Spielberg directed just before he exploded with “Jaws” the next year. It stars Goldie Hawn and William Atherton, who become outlaws over a child custody battle. Still, Robbins felt the original script needed a rewrite in order to get the tone and humanity he was looking for. Jon Peters, at the time said, ‘Work with whoever you want.' Walter Bernstein was hired and the two of us reworked it.” (Don't worry, there are plenty of Jon Peters stories still coming.) (Though, Robbins did try to get the title and name of the character changed because of the, you know, still extremely popular Michael Jackson song that came out a couple of years earlier. Bernstein, who was Robbins' longtime mentor, had previously written “The Front” and Marilyn Monroe's unfinished last film, “Something's Got to Give.” And, notably, he was also one of the writers blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Helen Slater sees a lot of Bernstein's point of view in the finished film: “It's not about a blacklisted screenwriter, but it had those seeds of when the culture, when the conditioning [is in a certain place], you get locked out. Helen shares a lovely scene with Keith Gordon where she's really wondering, Who am I? As Billie Jean and the group go on the run across a steamy Texas summer, they eventually find refuge in what they think is an empty mansion. They don't realize that a somewhat eccentric young man (when we first meet him, he's wearing an elaborate Wolfman costume) named Lloyd (Gordon) is still at home. Keith Gordon: “It's better than being remembered as dumb. Of course, Lloyd immediately falls in love with Billie Jean, but he's not the typical ‘80s boyfriend we usually saw in films of this era. But that doesn't mean Gordon (who had previously starred in “Christine” and “Dressed to Kill”) didn't have to convince producer Peters he was “sexy” enough for the role. Gordon recalled, “I remember Matthew and them prepping me, ‘This is what they're looking for and this is what they're afraid of'. Which was less having fun and more being cool. It felt so goofy, but I wanted to get the part.” What's it like having to convince Jon Peters that you are “sexy”? I went to his house, this gigantic mansion. We sat and had iced tea, or whatever. “And it's not really my personality to go, ‘Oh, yeah.' Meeting Lloyd doesn't just add a love story subplot to the film, it also leads directly into one of the film's most enduring sequences. Matthew Robbins: “Jon Peters was from the world of hairdressing. So, the issue of Helen and her haircut assumed enormous proportions. Yeardley Smith: “I remember that night she cut her hair.” Matthew Robbins: “He wanted to — and a matter of fact, did — send his own choice of hairdresser to Corpus Christi. Only the ‘very best' could be responsible for cutting her hair.” Helen Slater: “Our wonderful hairdresser, Lynn Del Kail, it probably was not great she couldn't do that moment.” Keith Gordon: “At the time, I felt like it was a Hollywood sellout. I remember I was like, ‘Yeah, they should just give Helen a pair of scissors and [let her] cut her own hair.' I was all in with the part, where I was and being so young and getting the lead in a movie. Keith Gordon: “I remember at the time being like, this is silly! Who would cut their own hair and have it be so perfect? Matthew Robbins: “It wasn't a good thing. It led to so much tension and chaos. It was an issue that should not have led to so much paranoia and expense.” Helen Slater: “That haircut … it wasn't wrong, exactly. Yeardley Smith: “I remember they wanted me to cut my hair. The solution was — I had long hair and my hair was thick — so if I wore that cheesy blazer with the collar flipped up, put the wig on, my hair was down my back in that scene on the beach.” “It felt different from a lot of movies I saw as a kid, in that it made kid problems feel very adult, but somehow mythical,” said Oscar-nominated screenwriter and noted “Billie Jean” fan, Emily V. Gordon. Like most of us who love this movie, the “Big Sick” writer first discovered Robbins' film on a seemingly never-ending loop on HBO. “These were kids dealing with sexual assault, poverty, physical abuse, being wrongly accused, and going viral before that was a thing,” she told IndieWire. “And though all those stakes felt intensely real, they also felt like problems you could overcome by the very nature of being a kid. What also makes “The Legend of Billie Jean” unique is its portrayal of something that we hear a lot about today: “strong female characters.” Back then, outside of notable exceptions like “Alien” and “The Terminator,” these kinds of mainstream action movies did not really attempt to do this, let alone feature multiple women as part of the main group. Even today, the male interpretation of “strong female character” just means she can beat up a bunch of guys. “Through the whole movie there's a female sensibility,” said Keith Gordon. “That would have been the other cliche Hollywood construction: it would have been Helen, a boyfriend, maybe the younger brother. There are a couple of scenes in “Billie Jean” that really illustrate this. In one, Billie Jean is recognized by some neighborhood kids who ask for her help in confronting a local resident who is abusing his young son. In a bad movie, Billie Jean would kick the father's ass. What actually happens in the film is much more nuanced: she simply steps into his house and makes it clear she (and everyone else) know what he's doing. “That's one of my favorite scenes in the movie actually,” said Robbins. “I ended up working with that actor several times, John Jackson, lovely guy. But she does it with a quiet, ‘I see you. Today, he would be bloody on the floor in a heap.” In another scene after an intense shootout, Smith's character, Putter, is bleeding. At first, the group thinks she may have been shot. Instead, it turns out she's just had her first period. It probably really doesn't need to be said there's really nothing else like this scene, in this kind of movie, at that time or now. “I remember people asking me, are we really going to shoot that?,” said Robbins. Where do we go that no one can anticipate?” Slater added, “When we're there as the actors just shooting it, it just feels like, ‘Well, this is what this scene is,' as if we're doing a play. I don't think we had the brainpower or the insight to be like, ‘Whoa, I don't see this very often.' Somewhere we knew, we had a hunch, this is kind of cool, because it's touching on something real, and how great it is to have that wrapped up in this fable about someone not having agency, to having agency over something and inspiring other people when that happens. “I actually don't like that scene,” said the actress. “Just, to me, look, it's fine that she gets her period. The bullet would have come into her head! Nobody in the history of the world who gets their period would, first thing they say, be, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' “I can't go with Yeardley on that one,” said Keith Gordon. “Teen girls would watch this and go, ‘That's so cool.' And the idea of, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' There wasn't a lot of treating girls the way boys were treated.” I presented the question of this scene to, again, noted “Billie Jean” fan Emily V. Gordon. “Everyone is entitled to feel however they want about it,” she said. I mean, movies still shy away from putting menstruation in our entertainment. Treat something like a shameful secret, it stays one! Thematically and emotionally, I love that it's a reflection of how young these children are, and also of how they care for each other. This experience is growing them all up very quickly, and that's true of getting your period, too. But it's also just an audacious beat to put in a shoot-out scene. I mentioned earlier that not everyone is thrilled about this anniversary of “The Legend of Billie Jean.” In the course of my prep work, I reached out to the reps for both of the film's credited screenwriters Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner. Keith Gordon even mentioned, “When I first read the script, it felt like in spots it was a little more satiric and a little more double-edged. That the whole thing was about a scooter. There was more dark humor, which I loved. And when we made it, that wasn't there as much.” Eventually, I heard from Mark Rosenthal via text message (for the life of me, I don't know how he got my number, but that's beside the point). He told me whatever I had heard about the movie so far was “distorted,” that Matthew Robbins fired him and was “clueless,” and then directed me to his website, where he had just written a long essay about his experience on the film. Would've been a much better film with me on it. (I'm actually in talks for a possible stage version.) !–confirms again the media press disrespects writers and does not understand how movies get made. Sorry to be snarky but it's my story.” It seems Rosenthal mistook an unidentified “he” earlier in the text thread as meaning Walter Bernstein, not Matthew Robbins, as I had intended. The last I heard from him was, “Then your noun pronoun agreement needs work. These are the words of Christian Slater when I interviewed him a couple of years ago as he was promoting the Disney+ show, “Willow.” I brought up “The Legend of Billie Jean,” both because I love the film and, I like to think, I had a premonition I'd one day work on a piece like this very one and it might be tough to get to talk to him again. I followed up by asking if he had a crush on Helen. After I joked about them being just being close siblings in the film, he continued, “No, no, just brother and sister hanging out, playing and splashing, and having a great time. No, I had nothing but love for her.” If it ever comes on I need to take a look at that. I just thought we were a very close brother and sister!” Smith added, “She really thought of him like a little brother. But I am actually not at all surprised to find out he had a crush on her.” And Keith Gordon agreed, “I don't remember that at all! What can you say, the camera likes him. He was really growing up fast on that movie. His mother was a quite well-established casting director out of New York, but he was there without a parent or guardian. Keith Gordon recalled what it was like to see that in action. “He's a teenager and all these girls are like, ‘Hi, you're in a movie and I want to hang out with you.' He was like 15 or 16 and all these girls were in love with him. I did a little bit of older brother stuff.” And then there was the whole issue of, as Christian Slater alluded to, that he and Helen shared a last name and played siblings in the film, but were not related in real life. When we were doing prep on this I had to constantly explain, no, no, we didn't plan this.” “But once you start talking [to them], it became very evident in like three minutes that they are not related.” While Christian Slater and Keith Gordon were bonding, Helen Slater, Yeardley Smith, and Martha Gehman were also becoming fast friends. “Helen was the only one who had a car. “Christian didn't really want to hang out with the girls. He was like, ‘Oh, God, why am I here?' I'll just say this, there was no potato in the group. We were shooting all day and there wasn't much downtime. I don't know if Matthew said this, but we had to get more tan because we were ‘New York City tan. '” (“'NYC tans,' that does sound like me,” said Robbins.) “That was my first introduction to blackened anything! Actually, I remember, ‘Supergirl' came out while we were shooting, so we all went to a matinee to see it. Recently, Helen Slater found herself back near Corpus Christi. It was like walking into a ghost town.” Why do so many people today still love this movie that, almost literally, no one saw in theaters? How did this movie predict the internet, with a woman going viral with her own hashtag (“What's fair is fair”)? And what made Matthew Robbins so equipped to tell such a feminine story? Helen Slater tried to put this in context: “If I just take a stab at it, without disagreeing with what Matthew is saying, he was a relational guy. He was sort of like a dad to us. He obviously wasn't old enough to be our dad, but he had a grounded-ness about him that had not been infected by the Hollywood grind.” Lots of men have not directed women well. Obviously, I don't think men shouldn't be able to direct women, because that would be a difficult world, but I do think female characters in Hollywood films have often been afterthoughts. I don't think that's ever been part of Matthew's writing, and he treated his male and female characters as equally as valuable. There weren't a lot of other movies that had a young woman who was strong and smart and somebody that if you were 13 or 14 or 15, you'd see in a movie and go, ‘I want to be like her. (An example: There's a scene near the end of the film in which Christian Slater's character, Binx, gets shot. As they were getting ready to shoot this scene, Robbins heard from the studio that he was not allowed to film this scene. He was told the most he can do is have Binx be shot with “a bean bag gun.” Anyway, assuming you've seen the film, Robbins won this argument.) Yeardley Smith: “People accost me with the line, ‘When can I get a diaphragm?' It's great to be accosted with that line in the produce aisle.” Keith Gordon: “The film was a huge disaster when it came out. And the reviews were terrible, which didn't help. We didn't have any kind of major star and I don't think they had any idea how to market it. I think its fate was sealed literally before it even opened.” Yeardley Smith: “I really thought this movie is going to make me a star. Though, I had quite a few movies at the beginning of my career that I thought would make me a star and didn't. At least ‘The Legend of Billie Jean' is enormously charming.” Helen Slater: “I don't want to put down any classic 1980s male directors, but if you think of some of those more bombastic ‘80s movies, if they had been at the helm, it probably would have gone a direction where you don't get that relational quality. Yeardley Smith: “It happens with ‘The Simpsons' daily. The show means so much to people, Lisa Simpson in particular. People are like, ‘She got me through so many hard times,' or, ‘I took up an instrument because of her,' or, ‘I became a writer,' or whatever the thing is. You do it because you love it, but the fact it can have a positive impact and mean something to somebody else who you've never met is icing on icing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Things have changed a lot since Star Trek: Strange New Worlds aired its cliffhanger season-two finale back in August 2023. Seasons three and four were basically shot back-to-back, with production on the final batch of episodes set to begin later this year. For another, more so than any other Trek show, Strange New Worlds has always been building toward a set endpoint. Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) has known his fiery future since he set foot on the Enterprise for his final five-year mission. Martin Quinn's Montgomery Scott joined at the end of last season, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get a Sulu or even a (slightly timeline bending) Chekov before this one is over. (It feels like Bones has to be last, right?) Where a lot of Trek shows are about limitless potential, Strange New Worlds has always been a true prequel running on limited time. And, in a way, I think knowing things are ending is only going to make the final run of episodes that much stronger. True, I suspect that if the show knew it would be taking a two-year strike-induced delay between its second and third seasons, it probably wouldn't have ended on a cliffhanger. (It's crazy to think there were only three months between the Locutus of Borg twist and its resolution in Next Gen's “The Best Of Both Worlds.”) But I suspect that's part of the reason we're getting a two-episode premiere this week. To that end, “Hegemony, Part II” opens with the sort of big impressive space battle that has become a hallmark of Alex Kurtzman-era Trek. Immediate crisis averted, there are three dangling problems for the intrepid Enterprise crew to work through after their terrifying experience on the mid-century-inspired human colony Parnassus Beta. On the medical-drama side, Pike's girlfriend Captain Marie Batel (Melanie Scrofano) has been infected with Gorn eggs that will hatch in less than a day. On the action-movie front, security chief La'An Noonien-Singh (Christina Chong), Dr. Joseph M'Benga (Babs Olusanmokun), helmsman Erica Ortegas (Melissa Navia), and xenoanthropologist Samuel Kirk (Dan Jeannotte) have been taken aboard a Gorn ship to be harvested. While Strange New Worlds' second season was filled with high points (I'm still smiling thinking about the Lower Decks crossover episode), it also sometimes felt like a selection of special, high-concept character episodes strung together rather than a true ensemble show. “Hegemony, Part II,” however, gives everyone a chance to shine by pairing them up in clever ways—from Scotty's funny but also quietly heartbreaking dynamic with his ageless former engineering professor Pelia (Carol Kane) to Spock (Ethan Peck) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Jess Bush) going full Grey's Anatomy melodrama in the sick bay. My favorite is actually the La'An/M'Benga/Ortegas/Sam quartet just because it's so unexpected. I feel like there are characters in that group we've barely seen interact before, but thrusting them together into a high-stakes escape mission highlights both what they bring to the table as individuals and how Starfleet's collaborative nature allows any set of the Enterprise crew to work in harmony. Even in their greatest moments of trauma, the Enterprise crew are still thinking about others—like Ortegas fighting through her life-threatening injuries to fly her friends to safety. That's what happens when Pike realizes that Una and Uhura's research into Gorn hibernation/hunting patterns could be the key to stopping a full-on armada invasion of Federation space. More than anything, “Hegemony, Part II” is an episode about relying on faith to get you through seemingly impossible odds. And while you could imagine a different version of this episode that lets at least one thing go wrong (particularly Spock and Chapel's improvisational surgery on Batel), it feels right that a big splashy premiere lets our heroes win on every front. There will presumably be days when the Enterprise can't do it all. The time jump also gives Nurse Chapel the chance to return from her archeological medicine fellowship with her new boyfriend Dr. Roger Korby (Cillian O'Sullivan) in tow. As with the premiere, however, there is a real ensemble focus here. It's not just Spock who gets in on the hijinks this week. Uhura flirts with Ortegas' filmmaker little brother Beto (Mynor Luken)! The sick bay adds an adorable new nurse (Chris Myers)! Compared to all that, Spock's arc is downright dramatic at first, as he basically lives through the Joseph Gordon-Levitt plot of (500) Days Of Summer—watching the non-committal woman he thought he could win over instead get serious with someone else. But that all changes when an impish bartender (Rhys Darby styled like Trelane, the all-powerful 19th century fanboy from the original series episode “The Squire Of Gothos”) pours him a drink that seems to port him over to an alternate universe where Spock and Chapel are getting married. Though I was expecting Spock to be shocked waking up next to Chapel, at first it's only Korby who realizes this isn't an alternate timeline but a mass delusion cast over all the guests at the gala. It's not totally dissimilar from when M'Benga and Hemmer were the only two people who realized something was amiss when the Enterprise turned into a children's fairy tale back in season one. Only here there's a much more compelling reason for Spock and Korby to be paired together. This isn't an episode about Chapel choosing between the two men—she's already made that choice. But it is an episode about Spock coming to understand what Chapel sees in Korby, who's devoted, pragmatic, funny, and relatably exacerbated throughout the whole madcap experience. (As in his brief role on Daredevil: Born Again, O'Sullivan has an insane amount of onscreen charisma.) With its focus on canapés and bachelor parties, “Wedding Bell Blues” mostly keeps things in goofy Father Of The Bride comedy mode rather than delving too deep into its character work. And it's genuinely heartbreaking to watch Spock break the spell by repeating the Pablo Neruda poetry he knows will remind Chapel of her love for Korby. And “Wedding Bell Blues” emphasizes that understated character trait within an over-the-top comedic setting. It's also a really nice touch to bring everything back to Spock and La'An—both because it returns to their newfound ballroom dancing partnership and because we know she experienced a similar kind of heartbreak in the musical episode, when Kirk revealed he's dating a pregnant Carol Marcus. Spock and La'An know what it's like to feel a connection that doesn't work out because of bad timing. And their burgeoning friendship is another lovely example of Strange New Worlds mixing up its ensemble in unexpected new ways this season. As for the cause of all that wedding chaos? It seems like Strange New Worlds might be tying two of its iconic all-powerful imps together. Only this one is voiced by John de Lancie, who's always said his performance as the all-powerful Next Gen antagonist Q was inspired by William Campbell's work as the similarly puckish Trelane. Q actually also had a son on Voyager, who popped up in petulant-teen form in the episode “Q2.” So this episode could be saying that Darby is literally Trelane who's also literally Q Junior. Nobody gets named, and Darby disguises himself to the crew so there's plausible deniability on all fronts. But, honestly, with all the Godlike Beings who popped up in the original series, why couldn't one of them have been a Q? In their own ways, “Hegemony, Part II” and “Wedding Bell Blues” are both optimistic episodes that serve as a welcome reminder of what Strange New Worlds does best. (And by that I mean having the whole cast dance to “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,” of course.) The final shot emphasizing Ortegas' Gorn-related PTSD suggests this season won't just be warm and fuzzy. But, for now, Strange New Worlds is here to remind us just how much fun it is to spend time with this crew. That's a great way to kick off this second half of the show's run.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While some had come to watch America's favorite pastime, others waited with bated breath, eyes on the digital screens set up around the arena — eager to see a diminutive anime girl with white hair and shark teeth appear. VTubers, or Virtual YouTubers, are not a new phenomenon, but have grown in popularity during Covid-19. On a basic level, they're just like any other creator on channels like YouTube or Twitch, generally hosting variety streams and playing video games while interacting with their fans. The main difference is that VTubers appear as customized 2D or 3D avatars, often concealing their identities in lieu of fictional personas that audiences connect with. VTubers across all regions have gained some recognition among international audiences. Gawr Gura, a fictional descendant from the Lost City of Atlantis, broke into the mainstream through her success streaming gameplay and releasing original music on YouTube before retiring in May 2025. Usada Pekora, a fictional rabbit girl, was nominated for Content Creator of the Year at The Game Awards in 2024 for her erratic and high energy gaming content, and has since appeared in this year's hit PlayStation title Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Perhaps the most well known is variety streamer Ironmouse, a virtual demon queen who briefly overtook massively popular creator Kai Cenat as the most subscribed streamer on Twitch. All of these content creators have something in common — they embody fantastical personalities via anime-esque avatars that blink and move and emote in sync with the real person behind them. There are dozens of VTuber talent agencies in operation, but three currently reign supreme: North America's VShojo, and the Japan-based pair of NIJISANJI and Cover Corp. (whose subsidiary Hololive primarily manages its VTuber clients). It's a big move for Japanese corporations like Cover Corp. and NIJISANJI, as many Japanese talent agencies, such as the widely popular and infamous Johnny's & Associates (that represent your more traditional, in-the-flesh idol), have remained focused solely on their domestic fan base, with no real consideration given to a broader, more international audience. But VShojo, founded in 2020, doesn't seem to mind that Hololive is encroaching upon its territory — at least according to CEO Justin “TheGunrun” Ignacio. “Our competition are people that I love,” Ignacio tells Rolling Stone. 'Donkey Kong Bananza' Is a Nintendo Platformer at the Height of Its Power ‘Donkey Kong Bananza' Makes Nintendo's Great Ape Into a King Again “For me, it was kind of like, ‘How do we bring VTubers to real life using this bonded LTE technology?,'” Ignacio says. Utilizing IRL streaming kits, VShojo provided a new way for fans to interact with VTubers like Ironmouse through the use of iPads and digital displays for on-location meet-and-greets at events like Anime Expo. While VTubers are entirely virtual creations, the ideas pioneered by Ignacio's agency have allowed them to have an in-person presence at conventions and awards shows that mirror what regular creators and online personalities can offer. Ignacio's background in streaming technology has been a boon for VShojo, allowing the agency to lean into their core strengths. It's a sentiment shared by VShojo's direct competition, Cover Corp. Unlike VShojo, Hololive has taken a more traditional approach to this model, expecting their virtual stars to speak multiple languages, sing, and dance on-stage in live performances — just like any other Japanese idol — albeit via motion capture that's displayed on giant screens. Having an office in North America would allow for the Japanese talent agency to properly support its overseas English-speaking talents like Ouro Kronii, Mori Calliope, and Ninomae Ina'nis, instead of churning out new VTubers, Cover Corp. can foster support and greater opportunities within the Western region. This expansion wouldn't be possible without Hololive's massive fanbase in both North America and Europe. While Hololive is indeed the largest VTuber talent agency within its home market, a majority of its revenue, estimated to be 1.57 billion yen (or around $10.8 million) in Q3 of 2025 based on the company's financial reports, comes from merchandise. The rest comes from merchandise, licensing, promotions, and other types of business components. Having a U.S. branch allows for us to focus on that B-to-B collaboration and will help bring us into the next stage and will expand our recognition in this market,” Tanigo states. We're not locked into what people have categorized us as. And I want us to be part of that story.” While CEOs like Ignacio and Tanigo are happy about the rapid growth of their industry, there's still a ways to go for VTubers breaking into popular culture. While the appearance of Hololive talent at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 2024 certainly spurred interest in the brand, she thinks it's a good step, but isn't quite enough to kick off mainstream appeal. “Unless [something] unprecedented happens, like if one of the top five pop stars in America collaborated with a VTuber talent, then I could see a much steeper incline for VTubers to break into the mainstream,” Calliope says. As one of Hololive's most popular talents, and the vocalist behind Warner Bros. Suicide Squad anime end credits, her hope is to one day collaborate with artists like Megan Thee Stallion or The Gorillaz. And while her production team did broach the idea of her performing at Coachella, Calliope didn't feel like it would be a good fit — instead looking for something that more or less aligned with her own interests, pursuing smaller venues like the Hollywood Palladium for her solo concert, “Grimoire.” However, VTubers are inching closer to what Calliope feels as a significant moment within the industry, with VShojo talent Ironmouse collaborating with musician bbno$ during one of his performances, with the song subsequently released to various streaming platforms some weeks after.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Find out why “DWTS” season 27 contestant Milo Manheim is fine with second place. Manheim and his “DWTS” season 27 dance pro partner Witney Carson came in second, but he wasn't too torn up about losing. During a July 2025 appearance on “The Zach Sang Show,” Manheim was asked if he's “haunted” by the loss. He also addressed how the “DWTS” voting system changed after his loss to Bobby Bones, who scored lower than Manheim. Manheim has discussed his “Zombies” co-star Chandler Kinney coming in third place during “DWTS” season 33. “I wasn't even worried for Chandler. I was like, ‘All right, she's going to avenge me.' And then, same thing happened to her. He added, “But I will say, I don't know, maybe it's just bias, but Chandler killed that thing and we just know how amazing she is at dancing.” “You know the ‘Zombies' curse on ‘Dancing With the Stars' is we're always going to be runner-up,” he said. As for the “Zombies” co-stars he would love to see take a spin on “DWTS,” the actor shared, “I would either send Meg [Donnelly] if she wanted to do it because [she] would redeem it for all of us and go win, or I would love to see Trevor [Tordjman].</p>
