                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Players like Jayson Tatum, Cooper Flagg, Juju Watkins and Cameron Boozer are among the recent notable winners. Looking to stamp her name next is women's soccer player Addison Halpern, who is one of the recipients for 2024-25 having logged 44 goals and 14 assists this past season despite missing the first six games due to representing the U.S. women's national team at the FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup. Halpern, who played for Rutgers Prep in Rochester, N.J., finished her high school career with 180 goals -- second in state history -- and 68 assists as she prepares for college. Halpern is still trying to wrap her head around the achievement. "It's hard to even think about it, and it's good to always take a step back and realize, like, what you're actually accomplishing," Halpern told NBCUniversal Local. "And I think we often look over that, and I've recently had some time to reflect on it. To even get the state one was an honor, and then I couldn't even think that wasn't even on my radar to get the national one.” Get Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. Where will Halpern take her game next? She's set to be a Cavalier at the University of Virginia, where she's maintaining high aspirations. “The goal is national championship at Virginia, obviously,” Halpern said. “But just taking it one game at a time and just making sure I'm developing while I'm there and and just having a good time and enjoying it while I can.” As part of winning the award, Gatorade invited Halpern and family to Los Angeles for a week-long experience leading up the ESPYs. Lisa Leslie, Karl-Anthony Towns and April Ross were among some of the stars in attendance. The list also included USWNT legend Abby Wambach, a Gatorade state winner who sat with Halpern and praised the New Jersey native for her goalscoring traits and achievements. If there's anyone who knows about scoring goals at high rates, it's Wambach. The 5-foot-11 forward scored 184 goals in 255 caps, currently the second most of all time in women's international soccer. As young forwards like Halpern and more seek to grow their game, Wambach offered deep insight beyond just the tactical aspect of the sport. "I think there's a thing that I've been thinking a lot about recently," Wambach started. One of the things that I think is happening a lot in the younger generation is it's like this dual perspective. And I think that there's a desire to not be as vulnerable. And in order to score goals at the highest level at a consistent rate, you have to literally open yourself up to the most kinds of vulnerability there is. "So, putting yourself out there and, like, planting a flag in the ground every single time you enter the field, that says I care more than everybody else. "It's like you wanna go out there and score. That it's like, the more you can open yourself up to utter annihilation, to me, the more goals you're gonna score." Hayes built a dominant team in England with Chelsea, and has brought over her expertise and success overseas. Wambach offered insight as to how Hayes is building her ideal World Cup team and beyond with a blend of ready-now youth and accomplished veterans. "And right now, in the last couple of months, since the Olympics, Emma has had an opportunity to see younger players who potentially could be a part of that core team. So some of the veteran players, you know, we've got players out, pregnancy leave, and some injuries, the 'Triple Espresso' [Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson], specifically. It's a unique opportunity for some of these other players to step in to grow themselves in the highest level of environment, of competition and difficulty. "So to me, Emma...she's sitting pretty. Now the expectations get reset, and they're quite high. And I think that they will always be high. And I'm just excited to see what happens because a lot can happen over the next 24 months leading into the women's World Cup in '27." Wambach also pointed out that there could be more players in both the NWSL and foreign leagues who are currently not in the picture that eventually breakthrough in time for the quadrennial tournament in Brazil. So much so that Wambach is uncertain how she would have fit in her prime. And so it's a lot more fun in some ways to watch, and sometimes I think we get a little too cute with it. That just will always be the case for me.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid were entirely outplayed in their Club World Cup semi with PSG. This poses more questions than answers over their 25/26 La Liga prospects. Despite Barcelona's financial issues, there's a sense of stability in Hansi Flick's squad now. They are our pre-season value pick for the 25/26 title. Correct at time of publishing and subject to change. Xabi Alonso has learnt a lot about his Real Madrid players after taking charge of the team for the 2025 Club World Cup. Despite being one of the pre-tournament favourites, Real were eventually dumped out in the semi-finals in comprehensive fashion by Paris Saint-Germain. Several former Real stars have backed Alonso to solve these issues. The media have often focused on the lack of defensive work from Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr, whose minimal pressing is said to leave Real's midfield and backline exposed. There are serious question marks over Kylian Mbappe's role in an Alonso side. He had the fewest touches of any outfield player against PSG and once again demonstrated an inability to press and track back. By contrast, Ousmane Dembele's relentless pressing caused Real all kinds of problems, and the Frenchman capped his performance with a well-deserved goal. Alonso is also in desperate need of a dependable left-back. Ferland Mendy continues to struggle with injuries, and Fran Garcia was left red-faced on several occasions by PSG's Desire Doue in their Club World Cup semi. With so many unresolved issues, it's hard to see why Real are currently priced as odds-on favourites to win the 2025/26 La Liga. Hansi Flick's 2024/25 La Liga champions missed out on a place at this summer's Club World Cup. This could actually be quite beneficial to them in the long run. Barca will surely start the new domestic campaign fresher and fitter than their title rivals. With plenty of question marks over Real at both ends of the pitch, Flick has only needed to make minor adjustments to his squad in the close season. There is also continued media speculation surrounding a move for Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who would offer serious competition to the likes of Raphinha and Dani Olmo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And from everything Donald has revealed about his son, Barron Trump, the president's cringe-worthy self-aggrandizing might have meant quite a bit to Barron, given his love for the sport. When Chelsea Football Club defeated Paris Saint-Germain Football Club 3-0 in the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Donald was on hand to present the trophy (or at least a replica, as he reportedly kept the real trophy for himself). Then, he proceeded to just stand around with the Chelsea players and bask in the cheering, as if it was meant for him. According to an X post from The Athletic, standout star Cole Palmer said he was baffled by the situation. "I knew he was going to be there," Palmer shared, "but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand where we lifted the trophy." While this may be true, and Barron hasn't shared his thoughts publicly, the New York University student has been spotted showing his love for Chelsea's rivals, Arsenal F.C., in the past. Back in 2017, Barron Trump was spotted playing on the White House lawn rocking an Arsenal Football Club jersey. The following year, Donald Trump spoke with Piers Morgan and said, "I have a son who does love this sport," while also confirming that his son is a big Arsenal supporter. Perhaps Cole Palmer's impressive talents with Chelsea have won Barron over and made him a superfan. — wound up taking home the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. The Tiffany & Co-created award was reportedly made from 24-karat gold and is valued at approximately $230,000. "[FIFA] said, 'Could you hold this trophy for a little while?'" "We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' And [FIFA President Gianni Infantino] said, 'We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office.'"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Video authentically shows FIFA President Gianni Infantino criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for taking the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. On July 16, 2025, a viral video claimed to show FIFA President Gianni Infantino criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for taking the Club World Cup trophy for himself. However, instead of stepping aside for the customary trophy lift, Trump stayed onstage during the team's victory photos, resulting in criticism and even some of the football players expressing confusion. This robber stole the glory that belonged to us. I really don't understand what this trophy has to do with the president of the United States. This was the most ridiculous day of my life and it happened right there on the Club World Cup podium. After every Club World Cup ends, the trophy always goes back to headquarters, quietly displayed in that building Zurich, Switzerland, to be admired by the whole world. I tried to push him aside, but it was useless. And just like that, the most absurd trophy swap in football history was born. There is no credible evidence Infantino made the above statement. We searched for specific sections from the above purported statement and found no authentic news sources verifying that Infantino ever criticized Trump using those words. Had Infantino actually made the above statements, it would have been headline news and would have likely gotten a public response from Trump. A March 2025 Instagram post on Infantino's official page stated: I am confident that FIFA, together with the White House, is going to ensure that these events will be celebrations of our beautiful sport unlike anything else the world has ever seen before. We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [Infantino] says, 'We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one.' And they actually made a new one, so that was quite exciting [...] Right now it's in the Oval Office." We previously reported on Trump's statement about FIFA giving him the original trophy. We also covered the false rumor that the FIFA Club World Cup winners Chelsea deliberately edited Trump out of their celebratory photos, when in fact they had chosen to publish images from when Trump moved to the back of the stage. Didn't Edit Trump out of Their FIFA Club World Cup Victory Photo." "Trump Said He Kept Original 2025 FIFA Club World Cup Trophy?" "US President Donald Trump Reaffirms Support for FIFA Tournaments during Meeting with Gianni Infantino." For a long time, my expectations of Donald Trump have been that he will be worse than I think, just never in the way that I think. Say what you will about the man, he is full of surprises. I assumed he'd make the country dumber, but I didn't think he'd succeed at nixing the entire Department of Education. I figured he'd do his best to destroy the federal government, but DOGE really came out of left field. (Or should that be the far right field?) Besiktas have publicly cancelled Kyle Walker-Peters' transfer to the club after rejecting a certain request from the ex-Southampton man. Chelsea's Cole Palmer had a taste of American food while starring at the Club World Cup, but the forward found it "disgusting". The 23-year-old England international delivered a masterclass in the final, netting twice and setting up another goal in a 3-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain that left the football world stunned. Alejandro Garnacho has been caught driving to Manchester United training in an untaxed and illegal car as speculation over his future continues. In a remarkable power play, Liverpool are confident that both strikers want to join In a summer of secret release clauses, Emi Martinez reportedly has one at Aston Villa that could work in Manchester United's favour. A former Manchester United director has been backed to play an important role in a possible pursuit of Joshua Zirkzee. The maximum fee Real Madrid would be willing to pay for Ibrahima Konate — into the last year of his contract — to Liverpool has been revealed. Federico Chiesa is likely to stay at Anfield despite an underwhelming debut campaign with Liverpool last season. The Italian left Juventus to join the Liverpool but he failed to break into Arne Slot's starting lineup and ended up with only 14 appearances under his belt across all competitions in 2024-25. Liverpool's chances of signing Rodrygo have been handed a major boost as Arsenal are ready to walk away from a potential €90 million (£78m/$104m) deal for the Real Madrid forward. Former Liverpool striker Andy Carroll endured a nightmare debut in non-league football for Dagenham and Redbridge as his team went down 5-1 against League Two side Crawley Town in a pre-season friendly. The 36-year-old, who once broke the British transfer record when moving to Anfield from Newcastle, is making a fresh start in the sixth tier of English football after leaving Bordeaux. Hamilton and teammate Charles Leclerc will take to the track at the Italian circuit to test a new rear suspension Rashford is among five players to have informed the Red Devils they wish to explore a future away from Old Trafford this summer. Spurs could take encouragement from latest developments at Forest Sir Jim Ratcliffe is intent on not being pushed into paying more than Manchester United's £65m valuation of the forward Bryan Mbeumo</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic took home the Best Soccer Player award at the 2025 ESPYS, beating out a Barcelona trio of Lamine Yamal, Aitana Bonmatí and Alexia Putellas. Pulisic put together a career-best campaign for AC Milan last season, recording 17 goals and 10 assists in 50 appearances. The U.S. men's national team star helped the Rossoneri win their first Italian Super Cup since 2016, scoring a goal in his side's improbable 3–2 comeback victory against Inter Milan. Despite Pulisic's stellar campaign, AC Milan only managed an eighth-place finish in Serie A, ruling them out of European soccer in next season. Still, the 2025 ESPYS, an annual awards ceremony produced by ESPN, recognized Pulisic's individual accomplishments and honored him as the Best Soccer Player award-winner. Congrats to @pulisic on being named Best Soccer Player at the 2025 @ESPYS! The winger helped Barcelona claim a domestic treble in Hansi Flick's first season in charge, tallying 18 goals and 21 assists across all competitions. Aitana Bonmatí, the reigning 2024 Women's Ballon d'Or winner, and her Barcelona teammate Alexia Putellas were also nominated for the award. Pulisic, though, beat out the three Barcelona players to join an exclusive list of past and present legends to win the Best Soccer Player award at the ESPYS. Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi are the two most recent winners, while David Beckham, Ronaldinho and Mia Hamm have all claimed the honor as well. The public backing Pulisic is a good sign for the USMNT captain after he received harsh criticism for skipping the 2025 Gold Cup to prioritize his recovery after a gruelling season.

When Chelsea FC stunned Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's Club World Cup final, U.S. president Donald Trump managed to insert himself into the conversation.

As the Chelsea players were preparing to lift the trophy, Cole Palmer noticed that Trump was still on stage — right in the center — and urged captain Reece James to wait for Trump to exit. The U.S. president refused, which made for an awkward celebratory scene. Chelsea ultimately settled on a photo where Trump was obscured, but the questions about Trump's presence were unavoidable.

That awkwardness also played out in the medal ceremony, and Palmer was asked about that exchange as well.

In an interview with The Daily Mail, Palmer recalled that Trump told him that his son, presumably Barron, was his biggest fan.

To that, Palmer said, "'Thank you' ... or something."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup, President Donald Trump has sparked multiple controversies with soccer fans. The 32-team tournament was ultimately won by Chelsea, who delivered a 3-0 rout of Paris Saint-Germain in the title game on Sunday, July 13. When Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were finished distributing championship medals to the winning team, Trump was left with one in his hand. Rather than hand it back, the president stashed it in the inside pocket of his suit jacket, drawing criticism from viewers. "My god Trump really pocketed one of the championship medals meant for the players smh," one X user wrote, while another quipped, "He's like a kid trying to blow out all the candles at another kid's birthday party, making it about himself, trying to take all the credit." “[FIFA] said, ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' It was next to the presidential desk as Trump was visited by the Italian football club Juventus last month, ahead of their Round of 16 knockout loss to Real Madrid. In addition to tension among soccer fans, there is global concern about the Trump administration overseeing an international tournament at the same time they are implementing foreign travel bans and ramping up immigration raids. Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement last month, “FIFA should publicly acknowledge the threat U.S. immigration and other antihuman rights policies pose to the tournament's integrity and use its leverage with the U.S. government to ensure that the rights of all qualified teams, support staff, media, and fans are respected as they seek to enter the United States regardless of nationality, gender identity, religion, or opinion." The opening match of the World Cup is set to be played in downtown Los Angeles, where Trump recently deployed National Guard troops to shut down protests against his deportation policies. Additionally, Mexico is both a host nation and a contender to perform well in the tournament, yet Mexicans are one of the most-targeted nationalities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier in July, 90 civil society groups signed an open letter urging FIFA to press Trump on his immigration and travel policies ahead of the massive sporting event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last weekend, Bayer Leverkusen officially signed American attacking midfielder Malik Tillman. Tillman also will have a prime opportunity to keep his national team stock high for the 2026 World Cup. He might be the front-runner to start in the central attacking midfield role in U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation, and a solid season for a Champions League club and recent Bundesliga champion will only reinforce that. We tend to see a lot of jostling for position in World Cup years. While the U.S. has plenty of stalwarts and, if healthy, likely 2026 starters -- including left back Antonee Robinson, right back Sergiño Dest, midfielders Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie, and winger Christian Pulisic (recent drama aside) -- there are plenty of spots on the 26-player roster for next summer. And we could see quite a few players seeking changes in scenery this season with one of those spots in mind. Weah finds himself in a tricky position at Juventus: He battled a hamstring injury for a good chunk of the 2024-25 campaign and was in and out of the lineup, spending time at multiple positions. Over the past two seasons with Juve, he has recorded 3,716 minutes in all competitions (ninth on the team), with seven goals (sixth), six assists (seventh) and 38 blocked passes (fifth) defensively. Since Igor Tudor took over as Juve manager on March 23, the right-footed Weah has started just three of 13 matches and made appearances mostly on the left side of the lineup in Tudor's 3-4-2-1 formation. If Inter Milan were to send Denzel Dumfries to Manchester City or elsewhere, as rumored, Weah would be a nice replacement option, as his stats were extremely similar to Dumfries' this past season. But if that isn't on the table, Marseille would be a solid alternative. If we ignore everything we know about his overall career trajectory and focus on the raw stats -- 5,762 minutes, 19 goals and 14 assists with Borussia Dortmund before his 23rd birthday -- there's still plenty of promise here. He has played only 1,218 club minutes over the past two calendar years with only nine starts, and he has filled holes everywhere from left attacking midfielder to right back. His brilliant 2020-21 season -- 2,699 minutes in all competitions as a 17- and 18-year-old, seven goals (fourth on the team), six assists (fifth), 103 one-on-ones (second), 63 fouls suffered (second) -- is pretty far in the rearview mirror. More than anyone else in the U.S. player pool, Reyna simply needs a set role and playing time. It's hard to imagine that coming with Borussia Dortmund. If he would consider MLS an option, which I doubt, he potentially could find a nice spot as a central attacking midfielder -- my own read on his best role -- with New York City FC (where 38-year old Maxi Morález is logging major minutes) or, perhaps, other 4-2-3-1 teams such as Houston (where he could team with Jack McGlynn) or Real Salt Lake (with Diego Luna). But the best fit could be in the Bundesliga, where Gerardo Seoane's Borussia Monchengladbach operates from a 4-2-3-1 and gives a lot of central attacking midfielder minutes to 32-year-old Alassane Pléa, whose contract expires in 2026 and who could move this summer. If Reyna is healthy, it wouldn't be hard to envision him pairing well with the industrious Rocco Reitz in midfield. Really, though, the best fit is any team that will play him a lot. One of the most important players during the USMNT's solid 2022 World Cup showing, Musah finds himself in a situation reasonably similar to that of Weah and Reyna: He's a man with skills and no defined position. But Musah has spent time in a lot of positions, including right winger. His one-on-ones chart basically shows that he'll take on anyone, anywhere, and that he's a man without a set spot. Like Reyna, Musah is still only 22 years old, and he's really good at what he's good at -- namely dribbling and drawing contact. New Milan manager Max Allegri could find him useful at right wing back or -- thanks to Tijjani Reijnders' departure -- in the second defensive midfield spot in a 3-5-2. If we're thinking about what might translate well to playing time in Pochettino's system, defensive midfielder experience would be useful. Allegri has proved allergic to playing younger guys at times, and the thing I'll call the Transfer Industrial Complex has linked Musah to Forest and Napoli in recent weeks. Aside from maybe goalkeeper Matt Freese, no player improved his national team stock more than Luna this summer. Until he seemingly ran out of gas a bit against Mexico, he put in solid pressing work throughout the tournament, as well. Summer tournament success almost always produces a run of transfer rumors, as it has for Luna. He has been linked to a few European teams. Who doesn't need a burly, hard-working and opportunistic attacker for your bench, at the very least? But Celta Vigo would be intriguing: They were the fifth-best attacking team in the league last season, and they are rebuilding their attack after the loss of forward Jørgen Strand Larsen and winger Fernando López to Wolves. Celta Vigo just added a nice string-puller in Club Brugge's Ferran Jutglà too. But even though Real Salt Lake kind of stink this season, Luna has a good thing going and doesn't need to leave just to get the national team manager's attention. Over the past two seasons, he has produced brilliant scoring stats on a dominant team in an attacker-friendly league. Attacker stats are typically friendlier when you're making shorter substitute appearances. We've definitely learned that Pepi can contribute great things in a great environment, as 22 goals and six assists in 16.5 90s (aka the equivalent of 16.5 full matches) is outstanding work in any environment; and it has to be accepted that anywhere outside of PSV, his scoring stats will drop. Meanwhile, at FC Augsburg, in an extreme too much, too soon move (he had just turned 18), he scored zero goals in 583 minutes but pressed like crazy and created 1.1 chances per 90 minutes. Stewart Robson believes the USMNT might struggle at next year's World Cup after their poor performance in the Gold Cup final. The rumor mill has linked Pepi with a Fulham move, among others. But with Malik Tillman leaving PSV, Luuk de Jong out of contract and Pepi coming back from meniscus surgery, the best play for Pepi might be to work his way back to full strength in this forward-friendly environment. Busio has a lot of miles on his 23-year-old legs. He broke through with Sporting Kansas City at age 16, and between Sporting and Venezia, he already has recorded more than 12,000 minutes of action. He is proving durable and physical despite a 5-foot-7, 143-pound frame. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Venezia were relegated again in 2024-25, however, and now that he has proved himself at the Serie A level, a move is expected. Rumors link him to Udinese, and that's probably about right: He might not be ready for a top-level team yet, but he could be a strong role player for a midtable club. The U.S. is loaded with interesting options at defensive midfield, where Tyler Adams, new Atlético Madrid addition Johnny Cardoso and Lyon's Tanner Tessmann all lurk (and where Musah might get more club minutes). The 6-foot-2 son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman has enjoyed a breakout year at age 20. He debuted as an Orlando City starter and looked good enough to not only get a USMNT summer call-up, but also start every Gold Cup match at right back. He has contributed quite a bit to the Orlando attack with four goals and two assists from 31 chances created. But while he didn't do a lot of that with the national team, he still had a ton of touches and defensive interventions (third in both categories). Granted, he also played the scorer onside for Mexico's winning goal in the Gold Cup final, and he was easily beaten in attack on a promising late scoring chance. But he's absolutely tantalizing, as evidenced by his current scouting report chart at FBref. There was talk of a Parma offer and things of that nature, but Freeman moving on after less than one full season as a professional starter might seem like a bit too much, too soon. Still, he came from out of nowhere and quickly advanced up the U.S. depth chart. He almost certainly is going to be at the center of many rumors this time next year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian soccer fans eager to score a ticket to one of the 13 FIFA World Cup games in Toronto or Vancouver next summer can now purchase hospitality packages. But the premium tickets for the group stage and round of 32 matches, which start at $2,500 and increase significantly depending on the level of service selected, won't get you in to see Canada's Men's National Team on the pitch at Toronto's BMO Field or BC Place in Vancouver. According to FIFA and On Location, its official hospitality partner, host nation games “are not available as a single-match offerings” for the special tickets. The Canadian side plays its first game at BMO on June 12 — the first-ever men's World Cup on Canadian soil — and rounds out its group stage play with matches on June 18 and 24 in Vancouver. Opponents won't be determined until later this year. Here's what you need to know about ticket prices less than a year before the event kicks off. After the Team Canada opener on June 12, Toronto will host five more matches — four group stage and one round of 32. But I don't have much control over it,” Toronto mayor Olivia Chow said this week, per City News. A round of 32 game on July 2, meanwhile, begins at $3,215. Those prices allow ticketholders access to the FIFA pavilion, a private area offering food and drinks separate from other attendees. There are four other hospitality levels to choose from, each offering a slightly higher level of exclusivity — the champions club, the trophy lounge, VIP and the top tier pitchside lounge. “An exclusive experience that blends luxurious comfort with the electrifying energy of the world's greatest sporting event,” according to FIFA and On Location. As of right now, Vancouver tops out at the “VIP standard plus” level, which will run you $6,450 for the round of 32 match. All of the packages include all you can eat and drink, including alcoholic beverages, and they get you inside three hours before kickoff and allow you stick around for up to two hours after the game ends. While a strong third-place finish could earn 28th-ranked Canada a berth in the round of 32 in this year's expanded tournament, the side is guaranteed only three group stage games. As of right now, tickets to those matches can only be secured by investing in the venue series, which grants the pass holder access to all the matches at either stadium, starting at $15,975 for Toronto and $19,860 in Vancouver. A single venue series pass with access to the “pitchside lounge standard plus” for the six games in Toronto rings up for $37,700. In Vancouver, where the pass gets you into all seven games, it's $46,740. Another option is to sign up for Canada Soccer's CanadaRED program, which offers registered members exclusive access to the organization's ticketing allotment for the national team's games. FIFA also announced this week that it would open applications for general tickets on Sept. 10. Ticket sales will continue from then until the final match in East Rutherford, N.J., on July 19, but FIFA has yet to offer details on the timing of future phases. As for how much they might cost, general tickets for fans at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar ranged from $11 for Qataris attending a group stage game all the way to $2,210 for international fans watching the final, according to The Sporting News. How much are Canada's World Cup games costing? Toronto has ballparked its hosting cost at $380 million, $104 million of which was supplied by the federal government, with another $97 million coming from Doug Ford's provincial government, a deal that's still being negotiated. A city staff report in late May revealed that “provincial service costs are still substantially higher than budgeted, and in some cases completely unbudgeted,” resulting in $39 million of the province's contribution already earmarked for provincial service costs like added Ontario Provincial Police security and hospital and paramedic surge capacity. Ford, who initially said the city wouldn't get a penny more, has promised to work with Chow to come up with a solution. “She (Chow) needs more cash, which I understand. The city is putting $123 million into BMO Field, increasing capacity to 45,000 with the addition of $17,000 temporary seats, along with other upgrades like four new LED videoboards and improved team facilities. In Vancouver, the latest estimated gross core costs of planning, staging and hosting are between $532 million and $624 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. president Donald Trump quite literally stook centre-stage following the final of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup on July 13. Trump joined FIFA chief Gianni Infantino in the middle of the MetLife Stadium pitch as Chelsea were crowned world champions following their shock 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final. He then decided to stand with the players as they lifted the trophy, despite Infantino's attempts to intervene and some bemused looks on the faces of Cole Palmer and Reece James. There was even a moment where it seemed Trump would try to lift the trophy alongside the Chelsea captain. Whether he truly wanted to share in the Blues' moment of glory is not entirely clear, but Trump certainly seems to be a big fan of the Tiffany-designed trophy itself. MORE:Reece James reveals what Donald Trump said to him during trophy lift It was unveiled at a special event in the Oval Office back in March, at which point it took pride of place on a plinth. "I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] 'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. So, that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now." This is not an entirely irregular thing to see. And it's not the only token Trump is said to have received. During the trophy ceremony, Infantino was seen to hand a spare winners' medal to Trump after the Chelsea players and staff had been presented with theirs.</p>

It's all thanks to his loved ones back home, according to Adams, like his parents making those long drive to the New York Red Bulls Academy in New Jersey as a kid. I was sleeping in the passenger seat next to them,” he said. “But again, it wouldn't be possible without my family. Adams' legacy and impact on his hometown was cemented this month, when the field he grew up playing on was renamed Tyler Adams Soccer Pitch. It was part of a partnership with Scotts lawn care company to resurface the field with new natural turfgrass. “I hope many generations of kids are going to be able to come here and play and grow, not only as athletes like I was able to, but also become good people from the Town of Wappinger,” Adams said. So Adams is cherishing these moments as much as he can, before joining Bournemouth later this month in Chicago for the Premier League Summer Series tour of the U.S. with three other clubs. “Right now, I'm enjoying having the off time,” Adams said. So soon we're gonna have to do training again and get ready for the new season.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The market wasn't always so warm to USMNT-eligible players. Even into the early 2010s, many Americans were either acquired at a bargain valuation or on free transfers after trial periods. In January 2007, Clint Dempsey broke MLS records when Fulham signed him from the New England Revolution for just $4 million. The program's joint-record scorer (tied with Landon Donovan on 57 goals) again made history in August 2012 when Tottenham brought him across town from Craven Cottage for $9.5 million. Put another way, Dempsey — then a proven Premier League forward who helped Fulham reach a Europa League final — went for as much money as West Brom paid Orlando City for Daryl Dike three years ago. Some of this was inevitable given the increased finances in soccer. On top of this, success on the field was a self-fulfilling path to retain a strong squad as winnings could be reinvested in higher wages and transfer fee expenditure. It starts with viewers who weren't occupying seats at grounds. Major leagues have become more accessible to a global audience, with fans able to foster stronger bonds from abroad with their teams possibly visiting on an occasional preseason tour. It is, however, undeniably relevant to this surge in player valuations. These days, clubs like AFC Bournemouth and Leeds United spend over $20 million with increasing regularity. All of which brings us back to Johnny, Tillman and the recent high sums for Americans abroad. Each of the dozen-plus highest fees for U.S. players have come in the past decade and involve players under 25, led by Christian Pulisic's $74.1 million move from Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea in January 2019. When Pulisic left for Chelsea, Dortmund already had its next American talent in the wings: Giovanni Reyna, who arrived from New York City FC's academy. Youth movement doesn't garner nearly as significant fees as moves for senior players, but it isn't a surprise that McKennie was involved in a lucrative transfer following years of productivity in Germany. In a trend identified long before the Club World Cup, yet validated this summer, many of Europe's top teams operate more systematically, recruiting with data at the heart of the operation and coaches instructing players from positional play models that give strict responsibility guidance for each member of the squad. For every overpayment to obtain any young Brazilian playmaker with a bag of tricks, there were a dozen bargain bin signings from less sexy nations like those in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and North America (among other regions). Those biases have gradually been worn away with more clubs have sophisticated scouting operations, but having successes like Pulisic and McKennie only accelerates that process. Atléti wasn't assessing Johnny as “an American midfielder,” which used to mean he would bust his tail every game but struggled technically; it was signing a player who proved himself in La Liga after Betis vetted his readiness and signed him from Brazil. The changing model of club ownership also plays a role. For generations, most owners were local stewards who saw their club as a local institution, even if it meant some lean years if revenue wasn't sustainable. Now, the sport is its own machine of profit-generation. Americans weren't previously dropping billions to helm Champions League contenders. Multi-club models were a twinkle in the Abu Dhabi royal family's collective eye, and loan deals were dependent on an outside entity wanted to temporarily house a player. Agreements between clubs make those processes easier, meaning more players can be signed and stashed in case they develop to a first-team standard — or can be sold for a profit. Just like Chelsea has Caleb Wiley and Gabriel Slonina on its books now, it took a flier on a 21-year-old Matt Miazga in January 2016. Manchester City has taken chances on Erik Palmer-Brown and Zack Steffen. Bayern Munich has tried matching Dortmund's success in the American market to varying degrees of success via Tillman, Chris Richards and Justin Che. None of this diminishes the major steps being taken by Tillman, Johnny and even Agyemang. Each is testing himself in a different setting, and each will almost certainly be a part of his new club's rotation from jump due to the amount invested by club ownership (though Derby indicated Agyemang's debut would be delayed due to hernia surgery). This list could be reshuffled some by summer's end, too, as more movement for USMNT regulars is reportedly in the offing. Yunus Musah could leave Milan after two difficult years, while Juventus apparently has suitors for both McKennie and Tim Weah. Josh Sargent, meanwhile, may be on the outs from Norwich City after years chasing promotion in vain. This may not yet be the USMNT's “golden generation” in terms of on-field standard. No matter how often he hears the Number 10 role is "dying," he'll always leave a light on for the next great playmaker.</p>
