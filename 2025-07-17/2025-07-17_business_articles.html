Netflix's Future:

While rival media companies are unloading assets and cutting costs, Netflix Inc. continues to thrive.

The owner of the world's most popular paid streaming service on Thursday reported second-quarter results that exceeded investor expectations in every major metric, saying revenue grew to $11.1 billion and earnings jumped to $7.19 a share. The company also raised its forecast for full-year sales and profit margins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump underwent a comprehensive medical exam that revealed he has a common vein disorder but cleared him of more serious illnesses, the White House said Thursday. The White House disclosed the 79-year-old president's medical information in response to speculation after photos showed Trump with swollen ankles. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump noticed the swelling in recent weeks and received a thorough evaluation by the White House medical unit. He was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which Leavitt described as a "benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70." Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when a person's leg veins are damaged, restricting circulation and causing blood to pool in the legs, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Leavitt said Trump was not in any pain from the condition. Leavitt also addressed bruises periodically visible on the back of Trump's hand. She said they were caused by irritation from "frequent handshaking," coupled with his aspirin regimen. The medical exam found no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, Leavitt said. Trump's blood test results were all within "normal limits," and an echocardiogram confirmed "normal cardiac structure and function" with "no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness," she added. Leavitt said in Thursday's briefing that bruising like that seen on Trump's hands is a common side effect of regularly using aspirin, which Trump takes as part of a "standard cardiovascular prevention regimen." "The president remains in excellent health, which I think all of you witness on a daily basis here," she said. White House physician Sean Barbabella wrote in an April memo that Trump "remains in excellent physical health" and is "fully fit" to perform the duties of the presidency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SECAUCUS, N.J. — As customers walk the aisles of Walmart stores, there are some early signs that higher tariffs are changing pricing. The nation's largest retailer warned in May that it would have to raise prices for its shoppers as President Donald Trump's new duties drive up the cost of many imported goods. About two months later, some household items on Walmart's shelves have higher prices, according to a CNBC analysis. CNBC tracked prices of about 50 products across merchandise categories including apparel, electronics, toys and groceries over seven weeks at Walmart's Secaucus, New Jersey, location. Many of those items are manufactured in countries that face significant tariff rates. Even in cases where prices on imported items increased, it's unclear if the moves were all or partly due to cost increases from tariffs. The price analysis offers a snapshot into what Trump's duties mean for consumers' wallets, a key concern since he started rolling out tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners earlier this year. While nationwide inflation data had seen a muted effect from tariffs in recent months, that showed some signs of changing in June. Though the consumer price index increased by 0.3% for the month and 2.7% year over year, the prices of tariff-sensitive segments like apparel and household furnishings rose at higher rates of 0.4% and 1%, respectively, from May. Walmart is a critical indicator of pricing trends for multiple reasons. It's the largest retailer in the U.S., a place where millions of Americans buy not only their regular groceries but also purchase furniture, shoes and other general items. "We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC. The store where CNBC tracked prices is one among more than 4,500 locations across the U.S., and its suppliers play a role in whether prices rise. Even so, the areas where CNBC saw price hikes at Walmart in many cases reflected trends in national data tracked by the government and research firms. Other retailers said this spring that they have raised or expect to hike prices, including Best Buy, Costco, Nike and E.l.f. However, some products saw a noticeable increase. The price of a 12-piece set of pots and pans from Beautiful, a private-label kitchenware brand that's exclusive to Walmart and co-founded by Drew Barrymore, rose from $99 to $149. In addition, the price of a Graco convertible stroller and car seat increased in price from $199.99 (then noted as a Walmart rollback, or limited-time discount from the $249 original price) to $299. Some items' packaging offered clues that tariffs could play a role in the hikes. The Beautiful pots and pans and Graco car seat are all made in China, according to labels on their packaging. Trump has put new 30% tariffs on goods imported from the country this year. Graco's parent company, Newell Brands, declined to comment on the price increase at Walmart. In its earnings call in late April, the company, which also owns Yankee Candle, Rubbermaid and other brands, said it has raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%. The price of Levi Strauss Signature Jeans for Men increased by a dollar from $23.98 to $24.98 at the Secaucus Walmart, bringing it in line with the cost of similar women's jeans. Levi's CFO, Harmit Singh, told CNBC in an interview that most of Levi's goods come from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Tags of the signature jeans sold by Walmart, which came in multiple styles and washes, said they were made in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Lesotho. Across retailers, prices have increased in some key categories, but their impact hasn't been as dramatic as some feared when Trump implemented new tariffs, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for Circana, a market research company that tracks consumer spending patterns across merchandise categories. Those items with elevated prices include coats and jackets, casual shorts, golf shirts, plush toys, and small household appliances, he said. Here's how much prices rose in some categories as of the week ended May 31, relative to the week ended March 8, according to Circana data: Despite some price pressures, consumer spending has held up, Cohen said. Unit sales of food and beverage at retailers are roughly flat in terms of units so far this year, according to Circana's data that runs through July 5 and compares with the year-ago period. Sales of discretionary general merchandise or nonfood items are down by about 1% in units compared with the year-ago period, the firm found. Early imports and supply chain strategies have helped retailers and brands tamp down on the number and magnitude of tariff-related price increases, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, a major industry trade group. He said many retailers imported goods early after hearing Trump's plans for tariffs on the campaign trail. And he said companies have used U.S. Customs-sanctioned foreign trade zones and so-called bonded warehouses to store goods duty-free until they head to shelves, in the hopes that the tariff rate may fall. Gold added companies are trying to predict if tariffs may go up or down, which will factor into their costs and their pricing decisions. Tariff levels have remained in flux as Trump delays some duties and announces others. "Companies are just kind of scratching their heads trying to figure it out," Gold said. However, there were price decreases at Walmart, too: Mattel-owned Barbie Swim dolls dropped in price from $7.97 to to $5.97. The Barbies are made in Indonesia, according to their packaging. Dolls, including Barbies, are one of the items that have come up in tariff policy debates after Mattel said it may have to raise prices. Trump said that American children "could be very happy" with fewer dolls under his trade proposals. Tariffs aren't the only dynamic driving prices, however. Some items that are not imported increased or decreased in price, too. They show how factors outside of tariffs are affecting consumers' wallets, since egg prices have risen and more recently fallen after an avian flu outbreak spread and then eased. Smucker, which owns coffee brands including Dunkin Donuts and Folgers, did not respond to a request for comment. Circana's Cohen said some brands have phased in price increases, hiking them by a more tolerable level of no more than 10% to 12% or focusing on infrequent purchases. While tariff-related price jumps haven't been as noticeable yet, Cohen said he expects more meaningful increases to come in the upcoming months. He said consumers may feel more of the pinch during the holiday season, since many Christmas decorations and toys are made in China or other parts of Asia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor who was abruptly fired by the Justice Department as President Donald Trump comes under pressure to release files on Epstein suggested Thursday that she was being targeted by a "tyrant." "If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain," the prosecutor, Maurene Comey, wrote in a farewell note to staff at the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. "Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought. Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place," she wrote in the note. Of commitment to seek justice for victims." Comey was fired Wednesday from the U.S. Attorney's Office, where her high-profile prosecutions included cases against Epstein; Epstein's procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell; and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump has considered an enemy since he fired the director in 2017. Hours before Maurene Comey was fired, Trump lashed out at Republicans who are demanding that the Justice Department release more files about the Epstein case. "Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bull----,' hook, line, and sinker," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. A number of Trump's supporters have criticized the recent decision by Attorney General Pam Bondi not to release previously undisclosed evidence that was assembled during the Justice Department's investigation of Epstein. The well-connected financier killed himself in jail in August 2019, a month after he was arrested on federal sex-trafficking charges. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who also oversees Amazon's Blink security cameras, Key in-home delivery service, and Sidewalk wireless network, announced on Wednesday that all promotion applications at his RBKS organization must now explain how employees are using AI at work. Siminoff, who returned to Amazon in April after a 2-year hiatus, said the new policy aims to reward "innovative thinking" and reinforce a culture of speed and efficiency. "When we combine innovative technology with our missions, we create something truly special," Siminoff wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider. The change underscores a growing trend among tech companies to incorporate AI use into their talent-evaluation process. Shopify announced in April that managers must prove AI couldn't do a job better before hiring anyone new. Microsoft is asking some managers to evaluate employees based on how they use internal AI tools. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, meanwhile, warned last month that AI will reduce the company's workforce because of efficiency gains. Siminoff, in his email, said employees seeking a promotion must now describe how they have used generative AI or other AI technologies to improve customer experience or increase operational efficiency. Those in management positions are also required to show how they used AI tools to accomplish "more with less," while reducing or not growing headcount, according to the email. "In the spirit of Day 1 culture, we will keep learning, iterating and improving this," Siminoff wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense manufacturing startup Hadrian on Thursday announced the closing of $260 million Series C funding round led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Lux Capital. The machine parts company said it will use the funding to build a new 270,000 square foot factory in Mesa, Arizona, and expand its Torrance, California, location as it looks to beef up its shipbuilding and naval defense capabilities. "What we really need in this country is this quantum leap above China's manufacturing model," said CEO Chris Power in an interview with CNBC's Morgan Brennan. "It's about supercharging the worker versus replacing them." Hadrian said the Arizona space will be four times the size of its California facility and start operations by Christmas. Hadrian said it uses robotics and artificial intelligence to automate factories that can "supercharge American workers." Power said demand is rapidly growing, but the lack of U.S.-based talent is a major hurdle to building American dominance in shipbuilding and submarines. Using its tools, the company said it can train workers within 30 days, making them 10 times more productive. Its workforce includes ex-marines and former nurses who have never set foot in a factory. "We have to do a lot more ... but certainly we're able to keep up with the scale right now, and grateful to our team and customers for letting us go and do that," he said. "As a country, we have to treat this like a national security crisis, not just the economics of manufacturing." The fresh raise also includes investments from Andreessen Horowitz and new stakeholders such as Brad Gerstner's Altimeter Capital. The company closed a $92 million funding round in late 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon laid off employees in its cloud-computing unit, the company confirmed on Thursday, and employees are trying to piece together the details in internal messages. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the company is laying off employees in AWS, but did not specify which teams were affected or how many employees were cut. Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest the affected teams include frontline support, training and certification, and the AWS Worldwide Specialist Organization, which works with customers and product teams. Some of the employees who wrote on Slack that they were laid off said their roles included work on marketing, analytics, and even generative AI. "After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said. "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." The cuts come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains." Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, said the cuts aren't primarily due to AI and the company has thousands of job listings posted in areas it deems more strategic. Glasser also said U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, and will be eligible for a severance payment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 21-year-old from Boston thinks the "Gen Z stare" is overblown. A 17-year-old heard from her parents that she had been inadvertently doing it. Conversations with seven Gen Zers indicate young people are divided on the idea that their generation often responds to questions with blank, wide-eyed stares, as many millennials on TikTok have gleefully suggested. Some told Business Insider they flatly rejected the idea that there is such a thing as the "Gen Z stare" — others said they'd seen it firsthand. Those who said there could be some truth to it floated potential contributing factors, such as the lingering effects of COVID lockdowns, an adolescence spent online, or simply being high. While not everyone agreed, they all had thoughts on the viral debate. "The transaction was made with minimal words," Alarcon said. Alarcon said she'd seen the "Gen Z stare" in professional settings, too. At a recent networking event, she noticed that the other Gen Z networkers would "freeze up." She has her suspicions as to the root cause. Another theory stems from her earlier days as a waitress, when she would serve blank-looking young customers. "It's because they hit their pen," she said, referencing the slim THC oil vape pens that have become popular in the past five years. Trinity Starr Rutledge said she thought the trend was "pretty stupid." "I think you're just talking to a rude person," Starr Rutledge said. "I don't think it's right to label our generation as people who have this stare." Still, Easton said she mostly believes her generation's stare is an air of nonchalance. "It comes from a lack of caring as much what people think," Easton said. "Where an older generation might think it's rude or not socially acceptable, Gen Z is more to the point, and their humor's a little drier." Easton said the stare shouldn't make older generations think Gen Z is "disrespectful or unintelligent." It's merely a difference in how different generations communicate, she said. Lindsey Cook likes to start her interactions with Gen Z baristas by saying, "I'm ready to order when you are — no rush." That way, if the barista does have social anxiety, it allows them to work on their own timeline and not just stare back. Online, some young people have retorted that small talk isn't mandatory or that they didn't consent to a conversation. Emerson Hubbard thought she was too nervous to give off a "Gen Z stare." "I was talking to my family today, and they were like, 'You have done it before,'" Hubbard said. She sees a "one-sided" debate between millennials and Gen Z, she said, especially in her TikTok comments, where a lot of millennials are "going ham." Eli Toy was raised by Gen Xers, not millennials. "From what I've seen, a lot of Gen Zers that were raised by millennials had more technology in their childhoods, so that could impact it," Toy said. "The biggest tech I had was a pink Nintendo." Netta Dar has seen the "Gen Z stare" before. Interestingly enough, April, played by actor Aubrey Plaza, is a millennial in the show. That could suggest the "Gen Z stare" isn't specific to Gen Z, but to people who are still developing their social skills. While Dar hasn't seen the stare among her college-age friends, she said she had noticed some social awkwardness in her younger sister's friends. "It definitely depends on the age as well, and how far along you are in your development, where the frontal lobe is at," Dar said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's AI company used contractors to train Grok on coding tasks with the goal of topping a popular AI leaderboard, and explicitly told them they wanted it to outperform Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet tool, documents obtained by Business Insider show. The contractors, hired through Scale AI's Outlier platform, were assigned a project to "hillclimb" Grok's ranking on WebDev Arena, an influential leaderboard from LMArena that pits AI models against each other in web development challenges, with users voting for the winner. xAI did not reply to a BI request for comment. Anthropic's Claude, which has multiple models, is considered one of the leading players for AI coding and consistently ranks near the top of many leaderboards, often alongside Google and OpenAI. Anthropic cofounder Benn Mann said on the "No Priors" podcast last month that other companies had declared "code reds" to try to match Claude's coding abilities, and he was surprised that other models hadn't caught up. Competitors like Meta are using Anthropic's coding tools internally, BI previously reported. On Tuesday, LMArena ranked Grok 4 in 12th place for web development. Models from Anthropic ranked in joint first, third, and fourth. You can cut & paste your entire source code file into the query entry box on https://t.co/EqiIFyHFlo and @Grok 4 will fix it for you! The company said it never copies or reuses public benchmark data for large language model training and told BI it was engaging in a "standard data generation project using public signals to close known performance gaps." Anastasios Angelopoulos, the CEO of LMArena, told BI that while he wasn't aware of the specific Scale project, hiring contractors to help AI models climb public leaderboards is standard industry practice. The industry's focus on AI leaderboards can drive intense — and not always fair — competition. In April, after Meta's Llama 4 model shot up to second place on LM Arena, developers noticed that the model variant that Meta used for public benchmarking was different from the version released to the public. This sparked accusations from AI researchers that Meta was gaming the leaderboard. Although xAI's project with Scale AI asked contractors to help "hillclimb" the LMArena rankings, there is no evidence that they were gaming the leaderboard. Leaderboard dominance doesn't always translate into real-world ability. Shivalika Singh, another author of the paper, told BI that "doing well on the Arena doesn't result in generally good performance" or guarantee strong results on other benchmarks. Overall, Grok 4 ranked in the top three for LMArena's core categories of math, coding, and "Hard Prompts." However, early data from Yupp, a new crowdsourced leaderboard and LMArena rival, showed that Grok 4 ranked 66 out of more than 100 models, highlighting the variance between leaderboards. Nate Jones, an AI strategist and product leader with a widely read newsletter, said he found Grok's actual abilities often lagged behind its leaderboard hype. "Grok 4 crushed some flashy benchmarks, but when the rubber met the road in my tests this week Grok 4 stumbled hard," he wrote in his Substack on Monday. "The moment we set leaderboard dominance as the goal, we risk creating models that excel in trivial exercises and flounder when facing reality."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than four and a half years after Uber sold off its autonomous vehicle division, the company is investing $300 million into Lucid as part of a new robotaxi deal. Lucid will make the vehicles for Uber's robotaxis, based on its Gravity EV. Uber is also partnering with self-driving technology company Nuro, which will power the autonomous driving capabilities. Uber expects the tech to launch "later next year in a major US city." "Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better," said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. "We're thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world." Lucid's stock price jumped more than 43% in pre-market trading following news of the partnership, while Uber's stock price was slightly up before the opening bell. Uber said it plans to deploy a fleet of 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. The company said its first prototype is "already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds." The robotaxi wars have been heating up over the last year, with market leader Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, operating autonomous rides in multiple states. Tesla launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi program in Austin earlier this summer. At the time, it was grappling with a pandemic-induced downturn in its ride-hailing business. If adopted widely, robotaxis would present a way for Uber and other ridesharing services to bypass human drivers. Do you have a story to share about gig work?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanks to President Donald Trump, your retirement plan could soon include a mix of stocks, bonds—and private equity investments. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Trump is expected to sign an executive order in the coming days allowing 401(k) plans to invest their assets in private equity. Private equity investments, meanwhile, are often concentrated in a small number of portfolio companies, illiquid, and carry valuations that can be difficult to measure day-to-day. Trump's green light doesn't come as a surprise to those monitoring the private equity space, but it's concerning nonetheless. "Private equity kind of always gets what it wants in Congress, but I think it's a bad idea," Jeffrey Hooke, professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, said. "I don't think it's a good investment for the rank and file retail market," Hooke added. The push to include private equity in retirement plans is just the latest development in a long-running trend of combining public and private markets. But now, as higher rates stymie private equity dealmaking, firms are eyeing a liquidity opportunity: gaining access to the $12 trillion 401(k) market. Brian Payne, chief private markets and alternatives strategist at BCA Research, described this development as "an exit ramp for the current situation going on for private equity." As a result, private equity firms have been lobbying the Trump administration for access to retirement vehicles. Retail investors require more liquidity, which will eat into private equity returns over the long term, according to Payne. Private equity investments also come with steep management fees that could decrease returns. While retirement vehicles typically have longer timelines, reducing the need for immediate liquidity, Payne sees a risk if an economic downturn increases unemployment and forces more people to tap into their 401(k)s. Moody's Investors Service recently raised a similar concern, noting that retail investor participation in the private markets poses systemic risks. While Payne and Hooke are skeptical about the increased presence of private equity in retail portfolios, it's unlikely that private equity will comprise a large portion of people's retirement plans. Experts project around 10% of retirement assets could go toward private equity over time, which means Americans will probably be shielded from dramatic price swings. Glenn Schorr, senior research analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note on Wednesday that corporate sponsors may also be hesitant to invest in private equity vehicles. However, mixing complicated assets like private equity into retirement vehicles is certainly a risky choice.</p>
