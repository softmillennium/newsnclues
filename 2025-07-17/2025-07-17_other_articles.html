                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pamela Ufie was taken into custody after being fiercely pursued by a retired cop and self-described “psychic fraud” investigator, who had facilitated her arrest before; the P.I., Bob Nygaard, had gone so far as buying a plane ticket to see to it that her mystical street shop ended up shuttered. In New York State, it is a class B misdemeanor to claim possession of “occult powers” while giving advice, a fact that many local residents may understandably not be aware of. Details from Ufie's arraignment, which were shared with Straus News by the Manhattan D.A. 's office, alleged that she approached a woman near 1540 Broadway–located in the vicinity of Times Square–back in April 2023, telling her that her son had the aforementioned “generational curse.” Between then and October of that year, Ufie then allegedly coaxed $87,000 out of the woman by saying that it would be used to “acquire specialty materials necessary to conduct rituals,” which would supposedly dispel the curse. She was arrested near Bryant Park on July 10 after Nygaard, who used to work in Nassau County law enforcement, spotted her. In an interview with Straus News, Nygaard described what amounted to a personal stakeout on July 10, which began when he spotted Ufie on the W. 40th St. side of the park. After a cop car finally rolled by around thirty minutes later, he said that chased it down to a red light, and banged on its back windows to get the attention of officers. Nygaard said that he had first arrested Ufie as part of an undercover sting around 2016. In a post on the social media site X.com after the July 10 arrest, Nygaard referenced this case: “Proud to have helped cause Pamela Ufie to be arrested but last time she was offered a sweetheart plea deal without @NYPD or @ManhattanDA investigating the scope of her activity fully. Will they give a damn this time or does the apathy run too deep?” Nygaard told Straus that he believes people like Ufie are “emotionally abusive” swindlers on the level of Bernie Madoff, the infamous Wall St. Ponzi scheme operator, and opined that they were substantially different than people who attract “voluntary” clients.s In a 2017 interview with the New Miami Times, Nygaard also explained that his choice of post-retirement profession was partly sartorial, saying that he “relished” being able to wear fedoras and trench coats after being “restricted” to a police uniform for years. Some people who have been arrested for claiming unprovable “occult” powers have mounted interesting defenses, such as by claiming that it should be protected under the religious liberty clauses of the First Amendment. However, precedent has not quite ruled in their favor, with a New York-based fortune teller named Abraham Ballard failing to win an appeal of his conviction back in the 1980s. Albert Dayan, Ufie's defense lawyer, did not return a call seeking comment as of press time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Pennsylvania coroner is revealing new details surrounding the sudden death of Dan Rivera, a noted paranormal investigator who was on tour with the Raggedy Ann doll known as Annabelle, made famous by “The Conjuring” horror film franchise, when he died. Francis Dutrow, coroner in Adams County, PA, told CNN on Thursday that the doll was not present in the hotel room where Rivera died earlier this week in Gettysburg. The case remains an“active investigation,” according to the coroner, with autopsy results expected in eight to ten weeks. Pennsylvania State Police public information officer Megan Frazer shared a report on Wednesday citing details that match Rivera's case, and stated that “nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene.” On Tuesday, NESPR posted to social media announcing “the sudden and heartbreaking loss of our dear friend and colleague” Rivera. Rivera was affiliated with the Warren Occult Museum in Connecticut, which shared on its Facebook page that he “played a vital role in the museum's operations, often responsible for transporting and safeguarding Annabelle during public appearances and private events.” Rivera's sudden passing has shocked both colleagues and paranormal enthusiasts worldwide.” NESPR's statement also said Rivera was a US Army veteran, and that he “worked closely with” Lorraine Warren – the late famed paranormal investigator who determined that the real-life Annabelle doll was demonically possessed in 1968. Warren was portrayed by actor Vera Farmiga in the “Conjuring” films, an immensely successful horror franchise that has also seen sequels and standalone spinoffs, including 2014's “Annabelle” and 2018's “The Nun.” A new sequel starring Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, titled “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” is due in September.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Sean Kaufman (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Adam Silver (The Diplomat) are new additions to Other Mommy, director Rob Savage's supernatural horror film for Universal and Atomic Monster that yesterday announced eight-year-old Arabella Olivia Clark as its lead. As previously announced, Jessica Chastain, Jay Duplass and Dichen Lachman will also star. Based on the book Incidents Around the House by Bird Box‘s Josh Malerman, Other Mommy centers on eight-year-old Bela (Clark), who lives in a home strained by her parents' troubled marriage, only to see her life further upended by a sinister entity she calls “Other Mommy.” When this malevolent presence emerges from her closet, persistently asking “Can I go inside your heart?”, Bela refuses. But soon, Other Mommy's manifestations become increasingly aggressive, threatening the safety of Bela's family. Eight-Year-Old Arabella Olivia Clark Lands Lead Role In Uni & Atomic Monster's Supernatural Horror Film 'Other Mommy' From Rob Savage 'The Odyssey': Tickets For Christopher Nolan's Homer Epic On Sale This Week The film is being produced for Universal by Atomic Monster/Blumhouse in association with Spin a Black Yarn. The film falls under supernatural horror, one of the 24 thriving subgenres identified in a Blumhouse study conducted with Sage Outcomes, which surveyed over 2,000 horror fans and experts, as discussed at the company's inaugural Business of Fear event. Breaking out with his turn as Steven in Prime Video's hit YA series The Summer I Turned Pretty, which returned for its third season yesterday, Kaufman will also be seen coming up in the fifth season of Apple TV+'s sci-fi drama For All Mankind. Additional TV credits include Manifest, FBI: Most Wanted, and Law & Order: SVU. He is repped by CESD, Untitled Entertainement, and JTWAMM. Silver earned a SAG Ensemble nomination for his turn in Netflix's hit political thriller The Diplomat and has also been seen in a scene-stealing role opposite Ben Whishaw in Netflix's Black Doves, as well as Apple's WWII series Masters of the Air and Netflix's Eric and 3 Body Problem. Cutting his teeth in both Chicago and Los Angeles' theatre communities before expanding into television and film, he most recently appeared on stage in New York, starring opposite Ralph Fiennes in David Hare's Straight Line Crazy. He is represented by The Artists Partnership and Untitled Entertainment. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

NBC Connecticut spent time with Rivera in 2023 while filming our original docuseries “Haunted Legends of Connecticut.” “I was mentored by Lorraine Warren herself. She made me promise that I would be doing this with Tony, keep on doing the investigations, helping people. I take that as an honor,” he said. During our visit to the museum in 2023 Rivera, showed NBC Connecticut how the proper protocol for handling the doll, which includes wearing blessed gloves. Rivera said he believed the Annabelle doll should be on tour as a teaching tool. Within days of the event, fire devastated Louisiana's Nottoway Plantation, ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center and an historic home in the French Quarter burned down. The report said Rivera was discovered in his room by coworkers and that nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene. NESPR released a statement that said in part, “Dan was not only a vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend… His caring nature and sense of purpose made a deep impact on everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for extraterrestrial life in the solar system and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics. A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking. Our paper fills this gap based on a 3 yr long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group. We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: first, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat, and second, a viability model, which describes the probability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental conditions. We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization, (b) interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets, (c) subsurface habitability of Mars, and (d) ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions. The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three sociologists found that supernatural beliefs in the United States tend to group into four types At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Younger Americans are more likely to express belief in witchcraft and luck, as our new research shows. Our statistical analyses found that supernatural beliefs in the United States tend to group into four types. A second represents belief in “spiritual and mental forces,” some of which are associated with either paranormal or new age beliefs. A third group represents belief in “witches and witchcraft.” This was measured on our survey with questions about the existence of “black magic” and whether it was “possible to cast spells on people.” Those with a bachelor's degree or higher, for instance, score below average on all four types of belief, while those with less education score higher than average on all four. Looking at race and ethnicity, we found that Latino or Hispanic individuals were more likely than white individuals to express belief in the “witches and witchcraft” form of supernatural belief. Comparing gender differences, we find that women are more likely than men to believe in the “spiritual and mental forces” forms of supernatural belief. For instance, about 31% of women in our survey agreed that “it is possible to communicate with the dead” compared with about 22% of men. Our research addresses two key questions: first, whether people who hold one type of supernatural belief are also more likely to hold other types of supernatural beliefs; and second, how do different types of supernatural beliefs vary across key demographic groups, such as across educational levels, racial and ethnic groups, and gender? Most scientific surveys of the U.S. public include, at best, only one or two questions about religious beliefs; rarely do they include questions about other types of supernatural beliefs, such as belief in paranormal or superstitious forces. This could lead to an incomplete understanding of how supernatural beliefs and practices are changing in the United States. However, it is not clear that supernatural beliefs have or will follow the same trajectory – especially beliefs that are not explicitly connected to those religious identities. For example, someone can identify as nonreligious but believe that the crystal they wear will provide them with supernatural benefits. Our survey provides some insight into the nature and patterns of supernatural belief in the U.S. at one point in time, but it does not tell us how such beliefs are changing over time. We would like to see future surveys – both ours or from other social scientists – that ask more diverse questions about belief in supernatural beings and forces that will allow for an assessment of such changes.

"There is some evidence that there's something really unusual going on in the skies.… We just don't have enough information," said Winnipeg-based science writer Chris Rutkowski, director of the long-running Canadian UFO Survey, who was consulted for the report. The Sky Canada Project was created in 2022 by the office of Mona Nemer, Canada's chief science adviser, partly in response to growing public interest in the topic of UFOs — also known as UAP, or unidentified anomalous or aerial phenomena. Staff set out to identify challenges related to data collection on UAP sightings and provide a summary of how other countries approach the issue. The report found Canada's "fragmented" UAP reporting protocols across departments "complicates the application of scientific principles ... making it onerous, if not impossible, for researchers to access and compile data for rigorous, science-based analysis." "Canada would benefit from an improved process for reporting, collecting, and studying UAP sightings," reads a section of the report. That's the same year one of Canada's best-documented UFO cases emerged in Falcon Lake, Man. Roles and responsibilities were scattered among the Canadian Space Agency, Transport Canada, NavCanada — and Rutkowski, who amassed vast civilian, military, police and air traffic controller records of UAP reports dating back to the 1940s that Sky Canada has used in its analysis. In recent years, NASA has conducted an independent UAP study; the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defence erected the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate UAP reports by military personnel; and Congress has held multiple public hearings centring on national security concerns posed by UAP and alleged government coverups. To date, there's still no evidence definitively proving extraterrestrial life is here or exists, notes the Sky Canada report. "Nonetheless, some UAP sightings — for which data exist — remain unexplained even after investigation," the report says. That uncertainty adds to the cultural fascination around UAPs. "There is some interesting stuff being reported," said Rutkowski. "It doesn't necessarily prove that aliens are visiting us. "Everyone loves the idea of searching for UFOs or UAPs," said Sara Seager, a Canadian-American astrophysicist at MIT focused on the search for Earth-like planets. I had never thought of the field in those terms before, and that was a really, really exciting new thing to me." Seager thinks a post-secondary institution might be more appropriate. "Universities are used to educating people, so perhaps there's a way they can, as the report said, parse this into some kind of outreach about planets and stars and natural phenomena," said Seager, who wasn't involved in the report. Sky Canada never set out to prove whether we're alone in the universe, the report says, nor was that project in particular to analyze data of sightings. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb is hunting for evidence of alien technology within Earth's atmosphere and our solar system through a data-driven approach. However, his work as head of Harvard's Galileo Project was cited by Sky Canada Project as an initiative that could prove "crucial in transitioning from anecdotal evidence to more scientifically rigorous analysis" of UAP. That project will have three uniquely constructed observatories in different U.S. states upon completion that use sensors and machine learning to spot and measure speed, size, relative distance and other variables of UAP flitting around American airspace — including balloons or craft from rival governments engaging in espionage. "The software we develop, the sensors we put together can be used by the Department of Defence if these are human-made objects, so I wouldn't feel like I wasted my time if we end up finding only human-made objects," said Loeb. Rutkowski appreciates Sky Canada's calls to encourage pilots to report sightings, and for more science on a topic still at times dogged by stigma and a "ridicule factor." He was a 2024-25 Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, reality TV show star Spencer Pratt posted multiple videos on social media savaging a proposed state bill on wildfire rebuilding. In one, Pratt told his 2 million TikTok followers that he consulted an artificial intelligence engine about Senate Bill 549. He said it told him the legislation would allow L.A. County to buy burned-out lots in Pacific Palisades and convert them to low-income housing, strip away local zoning decisions and push dense reconstruction. “I don't even think this is political,” Pratt said. None of what Pratt said is in the bill. Posts have preyed on fears of neighborhood change, mistrust of government authorities and prejudice against low-income housing to assert, among other things, that the wildfires were set intentionally to raze the Palisades and replace the community with affordable housing. The chatter has unmoored debate over a major rebuilding proposal from L.A. County leaders. Under the plan, a new local authority would be able to buy burned lots, rebuild homes and offer them back at discounted rates to the original owners. There are no changes to any rules that require zoning amendments or approvals for individual housing developments. A developer has plans to build as many as 100 apartments on the lot of a burned Shell gas station in Pacific Palisades. “It's become this total meme among the right-wing blogosphere and, unfortunately, picked up by some lazy-ass journalists that don't bother to read the bill that say this bill seeks to turn the entire Palisades into low-income housing,” Allen said. Some of his own friends who lost homes in the Palisades, Allen said, have been texting him asking why he's trying to force low-income housing into the neighborhood. “People are saying I want to put a train line in there,” Allen said. The frenzy, in part, is due to an issue of timing. Last month, a 20-member expert commission impaneled by L.A. County proposed the local authority as a key recommendation for rebuilding after January's Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed 18,000 homes and other properties. An independent panel is urging California lawmakers to create a new authority to oversee rebuilding after the firestorms in Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Commission leaders then approached Allen about writing a bill that would allow for its implementation. Allen wanted to do it, but deadlines for introducing new legislation had long passed. Instead, Allen took SB 549, which had nothing to do with wildfire rebuilding but was still alive in the Legislature, and added the rebuilding authority language to it. This is a common legislative procedure used when putting forward ideas late in the year. Allen decided as well to keep the original language in the bill, which called for significant spending on low-income housing in an unrelated financing program. The version of SB 549 with the wildfire rebuilding authority in it had its first hearing in a legislative committee on Wednesday. Misinformation over the rebuilding authority was fueled by a separate announcement California Gov. State housing officials carved out $101 million from long-planned funding allocations for low-income housing and dedicated it to building new developments in Los Angeles. Higher rents persist in nearby neighborhoods and low-income residents continue to struggle. Newsom cast the announcement as assisting them in regaining their footing. After disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency directly leases apartments for survivors. Despite the horrific housing market in L.A., officials say that isn't needed here. Any developer who receives the dollars would need separate governmental approval to begin construction. Rebuild it how they want,” said a July 15 post from X user @HustleBitch_, who has nearly 124,000 followers. Newsom called the situation another example of “opportunists exploit[ing] this tragedy to stoke fear — and pit communities against each other.” “Let's be clear: The state is not taking away anyone's property, instituting some sort of mass rezoning or destroying the quality and character of destroyed neighborhoods. Period,” Newsom said in a statement to The Times. “Anyone claiming otherwise is either misinformed or deliberately lying. Still unresolved were the authority's governing structure, and whether it would encompass the Palisades or be limited to Altadena and other unincorporated areas. Pratt lost his Palisades home in the fire and has sued the city, alleging it failed to maintain an adequate water supply and other infrastructure. In social media videos this week, Pratt said he and other residents didn't trust the county with increased power over rebuilding when he believed leaders failed to protect the neighborhood in the first place. By the end of Wednesday, Allen conceded defeat on SB 549. The most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you've ever looked up at the sky and thought, “Okay, that is not a plane?" Did you know that New York is one of the top states in the country for UFO sightings? Action Network.com released their findings on a recent study, and it turns out that New Yorkers have reported over 6,100 UFO sightings. Not only are people spotting weird things in the sky, but they are going deep in the Google rabbit hole too. New Yorkers search for UFO-related stuff about 14,800 times a month. That is a lot of “What did I just see?” moments. New York landed in fifth place for total UFO sightings. Only California, Florida, Washington, and Texas beat us. But they also have much more open sky than we do. New York has some ideal spots for a close encounter. Even Western New York and Long Island have had their fair share of “Wait… what is that?” moments. Maybe it's a weather balloon ,a drone or that one neighbor who's always flying something in the sky. All we're saying is, people are seeing stuff. If you've got a weird sky story, now's the time to share it. And if you haven't, maybe take a look up in the sky tonight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese internet celebrity @Jonouchich1 is known as the ‘YouTuber' with the world's longest chin', because of his unusually long and pointy chin. The young Japanese YouTuber was ridiculed and compared to anime characters for his exceptionally long and pointy chin, but he never let the jokes get to him. If anything, he leaned into his unique look to attract more attention. Most of his YouTube and TikTok clips are centered around his chin, as it has become somewhat of a personal brand. In fact, his social media handle is inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh character Katasuya Jonouchi. Some of @Jonouchich1's nearly 350,000 YouTube fans had long asked him to gen an X-ray of his impressive chin, and the social media sensation recently did just that. He said doctors had “never seen anything like this” before, but told him that it was most likely caused by genetic factors. @Jonouchich1 had long claimed that he drank a lot of milk growing up and speculated that the calcium had caused his lower jaw to grow, but doctors shut down his theory. However, @Jonouchich1 says that he is the only one in his family with such a long and pointy chin. He showed his fans photos of himself as a 3-year-old, where he had a normal chin, but by age 5, his chin had already started growing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While official updates suggested it was a wildfire caused due to lightening, UFO enthusiasts are not convinced A lightning-sparked wildfire burning near the highly classified Area 51 military base in Nevada has reignited public speculation and conspiracy theories online. The blaze has been confirmed as part of the Gothic Fire, which has been raging across northern Nevada since July 4. Users on social media have speculated that the fire may be hiding “a crashed experimental aircraft” or that it's “evidence being destroyed.” One user referenced the viral 2019 trend to “storm Area 51,” suggesting, “maybe someone finally did it.” The region is roughly 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. It is currently 0% contained, with no timeline yet for full containment. Area 51 is a remote US Air Force facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. These aircraft often flew at altitudes and speeds far beyond what was publicly known at the time, leading civilians to report unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the skies. Its secrecy, restricted airspace, and lack of public access have fueled countless theories suggesting the base houses captured alien spacecraft, extraterrestrial life, or advanced technology reverse-engineered from alien sources. In 2019, the base drew viral attention when over 500,000 people RSVP'd to a Facebook event called “Storm Area 51: They Can't Stop All of Us.” While meant as a joke, it drew thousands of curious onlookers to nearby towns, forcing authorities to bolster security around the base. Though no concrete evidence of alien activity has ever been presented, Area 51 remains a symbol of government secrecy—and for many, a focal point for everything the public doesn't know about UFOs and unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>
