                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doug Burgum, interior secretary, and Pam Bondi, attorney general, visit island as Nancy Pelosi calls idea ‘lunacy' The president's proposal to reopen Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to steep operating costs and is now a National Park Service museum with 1.4 million visitors a year, has attracted fierce criticism from local leaders, California Democrats and the state governor. She described it as a “diversionary tactic” from the recently passed budget and “lunacy”. “Alcatraz is the brand known around the world for being effective at housing people that are in incarceration, so this is something we're here to take a look at,” Burgum told Fox News on Thursday. But reopening the prison would be an enormous logistical and financial undertaking. The site later became a symbol of Indigenous resistance when Indigenous American activists began a 19-month occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, and opened to the public for tours in 1973. Officials have said it is in no condition to serve as a detention center. “There is no realistic plan for Alcatraz to host anyone other than visitors,” Daniel Lurie, San Francisco's mayor, said on Thursday. “If the federal government has billions of dollars to spend in San Francisco, we could use that funding to keep our streets safe and clean and help our economy recover.” In response to news of tour, Gavin Newsom's press office said: “Pam Bondi will reopen Alcatraz the same day Trump lets her release the Epstein files.</p>

Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) is taking on the “retirement crisis” in the U.S. with a new bill aimed at guaranteeing pensions or solid retirement plans for every worker in America. “If we are serious about addressing the retirement crisis in America, corporations must be required to offer all of their workers a traditional pension plan that guarantees a monthly income in retirement,” Sanders said in a statement. “And if corporations refuse to offer a decent retirement plan, their workers must be allowed to receive the same type of pension that every member of Congress receives.” Research has found that pensions could play a major role in reducing poverty. This has led to an affordability crisis for retirement-age Americans and seniors, with more than half of seniors living off less than $25,000 a year and no retirement savings. Over a fifth of seniors are living in poverty, a far worse rate than in other wealthy countries, Sanders's office points out. The bill, introduced to build upon Sanders's legislation to strengthen and increase Social Security benefits, has been endorsed by several unions and progressive organizations. “Pensions have long been the bedrock of retirement for working-class people, but corporate greed has eroded that foundation. The billionaire class gutted pensions in pursuit of profit, and Washington let it happen.” Indeed, instead of making it easier for Americans to retire, Republicans have proposed raising the minimum age for benefits like Medicare and Social Security in recent years. Meanwhile, this month, Republicans passed a bill that will slash Medicaid and other crucial anti-poverty programs, which will make it even harder for Americans to save for retirement. Right-wing figures have openly said that they are against the idea of Americans being able to retire at all, effectively saying that Americans should work until they die.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent pictures of US president's enlarged legs prompted speculation surrounding his health Donald Trump is suffering from a chronic vein condition which causes swollen ankles, the White House has revealed. On Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, revealed Mr Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following tests by the White House medical team. “Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.” However, the condition can develop into more serious conditions if left untreated, such as deep vein thrombosis. "All results were within normal limits ... and the president remains in excellent health," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.https://t.co/47rRrwKvNK pic.twitter.com/IL9JJFubAA “This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. This is a well known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.” However, results of the president's annual medical examination in April said blood flow to his extremities was “unimpaired” and did not record any muscle swelling. “President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,” the report concluded, noting his “active lifestyle” and “frequent victories in golf events”. Mr Biden allegedly forgot the names of close aides and people he had known for decades, and was later forced to suspend his re-election campaign following his disastrous performance in the first televised presidential debate. In May, Mr Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which had seemingly been missed by White House doctors.</p>

Blackburn, a supporter of privatized charter schools who has endorsed Trump's effort to eliminate the Education Department, accused the NEA of embracing “radical left policies and antisemitism.” Harris declared that “it's time to remove Congress' seal of approval from this rogue organization.” Becky Pringle, the union's president, hit back at Blackburn, Harris, and other supporters of the legislation, saying in a statement that “rather than supporting students and educators, some anti-public education politicians are now introducing legislation to repeal the National Education Association charter because the billionaires that fund their campaigns don't want educators to have a voice.” “Let me be clear — public school educators will never stop advocating for our students and communities, and the National Education Association will never stop lifting up the voice of those educators who dedicate their lives to the success of all of our students,” said Pringle. Republican lawmakers have been working for years to strip the NEA of its federal charter to express disapproval of the organization's support for progressive causes. “Revoking the NEA's charter would not, on its own, do any of those things,” Education Week reported. “But Aaron Withe, chief executive officer of the Freedom Foundation, suggested that additional legislation would be introduced next week, ‘whether that be removing [the NEA charter] entirely, or stripping it, or changing how it operates. Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement Wednesday that the NEA is “one of the most powerful voices for public education” and warned that “some in Congress want to destroy them because they don't like what the NEA says and does.” Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>﻿Kimberly's father's home in Mexico was a very small “tent looking” structure, she says. He spent most of his young life working, and never attended high school. Born in the United States, Kimberly, who requested anonymity, and her two sisters are now educated US citizens. Their parents remain undocumented; for more than two decades, they have lived under the radar working the low-paid jobs that keep America running – as cleaners, in childcare and in construction. But while Kimberly says her parents are safe for now, she worries that could change at any moment. She says life feels “unreal” and “like a nightmare” since US President Donald Trump began cracking down on illegal immigration, executing mass deportations since taking office in January –  reigniting her lifelong fear of losing her parents. “What I see now is that we're kind of losing humanity. “My parents might not have papers or the legal documents to live here, but they are also human… a piece of paper doesn't make you human.” “I remember as a kid being in the car and always looking back to see if there were any police cars because there would be times when people would get pulled over and they wouldn't know where the police cars came from,” she told CNN. As a child, she could tell her parents were nervous even though they tried to hide it. But I could see all of my parents' emotions very clearly.” A supermarket owner in Virginia says he is short-staffed due to President Donald Trump's immigration policy changes. For years, her family tried to live in places with other Mexicans so they could help support each other and blend in. Her parents worked long hours, often arriving home late at night. Their employers gave them the paperwork to file taxes and Kimberly emphasizes that her parents have always contributed to the US economy by paying taxes, despite their undocumented status. When the girls were old enough to stay alone for a few hours after school, their mother started working two jobs. “We would spend around maybe two hours before my mom came home, and then my mom would cook dinner and she would make sure that we were OK before going off to her second shift and then throughout that time my sisters and I would do homework, study,” she said. “My youngest sister was around 4 or 5 at the time, and so when she would ask when my parents are coming home, I couldn't give her a definite answer. All I could say was she'll be home soon, and then an hour after she would ask again and I couldn't really give her a straight answer. Her parents thought about trying to file for green cards, but they heard that it could take years to become documented, and that they could be deported during the process – a risk they could not take with three young daughters. Today, Kimberly says she worries her parents will be swept up in an immigration raid and sent to a detention facility – or even deported – without any notice. In those circumstances, it would be difficult for her to communicate with them and make sure they get back to Mexico safely, she says. “Now when I see what's going on with ICE, it's exactly as I imagined it as a kid,” Kimberly said, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But if it happened, she would consider moving to Mexico to be with them – a reluctant reversal after living so much of the American dream that her parents had for her. “There were many times when I was younger where my parents thought about going back to Mexico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Richardson's ground squirrel weighs less than a pound, is about a foot long and is native to the northern Plains. Joshua Herman said fighting the squirrels is akin to “one guy standing against a massive storm”. “If I'm trapping but my neighbor isn't, well then, we're really not going to get anywhere with it, long-term,” Herman said. Ground squirrels have been an issue in Minot, a city of nearly 50,000 people, for at least 20 years, but the problem has dramatically worsened in the last few years, said the Minot street department superintendent, Kevin Braaten. It's unclear how many of the squirrels live in Minot but it probably nears or even exceeds the city's population. “I don't see the population ever going to zero,” Braaten said. “I mean, it's almost impossible by the numbers that we have.” Outside of town, predators like coyotes, badgers, owls and even snakes love to dine on the squirrels. But in residential neighborhoods and even downtown, where few of their predators live, the rodents can roam pretty freely. Greg Gullickson, an outreach biologist with the North Dakota game and fish department, adds that the squirrels now have fewer grassland areas available to them and like the mowed spots they find in town. Female squirrels typically give birth to litters of about six babies a year, so it's easy to see how their numbers can quickly soar. Herman said he kills 3,500 to 5,000 of them a year, primarily by putting snares and carbon monoxide into the holes, and using an air rifle. “I've had calls downtown, calls in the mall, along the highways, here at the airport – really every part of the city I've done trapping for ground squirrels here in Minot,” Herman said as he checked his traps along an apartment building and shoveled dirt over holes. Herman says they damage driveways, sidewalks and lawns; create tripping hazards with their holes and can harbor disease from fleas. I didn't know if it was going to bite her,” Grandson said. North of town, Minot air force base, which houses bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, has fought the ground squirrels for years. Base officials declined to comment on the squirrels. Jared Edwards, facilities director for Minot Public Schools, which has three schools on the base, said residential areas of the base and runways are overrun by ground squirrels. “I'm not going to exaggerate: they're by the millions out there,” Edwards said. In town, three school properties have large populations of ground squirrels, he said. Last year, the school system began using snares, and for years before that had used poison. It is Mother Nature,” Edwards said, adding that they had probably been in the area since homesteaders came through. Still, not everyone sees the squirrels as a pest. Herman said people have sabotaged, stolen or thrown out his traps. They occasionally confront him when he shoots at ground squirrels with an air rifle, scolding him for hurting the wildlife, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A modernized Ukrainian An-124 Ruslan cargo aircraft was relocated from Ukraine to Germany last week in a rare wartime flight, according to a July 17 statement from the Antonov company. The plane departed Kyiv on July 11, marking its first flight since Ukrainian airspace was closed for safety reasons following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The aircraft, originally produced in 1994 and bearing serial number 0706, was safely transferred abroad following years of extensive upgrades. The An-124 had logged more than 21,000 flight hours across over 5,500 flights before undergoing a major overhaul. Antonov said the modernization project began in 2021 and focused on replacing critical components originally manufactured in Russia with modern parts sourced from Western and Ukrainian suppliers. The upgraded aircraft will now serve international operations. Antonov confirmed that its current fleet has been moved to secure locations under internal safety protocols. The former director of Antonov, Serhii Bychkov, was charged in April 2023 with negligence for allegedly failing to evacuate the Mriya despite repeated warnings.

Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Germany will provide Ukraine with new long-range missiles "very shortly, very soon," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, without mentioning the name of the weapons being supplied. The "Test in Ukraine" initiative will allow foreign companies and governments to create solutions for real war challenges while receiving immediate feedback from military personnel and improving products based on combat experience. Held under NATO auspices, the exercises aim to boost combat readiness and interoperability among allied and partner nations. "On one hand, it is very positive that President Trump is taking on a strong stance on Russia... On the other hand, 50 days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians," EU Special Envoy Kaja Kallas said. Allied capabilities now allow NATO to "take that (Kaliningrad) down from the ground" faster than ever before, U.S. Army Europe and Africa commander General Chris Donahue said. "The people of America need this technology, and you need to have it in your arsenal," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's 41st Combined Arms Army fighting in eastern Ukraine has suffered "catastrophic" losses, according to internal documents published on July 17 by Ukraine's "I Want to Live" government project. Launched in September 2022 by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR), the 24-hour "I Want to Live" hotline helps Russian soldiers willingly surrender themselves or their units to the Ukrainian army. "Russians who are not indifferent to the fate of Russia have given us documents that reveal the scale of losses of Russian troops in Ukraine," the project said in a post on social media. The documents detail the toll on Russia's 41st Combined Arms Army, a major military formation made up of four motorized infantry brigades, with soldiers primarily drawn from Siberia and southern Russia. As of June 1, 2025, at least 8,625 troops from this army had been killed in combat, 10,491 were listed as missing in action, and another 7,846 had deserted. The 35th Brigade from Altai Krai in Southern Siberia reported 1,975 killed, 3,163 missing, and 2,229 desertions. The 55th Brigade from Tuva, bordering Mongolia, once a small formation of 1,600, has lost 1,430 troops killed, 1,467 missing, and 1,616 deserting. The 137th Brigade reported at least 1,158 killed, 2,319 missing, and 948 deserting. On a single day, May 31, 42 soldiers fled their units, according to the project. Of those, 28% were former prisoners recruited into penal assault units known as "V companies." "It is also worth noting that the 'V companies' exist exclusively in motorized rifle brigades, where prisoners are used as cannon fodder," the statement from "I Want to Live" said, describing the losses as "catastrophic." The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Russian losses in Ukraine hit a massive, and grim milestone on June 12 — 1 million Russian soldiers killed or wounded during the 39-month-long full-scale war, according to figures from Kyiv. Although hugely symbolic, the number is unlikely to prompt a change in tactics from Moscow as it gears up for more offensives this summer, and escalates drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians. "(Russian President) Vladimir Putin made a fundamental strategic mistake in deciding how to resource this war," George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told the Kyiv Independent. "What Vladimir Putin has done is he has created a system in which he doesn't use the monopoly of violence of the Russian state to coerce Russians to go fight and die in Ukraine, as the Soviet Union might have. What Putin has done is he's created an alternative social contract where he pays you to go fight in Ukraine. "That strategy can work if you're planning on running a short war. It does not work if you are running a multi-year protracted war."

Germany will provide Ukraine with new long-range missiles "very shortly, very soon," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, without mentioning the name of the weapons being supplied.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with TASS, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev, both a politician and a lawyer, outlined the key lessons Russia has drawn from that historic event and explained its continued relevance in the context of the current situation around Ukraine.​ In parallel, London developed Operation Unthinkable, a war plan against the Soviet Union. In doing so, we must use the "correct lenses", without being naive or considering the events of July 1945 in isolation from the centuries-long attitude of European, or, more broadly, Western elites toward our country. Since the time of Peter the Great, when Russia established itself as a European power, we have witnessed a consistent trend of hostility, distrust and attempts to weaken our country in Western actions. As part of various coalitions, they [Western countries] have sought to turn Russia into Europe's stepdaughter who was admitted only to the threshold the pan-European house for re-education. They have also sought to impose a subservient role on our country in European and, later, global affairs. To Western elites, an independent and strong Russia has always been a historical anomaly and a very effective rebuff to the idea of their supposed "civilizational superiority". This is why Western elites have been making repeated attempts to isolate Russia and avenge their past failures. And today's developments - a proxy war, or actually a full-out war involving the launch of Western-made missiles and satellite reconnaissance, sanctions packages, and loud statements on militarization in Europe – are yet another attempt to destroy the `historical anomaly' that the West hates so much, to destroy our country. And we should therefore act accordingly, responding in full or even delivering pre-emptive strikes if need be. The Potsdam Conference was an important history lesson for us. And today, as in 1945, our country is fighting not only to protect its borders, but also the idea of a just world order. Can the approaches outlined there be applied to present-day Ukraine? And which Ds could be added or adjusted, in your vision? – The three 'D's – demilitarization, denazification and democratization – were developed to address Nazi Germany as an aggressor state that destroyed the world order. There is a cult of collaborationist and Nazi ideologists, as well as swastikas and Totenkopf prints on military uniforms and armored combat vehicles, not to mention other references to the Third Reich. The militarization of society adds to this, with armed groups acquiring not only military, but also political functions, some of which, in effect, are poorly controlled by the state. Like the Third Reich in its final months, present-day Ukraine is clearly experiencing an economic and management crisis that has been solely addressed through external funding and mobilization rhetoric. Demilitarization is not a punishment, but an opportunity for Ukraine to stop being used as a pawn in someone else's bloody geopolitical games, which often target Ukraine itself. For this reason, too, the country's non-aligned status is an essential part of its demilitarization. Furthermore, eliminating insane defense expenditures would provide additional funds for rebuilding its shattered economy. Denazification or debanderization is not an act of revenge, but rather long-term work with public conscience and historical memory. The peoples of our countries and many other former Soviet republics share a common historical destiny. This shared heritage creates huge potential for not only peaceful neighborly relations, but also cooperation and joint development. It involves restoring legal institutions, a free press, competition, and the separation of powers. Had these mechanisms been fully operational in Ukraine, its history since 2014 would have taken a far more favorable path. To the three 'D's, I would add a fourth: deparasitization, or disinsection. Residents of the territories currently controlled by the so-called Ukraine must learn to live independently and take responsibility for their actions. Otherwise, a parasitic Ukraine has no chance of preserving its statehood. Should this fact not only be acknowledged but also emphasized in the Russian historical narrative? – I have addressed this topic on numerous occasions in my speeches and articles. Rather than implementing genuine denazification measures in the territories under their control, our Western "allies" settled for superficial and perfunctory actions. Most Nazi criminals tried with the participation of Western judicial authorities got off with little more than a slap on the wrist, receiving exceedingly lenient sentences or being granted amnesty just a few years after the war. Neither they, nor their descendants or close associates, were barred from entering positions of power. The consequences of this astonishing "tolerance" toward Nazi criminals, combined with rabid and hysterical Russophobia, are being felt to this day. This is especially true in countries that served as Hitler's lackeys or expendable resources: the Baltic states, Poland, and Ukraine, which has embraced a Banderite identity. A striking example is the recent statement by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius about the country's readiness to "kill Russian soldiers" on the "eastern flank" and to always deal with Russia "from a position of strength." All of this echoes the hypocrisy of those self-proclaimed "anti-fascists" who like to say their grandfather "heroically died in a concentration camp after falling from a guard tower." Let me remind you that our president stated unequivocally: Russia does not intend to go to war with NATO or ‘attack Europe.' I would also like to add that this kind of drivel is deliberately injected into the information space to destabilize an already difficult situation. It is yet another front in the West's open war against us. Without question, all such facts must be brought to light, not swept under the rug.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President's biggest allies are breaking ranks and demanding he release the Epstein files, scared the Maga movement will turn on its heels The US president's administration has accidentally deported the wrong people in sweeping immigration round-ups, overseen a power grab that has repeatedly butted up against the Supreme Court, leaked highly sensitive military information in a Signal chat and bombed nuclear sites in Iran. Mr Trump has dabbled in conspiracies for years: Barack Obama was born in Kenya, Ted Cruz's father had a link to JFK's killer. And so when the Department of Justice concluded the Epstein had no “client list” and died by suicide, not murder, he faced a predictable rebellion. It is now open season with officials at war with each other, once-loyal podcasters attacking the White House, and even the most moderate voices like Republican leaders in Congress weighing in. Benny Johnson, the hugely popular Maga commentator, told viewers on Wednesday of the crisis: “It's been abysmal and people aren't satisfied.” Far-right conspiracy theorist and podcaster Alex Jones called Mr Trump's handling of the Epstein situation “the biggest train wreck I've ever seen”. It has caused the US president to hit out at his own side, labelling them “weaklings” for believing the “hoax” about Epstein. He said Maga loyalists had fallen “hook, line, and sinker” for conspiracy theories which began shortly after the disgraced financier was found dead in his Manhattan cell in 2019. Loyalists from Megyn Kelly to Tucker Carlson have called for Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to resign over her failure to deliver, after she claimed in February that Epstein's client list was “sitting on [her] desk”. “The biggest problem is Pam Bondi let too much out before she had even seen anything, right? But it is the polling that might worry Mr Trump most. More than six in 10 voters disapprove of how the Trump administration handled its investigation into the convicted sex offender, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Just 17 per cent of voters surveyed said they were satisfied with the DOJs conclusions that Epstein kept no client list. “It's a very delicate subject but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it,” he told Benny Johnson's podcast. Though Trump cannot legally run for another term, he will need strong support from a united party to pass his remaining legislative agenda in a narrowly divided Congress. But trying to escape the corner he has backed himself into may be to do what he does best, throw more mud at the problem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese trading house Mitsubishi MSBHF said on Thursday it would expand its salmon farming by acquiring additional businesses in Norway and Canada, as Japanese companies continue to grow in the food sector, with a focus on protein. Faced with volatile fossil fuel markets and in search of stable revenue streams, Mitsubishi and its rivals have been diversifying into the food business, where demand is set to grow alongside a rising world population. “In recent years, securing food resources has become a critical global challenge driven by population growth,” Mitsubishi said in a statement. The acquisition of three companies from Norwegian Grieg Seafood ASA GRGSF was made via Cermaq Group, Mitsubishi's salmon farming company with assets in Norway, Canada and Chile. The acquisition price is NOK10.2-billion ($1.3-billion), Cermaq said in a separate statement. Salmon is among the most popular sushi items in Japan, but the bulk of it is imported from other countries, including Norway and Chile. Japan aims to raise the share of locally sourced seafood it consumes to 94 per cent in 2033 from 54 per cent now. In October, Marubeni MARUY began selling salmon from a farm operated near Mount Fuji by its Norwegian partner, adding to the seafood business where its rivals Mitsubishi and Mitsui MITSY are also present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada's main stock index rose to a record high on Thursday, aided by gains for financial and technology shares, as Alimentation Couche-Tard abandoned a major takeover bid and U.S. data pointed to economic resilience. The S&P/TSX composite index ended up 233.96 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 27,386.93, surpassing Monday's record closing high. “Market strength has been unexpected and pretty exceptional, and that can be attributed to data that shows both Canada and the U.S. are holding up despite ongoing tariff threats,” said Elvis Picardo, a portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth. “This rally has been relentless - hardly any pullbacks,” Mr. Picardo said. The S&P 500 stock index and the Nasdaq Composite also both closed at record highs on Thursday, as investors embraced strong economic data and earnings reports that showed American consumers remained willing to spend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 247.64 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 44,502.42. Wall Street has had a strong run since tumbling after President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcements in early April and then recovering. This week was seen as a proving ground for these gains though, with a number of key economic reports and the start of second-quarter earnings season. Economic data and corporate earnings reports “are showing that the economic backdrop is still pretty solid, and so markets have been able to grind higher this week with some data to support where we are going,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. U.S. retail sales bounced back sharply in June, data showed on Thursday. Investors saw renewed economic momentum and confidence among consumers, after mixed inflation data which showed stalled producer prices and a spike in consumer inflation in the same month. Investors have been watching for signs of whether Trump's tariff policies are starting to permeate the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve has indicated it will hold off on interest rate cuts until it can see the inflationary impact of higher import taxes. This was reiterated on Thursday by Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who said rate cuts are on hold for now, as Trump's tariffs begin to push up consumer prices. Traders now peg the odds of a September rate cut at just over 54 per cent, with a July move nearly ruled out, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Accompanying strong retail sales was upbeat commentary from consumer-facing American companies. PepsiCo jumped after forecasting upbeat results, fueled by demand for energy drinks and healthier sodas, helping offset concerns about a dip in annual core profit. United Airlines gained after the carrier projected stronger demand since early July, offering a rare bright spot for an industry strained by Trump's budget cuts and trade tensions. Technology stocks were also buoyed, in particular U.S. chipmakers, after TSMC, the world's main producer of advanced AI chips, posted a record quarterly profit, saying demand for artificial intelligence was getting stronger.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Rally parliamentary faction, has announced plans to run for a seat in parliament if the snap elections are held. "I will run in the elections and will defend my candidature in relevant instances - the administrative court, and then the Council of State," she said in an interview with Le Parisien. According to Le Pen, the process in these instances will give her a possibility to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council, which will be obliged to check the decision banning her from taking part in elections for the compliance with the constitution. Early elections to the National Assembly, or the lower house of parliament, will be called if President Emmanuel Macron exercises his constitutional right to dissolve the lower house. On March 31, a Paris court sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison in connection with the parliamentary assistants case. The court also ruled to bar her from holding elected office and participating in elections for five years. Unlike the prison term, this measure took immediate effect and can only be overturned if an appeal succeeds. This ruling disqualifies her from running in the French presidential election in 2027 or participating in parliamentary elections in the event of an early dissolution of the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament). Le Pen slammed the ruling as politically motivated and filed an appeal with a higher court. The appellate review is expected to conclude by summer 2026.</p>
