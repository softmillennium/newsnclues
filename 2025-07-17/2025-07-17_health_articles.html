                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How this happened is one of humankind's greatest mysteries. Today, scientists work to develop synthetic cells that mimic living cells, hoping to uncover clues that will help answer the question: how did life on Earth begin? While there's no single definition of life, three elements recur across biology: Yet this cycle of building up and breaking down molecules is a critical aspect of how living cells respond to environmental stimuli, replicate and evolve. Now researchers from the University of California San Diego have designed a system that synthesizes cell membranes and incorporates metabolic activity. Life today is highly evolved, but we want to understand if metabolism can occur in very simple chemical systems, before the evolution of more complex biology occurred." Neal Devaraj, the Murray Goodman Endowed Chair in Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego and principal investigator on the paper Lipids are fatty compounds that play a crucial role in many cell functions. Lipid membranes are dynamic, capable of remodeling themselves in response to cellular demands. As a crucial step in understanding how living cells evolved, Devaraj's lab designed a system where lipids can not only form membranes, but through metabolism, can also break them down. This is important in helping understand how life emerged on prebiotic Earth, when only nonliving matter existed. said Alessandro Fracassi, a postdoctoral scholar in Devaraj's lab and first author on the paper. The fatty acids then couple with lysophospholipids, which generate phospholipids. These phospholipids spontaneously form membranes, but in the absence of fuel, they break down and return to the fatty acid and lysophospholipid components. "We know a lot about living cells and what they're made of," stated Fracassi. "But if you laid out all the separate components, we don't actually understand how to put them together to make the cell function as it does. In addition to shedding light on how life may have begun in an abiotic environment, the development of artificial cells can have a real-world impact. Drug delivery, biomanufacturing, environmental remediation, biomimetic sensors are all possibilities over the coming decades as we continue to deepen our understanding of how life on Earth came to be. "We may not see these kinds of advancements for 10 or 20 years," Devaraj noted. Authors: Alessandro Fracassi, Andrés Seoane, Hong-Guen Lee, Alexander Harjung and Neal K.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas McElrath, MD, PhD, of the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Brigham & Women's Hospital, is the lead and corresponding author of a paper published in JAMA Network Open, "Utility of the US Preventive Services Task Force for Preeclampsia Risk Assessment and Aspirin Prophylaxis." Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience? Dr. McElrath: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disease that complicates 7-10% of pregnancies. While recent advances in understanding the underlying causes of PE have been made, predicting its occurrence has historically been difficult because it is a complex condition that likely results from a variety of causes and can present in different ways. To address this challenge, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed a series of PE-associated studies to develop a set of risk factors to assist in characterizing patient risk of PE. However, since these risk factors were identified in individual and separate studies, they have not been evaluated as a whole to see how effective they are at stratifying risk within a single, diverse patient population. We aimed to assess how well these guidelines help physicians identify patients at risk of PE and if those patients who were identified as being at-risk patients were directed to take aspirin as a preventative measure. We found that using the USPSTF guidelines identified 89% of participants as being at either moderate or high risk for PE. With the vast majority of the population being labeled as "at risk," it is unclear if the USPSTF guidelines are serving their intended use of helping clinicians identify patients at most need of additional care. Furthermore, we found that only 37% of the participants who were identified as being at moderate risk were receiving the recommended prophylaxis of one low-dose aspirin per day, suggesting a gap still exists between risk identification and connection to preventative care. How well do the risk assessment guidelines for preeclampsia that were developed by the USPTF work in identifying those at increased risk of preeclampsia? Q: What methods or approach did you use? We approached and enrolled 5,600+ individuals with singleton pregnancies who met the inclusion criteria for the study at 11 different centers in geographically diverse area of the United States. Individuals were defined as being in the moderate risk category if they had at least one of the moderate risk factors, but no high-risk factors. Participants were defined as being in the low-risk category if they had no moderate or high-risk factors. These categories were therefore labeling 89% of the population as at moderate or high risk for PE. With the majority of the population being labeled as risk, it is unclear if the USPSTF guidelines are serving their intended use of assisting clinicians in stratifying preeclampsia risk. While the majority of patients (82%) at high risk for PE received a recommendation for aspirin prophylaxis, patients at moderate risk for PE received recommendations at much lower rates. Only about half of the patients with two or more moderate risk factors received recommendations for an aspirin prophylaxis while less than 25% of patients with one risk factor received a recommendation for aspirin. The risk factors for PE, and probably other conditions, should be simultaneously evaluated in a single population, not just compiled from the results of separate and individual studies, to ensure that they provide clinically actionable information that can assist with patient risk stratification and the alignment of clinical resources.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Each cell activates only the genes it needs, silencing the rest through molecular "switches" present on each gene. However, these switches can sometimes be erroneously activated, leading the cell to behave abnormally and potentially resulting in diseases such as cancer or autoimmune disorders. The activity of these "switches" is regulated by their methylation status, chemical marks that can be added to or removed from DNA. Thanks to new tools based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, the team led by Dr José Luis Sardina, group leader at the Josep Carreras Institute, has succeeded in controlling the "switch" of the IL1RN gene in cells derived from human leukemia, turning it on or off by adding or removing these chemical marks. The results of the study, led by Dr Gemma Valcárcel and conducted in collaboration with Dr. Esteban Ballestar's team, have just been published in the prestigious journal Science Advances. The research demonstrates how precise control of IL1RN gene activity affects the production of inflammatory cells that respond abnormally to external stimuli. This altered response causes the cells to produce modified inflammatory cytokines, showing a distinct capacity to modulate tumor growth in laboratory models. This proof of concept demonstrates that it is possible to regulate the activity of key immune system genes such as IL1RN through DNA methylation, thereby modulating functions like inflammation or tumor progression. Although researchers already suspected that such chemical modifications could influence immune system behavior, this study provides the first experimental evidence confirming that connection and revealing its functional consequences. With this knowledge and the technological capability to activate or deactivate individual genes with precision, the door is opened to the development of new strategies aimed at intervening in the most fundamental biological processes of immune cells and, potentially, new therapies for certain subtypes of leukemia and other diseases with an inflammatory component.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study by a Tulane University researcher casts doubt on a widely used shortcut in rectal cancer drug trials, raising concerns that some treatments may be fast-tracked for approval without evidence they help patients live longer. The study, published in JAMA Network Open in collaboration with researchers at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, found that the absence of detectable tumors after treatment – a key metric in clinical cancer drug trials known as pathologic complete response or pCR – does not reliably predict an improvement in long-term survival for patients diagnosed with rectal cancer. Traditionally, success of treatments for these patients was determined by measuring "overall survival," or the years between a person's diagnosis and death. Since 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed pharmaceutical companies to use tumor-free status post-therapy as a surrogate for overall survival to cut down on time and expenses needed to approve new cancer treatments. The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 25 clinical trials involving nearly 12,000 rectal cancer patients. They found no statistical relationship between pCR and overall survival, meaning cancer drugs may be moving toward development without showing meaningful long-term improvements over existing treatments, said first author Kavin Sugumar, chief resident of general surgery at Tulane University School of Medicine. The FDA has approved pCR as a substitute for a result that would normally take years to determine, but we found that pCR should not be used as a sole endpoint to determine if a cancer treatment has been effective." PCR remains vital for effectively determining if cancer has been cleared locally from tissue, and patients whose tumors disappear often fare better than those who don't. The use of pCR as a gold standard for drug approval may also increase costs for drug companies which may invest in approved therapies that cannot guarantee improved survival rates. "Overall survival is a costly and time-consuming endpoint to determine, and I don't think we've found the ideal surrogate yet," Sugumar said. "Instead of relying solely on pCR, we should maybe include a combination of surrogate endpoints that also includes pCR." Pathologic Complete Response and Survival in Rectal Cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The method could become an alternative in resource-limited settings where laparoscopic techniques are not generally available. Groin hernias are more common in men, but women are more likely to experience complications due to this condition. Many women in low- and middle-income countries who need surgery for groin hernias lack access to laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). To evaluate a new method using open surgery, the researchers conducted a randomised clinical trial at two publicly funded hospitals in Uganda. The study included 200 women who underwent groin hernia surgery and were followed up after two weeks and after one year. The evaluation showed that the new surgical method was effective for both femoral and inguinal groin hernias. Its effectiveness for both types is particularly important as the study also showed that nearly 45 percent of the women had femoral hernias, which carry a higher risk of complications. Alphonsus Matovu, PhD, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet and first author of the article The results are promising as the new method could be developed into a viable alternative where access to advanced laparoscopic surgery is limited. "Women with groin hernias can suffer serious and even fatal complications and therefore need access to effective surgical methods," says Jenny Löfgren, docent at the same department and last author of the article. "The new method could become a valuable tool to improve care for millions of women". To improve treatment, the new method will also be compared with other surgical methods, both open and laparoscopic.

"Pharmacists are an essential part of the primary care team," Alsabbagh said. "They can provide guidance to prescribers on individual prescriptions, appropriate dosages for each patient, inform policy decisions to address inequities and connect patients to support services, if necessary."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is characterized by a poor prognosis and rising mortality. While its interaction with tumor microenvironment cells is well-documented, the specific mechanisms by which Gal-3 mediates tumor-stromal interactions and promotes metabolic reprogramming linked to drug resistance remain unclear. This research, published in the Genes & Diseases journal by a team from Capital Medical University, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Shandong First Medical University, and Cardiff University School of Medicine elucidates whether the inhibition of Gal-3 expression in tumor or stromal cells can improve the efficacy of gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapeutic agent for PAAD. Analysis of multiple RNA sequencing public datasets revealed that Gal-3 is not only remarkably up-regulated in tumors but also significantly associated with the tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) in PAAD patients. Notably, high Gal-3 expression correlated strongly with poor patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer. Using a co-culture model of PAAD cells and pancreatic stellate cells, the researchers demonstrated that Gal-3 mediated the Ca2+/−calcineurin-NFAT pathway to increase the transcription of C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) and basigin (BSG) in TAFs. Interestingly, the Gal-3-mediated signaling cascade was shown to suppress oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells. Elevated CCL2, secreted by Gal-3-activated TAFs, inhibited NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) activity, reducing ROS levels, mitochondrial ATP production, and oxygen consumption. Further investigations revealed that Gal-3 enhances gemcitabine resistance via two mechanisms, CCL2-CCR2 signaling and the BSG-FAK-ERK pathway. Inhibition of these pathways reversed drug resistance and reduced tumor sphere formation. In orthotopic pancreatic xenograft models, co-treatment with modified citrus pectin (MCP)—a natural Gal-3 inhibitor—and AC-73, in combination with gemcitabine, significantly reduced tumor growth without adverse effects. These findings suggest that Gal-3 inhibition in vivo can effectively potentiate the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine. Overall, given its food-derived origin and safety profile, MCP presents a promising avenue for further development as an adjunctive therapy in pancreatic cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This fungus species can cause aspergillosis-a respiratory infection affecting the lungs. In high-risk populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, aspergillosis can be life-threatening and lead to poor patient outcomes. Owing to its allodiploid hybrid nature, A. latus has been associated with both colonization and clinical disease, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and some strains have shown reduced susceptibility to antifungal agents. Recent reports indicate that certain European and American aspergillosis cases could be attributed to A. latus. To identify and characterize A. latus strains from clinical isolates and address the concerns around cryptic species of Aspergillus that lack definite and observable morphological characteristics, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Hiroki Takahashi from the Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, Japan, has conducted a new study. The research team comprised Dr. Saho Shibata, Dr. Momotaka Uchida, and Dr. Takashi Yaguchi from the Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, along with Dr. Vit Hubka from the Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic. Their findings were published in Volume 63, Issue 6 of Medical Mycology on June 10, 2025. "The complexity of fungal pathogens and their resistance mechanisms presents both a fascinating scientific challenge and an important public health issue, which I am eager to explore," says Dr. Takahashi, explaining the motivation behind the present study. Initially, the researchers analyzed 23 A. spinulosporus strains, which were collected between 2012 and 2023. To accurately identify A. latus strains among the samples, the team utilized comprehensive phenotyping and genome sequencing analysis. The team identified seven A. latus strains among the 23 samples, which are clinically significant given that A. latus strains were not previously reported in Japan. Furthermore, through phylogenetic analyses, they observed that while one copy of the calmodulin gene aligned with the genetic sequence of A. spinulosporus, the other copy clustered with A. sublatus. Inspired by their findings, the researchers went a step further and conducted antifungal susceptibility testing of different Aspergillus strains to antifungal medications. Japanese strains of A. latus showed reduced susceptibility to caspofungin and amphotericin B drugs. Also, genomic analysis revealed multiple amino acid insertions and deletions in one of the two alleles of the fks1 gene, which encodes a key component of the fungal cell wall biosynthesis machinery. This fks1 gene is associated with resistance to echinocandin-class antifungal drugs. Taken together, this study provides significant observations regarding the clinical relevance, prevalence, and potential role of A. latus as a disease-causing agent. Improved and reliable molecular diagnostic tools are vital for the accurate identification of A. latus strains and the subsequent management of aspergillosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore extremely important. A KAIST research team has identified a new molecular mechanism in which alcohol-damaged liver cells increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death and inflammatory responses. KAIST (President Kwang-Hyung Lee) announced on the 17th that a research team led by Professor Won-Il Jeong from the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, in collaboration with Professor Won Kim's team at Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, has uncovered the molecular pathway of liver damage and inflammation caused by alcohol consumption. This finding offers new clues for the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Professor Won-Il Jeong's research team found that during chronic alcohol intake, expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 increases, leading to glutamate accumulation in hepatocytes. Subsequent binge drinking causes rapid changes in intracellular calcium levels, which then triggers glutamate* secretion. The secreted glutamate stimulates the glutamate receptor mGluR5 on liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), which induces ROS production and activates a pathological pathway resulting in hepatocyte death and inflammation. A particularly groundbreaking aspect of this study is that damaged hepatocytes and Kupffer cells can form a "pseudosynapse"—a structure similar to a synapse which is previously thought to occur only in the brain—enabling them to exchange signals. Simply put, the damaged hepatocytes don't just die—they send distress signals to nearby immune cells, prompting a response. This discovery proposes a new paradigm: even in peripheral organs, direct structural contact between cells can allow signal transmission. It also shows that damaged hepatocytes can actively stimulate macrophages and induce regeneration through cell death, revealing the liver's "autonomous recovery function." The team also confirmed in animal models that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of VGLUT3, mGluR5, or the ROS-producing enzyme NOX2 reduces alcohol-induced liver damage. They also confirmed that the same mechanism observed in animal models was present in human patients with ALD by analyzing blood and liver tissue samples. These findings may serve as new molecular targets for early diagnosis and treatment of ASH in the future." This study was jointly led by Dr. Keungmo Yang (now at Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital) and Kyurae Kim, doctoral candidate at KAIST, who served as co-first authors. It was conducted in collaboration with Professor Won Kim's team at Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center and was published in the journal Nature Communications on July 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on July 9, 2025, titled "A novel anti-human CD25 mAb with preferential reactivity to activated T regulatory cells depletes them from the tumor microenvironment." In this study, researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, led by first author Maja Buszko and corresponding author Ethan M. Shevach, discovered a new monoclonal antibody that selectively targets a subset of immune cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs). These cells, while normally important for preventing autoimmunity, also can block the body's ability to fight cancer by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. The researchers identified an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody with several atypical properties and named it 2B010. The treatment of these mouse models with 2B010 significantly decreased the number of Tregs in tumors and boosted the activity of CD8+ T cells, which are essential for killing cancer cells. Importantly, 2B010 worked without disrupting other key immune functions. Unlike traditional Anti-CD25 antibodies, it did not interfere with interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, which is essential for the growth and activity of effector T cells that fight cancer. "2B010 also had no effect on IL-2 induced STAT5 phosphorylation or CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro while both were blocked by Clone D1 further supporting the view that 2B010 does not recognize the IL-2 binding site." This finding is especially significant because high levels of Tregs in tumors are associated with poor outcomes in many cancers. By specifically removing these cells, 2B010 may help overcome one of the main barriers to current immunotherapy approaches. Its ability to preserve IL-2 signaling could also make it safer and more effective when used alone or in combination with existing therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Researchers suggest this may be due to limitations in the preclinical systems used, such as the lack of tumor-specific T cells in humanized mice. Nevertheless, these findings demonstrate that 2B010 has a unique mechanism of action that could complement other cancer immunotherapies in future clinical trials. In conclusion, the development of 2B010 is a promising step toward selectively disrupting the immune suppressive environment in tumors. As researchers continue to refine and test this antibody, it could become a powerful tool for enhancing the effectiveness of cancer treatments and improving outcomes for patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food insecurity is not only linked with, but directly causes symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to research published in the open access journal PLOS Mental Health. The authors therefore propose that interventions to reduce food insecurity would have immediate positive impacts on mental health. Social determinants play a role in the development of poor mental health, and food insecurity has been associated with increased anxiety and depression, though it has been unclear whether this effect is causal and the timescale over which it occurs. The authors collected monthly data between September 2022 and August 2023 from almost 500 adults in the UK and France. For those individuals, fluctuations between food insecurity and security were associated with changes in anxiety and depression, with deteriorations in mental health occurring when they experienced food insecurity and improvements when food security improved. The authors were able to predict mental health variations based on food security changes during the previous month. Such rapid changes in mental health suggest that the effects are related to food security rather than longer-term nutritional changes which would take longer to manifest in mood alterations. The authors conclude that food insecurity causes rapidly emerging negative effects on mental health, and interventions to prevent food insecurity are likely to quickly and effectively reduce prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in populations currently experiencing periodic food insecurity. The authors note: "What really impressed us was how rapidly symptoms of anxiety and depression responded to changes in participants' food insecurity status and the large size of the effects". The authors add: "Our results suggest that eliminating periodic food insecurity in those currently experiencing it could reduce the number of people with clinically concerning symptoms of anxiety and depression by 20 percentage points."
